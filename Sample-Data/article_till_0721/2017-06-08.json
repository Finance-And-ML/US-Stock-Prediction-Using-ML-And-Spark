If that prediction was borne out in the final results, the party would add six seats to its existing tally of eight, marking its best performance in a national election since 2010.The potential gain is larger than many pollsters predicted. The party had been struggling in opinion polls before the vote, rarely polling higher than 7% or 8%, a similar share to what it picked up in the previous election in 2015.Surveys had suggested that opponents of Brexit had resigned themselves to the result of last year\u2019s referendum, when Britons voted 52% to 48% to leave the EU. A May survey of more than 5,000 voters by polling firm             YouGov                   PLC found that about half of those who voted to remain in June 2016 believed the government had a duty to implement the public\u2019s decision.YouGov\u2019s research suggested the main beneficiaries of this trend appeared to be the ruling Conservatives, who were picking up many of this new group as well as hard-core Brexit voters who had previously been drawn to the anti-EU UK Independence Party.Thursday\u2019s exit poll suggests pro-EU voters may have reconsidered. The pro-Brexit Conservatives of Prime Minister       Theresa May       were projected to fall short of an overall majority in Britain\u2019s 650-seat Parliament, with around 314 seats. The main opposition Labour Party\u2014which also supports Brexit but advocates a softer approach to the divorce\u2014were projected to win 266. The findings of the exit poll were uncertain and the final tally may be different.Later, the British Broadcasting Corporation said it saw the Conservatives winning 318 seats, compared with 330 in the outgoing parliament. Sky News, meanwhile, said its analysis suggested between 308 and 328.In Lewes, a seat in southeast England, 54-year-old planning consultant Andrew Simpson said he planned to vote for the Liberal Democrats \u201cso we have a more effective opposition and a better negotiation on Brexit.\u201dThe constituency, centered on a town of 17,000 built around a medieval castle, went to the Conservatives in 2015 after 18 years of Liberal Democrat rule but voted against Brexit. The pro-EU Liberals were hoping to win it back, aided by voters such as Mr. Simpson who are frustrated by the two main parties\u2019 tough stance on Brexit. However, early Friday the Conservatives appeared to have held on, with MP Maria Caulfield re-elected.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very different Parliament and it\u2019s going to be a tense few days while we find out the results of this election and seeing who is going to be forming the next government,\u201d Ms. Caulfield said in an interview.The Conservatives say they will pull the U.K. out of the bloc\u2019s single market\u2014which sets rules for trade in goods and services\u2014and replace EU membership with a new free-trade accord. They also want to exit from the bloc\u2019s customs union, which places common tariffs on goods coming from outside its borders, and end the jurisdiction of European courts over British affairs.Labour said that it would seek to \u201cretain the benefits\u201d of the EU\u2019s single market but has been hazier on how it would achieve that objective. It said it will end unfettered immigration from the EU while protecting the rights of EU citizens already in Britain.The Liberal Democrats, by contrast, say they \u201cpassionately believe\u201d the U.K. would be better off staying in the EU and would offer voters a second referendum on whether to stay in the 28-member club.Robert Hill, 73, a retired shoe retailer, said he voted to remain in the referendum last year but is now backing Mrs. May. \u201cAs I see it, in a democratic society, we voted to leave so we\u2019ve just got to get behind it and negotiate our way to a satisfactory ending,\u201d he said.Meantime, Robert Pick, a longtime Conservative voter, is supporting the Liberal Democrats this time because he is unhappy about leaving the EU. \u201cThis is a protest vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI find the whole Brexit thing incredibly depressing.\u201dWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Some Pro-EU Voters Make Their Voices Heard.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 23:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-opponents-likely-to-be-a-no-show-in-u-k-election-1496938723", "news_title": "Pro-EU Voters Make Their Voices Heard, Poll Suggests", "keywords": "britain election,u.k. election,u.k. politics,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,surveys,polls"}, {"content": "Two chief executives of major messaging apps in India and South Korea predicted a decline in the importance of texting via keyboards and a rise in the use of cameras and voice activation to communicate.Speaking at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s D.Live Asia conference,         Kakao Corp.

For instance, Kakao\u2019s messenger app, which is ubiquitous in South Korea, has moved into mobile payments, taxi hailing and food delivery. The firm also has partnerships with South Korea\u2019s largest food retailer and fast-food chains.\u201cThe important thing is the actual service partners,\u201d Mr. Rim said.Hike, whose investors include Chinese internet giant             Tencent Holdings Ltd.       and Japan\u2019s             SoftBank Group Corp.      , is focused on the India market but could explore expansion into other countries like Sri Lanka or Bangladesh over the next 12 to 18 months, Mr. Mittal said.

The humiliation was on the other side of the contest, as Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       ruling Conservatives lost their majority, leaving no party clearly in command.With most races decided, Labour won what some projections put at 267 seats in the 650-seat Parliament, a big increase\u2014compared with 318 seats for Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives.\u201cIf there is a message from tonight\u2019s results, it\u2019s this: The prime minister called this election because she wanted a mandate,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cWell the mandate she\u2019s got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence.\u201dSupporters saw his better-than-expected performance as a powerful vindication of his leftist platform. Tony Travers, politics professor at the London School of Economics, said the results will spur Mr. Corbyn\u2019s supporters to say his model, as opposed to the more centrist ideology of former Prime Minister       Tony Blair,        will win in the next election.\u201cHe will have won it while losing,\u201d Mr. Travers said. \u201cThe expectations for her were too high at the beginning of the election, and for him the expectations were so low that he could never have done much worse than those expectations.\u201dMore moderate Labour voters and members of Parliament, however, were likely to view the party\u2019s third straight failure to win an election as proof that it needs a fresh strategy.Mrs. May\u2019s decision to call snap elections seven weeks ago reflected her confidence that she could expand her party\u2019s majority in Parliament and strengthen her government\u2019s mandate in what are expected to be arduous and contentious talks over Brexit, which begin later this month.Instead, her showing, if confirmed, marks a significant blow to Mrs. May and raises questions about her grip on the party and her ability to stay on as leader.Having run an surprisingly effective campaign, Mr. Corbyn faces no such predicament.From a low of 15% in March, the percentage of people who thought Mr. Corbyn was doing well rose to 34% this week, according to a poll by             YouGov                   PLC. Meanwhile, Mrs. May, 60, saw her rating slide from 53% to 46% during the period.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s smooth campaign, compared with a wobbly one by Mrs. May, burnished his image. His antiwar, antiausterity message, which has remained mostly unchanged during his 34 years in Parliament, tapped the frustration of voters with centrist politics. His campaign slogan\u2014\u201cFor the Many, Not the Few\u201d\u2014resonated with voters, some of whom are feeling the pinch after years of Conservative cuts to public services.As results poured in, Mr. Corbyn said in a tweet: \u201cWhatever the final result, our positive campaign has changed politics for the better.\u201dLabour\u2019s platform also was sunnier than the Conservative\u2019s, boasting promises to increase funding for Britain\u2019s National Health Service and to make college tuition free again.Mr. Corbyn appeared to draw support during the campaign from his outspoken criticism of President       Donald Trump.       While voters criticized Mrs. May for not opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement more strongly, the Labour leader said he would take a tougher approach than the prime minister.The Labour Party\u2019s social-media campaign also was more aggressive. Momentum, a pro-Labour initiative, helped the party reach younger voters with an app that allows activists to phone other Momentum members and encourage them to canvass voters. It also used graphics, memes and video clips to counter negative messaging by the Conservatives and right-wing newspapers.A video of Mrs. May refusing to debate Mr. Corbyn attracted 4.3 million views in three days, Momentum said. A website that provided directions to campaign events in swing districts and offered carpooling options was also effective, a spokesman for the group said.As voters cast their ballots in Islington in north London, some said Mr. Corbyn\u2019s well-run campaign had improved their opinions of him. \u201cHe [used to] look a bit disheveled and didn\u2019t come across like a credible leader but he definitely upped his game,\u201d said Catherine Shipley, a 38-year-old mother of two.Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King\u2019s College London, said Mr. Corbyn had drawn higher-than-anticipated support at the polls because of his ability to connect with voters at campaign appearances and on television.\u201cHe\u2019s been lucky that he\u2019s against an opponent who is worse than he is at the things he\u2019s bad at,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s overall been better than expected, but given how bad Theresa May is and has been, that\u2019s quite a low bar.\u201d\u2014Denise Roland  contributed to this article.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Corbyn Appears to Defy Expectations.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 22:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-u-k-election-jeremy-corbyn-looks-set-to-defy-expectations-1496962806", "news_title": "In U.K. Election, Jeremy Corbyn Defies  Expectations", "keywords": "u.k. elections,Jeremy Corbyn,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Massive growth in online spending will help fuel world-wide growth in the technology sector in the next decade,       Yuri Milner,        founder of DST Global, said at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s D.Live Asia 2017 conference.Mr. Milner, the head of the prominent technology investment firm, said despite growth in online commerce, only 6% of consumer spending takes place online.

That has been an increasingly appealing bet as 2017 has progressed, reflecting seemingly relentless declines in the shares, results and outlooks of companies such as             Macy\u2019s Inc.,Kohl\u2019s Corp.      , Sears Holdings Corp. and numerous others.Nordstrom\u2019s stock price had fallen 16% this year through Wednesday and bearish traders had accrued $186 million in profits by wagering against the stock. Fully 17% of Nordstrom\u2019s 166 million shares outstanding were on loan to short sellers as of the middle of May, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Some investors say that Thursday\u2019s pop in Nordstrom and one last month in Sears Holdings, the parent of the Sears and Kmart chains whose decline has been avidly followed on Wall Street in recent years,\u00a0bear the hallmarks of a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d That is a cascade of buying that results as bears seek to limit losses by repurchasing shares they borrowed and sold.Heavily shorted Sears jumped 11% and then 20% on consecutive trading sessions in March after two key shareholders disclosed fresh stakes. Sears shares climbed another 14% in one trading session last month after the company\u2019s quarterly loss was smaller than analysts expected, even though sales at stores open at least a year plunged 12%.\u201cGood old-fashioned short squeezes are alive and well in retail names today,\u201d said       Brad Lamensdorf,        portfolio manager of the Active Alts Contrarian exchange-traded fund, which aims to seek out and profit from short-squeeze candidates. \u201cThese guys are leaning so hard in one direction that if the price swings the other way it can be painful,\u201d Mr. Lamensdorf said.In Nordstrom, Thursday\u2019s stock pop had erased all of bears\u2019 year-to-date profit at one point in early trading, according to S3.After Sears\u2019s string of volatile price moves, short sellers have lost more than $31 million in 2017, even though the stock has fallen 26%.Shorting such a volatile stock is expensive: The annualized interest rate that prospective shorts must pay to borrow shares of Sears is 80%, by far the highest among department-store operators.Elsewhere in the sector, shorts continue to thrive. The shares of Kohl\u2019s, Macy\u2019s,             J.C. Penney Co.       and             Dillard\u2019s Inc.       have slumped between 28% and 45% this year, yielding tens of millions of dollars in profits for bears this year, according to S3.Shares of department-store operators were again sent reeling earlier this week after Macy\u2019s chief financial officer warned that profit margins could face additional pressure in part because it is taking longer than expected to clear excess inventory.Tension between bears wagering on the demise of retailers and investors hoping to pick up shares at a bargain could persist in the months ahead, leading to more volatile price moves for retail stocks.\u201cObviously, people are buying more things online, but it\u2019s premature to say that, for brick-and-mortar retailers, it\u2019s the death knell for them,\u201d said       Karyn Cavanaugh,        senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management. \u201cAs things get beaten up, the pendulum tends to swing too far.\u201d\u2014Akane Otani contributed to this article.Write to Chris Dieterich at chris.dieterich@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Surge in Retailer Exposes Short Sellers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 20:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nordstrom-stocks-pop-shows-retail-shorts-are-no-sure-thing-1496959538", "news_title": "Retailer\u2019s Surge Exposes Short Sellers   ", "keywords": "nordstrom shorts,nordstrom short selling,short sellers,short selling,short squeeze,stock bears,stock bulls,Nordstrom,JWN,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing"}, {"content": "Former FBI Director       James Comey       said his decision to speak publicly about the       Hillary Clinton       email probe last summer was directly motivated by a meeting on an airport tarmac between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President       Bill Clinton.In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday, Mr. Comey also said he was concerned by a request made by Ms. Lynch that he refer to the Clinton probe as a \u201cmatter\u201d not an \u201cinvestigation.\u201dMr. Comey said the meeting between Ms. Lynch and Mr. Clinton\u2014whose wife was under investigation at the time\u2014created a significant appearance problem for Ms. Lynch and her role in the case.Asked by Sen.       John Cornyn       (R., Texas) whether Ms. Lynch had the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest\u201d in the email probe following her June 2016 meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Comey said, \u201cI think that\u2019s fair.\u201d That meeting, Mr. Comey said, is what convinced him that he had to \u201cdo something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation.\u201dMs. Lynch said at the time that she and Mr. Clinton didn\u2019t discuss \u201cany matter pending before the department\u201d and talked about their grandchildren and golf. Under pressure, she later said in July 2016 that she would accept whatever recommendations career prosecutors and the FBI director made about whether to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton.Ms. Lynch didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment on Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony.Mr. Comey ultimately decided to hold a news conference on his own to announce that the probe had been concluded.\u00a0In that July 2016 news conference, he criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information when she was secretary of state but said the FBI had recommended against pursuing charges against her.At the time, then-GOP presidential candidate       Donald Trump       rejected the finding in the case involving his Democratic rival, accusing the system of being \u201crigged\u201d and tweeting: \u201cVery very unfair!\u201dThe announcement of no charges would ordinarily be left to the Justice Department leadership, and making the statement was \u201cdisastrous for me personally,\u201d Mr. Comey said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in early May, shortly before Mr. Trump fired him. He said in that hearing that the department\u2019s leadership had lost credibility, in part due to the tarmac meeting between Ms. Lynch and Mr. Clinton.On Thursday, Mr. Comey said he was also concerned by a request to refer the Clinton probe as a \u201cmatter\u201d not an \u201cinvestigation.\u201dThe request from Ms. Lynch came as Mr. Comey was asking whether she would authorize the FBI to confirm that there was a continuing investigation, which Ms. Lynch said she would. He called that move \u201cone of the bricks in the load\u201d that convinced him he had to \u201cstep away from the\u00a0[Justice]\u00a0Department if we\u2019re to close this case credibly.\u201d\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d he recalled asking Ms. Lynch when she made the request. \u201cJust call it a matter\u201d was her response, he recounted.Mr. Comey said he thought to himself that it wasn\u2019t a \u201chill worth dying on\u201d and that the news media would ignore his choice of wording anyway. He said that proved to be correct.In his news conference in July, Mr. Comey said, \u201cWe are glad that this matter is now resolved.\u201dA person familiar with Ms. Lynch\u2019s thinking said the then-attorney general told Mr. Comey that she had previously used the term \u201cmatter\u201d in response to reporter inquires to avoid confirming or denying the existence of an investigation, per department policy. She then suggested they continue to use the term for consistency\u2019s sake, and asked if Mr. Comey and other Justice Department officials were \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the term. No one contested it, the person said.Mr. Cornyn on Thursday pressed the former FBI director about why he didn\u2019t call for a special counsel if he felt the Justice Department was compromised in its investigation.Mr. Comey said he considered whether a special counsel was needed, but thought it would be \u201cbrutally unfair\u201d when by that point he said he \u201cknew there was no case there.\u201d Such an appointment, he said, \u201cwould send the message, \u2018Aha, there\u2019s something there.\u2019 \u201dA special counsel might have reached the same conclusion, Mr. Cornyn noted.Mr. Comey agreed, but said, \u201cIt would have been many months later, a year later.\u201dHis news conference announcing the conclusion of the probe came four months before the election. The probe was briefly reopened following the discovery of new emails on a laptop in the possession of Anthony Weiner, the husband of a top Clinton aide, but closed again just days before the election.\u2014Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at rebecca.ballhaus@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Clinton Meeting Sparked Decision.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 20:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/comey-says-special-counsel-would-have-slowed-clinton-email-probe-1496957980", "news_title": "Clinton-Lynch Meeting Sparked Comey Decision", "keywords": " clinton email probe, comey, comey testimony, donald trump, fbi, hillary clinton,james comey, loretta lynch, no charges,FBI,James Comey,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department"}, {"content": "Matthew Zames,        the chief operating officer at             J.P. Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. once thought to be a possible successor to Chief Executive       James Dimon,        is leaving the firm, the bank said Thursday.The departure of Mr. Zames, 46 years old, will kick off a new round of speculation within the bank about possible heirs to Mr. Dimon. But it will also reinforce views that the longstanding chief of the biggest U.S. bank by assets isn\u2019t going anywhere soon.Mr. Dimon, widely viewed as the most powerful executive on Wall Street and a statesman for the banking industry, has told people within the bank that he plans to stay in his role for another five years, executives said, though the number hasn\u2019t changed as the years pass.Mr. Dimon sent a memo to employees Thursday detailing Mr. Zames\u2019s decision to leave, saying, \u201cWhile I am sad to see him leave, I respect his decision and all he has done for J.P. Morgan Chase,\u201d according to a copy of the memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\u201cJamie has been public on numerous occasions he would like to be here another five years or so,\u201d Mr. Zames said in an interview Thursday. \u201cI want to get back to\u2026running a business.\u201dMr. Zames didn\u2019t want to stay since it was unlikely he would be named CEO of J.P. Morgan in the near future, or at all, people familiar with the situation said. What\u2019s more, people within the bank viewed Mr. Zames\u2019s chances to gain the top spot to have fallen within the past year or two, according to employees and executives.A bank spokesman said that while Mr. Zames wants to run a business now, the J.P. Morgan CEO job \u201cis unlikely to open up in the next several years.\u201dThe decision for Mr. Zames to leave in the coming weeks was amicable and was Mr. Zames\u2019s decision, the spokesman for the bank said.While he aspires to be a CEO at another company, it won\u2019t necessarily be in finance, Mr. Zames said. He added that he is leaving the bank without another job lined up because he wants to \u201ctake time and make the right decision for me.\u201dIn departing, Mr. Zames becomes the latest in a string of potential successors to Mr. Dimon who have either chosen to leave rather than wait, or been pushed out. Such executives have included       Jes Staley,        who is now CEO of Barclays PLC;       Bill Winters,        currently CEO of Standard Chartered PLC, and       Charles Scharf,        who until recently was CEO of             Visa Inc.,       among others.With Mr. Zames now out of the running, current executives viewed as potential CEO-successor candidates include:       Gordon Smith,        head of the consumer-banking business;       Daniel Pinto,        head of the firm\u2019s corporate and investment-banking business;       Mary Callahan Erdoes,        head of its asset-management business, and       Marianne Lake,        the bank\u2019s chief financial officer.Mr. Zames was elevated to his current role of chief operating officer in the wake of the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading scandal that cost the bank around $6 billion. The former head of the bank\u2019s fixed-income business, he was widely credited with helping to sort out the fiasco within the bank\u2019s chief investment office.He is known throughout the bank as someone with a trader\u2019s personality, who is blunt and passionate about his work. He was said to have led the bank\u2019s cost-cutting efforts a few years ago with an iron fist, which frustrated some executives and employees.There are also \u201cZames guys,\u201d or employees who have worked alongside him and respect his work, especially in the corporate and investment bank. Some employees who had worked with Mr. Zames said they were surprised and disappointed in his decision to leave the bank.In his current role, Mr. Zames oversaw a number of groups across the bank, including cybersecurity, technology, real estate and other functions. Earlier, he held roles across the investment-banking and trading businesses.His role became more important in recent years as J.P. Morgan and other banks were tested by cyberthreats and upstart fintech companies. J.P. Morgan responded by boosting its tech budget to $9.5 billion annually, according to a letter Mr. Zames wrote for the company\u2019s annual report in April that also highlighted the bank\u2019s hiring of outside programmers and its push into robotics and machine learning. \u201cI have never been more excited about the opportunities ahead,\u201d Mr. Zames wrote at the time.Executives on the bank\u2019s operating committee will take on Mr. Zames\u2019s responsibilities, a spokesman said.Mr. Zames was one of the bank\u2019s most highly paid executives. According to J.P. Morgan\u2019s most recent proxy statement, Mr. Zames was awarded total pay of $19 million for his work in 2016, up from $18.5 million the prior year and $17 million for 2014.According to a regulatory filing by the bank Thursday, Mr. Zames will be entitled to a future severance payment of $900,000, plus discretionary payments of $4.625 million in February 2018 and $4.5 million in February 2019.Mr. Zames\u2019s 2016 pay was the same as that of Ms. Erdoes and Mr. Pinto.

Shahzada Farhat, a police spokesman, said he was \u201cnot aware of any such development,\u201d when asked about the Islamic State claim.China early Friday expressed grave concern over the killings of the two Chinese nationals. The official Xinhua News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman as saying that China had tried to rescue the two and was working with Pakistani authorities to find out more.\u201cThe Chinese side is firmly opposed to the acts of kidnapping civilians in any form, as well as terrorism and extreme violence in any form,\u201d she said, according to Xinhua.Thousands of Chinese have moved to Pakistan over the last two years to support investment under Beijing\u2019s flagship \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure building program across Asia and Europe. Beijing is helping build power plants, roads and other major infrastructure worth over $50 billion. The Pakistani military has created a special security force with 15,000 personnel to protect Chinese citizens and projects. The Pakistani government has vowed to thwart attacks on these projects and considers their security paramount.Attacks on Chinese nationals are rare in Pakistan, with criminal gangs and militant groups usually targeting citizens of Western countries in recent years. Last year, a Chinese engineer escaped with minor injuries after a bomb exploded next to his car in the southern city of Karachi, an attack claimed by an obscure separatist group. In 2014, a Chinese tourist was kidnapped from northwestern Pakistan and released a year later.The Baluchistan province is considered dangerous, especially for foreigners, because of activity by Islamist militant groups, criminal organizations, and ethnic Baluch separatists who have been fighting a low-intensity insurgency for many years.Security in Pakistan overall has improved in recent years, with a dramatic reduction in the number of terrorist attacks since the government launched a large-scale operation against militants three years ago. Despite the drop in frequency, however, militant groups, have been able to carry out some high-profile deadly attacks.Pakistani officials say Islamic State doesn\u2019t have an organized presence in the country. However, the group has claimed several high-profile attacks in recent months, including a deadly bombing last month in the Mastung area of Baluchistan that killed 25.Islamic State indicated in its claim Thursday that the killing of the two Chinese nationals also took place in Mastung. Last week, the Pakistani military said it destroyed a well-stocked hideout in the same area of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al Alami, a Sunni Islamist militant group that operates mainly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The rabidly sectarian Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has collaborated with al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban in recent years and, like Islamic State, targets Shiite Muslims regularly.Pakistan\u2019s military said Thursday that it took three days to clear the hideout, a \u201clong gorge with steep heights and multiple caves\u201d in which militants had stored explosives, assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, sniper rifles and communications equipment. The military said 12 militants were killed in the operation.Pakistani officials have vowed to continue such operations to deny Islamic State any chance to set up a base on Pakistani soil.

ENDP 0.17%       remove its Opana ER from the market over concerns about the painkiller\u2019s links to injection drug abuse, in what the agency called its first effort to remove an opioid pain drug over abuse concerns.The FDA said it concluded \u201cthe benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks\u201d given the drug\u2019s association with injection drug abuse. Abuse of the drug via injection was linked to \u201ca serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C,\u201d the FDA added. The outbreak occurred in Indiana in 2015, where addicts shared needles while injecting the drug.\u201cWe are facing an opioid epidemic\u2014a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,\u201d FDA Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb       said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product\u2019s risks outweigh its benefits, not only for its intended patient population but also in regard to its potential for misuse and abuse.\u201dThe decision comes amid growing public concern and political pressure over widespread addiction to opioid drugs, which include prescription painkillers as well as illicit narcotics such as heroin and black market fentanyl. Opioid abuse has helped push U.S. overdose death rates to all-time highs. Many public-health officials say the addiction crisis began with widespread prescribing and use of prescription painkillers.Endo\u2019s parent company Endo International PLC said it is reviewing the FDA request and \u201cevaluating the full range of potential options as we determine the appropriate path forward.\u201dIt added it \u201cremains confident in the body of evidence established through clinical research demonstrating that Opana ER has a favorable risk-benefit profile when used as intended in appropriate patients.\u201dThe FDA said it has requested the company voluntarily stop selling the drug. It added: \u201cShould the company choose not to remove the product, the agency intends to take steps to formally require its removal by withdrawing approval. In the interim, the FDA is making health care professionals and others aware of the particularly serious risks associated with the abuse of this product.\u201dEndo International\u2019s shares fell 12.2% in after hour trading.Opana ER sales have fallen in recent years amid generic competition. The drug had 2016 sales of $159 million. Endo International, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, had 2016 sales of $4.01 billion.Andrew Kolodny, a longtime critic of opioid painkillers and co-director of Brandeis University\u2019s Opioid Policy Research Collaborative, said he hoped the FDA\u2019s move was a sign the agency was adopting a tougher approach toward opioids. He said the agency did too little over the years to clamp down on prescribing even as overdose death rates soared and \u201cit was clear prescribing had taken off at a rate much greater than could be clinically needed.\u201d He also faulted the agency for approving more opioid painkillers for sale even as addiction and overdose rates were climbing.The FDA declined to comment on Dr. Kolodny\u2019s remarks. The agency started approving many of the best-known opioid painkillers for sale in the late 1990s. In 2013, the FDA toughened some of the drugs\u2019 prescribing labels, more clearly emphasizing the addictive risks and removing language saying the drugs, including extended-release forms of Opana and OxyContin, could be used for \u201cmoderate\u201d pain. The new labels recommended extended-release drugs\u2019 use for \u201cpain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.\u201dIn March, a group of advisers to the FDA concluded Opana ER\u2019s benefits no longer outweighed its risks, with many saying the drug\u2019s formulation appeared to encourage particularly risky forms of injection drug abuse that can help spread blood-borne viruses.To heighten the high from painkillers, some addicts crush and snort the drugs while others liquefy and inject them.The FDA first approved Opana ER for U.S. sale in 2006. The Opana ER sold today is a reformulated version that Endo began marketing in 2012. At the time, Endo said the new version would be harder to abuse because it was designed to be more difficult to crush, and formed a \u201cviscous gel\u201d when mixed with liquids to make the drug more difficult to inject, according to documents the FDA prepared for the March hearing.Yet in its statement Thursday, the FDA said data demonstrated a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in abuse patterns of the drug after it was reformulated, \u201cfrom nasal to injection.\u201dDuring the advisers\u2019 meeting in March, some of the medical experts said addicts were able to turn Opana ER into an injectable solution by mixing it with a relatively large volume of solvent.

He met with top aides and local leaders to discuss his plan to improve the nation\u2019s bridges and roads.And he left to his lawyer the job of rebutting former FBI Director       James Comey\u2019s       testimony that Mr. Trump tried to derail an investigation into former national security adviser       Mike Flynn.In her press briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \u201cWe\u2019re carrying on as we normally would.\u201dThe orderly day at the White House came as Mr. Comey spent three hours before the Senate Intelligence Committee, testifying that he believed Mr. Trump directed him to drop the probe into Mr. Flynn\u2019s interactions with Russian officials during the presidential transition.Mr. Comey also made it known that he decided to keep contemporaneous notes about nearly every interaction with the president because he worried Mr. Trump would give false accounts of them.The former FBI director opened with a sharp rebuttal to the president\u2019s initial explanation for his termination. \u201cAlthough the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cThose were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them and I\u2019m so sorry that the American people were told them.\u201dPrivately, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said they were thrilled the president didn\u2019t take to             Twitter                   to offer a response. It\u2019s a rare day that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t tweet\u2014but he is under pressure from staff and his lawyers not to say anything about the Russia investigation to avoid a legal backlash.His outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz, speaking at the National Press Club, denied Mr. Comey\u2019s account of the conversations and urged federal investigators to go after the former FBI director, who said on Thursday that he leaked his own memos about conversations with the president for one news story.\u201cThe president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including suggesting that Mr. Comey \u2018let Flynn go,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kasowitz said.Despite the White House choreography, West Wing aides could be seen stealing glances at the flat-screen TVs airing above their desks and in some cases watching the entire event.With Mr. Comey testifying that he worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s veracity, a reporter at the briefing asked Ms. Sanders if the president was a \u201cliar.\u201d\u201cNo, I can definitively say the president is not a liar,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.An issue in the Comey-Trump meetings is whether the president recorded the conversations. Mr. Trump, in a tweet last month, suggested he might have secretly recorded the meetings.Does the White House have such a taping system? Ms. Sanders was asked. She said she didn\u2019t know and then quipped she would \u201clook under the couches\u201d to check.Mr. Trump, meanwhile, stayed busy, meeting with national security advisers and later giving a speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition. He avoided any temptation to strike back at Mr. Comey.The president spoke about expanding religious rights and restricting abortion funding. He appeared to stay almost entirely on message and offered no direct references to the hearing, instead offering his appreciation for a group that has been loyal to him in office, and whose rights he says are under attack.Not far away at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Vice President       Mike Pence       took part in a working luncheon with state and local officials about the president\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure plan. The White House had hoped to use the week to build support for Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to rebuild roads and bridges, calling it \u201cinfrastructure week.\u201dAfter the Senate committee closed the public portion of its hearing on Thursday, reporters were brought into an infrastructure meeting between Mr. Pence and the officials. \u201cFolks, it\u2019s already been a banner week for infrastructure,\u201d he told the group.Mr. Trump met with many of the same officials later in White House\u2019s State Dining Room. He promised to \u201cmove quickly\u201d to improve roads and bridges, and ignored shouted questions from reporters about Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony. \u201cThank you all,\u201d Mr. Trump responded. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Michael C.

But there will inevitably be another mania and panic, and regulators always miss them. The definition of a financial mania is that everyone thinks the good times will last forever.Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling\u2019s Financial Choice Act addresses this tragic flaw by offering banks an option: Stay subject to Dodd-Frank\u2019s costly regulations, or hold capital equal to 10% of assets in return for more lending freedom and less red tape.Banks lend with taxpayer-insured deposits, and high levels of capital are a guardrail for taxpayers and shareholders. If the guardrails are high enough, banks can afford to take more risks without bank examiners second-guessing every loan. We\u2019d prefer even higher capital levels, but       Mr. Hensarling       is raising the bar while moving banks away from their Dodd-Frank status as de facto public utilities.Democrats call this a favor to Wall Street, but note that the biggest banks oppose the Hensarling bill. They\u2019ve prospered under Dodd-Frank because they can more easily absorb compliance costs than can smaller competitors. By one estimate the average capital ratio of the seven largest banks is around 7%, while most regional or community banks hold 10% or more in capital.The big banks have also grown bigger, with the five largest now holding more than 40% of U.S. banking assets. Some industry consolidation was inevitable after the crisis, but community banks have been selling out or closing at a rapid rate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond reports that from 2010 through 2013 only four new banks were started in the U.S. Before the panic the average was 100 a year. All of this has cut lending for new small businesses essential for faster economic growth.Meantime, taxpayers are on the hook as much as they were in 2008. The Richmond Fed reports that about $27 trillion in the private economy carries an explicit or implicit federal guarantee, or more than 60% of the financial system\u2019s liabilities.The Choice Act would limit potential bailouts by ending Dodd-Frank\u2019s \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d that allows the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to wind down a failing institution. The bill establishes a new chapter of the bankruptcy code to liquidate a firm quickly without arbitrary political interference.Another move toward ending \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is revoking the Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s authority to deem \u201csystemically important financial institutions.\u201d The Obama FSOC abused this power by dumping the designation on             MetLife                  \u2014an insurer, not a bank. It did so without bothering to calculate \u201cwhat the losses would be, which financial institutions would have to actively manage their balance sheets, or how the market would destabilize as a result,\u201d as a federal judge put it in a ruling against the FSOC last year.More good news is that the bill would restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has prosecuted extralegal campaigns against payday lenders, auto loans and others. The bureau would become an independent agency more like the Securities and Exchange Commission with a director who could be fired at will by the President. Under Dodd-Frank, director       Richard Cordray       can only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\u201d though his tenure has included at least two of three. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled that this structure violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.The Choice Act would force the CFPB to rely on Congress for appropriations, instead of automatic financing from the Federal Reserve. We\u2019d rather make the CFPB part of the Treasury Department to improve accountability, assuming it can\u2019t be eliminated. But the Hensarling bill is an improvement and may be politically acceptable.The sages in Washington say all of this is dead on arrival in the Senate, but don\u2019t be so sure. Parts of the legislation could be tucked into budget reconciliation, including changes to the CFPB and the orderly liquidation authority. Mr. Hensarling is ready to negotiate, and Senate Banking Chairman       Mike Crapo       (R., Idaho) needs to show he\u2019s more than a front man for the big banks.Dodd-Frank was written so loosely that the       Trump       Administration has broad regulatory power to ease the rules without Congress. But the law\u2019s regulatory architecture is so deeply flawed that it needs a more durable reform. The GOP should grab whatever reform victories it can for the good of the economy and the rule of law.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'A Choice for Wall Street.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 19:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-choice-for-wall-street-1496964390", "news_title": "A Choice for Wall Street ", "keywords": "regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,editorials"}, {"content": "James Comey\u2019s       first post-FBI appearance in front of the Senate on Thursday turned out to be a political anticlimax, with no major revelations about the alleged Trump-Russia nexus or the President\u2019s supposed attempt to derail the investigation. But nearly three hours of testimony did expose the methods of the highly political former FBI director.To wit, Mr. Comey is trying to have it both ways. He worked to leave the impression that       Mr. Trump       had committed a crime or at least an abuse of power, even as he abdicated his own obligations as a senior law-enforcement officer to report and deter such misconduct.Mr. Comey confirmed that Mr. Trump never tried to block the FBI\u2019s larger probe of potential Russian entanglement in the election and even encouraged the FBI, noting that \u201cif some of my satellites did something wrong, it\u2019d be good to find that out.\u201d Despite this probative evidence, Mr. Comey claims that in an Oval Office meeting in February Mr. Trump importuned him to close the case on       Michael Flynn,        the National Security Adviser who had recently been fired for misleading the Vice President.Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Comey, defended Mr. Flynn, saying \u201che is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u201d Mr. Comey explained that \u201cI took it as a direction to get rid of this investigation.\u201dBut he wouldn\u2019t answer when Senators asked if such a direction was illegal. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the President was an effort to obstruct,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cI took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that\u2019s a conclusion I\u2019m sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that\u2019s an offense.\u201dMr. Comey also admitted that after he was fired he leaked his personal memos about his Trump conversations, via a cutout at Columbia Law School, \u201cbecause I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d So Mr. Comey triggers Robert Mueller\u2019s new assignment and then tosses him responsibility while still intimating that Mr. Trump violated the law.This legerdemain is an awfully convenient self-defense. The important question is whether Mr. Comey believed Mr. Trump was obstructing justice at the time, and Mr. Comey\u2019s behavior then doesn\u2019t confirm his Senate tale.Mr. Trump had expressed the same sentiments about Mr. Flynn\u2019s bona fides in public and on             Twitter,       so his preferences were no secret. But if Mr. Comey really believed Mr. Trump was trying to block the Flynn probe, then he had a legal duty to report Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct to his Justice Department superiors or the White House counsel. Obstruction of justice\u2014intentionally attempting to impede an investigation\u2014is a crime.Mr. Comey said that he was \u201cso stunned\u201d that he lacked \u201cthe presence of mind\u201d even to tell Mr. Trump that his request was improper. But he was able to gain enough composure to write up the experience in the car after the meeting, and to discuss the meeting, by his own testimony, with his chief of staff, the FBI deputy director, the associate deputy director, the general counsel, the deputy director\u2019s chief counsel and the head of the FBI office of national security. But he never informed Attorney General       Jeff Sessions,        the Deputy AG or any other supervisor.This abdication is especially remarkable for someone as experienced in the corridors of power as Mr. Comey. This is a government veteran who served three Presidents in senior positions and in 2004 predrafted a letter of resignation as Acting Attorney General to threaten President       Bush       over wiretapping.Quitting and going public after his meeting with Mr. Trump would have let the country know what was happening in Washington, as many other civil servants have done over the years. Yet in an exchange with Senator       Tom Cotton,        Mr. Comey averred that \u201cI didn\u2019t find, encounter any circumstance that led me to intend to resign, consider to resign. No, sir.\u201d In other words, Mr. Comey thought he was serving a corrupt President but wanted to keep that news a close hold.Mr. Comey\u2019s admirers want everyone to take this at face value. But an alternative reading is that Mr. Comey didn\u2019t resign or tell Mr. Sessions because he liked his job and wanted to keep it. He also knew he could write that memo and share it with his FBI comrades as a form of political insurance. As the fictional President says to       Jack Ryan       (played by       Harrison Ford      ) in \u201cClear and Present Danger,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019ve got yourself a chip in the big game now.\u201d Only after he was fired did Mr. Comey choose to share his moral outrage with the public, while setting up the President who dismissed him as a target for Mr. Mueller.Mr. Trump acted like a bullying naif who doesn\u2019t understand the norms of presidential behavior, but Mr. Comey is no Jack Ryan. He\u2019s a government official motivated by political self-interest who should have resigned if he believed what he now says he did. That he failed to act at the time suggests his motive now is more revenge than truth-telling.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 19:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-comeys-passion-play-1496964267", "news_title": "James Comey\u2019s Passion Play", "keywords": "FBI,James Comey,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Being an outsider has its advantages in today\u2019s political climate, and last year President Donald Trump made the most of them.Thursday, though, the world saw the downsides of coming from so far outside the system.A basic set of rules for surviving and thriving in the nation\u2019s capital\u2014well understood by Washington veterans\u2014would include: Don\u2019t make an enemy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, keep potential enemies inside the tent and, above all, remember that it usually isn\u2019t the action but the appearance of a coverup that brings real trouble.A compelling morning of congressional testimony by fired FBI director       James Comey       illustrated that Mr. Trump, deliberately or unwittingly, violated each of those maxims. In the process, he appears to have made a problem that always was going to be difficult for him\u2014assertions that Russia intervened in the 2016 election, ultimately to benefit the Trump campaign\u2014considerably worse. The Russia question is a minefield, and Mr. Trump has stepped directly on many of the mines.The irony is that this all came into focus on a day in which the dramatic congressional hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee also produced revelations that actually are helpful to the president\u2019s cause. Most notably, those include the fact that Mr. Trump himself was never the subject of Mr. Comey\u2019s inquiries on the Russia connection.Instead, though, the focus was on Mr. Comey\u2019s description of a series of private conversations in which he said the president tried to coerce him into becoming a loyalist and sought to squelch a continuing criminal investigation of former national security adviser       Michael Flynn,        then seemed to fire Mr. Comey because he wouldn\u2019t cooperate, and subsequently lied about the origin and details of their conversations.Those are serious assertions and have the potential to create significant legal problems\u2014perhaps even a case for obstruction of justice\u2014for the president, in addition to the potential problems for those around him.In each of those cases, though, it was clear that the way Mr. Trump handled his relationship with the nation\u2019s top criminal investigator made the situation more dangerous. In Mr. Comey\u2019s telling, the president attempted to use meetings and phone calls to extract a pledge of \u201cloyalty\u201d and a \u201cpatronage relationship\u201d from the FBI chief, and to pressure him into declaring publicly that the president himself wasn\u2019t a target of FBI investigation.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters love the fact that he is the outsider willing to shatter the rules and norms that seem to govern life in Washington, so they likely aren\u2019t troubled\u2014in fact, they likely will cheer. Still, officials from both parties question the propriety of such overtures in private settings, and they carry the potential to backfire on the president, which they did Thursday. Indeed, once the president decided to fire Mr. Comey, it was nearly inevitable that they would blow up into a public problem. A more seasoned political leader likely would have sensed that danger and steered a different course.\u201cThe president\u2019s new at this; he\u2019s new to government, and he probably wasn\u2019t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships\u201d between the White House and the FBI and Justice Department, said House Speaker       Paul Ryan.       Mr. Ryan, who has been around the capital for a while, said that \u201cof course there needs to be a degree of independence\u201d from the White House for the FBI and Justice.Mr. Trump\u2019s critics will charge that those questionable actions weren\u2019t merely rookie mistakes but signs that the president was eager to bottle up an investigation before it got to darker deeds by his campaign, his team or even himself.Yet there were aspects of the Comey testimony that actually buttressed the president\u2019s case and opened the door for his attorney, Marc Kasowtiz, to criticize Mr. Comey. Mr. Comey repeatedly said that Mr. Trump himself wasn\u2019t, in his time in office, the subject of an FBI inquiry, either a criminal probe or a counterintelligence probe.Mr. Comey also acknowledged that he personally arranged the leaking of a memo of one of his conversations with the president to the press because he wanted to get his version on the public record before Mr. Trump could provide a contrary one\u2014and because he calculated, correctly, that public attention to his memo might help prompt the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russia connection.He also said that he felt seemingly improper pressure from the Obama administration. He testified that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch urged him to characterize the FBI\u2019s inquiry into Democratic presidential candidate       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       handling of classified material in her email system as a \u201cmatter\u201d instead of an \u201cinvestigation.\u201dThere was one other silver lining for Mr. Trump. In their questioning of Mr. Comey, Republican senators generally appeared cautious, neutral and occasionally defensive of the president.\u00a0There was no sign that any were seeking a clean break. Moving forward, whether it stays that way will be critical for the White House.Write to Gerald F.

But the former FBI chief made clear that he doesn\u2019t like the man who fired him. Mr. Comey also may have made history with perhaps the most brazen defense of leaking ever offered by a federal official.Based on Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony, he doesn\u2019t think the President did anything illegal. In the absence of evidence of wrongdoing, Mr. Comey treated the gathered lawmakers to a lengthy description of the atmospherics of his conversations with Mr. Trump. The Senate panel heard about Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbody language\u201d and about awkward silences. There were trust issues. Lawmakers also learned of Mr. Comey\u2019s deep desire not to be alone with the President. There appears to be some useful material here for a movie on the Lifetime cable channel but it\u2019s not clear this investigation has anywhere to go.Mr. Comey also has an interesting view of the notes he made while doing official business in the employ of taxpayers. The Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus describes questioning this morning by Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.):Countless government employees who\u2019ve been told repeatedly that their work product does not belong to them will likely have a different view. And what did Mr. Comey do with at least part of this recollection? The former FBI Director apparently believed it was so important to share with the public an accurate report of a meeting with President Trump that he routed it anonymously via a university professor and then through the filter of a news organization. Again, here\u2019s the Journal\u2019s hearing coverage:Give him credit for honesty. Mr. Comey says he opted for an anonymous leak because that was in the best interests of Mr. Comey.Just because Mr. Comey doesn\u2019t think Mr. Trump broke any laws doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Trump\u2019s communications with his FBI director were appropriate. According to Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump expressed his opinion that former National Security Adviser       Michael Flynn       was a \u201cgood guy.\u201d As Sen.       Marco Rubio       pointed out on Thursday, this was similar to the message Mr. Trump shared publicly. Mr. Comey also said Mr. Trump shared his hope that Mr. Comey could see his \u201cway clear to letting Flynn go.\u201d The President\u2019s lawyer denies this.Also according to Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump asked him several times to tell the public the truth\u2014that Mr. Trump was not the subject of an FBI investigation. And the former FBI chief claims that Mr. Trump told him he was hopeful that the conclusion of the investigation into potential collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia could remove \u201cthe cloud\u201d of the allegation but also that it would be good to find out if anyone affiliated with his campaign really had colluded with Russia.Ideally presidents would not opine at all on such topics. But perhaps a little historical context is useful here. When it comes to exerting influence on an FBI director, Mr. Trump isn\u2019t in the same universe with Jack and Robert Kennedy. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning history, \u201cParting the Waters,\u201d Taylor Branch describes how Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, at the direction of President Kennedy, enlisted FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in a campaign to persuade Congress not to pursue an investigation of Ellen Rometsch, a JFK mistress and suspected East German spy. Apparently Hoover made quite an impression in a private meeting with two senators, discussing \u201cother party girls, senators from both sides of the aisle, foreign women\u201d and related topics. The Rometsch investigation quickly died.Let\u2019s hope the Justice Department, including the FBI, is never again corrupted in this way.

Assuming a typical takeover premium and including the company\u2019s debt, such a deal could approach $10 billion.The wealthy family, whose members still run the Seattle-based business, is seeking to take over a company whose shares have taken a beating even though it has fared better than many of its peers. Online sales account for about 20% of Nordstrom\u2019s revenue and growth at the discount Nordstrom Rack chain has cushioned declines at the company\u2019s full-price stores.The Nordstrom family would be making a long-term bet on the future of retailing, said       Allen Questrom,        former CEO of Neiman Marcus Group Inc.,             Macy\u2019s Inc.       and             J.C. Penney Co.       \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t make your numbers in the short term, but you want your brand to be around in 50 years,\u201d he said.Shares in the company, which had slid 16% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, rose 10% to $44.63 on Thursday. As recently as 2015, the stock traded above $80 a share.Investors have shown little faith in the health of department stores, as fewer shoppers visit malls and online rivals squeeze traditional retailers\u2019 profits. Some chains such as Macy\u2019s, J.C. Penney and             Sears Holdings Corp.are closing hundreds of locations to stem losses.But Nordstrom, which has fewer locations and is mostly in higher-end malls, is better positioned than others, analysts and investors say. It operates about 120 full-line stores and about 215 off-price Nordstrom Rack locations. Last year, a third of its $14.5 billion in revenue came from the discount business.\u201cEveryone is trying to determine who will be the survivors of the             Amazon.com                  -led nuclear winter and I think Nordstrom is one of those survivors,\u201d said Maxim Group analyst       Tom Forte,        noting shares of the company are undervalued by investors scared away by the woes of the wider sector.Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management, which owns nearly half a million Nordstrom shares, said the company has been making all the right moves but the market isn\u2019t giving it credit. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing them any good to be a public company at the moment,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead, whose firm has roughly $2 billion under management, said he expects Nordstrom to be one of the retail survivors. \u201cThey will gain share as their competitors close stores.\u201dThe company had a market value of $7.5 billion as of Thursday\u2019s close and around $2 billion of net debt. Bankers said Thursday that given the family\u2019s large stake, real-estate holdings and relative health of the business, the Nordstrom family wouldn\u2019t have difficulty finding a financing partner for a buyout.At $46 a share, the family would need to raise around $5.5 billion to fund a buyout, estimates Chuck Grom, analyst at Gordon Haskett Research. That would still leave the company with about a 28% lower ratio of debt to earnings than other recent retail buyouts.Privately held retailers haven\u2019t been spared the pain that has hit those in the public market. Nordstrom rival Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. is struggling with falling sales and more than $5 billion in debt from a leveraged buyout. J.Crew Group Inc., which was taken private in 2011, has posted 10 straight quarters of lower same-store sales and recently said its longtime leader Mickey Drexler would step aside as CEO.Some analysts were skeptical of the idea of adding debt to a retailer given the underlying pressures. \u201cWe do not see the merits,\u201d wrote Citi\u2019s Paul Lejuez.But Mr. Questrom drew a distinction between a founding family taking a company private and leveraged buyouts done by private-equity firms that typically pile on debt to juice returns and have a time horizon of five to seven years.The Nordstrom family group includes the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, Chairman Emeritus and former CEO       Bruce Nordstrom,        who owns 15.4% of the company and is a grandson of the founder. It also includes his sister,       Anne Gittinger,        who owns 9.2%, co-presidents Blake, Peter and       Erik Nordstrom,        as well as president of stores       James Nordstrom.The group said in a regulatory filing that it was exploring taking the company private \u201cbecause of the changing dynamics in the retail environment.\u201d It hasn\u2019t made a proposal, though Nordstrom said its board has formed a special committee of independent directors and hired financial advisers to consider any offer.Nordstrom had no further comment.\u201cThey have always wanted to run this as a family business,\u201d said Kathy Gersch, a former Nordstrom executive who now works at management firm Kotter International. She said such a takeover would \u201cnot be a standard leveraged buyout. It\u2019s really the family buying back their company. It allows for a level of alignment that you don\u2019t get in a standard buyout.\u201dNordstrom was co-founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant who had joined the Klondike gold rush, and a local shoe salesman. The founders retired in the late 1920s and sold the business to Mr. Nordstrom\u2019s sons. It sold only shoes until the 1960s and didn\u2019t have a location on the East Coast until 1988.A third generation, including Bruce Nordstrom, took over in the 1960s. The company added women\u2019s apparel, sold shares to the public in 1971 and expanded the chain into a national player. Three of the founder\u2019s great grandchildren are now co-presidents of the company.Nordstrom has fended off threats to its business in part by moving quickly to expand its off-price chain and buying digital startups such as menswear site Trunk Club and flash-sales site HauteLook. While they have helped boost ecommerce sales, the investments have been costly. Last fall, Nordstrom wrote down the value of Trunk Club by nearly $200 million.Nordstrom\u2019s profits tumbled 41% to $354 million for its fiscal year ended in January, while sales inched up to $14.5 billion. Comparable sales fell 6.4% at physical full-line stores, but were largely offset by gains in e-commerce and Nordstrom Rack.\u201cWe view Nordstrom as the strongest retailer in the department store space,\u201d wrote Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss, adding that the company is one of the few he expects to grow operating income over the next several years due to its e-commerce and off-price businesses. Mr. Buss said he believes the \u201ccore equity value\u201d is $52 a share.Last month, many of the big U.S. retailers reported dismal earnings. During its latest quarter, sales at Macy\u2019s stores open at least a year slipped 5.2%.             Kohl\u2019s Corp.       and Hudson\u2019s Bay Co., which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, also reported declines in same-store sales.Just this week, Macy\u2019s warned that profit margins were below its forecasts as it struggles to move unsold inventory. Sears announced plans to close another 72 Sears and Kmart locations.Earlier this year, Nordstrom faced additional scrutiny after it decided to drop the fashion label of       Ivanka Trump.       President       Donald Trump       criticized the retailer on Twitter, saying his daughter was being treated unfairly. Ms Trump has taken a leave from her apparel and accessories company, though she retains a financial interest.Nordstrom said it decided not to order items from Ms. Trump\u2019s spring collection because of the brand\u2019s performance, saying sales had steadily declined last year. During a call with analysts in February, Nordstrom executives said the President\u2019s criticism had a negligible impact on the business.\u2014Khadeeja Safdar contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 19:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nordstrom-considering-being-taken-private-1496928399", "news_title": "Nordstrom Family Weighs Taking Retailer Private", "keywords": "mall traffic,pe deals,private company,retailcarousel,retailers,retail sales,Nordstrom,JWN,Anne Gittinger,Bruce Nordstrom,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,leveraged buyouts,retail,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing,department stores"}, {"content": "U.S. stock futures slipped after U.K. exit polls suggested the governing Conservative Party failed to achieve an overall majority in Thursday\u2019s election.S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% in late trading.

Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t respond to that request, in Mr. Comey\u2019s retelling.\u201cI have a recollection of him just kind of looking at me\u2026. His body language gave me the sense like, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019... He didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Mr. Comey said at the hearing.Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said Mr. Sessions \u201cwas not silent,\u201d and said he responded by saying that the agency \u201cneeded to be careful about following appropriate policies regarding contacts with the White House.\u201d Mr. Prior also pointed to Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony that he didn\u2019t inform Mr. Sessions about the substance of his conversation with Mr. Trump.In his testimony, Mr. Comey also raised the possibility of new concerns about Mr. Sessions\u2019s contacts with Russia during the campaign. Mr. Comey said he was \u201caware of facts\u201d weeks before Mr. Sessions formally recused himself from an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and that those facts made Mr. Sessions\u2019s \u201ccontinued engagement\u201d in the investigation \u201cproblematic.\u201d He said that he couldn\u2019t discuss those facts in a public setting, and what he was referring to remains unclear.Democrats used that part of Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony to demand more answers from Mr. Sessions. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said that disclosure \u201craised serious questions\u2019\u2019 that Mr. Sessions and the Justice Department \u201cmust answer immediately.\u2019Mr. Sessions removed himself from the probe in March following the disclosure that he had conversations with a Russian official while advising the Trump campaign. That contact appeared at odds with testimony he gave during his confirmation hearing, but Mr. Sessions said in a letter dated March 6 amending his testimony: \u201cI do not recall any discussions with the Russian ambassador, or any other representative of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion.\u201dMr. Sessions was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest and most steadfast supporters on the campaign trail. He was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump as a candidate and was among the first appointments to the president\u2019s cabinet. But that relationship has come under strain in recent weeks, due in part to Mr. Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from Russia investigation, which is also looking at possible ties to the Trump campaign.Mr. Trump has said he fired Mr. Comey in part over the Russia investigation, and Mr. Comey said on Thursday he believed that to be the case. \u201cIt\u2019s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change\u2026the way the Russia investigation was being conducted,\u201d he said.Democrats have asked why Mr. Sessions was involved in Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, given his recusal and Mr. Trump\u2019s explanation that the firing was in part driven by the Russia probe. On Thursday, Mr. Comey said it was a \u201creasonable question.\u201dMr. Comey has a history of dust-ups with his bosses, dating to his 2004 race to the hospital bedside of then-Attorney General       John Ashcroft       to override any efforts by the White House to gain authorization for a surveillance program Mr. Comey believed to be unconstitutional.On Thursday, he also disparaged former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       attorney general, Loretta Lynch, saying her actions in the investigation into Democratic presidential candidate       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       email use forced him to take action on his own to \u201cprotect the credibility of the investigation.\u201dMr. Comey told lawmakers on Thursday he thought Ms. Lynch was compromised by a private meeting she had with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband, former President       Bill Clinton,        on an airport tarmac.He also cited Ms. Lynch\u2019s request to call the probe a \u201cmatter\u201d rather than an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d which he said tracked with how the Clinton campaign was trying to describe it and \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cconcerned\u201d him.Mr. Comey\u2019s public remarks last year on the FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email use while she was secretary of state earned him critics from across the political spectrum and were at issue in a memo that Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       wrote, which essentially recommended his firing.The issue of how to describe the Clinton probe came up in a discussion in September 2015 between Justice Department officials and Mr. Comey over whether to confirm the existence of the investigation, according to a person familiar with Ms. Lynch\u2019s thinking.Ms. Lynch told Mr. Comey she had used the term \u201cmatter\u201d in response to press inquiries, to avoid confirming or denying an investigation, in accordance with Justice Department policy, the person said. Ms. Lynch asked officials at the meeting if everyone was comfortable with using the term \u201cmatter\u201d and no one, including Mr. Comey, contested that view, the person said.But most of Mr. Comey\u2019s criticism was directed at Mr. Trump, and Republicans pressed Mr. Comey on why, if he was so concerned, he didn\u2019t raise his concerns more directly with the attorney general or White House counsel. Mr. Comey said he never alerted Mr. Sessions to Mr. Trump\u2019s request on the Flynn investigation, though he said the FBI\u2019s senior leadership discussed their possible courses of action.\u201cIt was of investigative interest us to try and figure out\u2026what just happened with the president\u2019s request. So, I would not have wanted to alert the White House that it had happened until we figured out, what are we going to do with this investigatively?\u201d Mr. Comey said.Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Comey Questions Sessions\u2019s Moves.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 19:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/comeys-testimony-sheds-light-on-tense-relationship-with-sessions-1496963008", "news_title": "Comey\u2019s Testimony Sheds Light on Tense Relationship With Sessions", "keywords": " donald trump, investigation,james comey, jeff sessions, russia,FBI,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "WashingtonJames Comey\u2019s       written testimony outlining meetings and conversations with President Trump was telling and damning because believable. Whatever Mr. Comey\u2019s reputation, and it is mixed\u2014an intelligent, accomplished professional who is plenty slick; state-of-the-art Beltway operator with an image of integrity, yet trailed by suspicions of slight smarm\u2014he is a careful man. It is not strange for an official to take notes after a meeting or conversation with a president, and it is wholly understandable when the president is unusual, the circumstances heightened, the relationship potentially contentious. It begs credulity that Mr. Comey would have tapped out elaborate fictions in a one-man note-taking plot to bring down a president. And he must have known it possible the calls and meetings were taped, in which case the contents would be used to destroy him if he lied.Mr. Comey first met with President-elect Trump in January. Afterward he broke with previous personal practice and documented the meeting in a memo. \u201cTo ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting.\u201dOn Jan. 27 he had dinner with the president at the White House. \u201cIt turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room.\u201d The president asked if he wanted to stay on as FBI Director. Mr. Comey found this \u201cstrange,\u201d because Mr. Trump had already told him twice, earlier, he hoped Mr. Comey would stay. The director felt \u201cthe one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship.\u201dThen: \u201cA few moments later, the President said, \u2018I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.\u2019 I didn\u2019t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence.\u201dNear the end of the dinner Mr. Trump said he was glad Mr. Comey wanted to stay. \u201cHe then said, \u2018I need loyalty.\u2019 I replied, \u2018You will always get honesty from me.\u2019 [Mr. Trump] paused and then said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want, honest loyalty.\u2019 I paused and then said, \u2018You will get that from me.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThus ended \u201ca very awkward conversation.\u201dJoin the WSJ\u2019s 2017 Pulitzer Prize winner Peggy Noonan and EMEA editor Thorold Barker for a frank and probing discussion about the inner workings of U.S. politics past and present, Thursday, June 22.On Feb. 14 Mr. Comey met the president and other top officials for a counterterrorism briefing in the Oval Office. At the end the president said he wanted to speak to Mr. Comey privately. Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       lingered; the president said he wanted Mr. Comey alone.\u201cWhen the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, \u2018I want to speak about       Mike Flynn.      \u2019\u00a0\u201d The president said: \u201cHe is a good guy and has been through a lot.\u201d Referring to the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.\u201d Mr. Comey agreed Mr. Flynn was a good guy, but didn\u2019t say he\u2019d let it go.Mr. Comey thought the meeting \u201cvery concerning, given the FBI\u2019s role as an independent investigative agency.\u201d Later he told his boss, the attorney general, that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d that Mr. Sessions was asked to leave the meeting and \u201cit should never happen again.\u201d Mr. Sessions did not reply, Mr. Comey reports.On March 30, the president phoned Mr. Comey at the FBI. He said the Russia investigation was damaging his ability to govern. \u201cHe asked what we could do to \u2018lift the cloud.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Comey answered that they were investigating the matter as quickly as possible. Mr. Trump urged Mr. Comey to get out the word the president himself wasn\u2019t being investigated. \u201cI told him I would see what we could do.\u201d He requested guidance from the Justice Department, which did not provide it.Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony backs up Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the director told him he personally was not under investigation.The worst part of the testimony is when the president pressed Mr. Comey for his personal loyalty. Presidents don\u2019t lean on FBI chiefs in this way. It is at odds with traditional boundaries, understandings and protocols. It was embarrassing to read. It was the move of a na\u00eff who\u2019s a cynic\u2014I know how the big boys play. Actually it\u2019s not how the big boys play, it\u2019s how someone who learns about government by binge-watching \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d would play. It was bumptious with the special bumptiousness of those who think themselves savvy.Still, as a Republican senator said after Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony was released, inappropriate does not mean illegal.       Jonathan Turley,        a law professor at George Washington University, wrote in USA Today that the desire for an indictable or impeachable offense by the president \u201chas distorted the legal analysis\u201d of the case \u201cto an alarming degree.\u201d Mr. Turley\u2019s read on the testimony: Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct was \u201cwildly inappropriate.\u201d Asking Mr. Comey to lay off Mr. Flynn was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cgrossly improper.\u201d But \u201cthe legal fact is that Comey\u2019s testimony does not establish a prima facie\u2014or even a strong\u2014case for obstruction [of justice].\u201d This is not the first president \u201cto express dissatisfaction with an investigation by the Justice Department\u201d:       Bill Clinton       did the same. Nor was it a surprise he wished to see the investigations end: He\u2019d said so publicly.On Thursday Mr. Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had authorized leaks about his memos after the president had tweeted a warning: \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.\u201d Mr. Comey realized there might be corroboration. Thursday he said, \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d (That was rather Comey, to pull out the \u201cLordy.\u201d) He asked if they exist that they be released.In the end Mr. Comey appears to have done himself little or no harm, but he harmed the president by documenting, again and persuasively, that Mr. Trump does not understand the norms, rules and traditions of his job. As I watched, I wondered how many other appointees, officials and White House staffers are writing themselves memos.Will all this damage the president with his supporters?What consumes Blue America does not consume Red America.The photojournalist       Chris Arnade       reported on             Twitter                   what he was seeing in Mountain Grove, Mo., Thursday morning as Mr. Comey testified.

Kirk said no: \u201cI got a lot of yards to mow.\u201dThen again, a conservative intellectual with small-town roots wrote, during the testimony, that he thought this might be a break point, a moment when Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters would listen close and think he\u2019s not so much like them, and not so different from the swamp he means to drain.I myself don\u2019t know.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-comey-told-us-about-trump-1496962205", "news_title": "What Comey Told Us About Trump", "keywords": "comey leaks,comey memo,donald trump,fbi director,james comey,jeff sessions,leakers,mike flynn,opinioncomeycar,russia,James Comey,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014An American pilot shot down an armed drone that attacked U.S.-backed forces in southern Syria on Thursday in an escalating confrontation with President       Bashar al-Assad       and his allies, military officials said.The shootdown came after the Predator-style drone targeted U.S.-led coalition advisers on patrol with Syrian fighters in southern Syria, where American forces operate out of a base along the border with Jordan and Iraq.While no members of the patrol were hurt by the drone strike, it marked a significant expansion in the fight between Mr. Assad\u2019s forces and Americans operating in Syria. American officials said it was the first time allies of Mr. Assad had used a drone to attack U.S.-led coalition forces in Syria.While once the province of a small group of nations such as the U.S. and Israel, drone development has accelerated in recent years. A dozen nations now have armed drones, according to New America, a Washington think tank, and militant groups like Islamic State and Hezbollah have used surveillance drones on the battlefield.The U.S. military has been working to identify the origin of the drone in Thursday\u2019s attack, but U.S. officials and analysts said it most likely was Iranian-made.\u201cThe fingers are definitely pointing towards Iran,\u201d said Alyssa Sims, an analyst who specializes in drones at New America.Iran used its Shahed 129 drone in February 2016 to carry out attacks in Syria, according to the country\u2019s state-run news agency. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group fighting alongside Mr. Assad\u2019s forces in Syria, has also used drones in the past.The fight in southern Syria has intensified in recent weeks as the U.S. military has beefed up its presence in the area as the fight against Islamic State extremist forces accelerates. Three weeks ago, the U.S.-led coalition carried out airstrikes on pro-regime forces that moved toward al-Tanf, where U.S. forces and their allies operate out of a base.At the time, the U.S. military warned Mr. Assad and his allies to steer clear of the base and stay out of a 33-mile deconfliction zone around the base.But some allies of Mr. Assad refused to leave, while others began to set up camp right outside the zone, U.S. officials said.Earlier this week, the U.S. military carried out a second strike on the pro-regime forces inside the zone, and issued public warnings for the remaining forces to pull back.U.S. officials said the forces in the area include Shiite militias backed by Iran and members of the Syrian military.The U.S. military used its deconfliction communications line with Russia to repeatedly urge Mr. Assad\u2019s allies to leave the area, but some remained, said U.S. Army Col. Ryan Dillon, a Baghdad-based spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition battling Islamic State.The U.S. has drawn criticism from Moscow and threats of retaliation from Damascus.After the strike earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the operation \u201can aggressive act\u201d and said that Moscow didn\u2019t recognize the deconfliction zone declared by the U.S.On Thursday, the U.S.-led coalition said it hit two armed pickup trucks that moved into the zone and posed a threat. Before launching the strike, the U.S. coalition sent a warning by walkie-talkie to pro-regime forces, according to American-backed fighters who forwarded the message to The Wall Street Journal.\u201cYou have exhausted all the chances given to you to leave,\u201d a man warned in Arabic. \u201cYou are now a target for lethal strikes. If you want to stay alive, leave now.\u201dLater in the day, Col. Dillon said, an American pilot shot down the armed drone that attacked coalition forces and Syrian allies on patrol outside the zone.While U.S. officials didn\u2019t identify the exact type of drone, Iran\u2019s allies in Lebanon aired footage earlier this week said to show an Iranian drone tracking an American drone flying in southern Syria.Col. Dillon said the pro-Syrian drone\u2019s strike \u201chit dirt\u201d and caused no damage. Nonetheless, the colonel said, the drone had other weapons that posed a threat to the coalition patrol.\u2014Nathan Hodge in Moscow and Nour Alakraa in Berlin contributed to this article.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'American Pilot Shoots Down Armed Drone in Syria.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-pilot-shoots-down-armed-drone-in-syria-1496947875", "news_title": "U.S. Pilot Shoots Down Armed Drone in Syria", "keywords": "coalition airstrikes,drone,shot down,southern syria,syrian civil war,syrian conflict,u.s. forces,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Washington state has no insurer willing to offer Affordable Care Act plans next year in two of its 39 counties, opening up a third U.S. region that is poised to be without coverage through the health law\u2019s marketplaces.The latest announcement, from Washington\u2019s state insurance regulator, is likely to add to the political pressure over the status of the ACA\u2019s marketplaces, which are showing growing signs of strain around the country.The insurer that is pulling out of the ACA exchange in the two counties, Premera Blue Cross, said its decision to stop offering marketplace plans there \u201cwill help us keep cost increases lower for customers in other counties.\u201d The insurer said it planned to pull out of a total of four out of the 27 Washington counties where it currently sells ACA exchange plans.Washington\u2019s Grays Harbor and Klickitat counties now join a swath of 18 counties in Ohio that have no exchange insurer signed up for next year in the wake of Anthem Inc.\u2019s decision to pull out of that state\u2019s marketplace. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City\u2019s planned exit from the ACA exchanges is leaving 25 counties in western Missouri in the same position for 2018, if no other insurer steps in.When there are no ACA exchange plans in a region, consumers are stranded because the situation essentially short-circuits the way the existing health law is supposed to function. The law, often called Obamacare, mandates that most people acquire health coverage and offers government subsidies to help lower-income consumers buy plans. To obtain the subsidies, though, people are supposed to buy their insurance through the health law\u2019s exchanges.Washington\u2019s insurance regulator said that based on regulatory filings, no insurer has so far indicated an intent to sell plans to consumers either on the ACA exchange or outside it in Grays Harbor and Klickitat, which together had about 3,350 people enrolled in individual plans this year.This year, according to a spokesman for the regulator, Grays Harbor had marketplace plans from Premera Blue Cross and its LifeWise subsidiary. Klickitat had LifeWise, the spokesman said.The latest ACA exchange pullback will likely be seized on by both Democrats and Republicans. Republicans have pointed to insurers\u2019 marketplace withdrawals and rate increases as signs of trouble with the ACA and argued that the developments bolster the case for the health bill that they are trying to pass. President       Donald Trump       has cited the so-called bare counties in Ohio this week and did so again on Thursday in a Washington speech.Democrats have countered that Anthem and other insurers are reacting to uncertainty created by GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration, particularly over the future of federal cost-sharing payments that help reduce costs for low-income ACA enrollees.Insurers have said that there will likely be further pullbacks and sharp rate increases in exchange plans if they aren\u2019t given certainty about the future of the ACA, particularly the cost-sharing payments, which Mr. Trump has threatened to stop.Premera pointed to cost issues in its coverage area but said \u201cuncertainty around [cost-sharing payments] is not a contributing factor in our decision to exit counties.\u201d The nonprofit insurer said that where it \u201ccannot offer in-network services at a reasonable cost, it will exit that service area.\u201d The pullback \u201cwill help us moderate rising costs for our members while allowing us to continue to offer coverage to more counties in the state than any other carrier,\u201d Premera said.Washington\u2019s insurance commissioner, Mike Kreidler, a Democrat who has supported the ACA, said that more broadly the state\u2019s expected drop-off next year in exchange insurers \u201cclearly indicates to me that the uncertainty the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress has sowed for months is sabotaging the progress we\u2019ve made.\u201d He said he would \u201cstrongly encourage\u201d insurers to enter the two counties currently set to lack exchange plans next year.Anthem, in announcing its exit from the Ohio exchange, said the market remains volatile and cited the uncertainty surrounding key issues, including the federal cost-sharing payments.The House has passed a health bill, though it didn\u2019t include an appropriation for the cost-sharing payments for next year. The GOP-controlled Senate is considering health-care legislation now, though some members are wary that 50 out of 52 members of the Republican caucus will be able to coalesce around a single bill. Mr. Trump\u2019s officials have said they want to use insurance-market turbulence to urge action.Even if new health-care legislation is passed by a GOP Congress, it won\u2019t take effect for some time. That puts the White House in a position of simultaneously talking up current problems in the insurance markets and trying to preserve them for next year and the following year, or risk being blamed as the administration in office when people find themselves without insurance options.Behind the scenes, Trump administration officials are talking to insurers and in some cases, hoping to persuade them to continue to offer coverage next year amid the upheaval. A senior White House official said that such work was likely to continue for months, and that the administration was counting on state regulators being able to solve the problem during that time.\u201c2018 is what we\u2019re talking about. That starts in January,\u201d the official said. \u201cI think people will work with the insurers as best as they can.\u201dMembers of Congress have already championed their own ideas to deal with the issue of bare ACA counties. Tennessee Senators       Lamar Alexander       and       Bob Corker       have proposed allowing people to use tax credits under the law with insurers that sell in their area, regardless of whether they do so through the federal HealthCare.gov online marketplace or a state equivalent.Democratic Senator       Claire McCaskill       of Missouri has proposed allowing people in bare counties to buy into the small-group health benefits offered to members of Congress and their staff, both those in the District of Columbia or their home states.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Another Area Loses Last ACA Insurer.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-washington-state-counties-lack-aca-health-insurer-for-2018-1496955152", "news_title": "Two Washington State Counties Lack ACA Health Insurer for 2018", "keywords": " aca,aca health plans, affordable care act,health care policy, health insurance, obamacare,Premera Blue Cross,Anthem,ANTM,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "Six miles in the air, I reached for my travel bag with the intention of retrieving something. I guess I wasn\u2019t paying attention, because I unzipped the wrong compartment, stuck my hand inside, and pulled something out that caught me by delighted surprise.Seeing it was like somehow encountering a goofy and grinning old gap-toothed friend you thought you\u2019d lost track of forever\u2014and here that friend was, riding across America with you.It was a copy of SkyMall, the deliriously bizarre in-flight shopping catalog that once was inescapable in the seat-back pockets of U.S. airliners. I must have tossed it in the bag and forgotten about it many years ago.When SkyMall\u2019s parent company declared bankruptcy in January 2015 the catalogs vanished from planes, taking with them a sunny quirkiness that we all could use as flying becomes exponentially more unpleasant. It wasn\u2019t that most passengers ever ordered from the catalogs. Rather, the items offered for sale were often so amiably eccentric that, for a brief moment, the prospect of owning them seemed tantalizing, if not entirely plausible. Down on the ground the products might be utterly resistible, but while you were in the air the catalog itself was irresistible. The ultimate in-flight entertainment.I opened the frayed old copy of SkyMall. It didn\u2019t disappoint:A baby blanket designed to look like a tortilla so that the swaddled child would appear to be an enchilada or a burrito. A CD promising to be the \u201cUltimate Voice Builder,\u201d to help the listener speak in \u201cdeeper, sexier and more powerful\u201d tones. A remote-controlled tarantula. A ballpoint pen with \u201cauthentic dirt from the infield of your favorite ballpark\u201d sealed inside. A paper-towel holder with four charging stations in its base to juice up phones and other electronic devices.When SkyMall ceased publication, its CEO said that the internet, including competition from online merchants, had siphoned passengers\u2019 in-flight attention elsewhere. Travelers could use their tablets and phones to access the web while flying, and SkyMall was no longer the diversion it had been. Airlines were dropping it, and sales shrank.Yet as I flipped through the newly found old catalog, I noticed that other passengers, not only in the seats directly next to mine but also across the aisle, were craning their necks trying to sneak a glimpse. The sight of those SkyMall pages, so densely packed with color photos of strange items, still seemed seductive.I handed the catalog, all 172 pages of it, to the man next to me. He riffled through it as if expecting to find buried treasure. In a sense, he did:A metal sculpture of a baseball player at the plate, ready to swing\u2014constructed so that he grips in his hands not a bat, but an upside-down wine bottle. A T-shirt with coffee fragrance baked into the fabric. A toaster that burns the \u201cStar Wars\u201d logo onto the surface of bread. A computer mouse made to look like a yellow Lamborghini. A purse that converts into a scarf \u201cwith two hidden secure zipper pockets to protect your valuables.\u201dSkyMall\u2019s most valuable service may not have been to sell the goods depicted in its pages, but to put its readers, crammed inside a speeding metal tube high in the clouds, in a sprightlier mood than they might have been otherwise. When cessation of publication was announced, a retail analyst was quoted as saying the catalog lacked a single marketable identity: \u201cIt\u2019s all over the place.\u201dThat\u2019s wrong. Its genius was that it wasn\u2019t all over the place, it was in one place: the seat-back pocket. When a New Jersey firm bought it out of bankruptcy later in 2015, it announced plans to bring SkyMall back as a stand-alone website.Which it did. When I landed later, I looked at it. The feeling somehow wasn\u2019t the same: An e-commerce site is an e-commerce site. The beauty of the printed in-flight catalog was the splendor of its studied serendipity, knowingly playing to a genuinely captive audience.On the plane I retrieved my old SkyMall from the fellow I\u2019d lent it to and put it back in my bag. It may come in handy on some future tension-filled, overbooked flight.

New York Police Department Commissioner       James O\u2019Neill       is refusing to march, as are several Democratic politicians, including Gov.       Andrew Cuomo,        Attorney General       Eric Schneiderman       and Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand.The wariness over L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2014who\u2019ll still march, though he\u2019s said he\u2019ll forgo the \u201chero\u201d designation\u2014is well-founded. The group he helped lead, the pro-independence Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional Puertorrique\u00f1a, or FALN, was one of the most prolific terrorist organizations of its time. Between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, the FALN perpetrated more than 130 bombings. It was responsible for the 1975 explosion at Fraunces Tavern, which killed four and wounded 63; a bombing spree in New York City in August 1977 that killed one, injured six, and forced the evacuation of 100,000 office workers; and the purposeful targeting and maiming of four police officers, among many other vicious crimes.Carnage on this scale was possible because of the FALN\u2019s organizational and operational sophistication\u2014including its numerous connections to communist Cuba and its intelligence services. Those connections have been known to law enforcement for decades.According to court documents,       Filiberto Ojeda R\u00edos,        who is believed to have helped co-found the FALN, told an undercover NYPD officer in 1983 that he had received explosives training in Cuba. And the FBI estimated that by 1973, roughly 135 Puerto Rican militants had received \u201cextensive instruction in guerilla war tactics, preparation of explosive artifacts, and sophisticated methods of sabotage\u201d from       Fidel Castro\u2019s       intelligence services.The full extent of the FALN\u2019s Cuba connections is unknown. But they may be more enduring than has been publicly reported. According to an NYPD document I discovered at the Hoover Institution archives at Stanford\u2014undated, but apparently circa 1977\u2014by that time officials had come to believe that \u201cthe FALN was started in the mid-1960\u2019s with a nucleus of Puerto Rican terrorists that received advanced training in Cuba. .\u00a0.\u00a0. After their advanced training in Cuba they returned to Puerto Rico and a wave of bombings and incendiary incidents struck the [latter] island. Within the last few years they have shifted their activities to the mainland. .\u00a0.\u00a0. It is believed that they have maintained close links and may in fact work closely with Cuban intelligence operatives.\u201dThat training would help explain the FALN\u2019s professionalism, as well as its ability to bedevil law enforcement. An FALN instructional manual, which I also found at       Hoover,        includes sophisticated directives for compartmentalized clandestine communications between different \u201ccadres,\u201d or cells, as well as espionage and countersurveillance techniques. \u201cOne must observe religiously the rules and regulations of security in order to protect the organization, its cadres, its secrets, its documents, its arms, [safe] houses, and other instruments of work,\u201d the document says. According to the manual, this hyperattention to security even extended to meetings of the MLN, the FALN\u2019s above-ground political organization.Viewed from this broader perspective, the FALN was not merely a \u201chighly motivated and intelligent adversary,\u201d as the NYPD document I found puts it. It was an instrument in the decadeslong shadow war between the U.S. and Cuba.This is not to minimize the pro-independence sentiment in Puerto Rico, or the historical, cultural and emotional bonds that tie the two islands together. The Spanish-American War, which gave Cuba its independence, also led to Puerto Rico\u2019s annexation by the U.S. But from Castro\u2019s perspective, training a group of dedicated Marxist militants, whose actions would then destabilize major American cities such as New York and Chicago (as well as Puerto Rico itself), would help form a relatively low-cost, and covert, strategy for weakening his greatest antagonist.On May 17 L\u00f3pez Rivera was released from house arrest, 3\u00bd months after departing prison. The Cuban regime applauded. \u201cPlease accept our fraternal congratulations on behalf of the Party, government and people, who share the joy of your liberation,\u201d said President       Raul Castro,        Fidel\u2019s brother. \u201cWe await you in Cuba, with all the honors and affection you deserve, whenever it may be possible for you.\u201dMr. Castro neglected to mention that Cuba already plays host to another FALN leader:       William Morales,        one of the group\u2019s bomb-makers, who after escaping from a U.S. prison in 1979 found his way to Havana. Much of the story of Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera and the FALN takes place far from the streets of Spanish Harlem, Humboldt Park or San Juan.Mr. Dorfman is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fidel-castro-supported-terrorism-in-america-1496961035", "news_title": "How Fidel Castro Supported Terrorism in America", "keywords": " castro, cuba,oscar l\u00f3pez rivera, puerto rican day parade, terrorism,NYPD,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,politics,international relations,domestic politics,espionage,terrorism,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "\u2018Slang,\u201d wrote the poet       Carl Sandburg,        is \u201clanguage that takes off its coat, spits on its hands, and goes to work.\u201d It swarms around our taboos and pleasures, its voice usually loud and impudent. \u201cMuch slang,\u201d comments the British writer Max D\u00e9charn\u00e9 in \u201cVulgar Tongues,\u201d begins \u201cas a kind of low-level guerrilla warfare directed at straight society.\u201d It\u2019s the combative lingo of the street corner and the stoop, a form of display or a marker of identity calculated to keep sobersides at arm\u2019s length and perhaps even revolt them.

Previously the author of books about Hollywood crime movies and London\u2019s murderous underworld, he was once the drummer for Gallon Drunk, a highly literate alt-rock band, before becoming the lead singer of another willfully sleazy group, the Flaming Stars.

There\u2019s a chapter on items of slang to do with prostitution; others focus on the terms favored by drug users and rappers. Gangsters get a chapter, too.

Mr. D\u00e9charn\u00e9 draws on many of these and marshals an impressive range of primary sources\u2014he is equally comfortable talking about 17th-century plays, hard-boiled detective novels, punk bands and the caustic essays of the Black Panther activist       Eldridge Cleaver.       It is strange, though, that he makes no mention of the tireless       Jonathon Green,        who is responsible for what is now certainly the best historical dictionary of English slang.The strength of Mr. D\u00e9charn\u00e9\u2019s account is its zest, and it comes as no surprise that he is very knowledgeable about music. He is a keen collector of saucy lyrics, and sometimes even the title of a song is the equivalent of an exaggerated wink. It was in 1897 that the English music-hall performer       Marie Lloyd       first dazzled her fans with \u201cShe\u2019d Never Had Her Ticket Punched Before,\u201d and in 1938 that ukulele-strumming comedian       George Formby       served up a number called \u201cI Wonder Who\u2019s Under Her Balcony Now.\u201dHistorians of slang like to point out that terms we may regard as sharply contemporary have long histories. Mr. D\u00e9charn\u00e9 is no exception, savoring the detail that in       Samuel Johnson\u2019s       \u201cDictionary of the English Language\u201d (1755) \u201cto rap\u201d is \u201cto utter with hasty violence\u201d and noting that the adjective \u201cfly,\u201d much used by the less hasty sort of rapper, appears in a slang dictionary of the early 19th century, where it is defined as \u201cacquainted with another\u2019s meaning or proceeding.\u201d Elsewhere his delight in curios means that he strays from his theme. But it is easy to be seduced by the incidental details, such as his reference to a character in Michael Avallone\u2019s novel \u201cThe Bedroom Bolero\u201d (1963) whose explanation for his facial bruises is that \u201cI tried to carry a moose head through a revolving door.\u201dWhether discussing       Geoffrey Chaucer       or       Johnny Depp\u2019s       tattoos, Mr. D\u00e9charn\u00e9 proves, as he might put it, hip to the tip. He has stretched his lunch-hooks into some unlikely places in his quest for curious argot, and there\u2019s a whole lot of bizarre information in his fusebox (or his idea pot, if you prefer). Inevitably, many of the most droll words and phrases he identifies are to do with sex. Readers will be able to work out for themselves what might be meant by \u201cstanding-room for one\u201d and \u201cplaying the invisible banjo.\u201d The impulse to write, and especially to talk, about \u201cgetting pretty goaty\u201d or indulging \u201cfour-legged thoughts\u201d is perennial.

Kim Jong Un\u2019s       scientists are still testing only low-yield nuclear weapons, the thinking goes, and have yet to place them on ballistic missiles capable of reaching America\u2019s West Coast.While its technological shortcomings have been well documented, North Korea\u2019s desire to provoke a nuclear conflict with the U.S. should not be minimized or ignored. Pyongyang is surely close to getting it right.For South Korea the danger is more immediate. According to physicist       David Albright,        the founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security, the North Koreans have between 13 and 30 nuclear weapons and can build as many as five more every year. If Mr. Kim were to detonate one of these bombs in the atmosphere 40 miles above Seoul, it could inflict catastrophic damage on South Korea\u2019s electric power grid, leading to a prolonged blackout that could have deadly consequences.The United States has 28,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in South Korea stationed below the 38th parallel\u2014and more at sea nearby. An electromagnetic pulse attack on South Korea could play havoc with America\u2019s ability to mount an effective response to North Korean aggression. One hopes the troops manning the two already-deployed batteries of the Thaad ballistic-missile defense system are prepared for such a scenario (in a concession to China, the newly elected South Korean government suspended this week the deployment of four additional launchers).In 2001 Congress established a commission to study the danger of an electromagnetic pulse generated by the detonation of a high-altitude nuclear weapon. It concluded that while there would be no blast effects on the ground, critical electricity-dependent infrastructure could be rendered inoperable. The commission\u2019s chairman,       William R. Graham,        has noted that several Russian generals told the commissioners in 2004 that the designs for a \u201csuper EMP nuclear weapon\u201d had been transferred to North Korea.Pyongyang, the Russian generals reported, was probably only a few years away from developing super EMP capability. According to       Peter Vincent Pry,        staff director of the congressional EMP commission, a recent North Korean medium-range missile test that was widely reported to have exploded midflight could in fact have been deliberately detonated at an altitude of 40 miles.Was it a dry run for an EMP attack? Detonation at that altitude of a nuclear warhead with a yield of 10 to 20 kilotons\u2014similar to those tested by North Korea\u2014would produce major EMP effects and inflict catastrophic damage to unhardened electronics across hundreds of miles of surface territory. It is a myth that large yield nuclear weapons of hundreds of kilotons are required to produce such effects.Although some analysts have dismissed the possibility of a successful North Korean EMP attack\u2014either on South Korea or the United States\u2014several factors could make it a more appealing first-strike strategy for Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear scientists than a direct, missile-delivered nuclear strike. For one thing, accuracy is not a concern; the North Koreans simply need to get near their target to sow chaos. Nor would they need to worry about developing a reliable re-entry vehicle for their ballistic missiles.Conventional wisdom aside, a North Korean EMP attack on the U.S. may also not be far-fetched. \u201cNorth Korea could make an EMP attack against the United States by launching a short-range missile off a freighter or submarine or by lofting a warhead to 30 kilometers burst height by balloon,\u201d wrote Mr. Graham earlier this month on the security blog 38 North. \u201cEven a balloon-lofted warhead detonated at 30 kilometers altitude could blackout the Eastern Grid that supports most of the population and generates 75 percent of US electricity. Moreover, an EMP attack could be made by a North Korean satellite.\u201d Two North Korean satellites currently orbit the earth on trajectories that take them over the U.S.This is not mere theory. In 1962 the United States detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead over the South Pacific, 900 miles southwest of Hawaii. Designated \u201cStarfish Prime,\u201d the blast destroyed hundreds of street lights in Honolulu, caused electrical surges on airplanes in the area, and damaged at least six satellites. Only Hawaii\u2019s undeveloped electric power-transmission infrastructure prevented a prolonged blackout. It was the era of vacuum-tube electronics. We are living in the digital age.The U.S. and South Korea should ensure their ballistic-missile defenses are effective and harden their electric power grids against EMP effects as soon as possible. The day of reckoning could come sooner than anyone in either country thinks.Mr. Cooper was the U.S. ambassador to the Defense and Space Talks during the Reagan administration and director of the Strategic Defense Initiative during the       George H.W.

It was declared a World Heritage site in 1984, and rightfully so: The building\u2019s interior is a stunning example of Moorish architecture.Yet this \u201cmosque\u201d is actually the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of C\u00f3rdoba. In 1236, King       Ferdinand III of Castile       captured C\u00f3rdoba from the Almohad Caliphate. He then had the building consecrated for Christian use. Or reconsecrated, rather, since underneath the mosque lay the demolished remains of a sixth-century church built by Spain\u2019s Visigothic rulers before the Muslim invasion in 711. Today, Mass and confession are celebrated inside. The cathedral has been a Christian house of worship for centuries longer than it was an Islamic one.The discordance greeting tourists is the result of more than 200 years of antagonism toward the Catholic Church by left-leaning Spanish intellectuals. They have used the cathedral\u2019s unique architecture essentially to de-Christianize it in the name of restoring its historical Islamic roots. This secularist campaign began in the early 19th century but has gained new force in the past 20 years. Recent Islamic immigration to Spain has given the anticlerical leftists new allies\u2014Muslims demanding to worship in their \u201cGreat Mosque.\u201dBut that would require taking the building out of the Catholic Church\u2019s hands. In 2013 an organization called the Platform for the Mosque-Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba gathered more than 350,000 signatures on a petition calling for a public takeover. A year later, the Socialist-led coalition government of Spain\u2019s Andalusia region, which includes C\u00f3rdoba, accused the diocese of \u201chiding\u201d the building\u2019s history. In March the city council issued a report arguing that the diocese does not legally own the cathedral. \u201cReligious consecration is not the way to acquire property,\u201d it said. The site\u2019s true owners \u201care each and every citizen of the world from whatever epoch and regardless of people, nation, culture or race.\u201dThe diocese worries that the leftists may be about to get their way. To shore up support among American Catholics, the bishop of C\u00f3rdoba,       Demetrio Fern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez,        spoke Wednesday at a meeting sponsored by the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom. Outright expropriation by the local government \u201cwould be impossible,\u201d Bishop Fern\u00e1ndez told me before his speech. But, as a European Union report on the mosque controversy pointed out, Andalusian law would permit expropriation if a court determined the diocese had failed properly to maintain and conserve the property. The bishop added that he already has obtained the pope\u2019s support should a legal battle arise over ownership.Michele Lamprakos,        an architectural historian at the University of Maryland, makes clear in a 2016 article for the journal Aggregate that during the Reconquista the Christians didn\u2019t simply plunk their own religious paraphernalia into an Islamic structure. They worked carefully to transform and hybridize it, adding Gothic stonework and constructing a transept to make the building into a cruciform. They also carefully incorporated some of its Moorish features into their own plans. The interior seems Islamic today only because during the 19th century secular architects stripped away layers of Christian stylings.It has become fashionable on the left to romanticize Spain\u2019s Islamic past. The Catholics of the Reconquista are thought of as crude fanatics, whereas the caliphate is presented as a haven of tolerance and learning where Jews and Christians\u2014never mind their second-class status\u2014lived side-by-side with Muslims in happy convivencia.       Barack Obama       even cited Andalusia as an example of Islam\u2019s \u201cproud tradition of tolerance\u201d during his 2009 speech in Cairo.Spain\u2019s Islamic population has nearly doubled, to 1.9 million from around one million in 2007. Muslims, who now constitute about 4% of the country, mostly live along the Mediterranean, in Andalusia and Catalonia.They began lobbying in the early 2000s to treat the C\u00f3rdoba cathedral as a shared worship space. In 2010 two Muslim tourists, part of a larger group from Austria that had knelt on the cathedral floor, were arrested following a scuffle that seriously injured security guards trying to evict them. Muslim militants inside and outside Spain remain a solid constituency for the anti-Catholic left.The issue ultimately is one of religious freedom: Can a government confiscate the property of a church that has held it and cared for it for nearly 800 years? The answer will indicate where an increasingly secular Spain is headed. Anyone concerned for religious freedom should watch C\u00f3rdoba closely.Ms. Allen is the author of \u201cThe Human Christ: The Search for the Historical Jesus\u201d (Free Press, 1998).Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spanish-left-yearns-for-deconquista-1496960885", "news_title": "The Spanish Left Yearns for Deconquista", "keywords": "andalusia,cathedral of cordoba,cordoba,moor,spain,the great mosque of cordoba,architecture,art,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,islam,religion,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "At least 10 college-bound students found out this week that they won\u2019t be going to Harvard after all. The college rescinded its admissions offers after reviewing explicit and racist messages the students had traded on a private             Facebook                   page.The school\u2019s student newspaper, the Crimson, obtained screenshots of the chat and reported that it included \u201cmemes and other images mocking sexual assault, the Holocaust, and the deaths of children.\u201d One message \u201ccalled the hypothetical hanging of a Mexican child \u2018pi\u00f1ata time.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIt makes you wonder what these kids wrote in their application essays. Harvard\u2019s questions range from explaining \u201chow you hope to use your college education\u201d to saying \u201cwhat you would want your future college roommate to know about you.\u201d Jokes about the Holocaust or pedophilia probably didn\u2019t spring to mind.But that\u2019s the farcical application process. Admissions officers, after reading all the 500-word essays, the heartfelt recommendations from teachers, the interviews with loyal alumni, know exactly what students want them to know. SAT scores are more objective, but testing plays a smaller role in admissions than it used to.In a 2015       Kaplan       survey, 40% of admissions officers at top colleges said that they check applicants\u2019 social-media accounts. Let\u2019s stipulate, too, that other elite schools would probably have had the same reaction\u2014rescinding admission\u2014upon discovering a similar Facebook group.Still, Harvard\u2019s deeper hypocrisy is that the school claims a commitment to \u201cthe transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education\u201d yet apparently sees real limits to that power. Who needs transforming more than a callow 18-year-old with a sick sense of humor, running his mouth on the internet?

It is unlikely to become law because it isn\u2019t expected to earn sufficient support to advance in the Senate.Aspects of the plan, dubbed the Financial Choice Act, could be approved by Congress in smaller pieces or be implemented by the       Trump       administration. Those officials, however, have laid out a more modest agenda. They are expected to release a report next week outlining the administration\u2019s financial regulatory goals.House Democrats unanimously opposed the plan but as the minority party were unable to stop its passage. One Republican\u2014Rep.       Walter Jones       of North Carolina\u2014broke rank in opposing the bill.(Separate subscription)Senators are working on their own regulatory rollback, which they hope to pass with support from at least some Democrats. The Senate is preoccupied with other priorities, such as health-care and tax overhauls, and it is unclear if or when it might take up a broad financial overhaul package.The House bill would unwind major parts of Dodd-Frank by relieving healthy banks of some regulatory requirements and forcing failing firms through bankruptcy rather than a liquidation process spearheaded by the regulators. It would subject new financial rules to cost-benefit analysis, boost penalties for financial wrongdoers, and repeal the Volcker rule restricting banks from speculative trading. Supporters of the plan say scrapping what they view as onerous regulatory requirements will ultimately help smaller businesses, allowing them to grow and create jobs.\u201cThe Choice Act reins in Dodd-Frank and delivers the regulatory relief these small banks so desperately need,\u201d House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) said during floor debate.The main trade-off embedded in the bill: Banks can win significant regulatory relief if they maintain a so-called leverage ratio of 10%, meaning they must fund every $100 of loans or investments with at least $10 of equity, as opposed to borrowed money such as deposits.Supporters say relying less on borrowed money makes banks more stable. Most big banks oppose the idea because they don\u2019t meet that standard today. The current requirement is about 5% for the biggest banks.Another target of the bill is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created by Dodd-Frank to write rules and examine financial-services firms for compliance with consumer protection policies. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling\u2019s (R., Texas) bill would eliminate the CFPB\u2019s supervisory and rule-writing functions, reducing it to an enforcement agency.Democrats generally support higher bank capital requirements, but say Mr. Hensarling\u2019s bill puts consumers at risk by cutting many other regulations. They oppose most changes to the consumer bureau, among other provisions in the bill.\u201cIt destroys nearly all of the important policies we put in place\u2026to prevent another financial crisis and protect consumers,\u201d said Rep.       Maxine Waters       (D., Calif.), referring to the Dodd-Frank law.In a move symbolic of their opposition, Democrats didn\u2019t offer amendments attempting to change to the GOP measure. A spokeswoman for the House Democratic leader, Rep.       Nancy Pelosi       of California, said the decision reflects Democrats\u2019 belief the House bill is \u201cfatally flawed.\u201dThe Trump administration issued a statement this week calling the bill \u201ca necessary and important step in moving financial reform legislation through the Congress.\u201dThe statement said the administration supports curbs on the CFPB, regulatory relief for well-capitalized banks, and regulatory cost-benefit analysis. But on other issues, the administration has signaled it is taking a less aggressive tack than the House plan.For instance, on the Volcker rule, only Congress can repeal it altogether. Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin,        unlike Mr. Hensarling, has said he supports keeping the rule in effect, though he is pushing financial regulators to make complying with it easier.White House National Economic Council Director       Gary Cohn,        a former top executive at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       has criticized a stricter leverage ratio by pointing out that it can curb the loans banks make.While the bill is unlikely to advance in the Senate, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) has said he would advance bills through his committee that have Democratic support. He is working with Sen.       Sherrod Brown       (D., Ohio) on separate legislation addressing parts of Dodd-Frank.The pair haven\u2019t announced any plan. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate so far have only been able to agree on relatively minor changes to Dodd-Frank.That means the Senate is unlikely to take up some of the more controversial provisions in House bill, according to a GOP Senate aide, such as the 10% leverage ratio for regulatory relief, reduced powers of the consumer bureau, and repealing the Orderly Liquidation Authority in Dodd-Frank for the government to unwind a failing financial firm.Mr. Crapo, in a written statement, congratulated Mr. Hensarling and said the bill \u201cmakes a positive move away from government micromanagement, and returns to basic principles of safety and soundness and market-driven principles.\u201dMr. Hensarling said he is looking for ways to push pieces of the plan through the Senate without Democratic support by attaching some measure to the annual budget bill, which passes on a majority vote. Some of those provisions include the Orderly Liquidation Authority measure, reducing the CFPB\u2019s powers and eliminating the Office of Financial Research, created to study financial risks.\u201cWe\u2019ll look for every opportunity to get as much of the Financial Choice Act on President Trump\u2019s desk as is possible,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.The banking industry praised the bill\u2019s passage, saying firms could release more credit to consumers without some of the regulatory burden of Dodd-Frank.\u201cToday\u2019s House vote is an important step toward making much-needed regulatory reforms that will allow banks to better serve their customers,\u201d American Bankers Association President Rob Nichols said.Consumer groups opposed the bill and said it would encourage the loose oversight standards that led to the financial crisis.\u201cThis legislation is the wrong choice for U.S. economic security,\u201d Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden said.\u2014Andrew Ackerman contributed to this article.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com and Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-set-to-pass-bill-rolling-back-wall-street-rules-1496914205", "news_title": "House Passes Bill Rolling Back Wall Street Rules", "keywords": " banking industry,bank regulations,cfpb,congress,consumer finance, consumer finance, consumer protections,dodd-frank, financial regulations, house of representatives,pe legal,politics,secuities regulations,senate,House Financial Services Committee,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,Mike Crapo,Jeb Hensarling,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,securities regulations,political,general news,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "What if all the painful drama over       Donald Trump       and       Mike Flynn       and       Hillary Clinton       and Russians wasn\u2019t really due to Donald Trump or Mike Flynn or Hillary Clinton or Russians? What if the national spectacle the country has endured comes down to one man,       James Comey      ?It was certainly all about the former FBI director on Thursday, as he testified to the nation via the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Comey didn\u2019t disappoint. He already had submitted pages of testimony detailing his every second with President Trump, complete with recollections of moments he felt \u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cuneasy\u201d or \u201cawkward.\u201d But on Thursday he went further, wowing the media with bold pronouncements: President Trump was a liar; the president fired him to undermine the Russia investigation; the president had directed him to back off Mr. Flynn.Mostly he pronounced on what is\u2014and is not\u2014proper in any given situation: when handling investigations, interacting with the president, or releasing information. By the end, something had become clear. Mr. Comey was not merely a player in the past year\u2019s palaver. He was the player.It was Mr. Comey who botched the investigation of Mrs. Clinton by appropriating the authority to exonerate and excoriate her publicly in an inappropriate press event, and then by reopening the probe right before the election. This gave Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters a reason to claim they\u2019d been robbed, which in turn stoked the \u201cresistance\u201d that has overrun U.S. politics.We now know it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Mr. Comey explained that he had lost faith in then-Attorney General       Loretta Lynch\u2019s       ability to handle the affair, in part because she had directed him to describe the probe in public as a \u201cmatter\u201d rather than an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d That one of President       Obama\u2019s       political appointees outright directed the head of the FBI to play down an investigation is far more scandalous than any accusation aired about Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said it gave him a \u201cqueasy\u201d feeling. But did he call on Ms. Lynch to recuse herself? Did he demand a special counsel? No. Mr. Comey instead complied with the request. Then he judged that the only proper way to clean up the mess was to flout all the normal FBI protocols. Vive la resistance.It was Mr. Comey who launched an investigation into Russian meddling last July and expanded it to look for possible collusion with the Trump campaign. That may well have been warranted. Yet before the election his FBI had leaked this to the press, casting an aura of illegitimacy on a new president and feeding conspiracy theories based on, in Mr. Comey\u2019s words, \u201cnonsense\u201d reporting.Mr. Comey could have spared us this by simply stating, as he acknowledged Thursday, that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t under investigation. One could argue he had a duty to explain, given that he\u2019d taken the unusual step of confirming the probe, and given the leaks from his FBI and the flood of fake news that resulted. But no. James Comey judged that (in this case, at least) it would be improper to speak out. So we\u2019ve had all Russia all the time.Moreover, it was Mr. Comey who had the discussions with President Trump that he now describes as compromising. On Thursday he claimed to have felt that Mr. Trump was directing him to end the Flynn investigation, even as he simultaneously admitted that Mr. Trump\u2019s words (\u201cI hope\u201d) expressed no such order. He said he had been deeply uncomfortable that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t following protocol for dealing with an FBI director.If Mr. Comey truly had believed the president was interfering, he had a duty to report it or to resign. Instead he maintained Thursday it wasn\u2019t his role to pronounce whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice. Really? This may count as the only time Mr. Comey suddenly didn\u2019t have an opinion on whether to render justice or to take things into his own hands.And why did he agree to dinner with Mr. Trump in the first place? Why keep accepting the president\u2019s phone calls? Asked whether he, in those early meetings, ever told the president how things ought to go, he said no. Mr. Comey did nothing to establish a relationship he felt was correct.Instead, he kept secret memos, something he\u2019d never done before. He wrote them in an unclassified manner, the better to make them public later. He allowed Mr. Trump to continue, while building up this dossier.When he was fired, he leaked to the media, through a \u201cclose friend,\u201d highly selective bits of his privileged communications with the president. And then he stayed silent and let the speculation rage. Thus, for the past month the nation has been mired in a new scandal, fueled by half-leaks. Thank you, yet again, Mr. Comey.Yes, Russia interfered. Yes, Mr. Trump damages himself with reckless words and tweets. Yes, the Hillary situation was tricky. Yet you have to ask: How remarkably different would the world look had Mr. Comey chosen to retire in, say, 2015 to focus on his golf game?

Didn\u2019t do it myself for a variety of reasons. I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201dMr. Richman, whose Columbia Law School biography describes him as an adviser to Mr. Comey, was the chief appellate attorney in the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office, where Mr. Comey was at one point the top federal prosecutor. The two men started working alongside each other there as line prosecutors in 1987, according to a spokesman for the office.Mr. Comey, when asked during his testimony why he didn\u2019t give the information to the media himself, said he was hounded by reporters, who at that point were \u201ccamping at the end of my driveway.\u201dHe said, \u201cI worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach, if it was I who gave it to the media.\u201d So, he added, \u201cI asked my friend, make sure this gets out.\u201dOn Thursday, Republicans and Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney sought to draw attention to what they described as Mr. Comey\u2019s improper actions regarding his memos and Mr. Richman.Mr. Trump\u2019s personal counsel, Marc Kasowitz, seized on Mr. Comey\u2019s directive to Mr. Richman, characterizing it as part of a broad pattern of \u201cselective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications\u201d from those within the government who \u201care actively attempting to undermine this administration.\u201d\u201cMr. Comey has now admitted that he is one of those leakers,\u201d Mr. Kasowitz told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington, where he read a lengthy statement and didn\u2019t take questions.\u201cWe will leave it to the appropriate authorities to determine whether these leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated,\u201d Mr. Kasowitz added.He disputed Mr. Comey\u2019s description of his interactions with the president during his testimony. Mr. Kasowitz didn\u2019t indicate that Mr. Trump has any recordings or other materials that could corroborate his own denials of having pressured Mr. Comey during a February meeting to end the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser       Mike Flynn,        who was fired for misleading Trump administration officials about his contacts with a Russian diplomat. That matter is now part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, allegations the Russian government denies.On Capitol Hill, Republicans criticized Mr. Comey for seeking to make public his private interactions with the president. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said he wanted to review the testimony further before making any conclusions, but was concerned that Mr. Comey asked a friend to share the contents of a memo about a meeting with Mr. Trump to a reporter.\u201cOne of the most disturbing patterns we have seen is the aggressive pattern of leaking from those seeking to undermine the White House,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cMany of those leaks have been criminal and it should concern everybody to see members of law enforcement and the intelligence community disregarding the criminal laws.\u201dSaid Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) said of Mr. Comey: \u201cThe way he was fired was really inappropriate, he deserved better than that. But you don\u2019t fix things [with] \u2018Hey buddy, will you leak this memo so we can get a special counsel?\u2019 That\u2019s not exactly the rule of law as I know it.\u201d\u2014Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'The \u2018Close Friend\u2019 Behind Memo Leak.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/comey-close-friend-gave-memos-about-trump-conversations-to-media-1496960064", "news_title": "Comey \u2018Close Friend\u2019 Gave Memos About Trump Conversations to Media", "keywords": " columbia professor, comey memos, donald trump,james comey, russia probe, senate intelligence committe,senate testimony,FBI,James Comey,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "The dollar rose Thursday as investors brushed off testimony from former FBI Director       James Comey,        while the British pound plunged in late trading after an early poll indicated Britain\u2019s ruling party may have lost its majority.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, edged up 0.1% to 88.21.

The proposals include a potential extension of maturities on some bailout loans by up to 15 or 17 years, according to several officials. But many analysts believe the deal signals the IMF may never rejoin the bailout with its own financing, cementing what has already been three years without the fund.Under the proposal, the fund will approve a bailout \u201cin principle.\u201d Actual IMF financing would be contingent on Athens\u2019s European creditors giving the fund clear assurances they will implement debt relief.Ostensibly, Europe could move ahead with its own financing without the IMF. But Germany wants the IMF on board because it has promised voters it won\u2019t give Athens any more cash without the fund to lend the program a measure of credibility. Without fresh financing, Greece risks default and a major market meltdown with bonds coming due in July. That could not only trigger another painful bout of painful economic and political turmoil for the country, but also set the country back on the path for a potential euro exit.The IMF contends that this half-in-half-out process is legal under its bylaws, pointing to the precedent set more than three decades ago.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a case here of breaching guidelines\u2026or bending or breaking rules,\u201d IMF spokesman       Gerry Rice       said Thursday. \u201cI would want to push back strongly against that notion.\u201dStill, the Greek case could arguably be said to infringe on many of the fund\u2019s most important guidelines established for the procedure several decades ago.Amid the debt crises of the early 1980s, the IMF\u2019s executive board started approving bailout programs \u201cin principle.\u201d Loans were released \u201conly after the Fund was satisfied that arrangements had been made for the financing of the uncovered gap in the member\u2019s balance of payments,\u201d according to IMF records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Rice said part of the precedent set in the 1980s was each program was unique in the terms of the approval in principle. But the fund believes the guidelines are now essentially defunct.\u201cThe guidelines are no longer applicable because they were used at a time when there was a particular set of dynamics that are no longer in place,\u201d Mr. Rice said. \u201cHowever, some of the underlying principles that led to the use of this procedure are relevant to this case.\u201dThe procedure came about mainly to break a deadlock created by creditors\u2019 insistence that debtor countries have an IMF program in place before they are granted debt relief.But the procedure still gave the IMF board cause for concern, so the fund crafted guidelines for its use. \u201cIt ought to be used cautiously and sparingly,\u201d       Nigel Wicks,        the U.K.\u2019s then representative to the executive board, said at the time.The fund said the primary intent of using the \u201capproval in principle\u201d practice was the help catalyze a debt-relief deal with creditors. The IMF cautioned that \u201cdue consideration would need to be given to whether in some cases this might reduce the pressure on creditors to come to an agreement.\u201dBut in Greece\u2019s case, the process is seen by analysts as weakening pressure on Germany to reach a debt-relief deal, buying time for Berlin ahead of its elections in September.According to leaked minutes of the last Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers in May, the IMF\u2019s Europe chief       Poul Thomsen       said there \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to be converging on a debt process.\u201d At the same meeting, another senior official said it wouldn\u2019t provide the clarity investors are seeking in a deal, which would mean Athens faced more market turmoil ahead.According to the IMF\u2019s protocol, programs approved in principle should lapse no more than 30 days after approval was given. If a viable program isn\u2019t in place by then, \u201cit should be withdrawn,\u201d Mr. Wicks said at a board meeting to approve the guidelines in 1984.And as a general rule, the fund said officials should establish a time period by which debt relief \u201cmust be secured.\u201d If the fund resorted to the procedure, the bulk of any loan disbursements would only be made available \u201cafter its financing has been firmly secured.\u201cG\u00fcnter Grosche,        an executive board member of the IMF in the 1980s, insisted at the same meeting that no approval should\u00a0be sought until management and staff \u201dwere reasonably certain that financing would be made available in the expected amounts.\u201dOfficials said they haven\u2019t discussed how long this arrangement with Greece and its creditors will stay in place. If the fund moves ahead with this plan, as all signs indicate it will, there is no apparent timetable for securing debt relief. Still, senior officials involved in the talks say they hope the fund will be able to have assurances that will allow it to disburse money before the end of the program.\u201cDebt relief does not need to be fully specified up front, but we do need assurances that the debt relief measures are specific enough\u2026to deliver debt sustainability,\u201d Mr. Rice said.Mujtaba Rahman,        Eurasia\u2019 Group\u2019s managing director overseeing Europe, says the IMF will most likely never join the Greek bailout as a lender again.\u201cIf the IMF fails to fully join the Greek bailout by mid-July and endorse the program only in principle, there is no reason why it will have any incentive to do so after German elections and before the conclusion of the Greek bailout in August next year,\u201d Mr. Rahman said in a client note.\u00a0\u201cEurogroup language will suggest IMF is still in, but in practice, it\u2019s out.\u201dGiven the risks, the fund used the procedure sparingly in the 1980s, including for Sudan, Kenya, Mexico and Argentina. But it soon fell out of use as official and commercial creditors began to signal debt relief at the outset of bailout programs.It isn\u2019t the first time the IMF resorted to unorthodox tactics to keep Greece from going under. The fund was forced to change its lending rules to legally move forward with its highly-criticized original 2010 Greek bailout because of both the record loan amounts and that officials couldn\u2019t say with confidence the country would be able to pay its debts. The board has since closed that loophole over worries that it put IMF resources at risk.Just as that 2010 move marred the IMF\u2019s credibility, some economists say this one could too.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 18:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-bailout-deal-could-leave-imfs-role-in-limbo-1496928736", "news_title": "Greece\u2019s Bailout Deal Could Leave IMF\u2019s Role in Limbo ", "keywords": " christine lagarde, ecb, european union,greece, greek bailout, greek debt relief, imf, troika, tspiras,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "DOHA, Qatar\u2014When Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and several other Arab states severed ties with tiny Qatar, Rashed al Jalahma and thousands like him were pulled into the Persian Gulf\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.A resident of Qatar who holds a Bahraini passport, the 21-year-old faces the prospect of being separated from his Qatari mother and uprooted from this lifelong home, the Qatari capital of Doha. That\u2019s because Bahrain joined the coordinated effort to isolate Qatar over its alleged link to extremist groups and disagreements on foreign policy. As a result, the rupture in diplomatic ties\u2014and the blocking of direct land, sea and air routes with Qatar\u2014has wreaked havoc with families of mixed nationalities and torn allegiances.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Bahrain because I don\u2019t know Bahrain,\u201d says Mr. al Jalahma, who is training as an engineer with Qatar Airways, the national carrier.Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain also ordered the expulsion of Qataris from their countries, and gave their own citizens two weeks to leave Qatar without facing penalties. Those ultimatums have caused panic among thousands of people on the wrong side of the border.They include some 6,500 mixed families, according to figures provided by Qatar\u2019s government, whose members now face the choice of defying their government\u2019s orders or abandoning their families.Qatar\u2019s National Human Rights Committee said that is has so far received over 400 appeals for help from Qatari and non-Qataris who were directly affected by the new restrictions imposed by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the U.A.E. Thousands will have to quit their job and interrupt their studies.\u201cIt\u2019s a shock for all of us in the Arab region. How can I be separated from my children? says Wafa al Jazeedi, the Qatari mother of Mr. al Jalahma, the 21-year-kold Bahraini. \u201cMe as a mother I\u2019m thinking: what shall I do?\u201dAfter she divorced her estranged Bahraini husband in 1999, she raised her two daughters and a son on her own in Qatar. Her son says he would rather give up his Bahraini citizenship than be forced to leave Qatar now.In Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, children get their citizenship from their fathers, not their mothers. Ms. al Jazeedi says she has received assurance from Qatari authorities that her children will be able to stay in the country. But it\u2019s unclear if they will eventually be eligible to receive a Qatari passport.Qatari officials say the government is appealing to human-rights organizations and the United Nations to help address and resolve the simmering humanitarian fallout of the dispute.\u201cWhat\u2019s really hurting here is the families,\u201d Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, told reporters in Doha on Thursday. He said the dispute is currently preventing Qataris from going on pilgrimage to the holy Muslim city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh earlier said the diplomatic rupture wouldn\u2019t stop Qataris from going on religious pilgrimage.In justifying the measures taken against Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and other Arab countries including Egypt cited Qatar\u2019s alleged links to extremism, which Doha denies, its conciliatory stance toward Iran and its support of Islamist groups like Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas of the Palestinian territories, whose members have a presence in Qatar.The panic that immediately followed the diplomatic breakdown has since turned to deep unease. When the diplomatic break first occurred, residents of Doha rushed to supermarkets to stock up on frozen goods and water.Sheikh Mohammed added the government can guarantee the supply of food and other products \u201cforever\u201d and that only 16% of food previously came overland from Saudi Arabia, a border that is now closed.The Arab countries opposing Qatar have blocked access to Qatari media including Al Jazeera from within their borders. The U.A.E. and Bahrain have also criminalized expressions of\u00a0 support for Qatar in the press or on social media platforms.Many in the Gulf have criticized the new restrictions because of their impact on residents.\u201cTo have such an aggressive action is against logic. What about Qatari women married to Saudi men and Saudi women married to Qatari men?\u201d said a Saudi citizen who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. \u201cIt is sad that we are punishing the people of Qatar.\u201dResidents of Oman and Kuwait\u2014the two Gulf countries that are trying to act as mediators in the spat\u2014expressed sympathy toward Qatar on social media.\u201cBody here, soul in Qatar,\u201d said one             Twitter                   user from Kuwait. \u201cPolitics will never change our love.\u201d\u2014Nicolas Parasie in Dubai and Dahlia Kholaif in Cairo contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Gulf Rift Takes Toll On Mixed Families.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 17:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-crisis-takes-toll-on-families-caught-between-countries-1496958822", "news_title": "Qatar Crisis Takes Toll on Families Caught Between Countries", "keywords": "qatar crisis,qatar rift,Qatar Airways,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Hudson\u2019s Bay Co.

During that meeting, according to Mr. Comey, the president mentioned the probe into Mr. Flynn and expressed hope the FBI director could \u201clet this go.\u201d\u201cI understood him to be saying that what he wanted to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn\u2019s account of his conversation with the Russians,\u201d Mr. Comey said. The former FBI director said he would leave it to special counsel Robert Mueller to determine whether the exchange amounted to obstruction of justice by the president.Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said the president never suggested Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including Mr. Flynn. Mr. Kasowitz said in a statement that the president \u201cnever pressured Mr. Comey.\u201dMr. Flynn\u2019s conversations with Russian Ambassador       Sergei Kislyak       during the transition came under scrutiny from federal investigators before the inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence, relying on Mr. Flynn\u2019s assertions, said on television Jan. 15 that Mr. Flynn hadn\u2019t discussed sanctions during those interactions when, in fact, he had done so, according to law enforcement and intelligence officials.Then-Acting Attorney General       Sally Yates       warned the White House on Jan. 26 that Mr. Flynn was misleading his fellow officials about the conversations after seeing Mr. Pence and others make false statements about the interactions, she has testified. She said she believed this potentially exposed Mr. Flynn to blackmail. Mr. Flynn was fired from the White House on Feb. 13, nearly three weeks after Ms. Yates\u2019s meeting with the White House counsel.During Thursday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Comey was asked if it was correct the FBI was investigating whether Mr. Flynn misled the vice president and others at the time of the Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump.\u201cCorrect,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to go into the details, but whether there were false statements made to government investigators as well.\u201dRobert Kelner, Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyer, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.It wasn\u2019t clear from Mr. Comey\u2019s statements whether the FBI is still investigating whether Mr. Flynn lied to government investigators. A spokesman for the FBI declined to comment.\u201cGen. Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cThere was an open FBI criminal investigation of his statements in connection with the Russian contacts and the contacts themselves.\u201dFederal law prohibits people from knowingly and willfully making false statements to government agents. It\u2019s a commonly prosecuted criminal statute that generally carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. Sentencing guidelines for defendants in good standing, however, could recommend as little as zero to six months in prison.Federal investigators are also looking at whether Mr. Flynn violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by carrying out work benefiting the Turkish government without properly disclosing the arrangement to the Department of Justice, people familiar with the case have said.\u2014Byron Tau contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'FBI Probed Whether Flynn Lied to Investigators.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 17:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-has-probed-whether-flynn-lied-to-investigators-1496958451", "news_title": "U.S. Has Probed Whether Flynn Lied to Investigators ", "keywords": "fbi investigation,flynn investigation,flynn probe,Federal Bureau of Investigation,James Comey,Mike Flynn,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The British pound slumped after an exit poll projected that Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative Party may have failed to retain its parliamentary voting majority in the U.K.\u2019s general election.The pound, which traded near $1.2950 just before the poll came out, fell swiftly and was trading near $1.2754 in the minutes after, a drop of 1.5%.Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       Conservative Party will remain the largest party in Parliament, the exit poll showed, but if it doesn\u2019t\u00a0retain enough seats to control the 650-seat legislature, the political parties will have to cobble together a government. That could complicate the already-difficult negotiations between Britain and the European Union over the U.K.\u2019s departure.\u201cSterling looks like it\u2019s a on a fairly precipitous decline already,\u201d said       James Athey,        portfolio manager at             Aberdeen Asset Management.       \u201cThe prospect of a hung Parliament will just complicate Brexit negotiations.\u201dSome investors, though, say that a minority, or coalition, government could eventually boost the pound.

Earlier Thursday, it stood at between 1 and 12 percentage points, depending on the pollster, down from 20 points or more at the start of the campaign.The recent sharp reduction in the Conservatives\u2019 lead, poor past reliability of voters\u2019 surveys and uncertainty about turnout rates all conspire to \u201cmake this election tricky to call,\u201d said       Kallum Pickering,        senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank in London. He had put the probability of the Conservatives winning an increased majority\u2014the most likely scenario according to his projection\u2014at 35%.The Conservatives looked likely to pick up a majority of the nearly 4 million votes\u201412.6% of the total\u2014cast for the anti-EU UK Independence Party in the 2015 election. UKIP\u2019s support has shrunk since last year\u2019s Brexit referendum and stands at about 4%. A recent survey by Opinium Research LLP had showed that 49% of past UKIP voters were now supporting the Conservatives, with only 13% switching to Labour.Mrs. May called the snap election in April, seeking to strengthen her party\u2019s thin parliamentary majority ahead of the Brexit talks, which formally began in March and are due to last at least two years.The campaign\u2019s initial focus on Brexit was seen to likely favor the incumbent. Mrs. May, who had campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the EU, has laid out plans for a clean break with the bloc, which would see it leave the European single market to gain tighter control of immigration, an important issue for many British voters.She offered what she repeatedly described as \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership in contrast to what she depicted as \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d under Mr. Corbyn.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party said it would prioritize retaining the benefits of the single market and maintaining closer links to the EU, hinting at a softer approach to the talks. But with the party\u2019s loyalty split between young, urban voters, who largely backed remaining in the bloc, and voters in Labour\u2019s traditional working-class strongholds, who overwhelmingly favored Brexit, the party struggled to challenge Mrs. May on the issue. It had more success in reaching wavering voters weary of years of Conservative belt-tightening with a populist platform that included nationalizing railways, free child care and free college tuition. These pledges\u2014and the contrast between Mr. Corbyn\u2019s relaxed campaigning style and Mrs. May\u2019s stiff appearances on the stump\u2014helped Labour narrow the gap in opinion polls during the six-week race.Casting his vote at a polling station in Greenwich, southeast London, Jeffrey Brown, 28, said that though he voted to remain \u201cBrexit means Brexit now.\u201dIn Mr. Corbyn\u2019s constituency in North London, Anne Lambourne, said that before the campaign he didn\u2019t appear to be a statesman. \u201cPeople liked to take the mickey out of him, but they can\u2019t take the mickey out of him now,\u201d she said.As terrorism came to the fore in the campaign, the Conservatives, generally regarded as the law-and-order party, didn\u2019t seem to gain. While Mr. Corbyn\u2019s past links to members of the Irish Republican Army and hard-line Islamic groups were criticized, Labour emphasized the cuts in police numbers while Mrs. May was Home Secretary and responsible for policing from 2010 to 2016.British police said they have reviewed security around polling stations in light of the recent terror attacks.In London, the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service said every London borough will have a specialist policing operation protecting voters and a \u201cspecialist and highly-flexible\u201d force ready to respond if needed.The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, which represents senior law-enforcement officers, said the threat from terrorism remains \u201csevere\u201d\u2014the fourth rung of a five-rung scale.Police investigating the London car-and-knife attack said they had arrested three men in east London late Wednesday. Separately, counterrorism police detained three other men in east London on suspicion of terror-related offenses. Those arrests weren\u2019t connected to the attack.Pollsters say the significant discrepancies between their projections stem from varying assumptions on turnout, which might prove critical to the result.Both parties could face a significant challenge in getting their supporters out to one of the 41,000 polling stations. Conservative voters could see the election as a foregone conclusion and not bother to vote. The Labour Party enjoys strong backing among under 25-year-olds, a group that is traditionally the least likely to vote.\u2014Jason Douglas, Denise Roland and Jenny Gross contributed to this article.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 17:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-election-remains-tight-as-voters-head-to-the-polls-1496901600", "news_title": "U.K. Election Exit Poll Shows No Party Has Overall Majority ", "keywords": "brexit,british politics,conservative party,general election 2017,jeremy corbyn,labour party,london terror attack,manchester terror attack,theresa may,u.k. election,u.k. politics,uk general election 2017,ukip,Jeremy Corbyn,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,surveys,polls"}, {"content": "The mayor of Jersey City plans to fire police officers shown on video allegedly kicking and dragging a bystander injured during a car chase, and said officials might file criminal charges.\u201cOnce we clearly identify all the officers involved we will be seeking termination in addition to any possible criminal penalties in appropriate cases,\u201d       Jennifer Morrill,        a spokeswoman for Mayor       Steven Fulop,        said in a written statement.At about 11 p.m. on Sunday officers were trying to stop 48-year-old       Leo C.

Gradually, and then suddenly.\u201dIn one way the swift execution of Popular was a successful first test of Europe\u2019s new bank-failure regime, and the risky bonds that underlie it. Taxpayers didn\u2019t pay a penny, there was no contagion to other banks and Spain\u2019s sixth-largest bank opened its doors as usual on Wednesday morning.In another way it was a complete flop, showing the perils to investors of relying on overengineered financial products. Popular was the first failure of a bank with contingent convertible bonds, supposed to provide a private-sector rescue by converting into equity when capital falls below a specified level (in Popular\u2019s case, one CoCo had a relatively high trigger at 7% of risk-weighted assets). The extra capital is meant to keep the bank functioning on its own, avoiding the need for painful bankruptcy or resolution procedures.Instead of converting the \u20ac1.25 billion ($1.4 billion) of CoCos into shares, they were simply zeroed by the regulator, along with the shares, while another \u20ac1 billion of junior debt was turned into equity and sold for a symbolic \u20ac1 to             Banco Santander.        SAN -1.06%       Conveniently, this extra capital exactly matched the regulator\u2019s new assessment of the shortfall, meaning senior debt and deposits were untouched.The process suggests that investors might as well not bother reading the long and turgid CoCo prospectuses, and that time spent building complex models of the options embedded within a CoCo is wasted. If the regulator decides the bank is bust, the CoCo is worthless; the rest of the time it trades like normal junior debt.CoCos are more like an insurance industry catastrophe bond linked to unpredictable hurricane damage than they are like ordinary corporate convertible bonds. Investors analyze the political and regulatory winds, but like weather forecasts, their reliability is limited. This unpredictability ought to make the bonds look more risky.\u201cThey [CoCos] are priced way too tight,\u201d says       Brad Golding,        who runs a fund investing in bank bonds and stocks at hedge fund Christofferson Robb & Co. \u201cHow do you price the non-modellable risk of a regulator coming to your door the moment something looks weird?\u201dPopular suffered a disastrous bank run in its final days, even as it was trying to sell itself to bolster capital. A newly formed post-crisis regulator called the Single Resolution Board said those conditions forced it to act fast.The rest of the CoCo sector was unperturbed by the Popular loss, to the surprise of those caught up in the brief panic a year ago around             Deutsche Bank\u2019s       CoCos.One investor who lost money on Popular said everyone knew there were problems, but thought the bank would manage to raise capital. The lesson? \u201cAs soon as you get the first whiff of a problem you should get out as quickly as you can.\u201dPart of the reason is that CoCos haven\u2019t worked. In a bank crisis a collapse in bond prices can be both an indicator of trouble and self-fulfilling, as it shows the bank cannot tap markets for more capital.\u201cWhen a bond really starts to trade down it\u2019s a signal to regulators that the market doesn\u2019t believe in that institution, and if the market doesn\u2019t believe in that institution, then it\u2019s not viable,\u201d said       Piers Ronan,        head of financial institutions debt syndicate at             Credit Suisse.This nasty cycle was one reason for the creation of CoCos, but they can provide such a thin sliver of new capital to a bank that they would make little difference.CoCos are still one of the few places investors desperate for yield can find something\u2014but dramatically less than a year ago. One of             Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria\u2019s       CoCos yielded 16% last June, but now offers 6%, and many European CoCos yield 4% to 5%. With junk bonds yielding even less, this might attract some buyers. But the speed with which Popular\u2019s junior bonds went from the hospital to the graveyard should be a handy reminder of the risk these CoCos bring.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 17:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-the-hunt-for-yield-turns-sour-this-is-what-it-looks-like-1496945375", "news_title": "When the Hunt for Yield Turns Sour, This Is What It Looks Like ", "keywords": "coco, contingent convertible bond,Banco Popular Espanol ,POP.MC,Banco Santander S.A.,SAN,Brad Golding,Piers Ronan,regulation,government policy,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       will host India\u2019s Prime Minister       Narendra Modi       in Washington later in June, the State Department said Thursday.\u201cWe look forward to having the prime minister here in Washington,\u201d spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

VZ 0.21%       completes its acquisition of Yahoo and combines the two onetime internet rivals, a person familiar with the matter said.The coming layoffs, which affect roughly 15% of the roughly 14,000 people in the combined workforce, will occur evenly across AOL and Yahoo to reduce duplication and streamline the organization, the person said. Employees in product and engineering roles will be the least affected, the person said.Yahoo shareholders approved the $4.5 billion transaction Thursday and it is expected to close on June 13.Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has led Yahoo for the past five years, is widely expected to leave the company after the deal closes but hasn\u2019t confirmed her plans. She made no remarks and took no questions during a special meeting held in Santa Clara, Calif., Thursday, a Yahoo spokeswoman said.Shareholders also approved compensation packages for Ms. Mayer and other executives tied to the deal. Ms. Mayer could reap more than $220 million in connection to the sale, up from the $187 million estimated in April due a rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price. Yahoo shares gained 10% to $55.71 on Thursday, following a 13% surge in shares of             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       in which Yahoo still owns a stake.The Yahoo purchase and the pending layoffs will help bring closure to a drawn-out deal process that has damped morale at the internet pioneer, which commanded a market value of more than $125 billion at the height of the dot-com boom in early 2000.Verizon initially agreed in July 2016 to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business for $4.83 billion. Then Yahoo disclosed two large security breaches, one in 2014 that hit more than 500 million accounts and another in 2013 that affected more than one billion accounts. The security incidents forced Yahoo back to the negotiating table, and the two sides agreed to lop off $350 million from the price.AOL CEO       Tim Armstrong       will lead the combined company under Verizon\u2019s new businesses unit, which is overseen by Verizon\u2019s       Marni Walden.       The digital media operation will be known as Oath, but the Yahoo and AOL brands won\u2019t go away.\u201cConsistent with what we have said since the deal was announced, we will be aligning our global organization to the strategy,\u201d AOL wrote in a statement. \u201cOath\u2019s strategy is to lead the global brand space. With access to over one billion consumers upon close, we will be positioned to drive one of the most important platforms in the consumer brand space.\u201dThe transaction brings Yahoo\u2019s core internet business and millions of users from Yahoo sites like Finance, Sports and News into Verizon\u2019s expanding portfolio of online content. Verizon\u2019s current assets include Huffington Post and TechCrunch, which it acquired in its AOL deal.Late last year, New York-based AOL laid off several hundred workers to prepare for the merger.

That means they must fund every $100 of loans or investments with at least $10 of equity raised from investors, as opposed to borrowed money such as deposits.

Paul LePage       to potentially lengthen the state\u2019s decadeslong, informal moratorium on digging for metals.The new rules, sponsored by a Democratic state senator, require mining companies to set aside money for at least a century to cover cleanup after a mine shuts to limit future taxpayer liability. It also includes strict rules for handling waste and bans open-pit mining.The restrictions passed with bipartisan support and won cheers from environmentalists who sought to protect the state\u2019s woodsy, sparsely populated northern wilderness. Nick Bennett, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources Council of Maine, called the new law a victory for the state, with strong protections \u201cso that if mining companies come here, they do it right.\u201dBut the Republican governor said the restrictions would put the state at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cThis bill will deter any company from mining in Maine, and it will discourage exploration of our mineral deposits because this bill would make them undevelopable,\u201d Mr. LePage had said in his June 2 veto message.Lawmakers overrode the mining veto Wednesday with a unanimous vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and a 122-21 vote in the Democratic-controlled House.This is the latest clash between lawmakers and the governor, who has vetoed at least 460 bills since taking office in 2011, according to data from the nonpartisan Maine State Law and Legislative Reference Library. Nearly half of the vetoes have been overridden.Maine lawmakers have been grappling for years over bills and rules that could determine whether any new mines are dug. Maine has deposits of metals like copper, zinc, gold and silver, but the state\u2019s last metallic-mineral mine closed in 1977.In a press release, state Senate Democrats highlighted a former open-pit mine, which closed in 1972 and became a federal Superfund site with ongoing cleanup, as an example highlighting the need for tough restrictions.Mining proponents have blamed regulations dating back to 1991 for hindering the industry. In 2012, the GOP-controlled legislature enacted changes with a law that directed state regulators to replace those rules. But the changes required even more legislative signoff, and lawmakers wound up rejecting the rules twice following changes in the legislature.State records show closely held J.D.

Ostapenko, ranked No. 47 and from Latvia, ended the match with her 50th winner, 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-3. The victory came on her 20th birthday.

Only weeks ago analysts and traders broadly expected a steady march higher toward $60 a barrel because of output cuts from the world\u2019s biggest exporters. But U.S. inventories have barely responded to that, holding near to record highs and spreading a fear that even $50 may be too high a price for crude.Thursday\u2019s losses added just slightly to Wednesday\u2019s, which were the steepest in three months. U.S. government data Wednesday showed stockpiles unexpectedly growing again after a long stretch of drawdowns. The market did briefly rebound Thursday\u2014likely from bearish traders closing out profitable bets\u2014but its swift retreat again may demonstrate bloated stockpiles are still the dominant factor waylaying the rally many expected.Light, sweet crude for July settled down 8 cents, or 0.2%, at $45.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent lost 20 cents, or 0.4%, to $47.86 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.Both have felt the pressure from repeated losing streaks this spring, with U.S. crude now at its second-lowest settlement of the year and Brent falling to its lowest since Nov. 29. U.S. crude has lost ground in eight of 11 sessions, and Brent in seven of eight. Both are now down more than 15% year to date.Prices had climbed well above $50 earlier this year based on expectations that cutbacks from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters would cause supply declines. And while some data firms have charted falling stockpiles around the world, that decline has not been as severe in the U.S., the world\u2019s biggest consumer. Production there has also rebounded back toward record highs.\u201cAfter a while you just can\u2019t argue with the numbers that show up in production and storage,\u201d said       J. Alexander Blackman,        an executive at Standard Delta Co., a trading company based in Houston. \u201cPrices are (now) being dictated by supply and demand instead of headlines on OPEC policy.\u201dMost of the latest fall came Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stocks rose 3.3 million barrels last week, deepening concerns that the OPEC cuts aren\u2019t effectively reducing the glut of oil that has suppressed prices for over two years.\u201cThere is some general doubt regarding the success of OPEC,\u201d said Olivier Jakob at Switzerland-based consultancy Petromatrix. Mr. Jakob said that this is usually the tightest time of year in terms of strong demand, along with lower supply from Saudi Arabia due to seasonal factors, therefore U.S. stocks weren\u2019t expected to build.One problem for OPEC is that their announcement last year initially led prices above $50 a barrel, which benefited U.S. shale producers, who are aggressively expanding their operations and raising their oil exports. Though last week\u2019s daily crude production ebbed from the previous week, when it reached the highest level since August 2015, it remained above 9.3 million barrels.\u201cOil prices are likely to remain range bound with OPEC providing support for prices and U.S. production growth limiting potential price gains,\u201d said       Rob Haworth,        investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.Gasoline futures gained 0.61 cent, or 0.4%, to $1.4223 a gallon.

The proposed budget also calls for 300 new federal prosecutors and 75 new immigration judges.The budget doesn\u2019t detail the costs of the prison growth, but it is expected to be a boon to private prison companies, which are stepping up lobbying efforts to win contracts to house thousands of new inmates and immigrant detainees.Earlier this year, Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       overturned a decision by the Obama administration to phase out contracts with for-profit prison operators after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general concluded private prisons were more dangerous than government-run facilities. Private prison companies disputed those findings, and federal officials say they have improved oversight of contract facilities.About 19% of federal inmates are in private prisons or re-entry centers, a proportion industry analysts say will increase because contractors have more beds available than federal facilities. Government-run prisons are running 14% above their official capacity, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\u201cThis is an opportunity for private prisons, absolutely,\u201d said       Michael Kodesch,        an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, a financial-services firm.The anticipated increase in the federal-prison population contrasts with a growing bipartisan movement to reduce the number of people behind bars. After decades of tough-on-crime laws led to crowded and costly prisons, many states are reconsidering the long, mandatory-minimum sentences that critics say disproportionately affect minorities and fail to improve public safety.In Louisiana, which imprisons more residents per capita than any other state and also has the highest murder rate, the Republican-led Legislature this week approved a sweeping criminal-justice overhaul that will reduce sentences for a range of crimes and expand parole, probation and other alternatives to prison for nonviolent offenders.Mr. Sessions argues that long sentences helped cut crime and that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies are in part responsible for the recent increase in violent crime in some cities.Last month, Mr. Sessions scuttled an Obama administration policy to avoid mandatory-minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, ordering federal prosecutors to charge \u201cthe most serious readily provable offense.\u201dSome of his former Senate colleagues are pushing back. \u201cThe department\u2019s new policy ignored the growing bipartisan view that federal sentencing laws are in grave need of reform,\u201d said a letter to Mr. Sessions this week from Republicans       Mike Lee       of Utah and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky and Democrats       Richard Durbin       of Illinois and       Cory Booker       of New Jersey. \u201cIn many cases, the new policy will result in counterproductive sentences that do nothing to make the public safer.\u2019\u2019Mr. Obama was the first president in decades to leave office with a smaller prison population than when he arrived. Thousands of prisoners were released following a 2014 decision by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent policy-making body, to reduce most drug-related sentences and apply the changes retroactively.Mr. Obama also granted clemency to 1,927 individuals, more than any other president since       Harry Truman.Those trends have been widely expected to reverse under President       Donald Trump,        who vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking during his campaign. Share prices for the two biggest private prison companies.             Geo Group Inc.       and CoreCivic, formerly known as             Corrections Corp. of America,       have roughly doubled since the election.In February, Geo Group added another lobbyist to its team of a half-dozen firms:       Brian Ballard,        a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign in Florida. Geo Group spent $390,000 on federal lobbying in the first three months of this year, nearly half of what it spent all of last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.In April, Geo Group landed a contract from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to build and run a $110 million, 1,000-bed detention facility in Texas.\u201cWe look forward to working with both the new administration and the new Congress in continuing our long-standing partnership with the federal government,\u201d said       Pablo Paez,        a spokesman for Geo Group.CoreCivic spent $220,000 on federal lobbying in the first three months of this year, compared with $1.1 million for all of last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Growth in Federal Prisoners Expected.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 16:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-prison-population-expected-to-grow-under-trump-1496953721", "news_title": "Federal Prison Population Expected to Grow Under Trump ", "keywords": "donald trump,jeff sessions,prison population,CoreCivic,CXW,GEO Group,GEO,Federal Bureau of Prisons,U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,U.S. Sentencing Commission,Center for Responsive Politics,Rand Paul,Barack Obama,Cory Booker,Pablo Paez,Brian Ballard,Jeff Sessions,Michael Kodesch,Mike Lee,Richard Durbin,Donald Trump,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,law enforcement,illegal immigration,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,prisons,prisoners,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "Westport, Conn.A year after his death, Peter Shaffer has receded into the shadows of forgotten fame. It scarcely seems possible that the playwright who gave us \u201cAmadeus\u201d and \u201cEquus,\u201d two of the biggest theatrical hits of the postwar era, should now be so ill-remembered on this side of the Atlantic, but it makes unhappy sense of a sort. Most of his plays are big machines that require large and costly casts to bring off, which makes them dicey for Broadway and riskier still for even the most ambitious regional theaters. In any case, his old-fashioned brand of serious middlebrow theater has fallen from favor: \u201cAmadeus\u201d and \u201cEquus\u201d are the only major plays by Mr. Shaffer ever to have been revived on Broadway, and neither revival was more than modestly successful. So it\u2019s great news that \u201cLettice and Lovage,\u201d Mr. Shaffer\u2019s last hit, is now being performed by Westport Country Playhouse. Written in 1987 as a vehicle for       Maggie Smith,        it\u2019s a chokingly funny farce enriched by a savory touch of seriousness, and Mark Lamos\u2019s smart staging never puts a foot wrong.Lettice and LovageWestport Country Playhouse, 25 Powers Court, Westport, Conn.  $30 and up, depending on availability, 203-227-4177/888-927-7529,  closes June 17In \u201cLettice and Lovage,\u201d we make the acquaintance of Charlotte (      Mia Dillon      ), an imperious bureaucrat whose shell of melancholy prissiness is smashed to bits when she makes the acquaintance of Lettice (Kandis Chappell), a splendidly flamboyant tour guide whose job it is to tell bored tourists about \u201cthe dullest house in England.\u201d Instead of sticking to the colorless story of Fustian House, Lettice starts rolling her own anecdotes, the wilder the better, and Charlotte, her supervisor, is forced to fire her. Naturally, the two women become friends, and this being a farce, their friendship soon attracts the attention of the police. I\u2019ll leave it at that, save to say that Charlotte profits no end from knowing the much-larger-than-life Lettice, who is (in Lettice\u2019s own words) \u201cthe absolute antithesis of the Mere.\u201dPart of what makes \u201cLettice and Lovage\u201d such a satisfying comedy is its underlying seriousness. In a way, it\u2019s a comic version of \u201cEquus,\u201d for both plays share a common theme: They\u2019re about deeply inhibited people who long to lead larger lives. Might Mr. Shaffer have had his own long-secret homosexuality in mind when he took up this subject? Or was he writing more generally about the paralyzingly self-conscious gentility of the English middle class of his youth? Whatever his motives, he employed his theme very, very well. \u201cLettice and Lovage\u201d ought to be much more widely known to American audiences, and this production, the first revival that I\u2019ve had occasion to review since I saw the play at Chicago\u2019s Court Theatre in 2006, is worthy in every way.The role of Lettice, created by Dame Maggie, is the plummiest of plum parts, and Ms. Chappell wears it like a perfectly tailored, fabulously elaborate period costume. It\u2019s pure pleasure to catch the loony glint in her eye as she elaborates with quick-rising implausibility on the dull history of Fustian House. Ms. Chappell was forced to step into the part a week before the show opened when the actor originally hired by Mr. Lamos fell ill, but you wouldn\u2019t have known it from her opening-night performance, which was totally assured. As for Ms. Dillon, she\u2019s nothing short of ideal as Charlotte, whom Lettice drags into the warm spotlight of emotional extravagance. For the smaller but pivotal role of Lettice\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Lamos offers a deluxe piece of casting: Paxton Whitehead, who played the part on Broadway, reprises it here, and does his usual masterly job of embodying stiff-upper-lip befuddlement.As for John Arnone\u2019s two sets, the Grand Hall of Fustian House and Lettice\u2019s cheap but fancifully decorated two-room basement flat in London, to call them Broadway-worthy would be understating the case. Indeed, one might say the same thing of the production as a whole, which Mr. Lamos has directed with his usual blend of theatrical flair and satisfying faithfulness to the author\u2019s wishes.

Trey Gowdy to be the next chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the powerful congressional panel charged with investigating waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government.Mr. Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, won the support of the Republican Steering Committee in a private meeting\u00a0on Thursday, clearing his path to become the next head of the committee probing President       Donald Trump\u2019s       dismissal last month of FBI director       James Comey       and the brief tenure and resignation of former national security adviser       Mike Flynn.The Steering Committee, which is dominated by members loyal to the GOP House leadership, assigns committee seats and leadership posts.

Four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, were killed in the attacks.Many Democrats alleged the committee was a political charade designed merely to uncover damaging information on former Secretary of State       Hillary Clinton,        the Democratic Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee.The committee\u2019s final report didn\u2019t fault Mrs. Clinton for the deaths.The current Oversight Committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, has said he would leave Congress at the end of the month to pursue opportunities in the private sector.\u201cTrey Gowdy possesses the experience and deep commitment to transparency and accountability necessary to be the House\u2019s next Oversight chairman.

Yields rise as bond prices fall.The ECB held interest-rate policy steady at its latest meeting. ECB President       Mario Draghi       gave a nod during a news conference to the improvement in the eurozone\u2019s economy, but downgraded the central bank\u2019s inflation forecasts for the next two years, a reason he believes that ultraloose monetary policy is still needed for economic recovery.Mr. Draghi said he is ready to add stimulus if the growth outlook worsens.The ECB\u2019s large monthly bond purchases have been playing an important role in pushing down global government bond yields to historically low levels. The latest reassurance that the ECB isn\u2019t ready to taper bond buying any time soon initially supported Treasury bond prices Thursday, with the 10-year yield falling to 2.178%.Selling soon resumed as Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments encouraged investors to buy riskier government bonds from various European countries, a sign some investors believe prices of that debt will get a bigger boost from the ECB\u2019s stimulus.Among the big winners were government bonds in Italy where the 10-year bond yield fell more than 0.1 percentage point Thursday, according to Tradeweb. The 10-year bond yield in Spain was down about 0.08 percentage point and the 10-year yield in Portugal was down 0.05 percentage point.The yield on the 10-year German bund, the benchmark for eurozone\u2019s debt markets, fell to 0.245% earlier but traded at 0.254% late Thursday, compared with 0.253% Wednesday.Lower German bund yields continue to make U.S. Treasury debt appealing to global investors in a low-yield world. This factor has reduced market expectations over a big rise in U.S. bond yields, encouraging some investors to buy when U.S. yields rise. The buying contributed to the 10-year Treasury yield\u2019s slide from this year\u2019s close high of 2.609% in March.Bill Merz,        director of fixed income at             U.S. Bancorp                   Wealth Management, said the ECB is taking \u201ca page from the playbook\u201d by the Federal Reserve. A \u201cslow and cautious manner\u201d in signaling policy shift reduces the threat of a big selloff in the bond market, he said.Central bank officials are mindful of the taper tantrum in the Treasury bond market during the summer of 2013. The 10-year Treasury rose sharply as comments from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke about a possible cut in bond buying caught investors off guard. Higher Treasury yields rippled into many other fixed-income markets, caused a record pace of outflows from bond funds and tightened financial conditions for the U.S. economy.Factors that contributed to higher Treasury yields Thursday: upbeat data out of China and Germany which sapped demand for haven assets. China\u2019s data showed improvement in both imports and exports, while industrial production in Germany beat economists\u2019 forecasts.The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.147% Tuesday, the lowest close since November, as investors parked cash in haven assets to hedge risks related to the ECB, former FBI Director       James Comey\u2019s       congressional testimony and the U.K. election.The yield ticked up Wednesday as anxiety pulled back. The release of Mr. Comey\u2019s prepared remarks Wednesday afternoon \u201cappeared to diminish risks for some of the worst outcomes for the Trump administration,\u201d said       Aaron Kohli,        interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony Thursday didn\u2019t move markets. Results of the U.K. elections are due after U.S. markets close.The Fed is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates again next week after similar moves in December and March. Some disappointing economic releases and signs of decelerating inflation are casting some doubt over the Fed\u2019s plan in raising rates beyond June.The prospect of a go-slow Fed has reduced investors\u2019 concerns about a big rise in long-term Treasury yields. This, coupled with slowing inflation, is encouraging investors to buy Treasurys. Since inflation chips away bonds\u2019 fixed returns over time, it is seen as a threat to long-term government debt.Matt Freund,        co-chief investment officer and head of fixed-income strategies at asset manager Calamos Investments, said the 10-year Treasury yield may end this year around where it traded Thursday.\u201cYou have stock valuation at very high level, inflation is easing, energy prices are rolling over and there is no follow through in terms of President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal agenda,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Freund. If these factors remain in place, a rise in Treasury yields would provide a buying opportunity, he said.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 16:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bonds-soften-after-rising-earlier-after-ecb-rate-news-1496933050", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Fall", "keywords": "bond yields,comey,ecb,european debt,fomc,government bonds,interest rates,investors,markets,monetary policy,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,European Central Bank,James Comey,Mario Draghi,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "There are reasons to worry about the strength of U.S. consumer spending. Debt isn\u2019t one of them.The Federal Reserve on Thursday released its detailed rundown of U.S. financial accounts. Its measure of household debt reached a record $14.6 trillion in the first quarter, about $500 billion more than in the third quarter of 2008, when the financial crisis got going, and $1.5 trillion above the postcrisis low.It is the kind of figure that, taken out of context, could lead you to bemoan how Americans are lining up at the debt trough again. But context is important.As a group, U.S. households made a lot more in the first quarter, and were worth a lot more, than when the crisis struck. Their after-tax income came to $14.3 trillion, at an annual rate, versus $11 trillion in the third quarter of 2008. Their net worth was $94.8 trillion in the third quarter, versus $60.4 trillion. As a result of the gains, households\u2019 debt-to-income and debt-to-asset ratios both ticked postcrisis lows.Mortgages are the main cause of decline. A drop in homeownership, a rise in defaults, more stringent lending terms and a weak housing market pushed mortgage debt levels sharply lower, and even now they are significantly below their 2008 peak. Some types of debt have filled the gap to an extent. Notably, separate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show student loan levels are up sharply. That is a reflection not just of rising tuitions, but an increase in the number of people pursuing postsecondary and graduate educations.On the other hand, credit-card debt remains low. The Fed reported on Wednesday that revolving credit outstanding (the bulk of which comes from credit cards) rose a scant 0.2% in April from March. That amounted to 7% of after-tax income versus 9.3% at the start of 2008 and 8.6% at the start of 2000. It counts as one of the clearest signs of how much more averse people are to taking on debt than they were in the precrisis days.They also seem pretty averse to boosting their spending, and there are reasons for that other than debt.It matters that a bigger share of people rent homes than before the crisis and that rising rents have been cutting into their ability to spend on other things. It matters that some things that once counted as discretionary purchases, like internet access and mobile telephone plans, are now pretty much essential to many Americans. It matters that the gains in wealth have mostly flowed to richer households, which have a lower propensity to boost spending. And it matters that despite the gains in employment, wages are going up slowly.People are being more careful about debt, and maybe they are being more careful for a reason.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 16:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-the-indebted-american-1496952823", "news_title": "The Myth of the Indebted American   ", "keywords": "american debt,credit card debt,heard on the street,us consumer spending,us household debt,economic performance,indicators,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,economic news,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "RIO DE JANEIRO\u2014Brazilian meat giant         JBS               is facing a backlash from its business partners after admitting to bribing nearly 2,000 politicians in exchange for subsidized financing that helped turn the company into the world\u2019s largest meatpacker.A slew of restaurants and supermarket chains in Brazil have either stopped purchasing JBS products or said they are considering doing so. Banks have tightened lending standards for the company. And the Brazilian state-controlled oil company, Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, canceled a natural-gas supply contract\u00a0Thursday\u00a0with a power plant owned by JBS\u2019s holding company, J&F Investimentos. Citing the violation of an antibribery clause, Petrobras said it seeks about $21 million in redress.The moves highlight the potential costs, beyond the record $3.14 billion in penalties that J&F Investimentos agreed pay Brazilian prosecutors last month, of fessing up to corruption. The settlement, which spared former JBS Chairman Joesley Batista and his brother, current Chief Executive       Wesley Batista,        from jail, sparked public outrage and prompted some JBS customers to take action.J&F said in a statement that the power plant was never a target of corruption investigations.In a Facebook post shared more than 10,000 times,             Domino\u2019s Pizza                   Brasil said on June 2 it would no longer use JBS products at its 184 shops. The pizza chain said its decision applied to grilled and shredded chicken.\u201cWe greatly value transparency and ethics along with all Domino\u2019s lovers,\u201d the company said, \u201cand we share the same sense of disgust when those values aren\u2019t taken into consideration.\u201dJBS said the quality of its products has never been in doubt and that the company\u2019s priorities are its clients, suppliers and employees.Sandwich-shop chain Subway, which has 2,161 stores in Brazil, said it is considering changing suppliers because of the scandal. Brazilian steakhouse chain Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, which has branches in the U.S., said it has stopped buying JBS products in Brazil \u201cout of respect for our clients.\u201d Brazilian press reported that       F\u00e1tima Bernardes,        a well-known television presenter, stopped doing commercials for JBS\u2019s Seara meat brand.Publicly traded companies that extend their codes of conduct to suppliers are also considering what actions, if any, to take.Wal-Mart,       whose U.S. grocery stores sell JBS brands, including             Pilgrim\u2019s Pride                   chicken, has a policy stating its suppliers \u201cmust not tolerate, permit or engage in bribery, corruption or unethical practices.\u201d Asked about the JBS scandal, a             Wal-Mart                   spokeswoman said the company is \u201cfollowing the JBS investigation closely.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s,       which JBS identifies as a \u201cglobal customer\u201d in its annual report, said it, too, is \u201cclosely monitoring the events\u201d and \u201creviewing the situation.\u201d French supermarket chain Carrefour, which has similar antibribery rules for suppliers, said it has requested \u201cclarifications\u201d regarding JBS.In a plea bargain released last month, the Batista brothers and other company executives told prosecutors they made roughly $150 million in payments to Brazilian politicians, including the country\u2019s current president,       Michel Temer,        and his two immediate predecessors. The three deny wrongdoing.The bribes helped JBS secure access to billions of dollars in loans and investments from state-owned Brazilian banks,\u00a0prosecutors said.\u00a0The company then used\u00a0that financing\u00a0to make dozens of major acquisitions at home and abroad, particularly in the U.S., according to JBS public filings.\u00a0JBS saw its revenues explode from $1.8 billion in 2006 to $49 billion last year, surpassed only by             Nestl\u00e9                   among global food companies,\u00a0according to data from FactSet.Mr. Temer lashed out at JBS in a televised statement after the Batista brothers\u2019 plea bargain sparked an investigation into possible corruption, obstruction of justice and criminal conspiracy by the president.That has sparked fears within JBS of retaliation, according to people close to the investigation. The Brazilian government directly controls state-owned banks             Banco do Brasil,       Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal and national development bank BNDES. The latter has been a particularly crucial partner for JBS, holding a 21.32% equity stake in the meatpacker.A person familiar with Banco do Brasil said the bank has adopted stricter lending standards for J&F, as it would do with \u201cany other client in such a situation.\u201d Additionally, according to a person close to the matter, representatives for JBS\u2019s holding company have complained about tougher rules from Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, which had no immediate comment.The government denied that it would retaliate against JBS.\u00a0\u201cThe banks will decide on interest on credit lines by following technical criteria,\u201d Mr. Temer\u2019s office said in a statement.Write to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Luciana Magalhaes at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Meatpacker JBS Alienates Some Customers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 16:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/business-partners-back-away-from-jbs-amid-bribery-scandal-1496952292", "news_title": "Business Partners Back Away From JBS Amid Bribery Scandal", "keywords": " brazil, bribery, corruption, grocery stores,jbs, michel temer, restaurants, stores, suppliers,J&F Investimentos,Nestle,Petrobras,PETR4.BR,PBR,JBS S/A Ord,BR:JBSS3,Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,McDonald's,MCD,Carrefour S.A.,FR:CA,Fogo de Chao,JBS,Joesley Batista,Wesley Batista,Michel Temer,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,retail,wholesale,food retailing,supermarkets,grocery stores,specialty stores,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,full-service restaurants,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,consumer goods,food products,integrated oil,gas,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.        TEVA -0.09%       will seek to overhaul its board by nominating four new directors, the latest step toward remaking the struggling drug company.Teva, the world\u2019s biggest seller of low-price generic drugs, will ask shareholders to approve the nominees at the company\u2019s annual meeting July 13, said Sol Barer, the board\u2019s chairman. The nominees would replace longtime board members who have decided to step aside or aren\u2019t seeking new terms.Three of the nominees would bring international drug-industry and financial experience to the Israel-based company, while the fourth is an Israeli venture-capitalist. Among their first orders of business would be picking a new chief executive.\u201cWe are evolving the board to meet new challenges both within Teva and the business\u201d of generic drugs, Dr. Barer said in an interview.The nominees include       Murray Goldberg,        former chief financial officer at             Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.      ;       Roberto Mignone,        managing partner of hedge fund Bridger Management LLC that specializes in health care; and       Perry Nissen,        a former GlaxoSmithKline PLC research-and-development official who now leads the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, Calif.The fourth nominee is       Chemi Peres,        managing partner of Israel\u2019s Pitango Venture Capital, which has invested in health care and information technology.They would replace       Ari Belldegrun,        who left the board in January;       Roger Abravanel,        who is resigning as of the annual meeting to support the board\u2019s makeover; and Ory Slonim, who is not standing for re-election.       Joseph Nitzani       will leave when his term ends in September.None of the nominees had a comment, a company spokeswoman said. In statements, Mr. Slonim said, \u201cI thought it would be better to allow the board to refresh\u201d with new members; Mr. Abravanel said that he will be involved in the company in the future, and he is \u201cproud to have been a board member\u201d; Mr. Nitzani said, \u201cI consider rotation as a significant value.\u201d Mr. Belldegrun had no comment.Teva is confronting challenges of its own as well as those besetting the entire generic-drug industry.Like other generic-drug makers, Teva faces a tough pricing environment and intensifying competition for copycat medicines that is squeezing their tight margins. The company must also deal with $32 billion in debt and a sprawling supply chain accumulated through acquisitions.And multiple-sclerosis therapy Copaxone, one of Teva\u2019s few brand-name drugs but a key source of sales and profit, is starting to lose patent protection in the U.S.The company has been trying for several years to effect an overhaul. In 2012, it hired       Jeremy Levin       from             Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.       to take the helm but he was forced out the next year during a dispute with the board over the direction to take the company.His replacement,       Erez Vigodman,        an Israeli who was familiar with the company from his time serving on its board but lacked a drug-industry background, stepped away from the company in February for undisclosed reasons. Longtime CFO       Eyal Desheh       is scheduled to leave June 30.Analysts and investors have been pressuring Teva to add more global industry experience to the board, so it can support executives to take the steps needed to restructure the company.Dr. Barer described the new board nominations as an effort to position Teva to make \u201ca lot of tough decisions.\u201d With the new members added, the board would be \u201cready for change\u201d and back up the next chief executive to \u201caggressively move Teva forward.\u201dThe board is interviewing candidates for chief executive, and the choice would likely be someone from outside Israel willing to live in the country and with global drug-industry experience. He declined to give a timetable for a decision, but said the search is the company\u2019s main priority.The board is also looking for a chief financial officer, but Dr. Barer said the next chief executive would pick the person.Write to Jonathan D.

But in the long shadow cast by Brexit and security concerns after three deadly terror attacks in as many months, neither party engaged in the sort of broad-strokes economic debate that has characterized recent national polls.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who like the U.S. Treasury secretary has broad responsibility for the economy, has played a minor role in the campaign, as has his Labour counterpart.Clouding the debate, corporate chiefs and economists have struggled to make forecasts about issues that could affect voters most\u2014for instance, the long-term path for inflation, interest rates, housing prices and the pound. Post-Brexit issues like immigration, trade and market access all will have big economic consequences, but they are subject to negotiations with the European Union after the election.\u201cI\u2019m looking at the bigger picture,\u201d said Sonia Chester, a 45-year-old doctor, leaving a voting station in south London. \u201cI think we are headed into a period of great uncertainty either way because of Brexit.\u201dSo, how is Britain doing economically? Not bad, but not great, either. Many economists, including at the Bank of England, the country\u2019s central bank, were forecasting a big, immediate economic hit should the U.K. vote to leave the EU. But in the months after the June 23 referendum, Britons kept shopping, and consumer and business sentiment stayed buoyant.The biggest economic impact of the vote was the sharp drop in the pound. It had climbed to around $1.50 at the time of the referendum, with polls predicting a \u201cremain\u201d vote. Now, it\u2019s trading around $1.29.That has been a two-edged sword. Manufacturers and exporters should see their products priced more competitively overseas, and profits brought home and translated into pounds will boost the bottom lines of internationally focused firms. The FTSE 100 index of British blue-chips is dominated by such companies and is up more than 17% since June 23, 2016.But those same companies will also pay more for ingredients and parts coming from outside the country. Meanwhile, everyday Britons are already paying more for imports like wine and electronic goods.         Unilever               PLC triggered a media frenzy in October when it bumped up prices of Marmite salty spread, Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Dove soap and other products by 10%, citing currency moves.After a period of outperforming its European peers, the U.K. is lagging behind this year. The economy grew at an annualized 0.7% for the first three months of 2017. That compares with 2.3% growth in the eurozone, the group of countries that use the euro, and 1.2% in the U.S.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said this week it expects the U.K. economy to grow by 1.6% this year and just 1% in 2018\u2014a slowdown from 1.8% recorded in last year. Inflation is expected to come in at 2.8% this year, compared with 0.6% last year. Wages won\u2019t keep up, the OECD projects, at 2.5%.With costs rising and wages stagnating, the Labour Party has campaigned on what it called uneven incomes between high- and low-paid workers. A campaign slogan promises action \u201cfor the many, not the few.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s manifesto, meanwhile, includes pledges to increase scrutiny of pricing decisions by utilities. She has also promised more openness on how much business leaders are paid and why.Polls have shown that voters continue to view the Conservative Party as a better steward of the economy but also that Labour has rolled out some of the more popular economic proposals this time around.

While their stock prices have surged since the presidential election in November, the companies have come under fire for what critics say is mistreatment of inmates.\u201cMorally, the industry wants to turn back the clock on years of progress on criminal justice, and we can\u2019t sit idly by and watch that happen,\u201d said Mr. Stringer, a Democrat. \u201cDivesting is simply the right thing to do, financially and morally.\u201dThe companies disputed Mr. Stringer\u2019s assertions.             The GEO Group                   said it rejected \u201cthe baseless claims that led to this misguided decision.\u201d The company said it had a record of providing high-quality services and treating people in its care with respect.A CoreCivic spokesman said the company helps keep communities safe and enrolls thousands of inmates a year in programs that help reduce recidivism. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that activists would advocate against those benefits without themselves providing any solutions to the serious challenges our corrections systems face,\u201d the spokesman said.A G4S spokesman said its prison business makes up less than 5% of its revenue. It doesn\u2019t run any prisons in the U.S.In 2015, about 126,000 state and federal prisoners were held in private facilities, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.An August 2016 report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general found for-profit facilities had more \u201csafety and security incidents\u201d than comparable government-run facilities. It cited events including riots and the death of a correction officer.Later that month, the Justice Department said it would phase out the use of private prisons because they compared poorly to government facilities.In February, Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       reversed this policy, saying for-profit prisons were needed to accommodate the inmate population. President       Donald Trump,        a Republican, has said private prisons seem \u201cto work a lot better.\u201dSince November, the stocks of such companies have soared. The share price of CoreCivic increased from $14.19 on\u00a0Nov. 8, election day, to about $30\u00a0on Thursday.Similarly, the GEO Group\u2019s stock increased from $15.92 on\u00a0Nov. 8\u00a0to about $30\u00a0on Thursday.The comptroller\u2019s office said there are risks to investing in for-profit prison companies. Practices like inmate abuse and increased violence can lead to lawsuits that result in high payouts, which make the companies less profitable and harm investors, the office said.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Pension Funds Exit Prison Companies.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 15:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-pension-funds-pull-out-of-private-prison-companies-1496951174", "news_title": "New York City Pension Funds Pull Out of Private Prison Companies", "keywords": "private prisons,GEO Group,GEO,CoreCivic,CXW,G4S,DE:GHN,Scott Stringer,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,divestments,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,politics,international relations,domestic politics,prisons,prisoners,elections,presidential elections,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,real estate investment trusts,consumer goods,real estate,construction,financial services,food products,investing,securities,specialty reits"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The National Institutes of Health said it would begin redirecting up to about $1.1 billion in research-grant money a year to early- and midcareer scientists to help boost their careers and preserve U.S. science.The agency said it would begin the redistribution immediately with about $210 million annually, but that the amount would steadily increase over five years to about $1.1 billion a year.The federal medical-research agency, which has an annual budget of just over $34 billion, said it is taking the steps to encourage younger researchers to stay in science and in the U.S.The Trump administration has said it is seeking to cut the NIH budget by more than 20%, although leading congressional members of both parties have said they plan to fight for increases, not cuts, to the NIH budget.NIH Director       Francis Collins,        in a conference call with reporters, said, \u201cOur concern is that the next generation of researchers is under stress.\u201d\u201cWe are going to do this immediately,\u201d said       Lawrence A.

It ended being dominated by terrorism.Campaigning was interrupted twice by terrorist attacks, on May 22 in Manchester then last weekend in London. Together with an earlier attack in March on London\u2019s Westminster Bridge, 35 people were killed in three months.The attacks shattered a 12-year span during which there were no mass-casualty terrorist incidents on British soil. An Opinium Research LLP poll, conducted one day after the most recent London attack and four days before the election Thursday, showed that 55% of voters considered terrorism one of the most important issues facing the country, with Brexit trailing at 40%.The survey suggests a swing in voter mood: In a similar poll, conducted days before the Westminster attack, handling the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union was seen as a priority by 40% of Britons, with terrorism named by 21%.On the surface, the shift in campaign\u2019s theme should have played in favor of Prime Minister       Theresa May,        of the Conservative Party. She was in charge of domestic security and police forces as interior minister between 2010 and 2016. Surveys indicated she was widely seen as competent in the field.The Conservatives have long attacked the Labour Party\u2019s leader,       Jeremy Corbyn,        over his past links to members of the Irish Republican Army and hard-line Islamic groups, as well as his opposition to stricter antiterrorist regulation and nuclear weapons.A 2008 Rand Corp. study also showed that a terrorist attack occurring\u00a0within three months\u00a0of an election could add 1.4 percentage points to right-wing political parties\u2019 support, suggesting the issue could provide an edge for the Conservatives as polls continued to tighten.But Mr. Corbyn unexpectedly put Mrs. May on the defensive when he called on her to resign for her decision to cut police numbers during her six-year tenure as interior minister. Mr. Corbyn said the government was warned repeatedly about the cuts, and promised to recruit 10,000 more police officers if elected.Mrs. May defended her record, saying the budget for counterterrorism policing and the resources available to the security and intelligence agencies had increased under her watch.Ultimately, neither side appeared to have capitalized on the issue.\u00a0 Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent, said in an Election Day note that he was skeptical terrorist attacks could \u201cproduce decisive and \u2019direct\u2019 shifts in party loyalty\u201d.He said, however, that such events could entrench voters\u2019 perception of competence on the issue, one on which polling suggests Conservatives enjoy a lead Labour.\u201cIf, during that quiet moment in the polling booth, these issues are bouncing around the minds of voters, then it will favor the Conservatives,\u201d Mr. Goodwin said.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Terror Overtook Brexit as Dominant Theme.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 15:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/terror-overtook-brexit-as-leading-theme-in-u-k-election-1496949709", "news_title": "Terror Overtook Brexit as Leading Theme in U.K Election", "keywords": "conservative party,labour party,long bridge attack,manchester terror attack,terrorism,u.k. election,u.k. politics,u.k. terror attacks,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Lewis Carroll\u2019s White Queen bragged to Alice that she\u2019d been capable in her youth of believing six impossible things before breakfast. British voters have gone one better. They believed seven impossible things before Thursday\u2019s election. These myths will dominate politics for the next five years and beyond, whoever has won and by whatever margin:Low immigration is compatible with high growth. The propagators of this\u2014the biggest impossibility of all, and a prime motivator of the Brexit vote\u2014don\u2019t phrase it like this. Instead, before and after last year\u2019s Brexit referendum they implied that Britain\u2019s economy can continue as strongly as it is now but with fewer people. It can\u2019t.The clue is that net immigration soared in recent years at the same time unemployment fell and labor-force participation boomed. Clearly Britain needs more human beings than it is capable of producing domestically to power a 2% economic growth rate, let alone more. Britain faces chronic skills shortages in health care and engineering, among other fields.Lower immigration also is necessary to make entitlements work. This is a corollary of the first impossibility. Net migrants allegedly strain the National Health Service and the education system, and the various crises in those services would be easier to manage with fewer foreigners moseying up to the trough.Instead, these public services quickly become impossible to fund without a steady inflow of younger foreign workers. Human-resources consultancy Mercer calculates that if the government reduces net annual migration to below 100,000, the percentage of the population in work will rise by 3% by 2030 while the overall population will increase by 7%. This implies a growing burden on workers to support a larger number of nonworking young and retirees. At that rate, the pay-as-you-go model of entitlement financing will collapse faster than you can say \u201cstrain on public services.\u201dThe public finances are fixed and Westminster can loosen the purse strings. Are you kidding? Six years of Tory \u201causterity,\u201d one round of welfare reforms, and economic growth above 2% with a revenue boom to match, and Britain still is running a budget deficit of nearly 1% of GDP. This is an argument not for tax hikes (see below) but for realism about voters\u2019 willingness to reconsider the spending priorities they have foisted on their politicians, and about the potential for global markets to make up the difference indefinitely.Even if the public finances aren\u2019t fixed, there\u2019s still plenty of money if only Britain taxes more like a European country. Labour is the worst offender here.       Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s       party claimed it could pour billions of pounds into health care and education by increasing the top personal-income tax rate to 50% from 45%, and the top tax rate on corporations to 26% from a planned 17% under the Tories. The Conservatives were more subtly wrong, only hinting at income-tax hikes before reversing.Globalization says otherwise. You can\u2019t tax your economy more than your neighbors do when your economy can up and leave, building factories or settling high-earning bankers in lower-tax jurisdictions.Trade deals will determine Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future. Nice try, but productivity will. Most of the world\u2019s economies thrive outside the EU, and without special trade pacts with each other. Very few economies of Britain\u2019s size, composition and trading relations thrive from outside the European Union while muddling along with a sub-French level of per-worker productivity to make up for the lack of trade advantages with its most important partners. While everyone obsesses over \u201cno deal\u201d versus \u201cbad deal,\u201d what\u2019s London\u2019s plan for liberalizing the economy to encourage the investment and entrepreneurship to boost productivity?Britain is fundamentally different from the rest of Europe. It could be, given its Anglo-Saxon regulatory approach and tradition of outward engagement with the world. But when you consider the political hostility to its labor-market flexibility (in the form of hated \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d) or a single-payer health behemoth more statist than anything in Germany or France, maybe Britain isn\u2019t so different from Europe after all.The European Union is a millstone around Britain\u2019s neck. Quite the opposite. EU membership has allowed Britain to muddle through a lot longer than it otherwise could have without confronting any of these problems. The efficiency gains of unfettered access to the single market make up for Britain\u2019s low productivity, while the EU\u2019s free movement of people provides fiscal cover for unsustainable British entitlements.Believing impossible things is a characteristic of most democratic electorates. Surgically removing scales from eyes is the chief mark of genuine political leadership, which lies somewhere between the poles of ineffective wonkery or rank demagoguery.

Many economists had expected Mr. Draghi to hint more strongly at an exit path.\u201cThe ECB is essentially in a holding pattern,\u201d said       Patrick O\u2019Donnell,        a fund manager with             Aberdeen Asset Management                   in London. \u201cThere\u2019s no appetite to risk choking off the growth that the economy has been seeing of late.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s message of patience is likely to cause further irritation in Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, where top officials have been calling urgently for a policy reversal from the ECB. Those officials, who include German Finance Minister       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble,        argue that years of easy money are inflating asset prices while harming German savers and pensioners.\u201cSadly, the return to a normal monetary policy is set to drag out painfully slowly,\u201d said       J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer,        chief economist at             Commerzbank                   in Frankfurt. \u201cAn end to easy money is urgently needed to avoid the risk of new property price bubbles.\u201dThe eurozone is enjoying its most protracted growth spurt in almost a decade. Its economy grew by 1.9% on the year in the first quarter, outpacing the U.S. Unemployment has fallen to an eight-year low of 9.3%, bank lending is expanding robustly and business surveys suggest growth is accelerating.That progress has come despite a volatile political backdrop that has included tense national elections in France and Netherlands, as well as Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.Mr. Draghi acknowledged the brighter outlook on Thursday, boasting that the region had created more jobs over the last 3\u00bd years than the U.S.The size of the ECB\u2019s stimulus \u201clooks increasingly out of line with the economic backdrop,\u201d said Ken Wattret, an economist with TS Lombard in London.But in a sign of the dilemma facing the ECB, the bank also downgraded its forecasts for inflation over the next three years. It now expects consumer prices to rise by only 1.3% next year, some way below its target of just below 2%.That downgrade underscores the continuing fragility in the region\u2019s economy. While unemployment is falling, it is still high, which is holding down wages and limiting price growth.Despite that, most economists expect the ECB to soon start winding down its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing or QE\u2014not least because it is expected to start struggling to find enough bonds to buy. It has already bought more than \u20ac1.5 trillion of government debt, and constraints on the program\u2019s design mean it is likely to face shortages next year in Germany and other markets. The program is currently due to last at least through December.Some analysts said Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks Thursday meant a decision on the future of QE might be pushed back, perhaps as late as December.\u201cThe exit is not going to be easy,\u201d said       Anna Stupnytska,        an economist with Fidelity International in London. \u201cThe ECB has worked hard to put together all the elements of the current policy package\u2026and they are likely to be extremely cautious in removing\u201d them.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'ECB Skips Rate Cut But Keeps Stimulus.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 15:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-drops-reference-to-future-interest-rate-cut-1496923503", "news_title": "ECB Drops Reference to Future Interest-Rate Cut", "keywords": "bond news,ecb interest rates, ecb policy, ecb qe,euro,eurobonds,european central bank, eurozone economy, eurozone inflation,foreign exchange,germany,mario draghi,monetary policy,Mario Draghi,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,central bank intervention,interest rates,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "During       James Comey\u2019s       appearance today before the Senate Intelligence Committee, some lawmakers discussed whether President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with the former FBI director constituted obstruction of justice. Here is some background on the law.The obstruction law 18 U.S. Code Chapter 73 has 21 sections that cover everything from assaulting a process server to influencing jurors to obstructing criminal investigations. Congress enacted the modern precursor to the law in 1909 and has tinkered with it several times since, broadening its scope and enhancing its penalties, according to a 2009 paper by New York University law professor Erin Murphy.Legislators extended the law\u2019s reach to cover acts interfering with Federal Bureau of Investigation probes in 1967. The change was meant to give prosecutors a tool to punish mobsters for targeting witnesses cooperating with federal agents against them.\u201cIt will be a serious crime to obstruct a federal criminal investigation through bribery, intimidation, force or threats of force,\u201d President Lyndon Johnson said in his signing statement, adding that its \u201cchief impact will fall on organized crime.\u201dOne of the law\u2019s broader provisions is Section 1503. It says that anyone who \u201ccorruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication\u201d attempts to \u201cinfluence, obstruct, or impede\u201d the administration of justice is guilty of a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. (If the crime involves attempted killing or threats against a juror, the penalty increases to a maximum of 20 years.)But that section requires a pending judicial proceeding, such as a grand jury investigation. Another section of the law, 1510, covers FBI investigations, but applies only when bribes are paid to obstruct justice.Experts disagree over whether section 1512\u2014which creates a punishment of as many as 20 years in prison for anyone who corruptly \u201cobstructs, influences, or impedes any officials proceeding\u201d\u2014could reach interference in an FBI investigation, even in the absence of a judicial proceeding.\u201cObstruction of justice\u201d may evoke evidence destruction or witness tampering, but courts have interpreted the federal law to cover a much broader expanse of conduct, giving prosecutors freedom to innovate.The New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in an oft-quoted 1979 ruling describing the breadth of the law, said it was intended to cover \u201ca variety of corrupt methods\u201d of obstruction limited \u201conly by the imagination of the criminally inclined.\u201dProsecutors need not show anyone succeed in obstructing justice to prove violations of the law, said Lisa Kern Griffin, a professor at Duke University School of Law. Nor must the investigation or proceedings that were obstructed lead to criminal charges.Prof. Griffin gave the example of I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, an adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney who was convicted in 2007 of obstruction for misleading a grand jury in an investigation of the leaked identity of Central Intelligence Agency operative Valerie Plame. He wasn\u2019t charged with the leak itself.Prosecutors have brought successful cases for obstruction when the conduct included persuading a secretary not to cooperate with law enforcement, attempting to coerce or bribe witnesses to lie or withhold testimony, and misleading grand juries, Prof. Griffin said.Pivotal to establishing obstruction\u2014particularly in white-collar cases\u2014is the element of intent: demonstrating the accused acted with the purpose of interfering with justice. \u201cIntent is the heart of it,\u201d said Duke criminal law professor Samuel Buell.Like a lot of other areas of criminal law, inserting a president into the equation complicates the analysis. In theory, a president could have good-faith reasons, such as national-security concerns, for pressing the FBI to stop probing a particular matter.So when would presidential interference cross the line from legitimate governing to obstruction? What matters more than the words uttered is the purpose behind them, said Prof. Buell.He framed the issue as whether a president is acting with \u201cpersonal motives that don\u2019t have to do with fulfilling his public obligations as president.\u201dWrite to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com and Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 15:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/comeys-senate-hearing-sparks-the-question-what-is-obstruction-of-justice-1496948612", "news_title": "Comey\u2019s Senate Hearing Sparks the Question: What Is Obstruction of Justice?

Morgan Chase                   & Co. and hundreds of other lenders.A bankruptcy judge in New York will weigh the financing request at a June 30 hearing.The fight dates back years, to the time when the national economy was shaken by mortgage losses and the fabled U.S. auto maker needed a government assist to avoid being crushed under its load of debt.A paperwork gaffe resulted in the release of lender claims on a large collection of GM assets\u2014equipment and fixtures at 42 GM plants\u2014meaning loans J.P. Morgan believed were secured were in fact unsecured. That is the creditors\u2019 position.Backed by other lenders, J.P.

Other than that, this is our country, and our policies should be independent,\u201d said Sheikh Mohammed.He said the crisis could only be resolved through diplomacy, ruling out a military escalation.When asked about possible outside pressure to curb Al Jazeera, an official at the U.S. State Department said the U.S. would oppose attempts to restrict freedom of expression.\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental pillar of civil society,\u201d the official said. \u201cAs we do around the world, we urge governments to respect their obligations and commitments to respecting and upholding this important right.\u201dWrite to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com and Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 15:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/al-jazeera-says-websites-digital-platforms-under-attempted-cyberattack-1496946930", "news_title": "Al Jazeera Says Websites, Digital Platforms Under Attempted Cyberattack", "keywords": "al jazeera, aljazeera, al jazeera cyberattack,al jazeera hacking ,gulf countries,persian gulf, qatar,qatar foreign minister, qatari,sheikh mohammed,Sheikh Mohammed,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,broadcasting,television broadcasting,satellite broadcasting,media,entertainment,satellite television"}, {"content": "As her collection of troubled companies continues to struggle, distressed investing       executive Lynn Tilton       will face questioning under oath about the demise of one of them, failed emergency-care transport company Transcare Corp.Over the past year, Ms. Tilton has gone to trial in New York and Delaware over her handling of what was once a $2.5 billion empire, spending days on the witness stand. Sometime this summer, Ms. Tilton will take questions about the fate of Transcare, which shut down suddenly last year, leaving more than 1,200 workers jobless, and many allegedly unpaid.The questions will come from bankruptcy trustees, who have been issuing subpoenas and getting court orders to fill in the gaps in the ambulance company\u2019s financial records. More than a year after Transcare closed down, bank and tax records were missing, court documents say.Creditors are also entitled to participate. That means ambulance workers that were allegedly handed rubber checks for their final pay, and who have sued for damages over lost benefits, are entitled to ask Ms. Tilton about Transcare\u2019s fate.In a statement this week, Ms. Tilton said she and her Patriarch Partners management firm aren\u2019t responsible for the lost pay and benefits. Neither she nor Patriarch was the employer, the statement said.Transcare was at one time part of what was known as the Patriarch portfolio of companies, a collection of businesses in trouble that Ms. Tilton vowed to reclaim. More than a decade ago, Ms. Tilton launched an effort to draw in investor funds to fuel the turnaround effort, raising money through collateralized loan obligation vehicles known as the Zohar funds. Two of the Zohar funds have defaulted and she has resigned as their manager, but she holds on to her position as person in charge of a dwindling collection of businesses.Many of the companies, like Transcare, have shut their doors in recent years, often with no explanation. Ms. Tilton says there is enough value in the remaining companies to pay back all the Zohar debts, and return a profit to her. Zohar investors hope she\u2019s right.The questioning in Transcare\u2019s bankruptcy case has been long delayed. After more than a year of no-shows at the meeting Transcare is required to have with its creditors, bankruptcy trustee       Salvatore LaMonica       finally sought a court order to compel Ms. Tilton and other company representatives to show up.She agreed\u2014no court order will be necessary\u2014and said this week she will attend a Transcare creditor meeting in June or August.The Transcare bankruptcy meeting is a far cry from Ms. Tilton\u2019s other trials, which took place in courtrooms presided over by judges. In a New York federal courtroom last fall, Ms. Tilton faced civil fraud charges leveled at her by the Securities and Exchange Commission. She denies the allegations, which focus on whether she hid losses from investors in the Zohar funds, the vehicles that fed money to the businesses she controlled.In a Delaware corporate law tribunal, she battled the Zohar funds\u2019 new managers, the restructuring firm of Alvarez & Marsal, over portfolio company business records, and lost. Months later, she fought an effort by the Zohar funds to oust her from control of some of the better companies in the portfolio.A decision is awaited in the SEC case and on the Delaware fight for control. Separately, the Zohar fund managers have filed a racketeering lawsuit against Ms. Tilton and Patriarch in federal court in New York which Ms. Tilton has sought to have thrown out as baseless. It alleges she improperly took cash and assets from investors.This week the Zohar funds, under Alvarez\u2019s control, asked a federal judge to let them start gathering evidence in the racketeering case, arguing, \u201cThe ongoing and repeated failures of Zohar Fund portfolio companies comes at significant economic and human cost.\u201dMs. Tilton\u2019s lawyers, in reply, said the Zohar funds had \u201csmeared\u201d her, and attempted to \u201cvilify\u201d her with \u201cinflammatory public accusations,\u201d and in so doing, damaged the companies.The fate of the Transcare workforce\u2014sudden job loss, unpaid wages and benefits\u2014has been shared by workers at other Patriarch-run businesses, from New England to Cambodia, that have failed and shut down abruptly over the past 18 months.Records of an arbitration conducted after a Tilton-controlled textile plant in Cambodia closed its doors suddenly in June of last year show hundreds of workers, most of them with years on the job at the plant, were owed more than a month\u2019s wages at the time. The monthly wage for those Cambodian workers was $147, arbitration records show. The figure includes $10 for not missing a day\u2019s work.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 15:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/turnaround-executive-lynn-tilton-to-testify-about-failed-ambulance-company-1496948401", "news_title": "Turnaround Executive Lynn Tilton to Testify About Failed Ambulance Company", "keywords": "lynn tilton,patriarch partners,transcare,zohar funds,Patriarch Partners,Transcare,executive Lynn Tilton,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,economic performance,indicators,bankruptcy figures,economic news,political,general news,crime"}, {"content": "The U.S. Treasury Department will auction $128 billion in securities next week, comprising $57 billion in new debt and $71 billion in previously sold debt.

But the question that may ultimately determine             Nordstrom\u2019s        JWN 1.45%      \u00a0health is how much debt they would have to take on to buy it.Members of the Nordstrom family are exploring the possibility of taking the company private,\u00a0the retailer announced\u00a0Thursday. Its board has formed a special committee of independent directors to represent shareholders in the event of an offer.For Nordstrom, going private has its appeal as the crisis facing U.S. department stores deepens. Its sales have held up better than those of peers such as             Macy\u2019s,       but its shares repeatedly have been punished for rivals\u2019 weakness. The family, which already owns nearly 30% of the company\u2019s stock, may find it easier to make investments necessary to compete outside the public eye. But, at a time when industry conditions are shifting rapidly, taking on too much debt to do a deal might limit Nordstrom\u2019s options.A buyout looks easier to pull off than in the recent past. Nordstrom\u2019s stock price is down about 45% from its all-time high of $82.32 on March 20, 2015. After the stock jumped on the announcement Thursday, the market was valuing it at 6.8 times 2016 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That is still about 28% lower than the average of 9.4 times for retail leveraged buyouts since 2006, according to Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.The\u00a0research\u00a0firm looked at a range of takeout multiples from 7 times to 9.5 times, implying a price of $48 to $69 a share, and calculated that they would require the buyers to raise $5.65 billion to $8.19 billion in additional capital. If that comes in the form of debt, it would leave the remaining company with leverage ranging from 5.4 times to 6.8 times net debt to Ebitdar, a retail measure that excludes rent expense. By comparison,             J.C. Penney\u2019s       lease-adjusted leverage ratio is around 4.5 times, according to             Morgan Stanley.That could be difficult for the company to support, especially given that cash flow from operations\u2014$1.65 billion last year\u2014is expected to decline. To diminish this risk, the Nordstrom family might want to bring in another equity investor, such as Saks-owner             Hudson\u2019s Bay,      \u00a0or contribute additional cash of their own.Going private will benefit Nordstrom only if it can fully enjoy the freedom to invest.Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 14:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nordstrom-buyout-watch-the-debt-1496948098", "news_title": "Nordstrom Buyout: Watch the Debt   ", "keywords": "buyout,deal,debt,heard on the street,lbo,leverage,nordstrom,private,take private,Nordstrom,JWN,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,leveraged loans,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores"}, {"content": "Copper prices rallied Thursday after severe weather hit some mines in South America and labor issues recurred in Indonesia.Copper for July delivery settled up 2.3% at $2.6095 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest close since May 2.Investors turned their attentions to the snow and strong winds seen so far this week in northern Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert.

It\u2019s also a Golden State Warriors art gallery.For the last month, and for at least another week, its walls have been covered with framed prints depicting the Warriors as they\u2019ve never been seen before. There are illustrations of Stephen Curry as a samurai and Curry as a zombie, Curry wearing a bathrobe and Curry wearing a Louis Vuitton towel, Curry guarding Michael Jordan and Curry guarding a younger Curry. There are several pieces inspired by Kevin Durant leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder and one piece recasting Durant as the grim reaper. There is even a portrait of LeBron James\u2014except this LeBron James is fat.The work currently on display comes from an exhibit called Dubz Against the World that opened in SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco earlier this year. That show featured more than 300 basketball-themed pieces commissioned from more than 50 artists in Australia, Brazil, China, France, Japan, South Korea and across the U.S., especially the Bay Area.That\u2019s where the Warriors aren\u2019t merely the NBA\u2019s best team one game away from the title with a 3-0 lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. They also have become a muse.The original exhibit was curated by Vince Chang and Vinny Chiu, fans of basketball, art and basketball art, and sold everything from $5 pins to $3,500 oil paintings. There was an NBA Jam console. There was a pop-a-shot machine. There was even a pop-up barbershop.More than 3,000 people attended the show. But one stood out, partly because he was 7-foot tall, and mostly because he plays for the Warriors.Golden State center JaVale McGee was hard to miss. He posed with some of the pieces and took home a portrait of himself. It was an illustration of McGee riding around Haight-Ashbury with his sphynx cat.How did he find out about the exhibit? \u201cInstagram,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201dJeff Perlstein, the owner of SoleSpace, agreed with McGee\u2019s assessment. He went to the last day of the SOMArts exhibit with his son and was so impressed he offered to keep it alive by hanging unsold art on the walls of his sneaker shop in downtown Oakland during the NBA playoffs. \u201cWe were blown away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just let them pack up the show and close it.\u201dThere are now more than 60 pieces from artists whose         Twitter               names are penciled alongside their work next to the prices. But not all of them are about the Warriors. Jack Perkins\u2019s favorite piece in the Dubz Against the World exhibit is a black-and-white drawing of a stoic LeBron James grabbing the NBA championship trophy with mobs of angry Cleveland fans behind him and waves of elated Cleveland fans in front of him. \u201cI wanted to show him, almost without emotion, somewhere between the hate and the love,\u201d he said.Chang requested a piece from a local artist named Joe Wallace that\u2019s more palatable to Golden State fans: a full-size portrait featuring the entire team. At the SOMArts exhibit, Wallace saw McGee staring at his work. He decided to introduce himself. Then he gave him another one of his creations: a T-shirt of Looney Tunes characters in Warriors gear. Not long afterward, McGee wore that T-shirt to a playoff game.\u201cFor the subjects of your work to actually take time to even look and appreciate it all really makes the creative process worthwhile,\u201d Wallace said.McGee couldn\u2019t drag any of his teammates to the exhibit when it was in San Francisco.

Christopher Giancarlo,        a Republican, submitted a budget request of $281.5 million to the House Appropriations Committee. He said the amount was \u201cnot an ad hoc number,\u201d reflecting the agency\u2019s need for more economists, examination resources and funding for its financial-technology initiatives.\u201cThere is no guarantee that providing the CFTC an increase would further your major priorities, such as improving economic analysis or the financial-technology sector,\u201d said Rep.       David Valadao       (R., Calif.), the vice chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the CFTC.The CFTC is the top regulator of swaps, or contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in certain benchmarks. Swaps were targeted by lawmakers for greater oversight and transparency after they played a central role in causing the financial crisis.The CFTC\u2019s budget has hovered around $250 million for three years. Republicans in Congress resisted calls during the Obama administration to boost CFTC funding, citing the constraints of the broader federal budget. The last time appropriators agreed to an increase for the agency was in 2014, as part of a year-end funding deal. The agreement included a rollback of a controversial provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law requiring banks to \u201cpush out\u201d some of their riskiest derivative-trading activities into affiliates that aren\u2019t eligible for federal backstop programs.Democrats on the subcommittee criticized Republicans on Thursday over CFTC funding.\u201cCongress would never deprive first responders of the resources they need to perform their duties,\u201d said Rep.       Sanford Bishop       (D., Ga.).Mr. Giancarlo, presenting his first budget request as acting chairman of the CFTC, made remarks separating himself from some of the more vigorous criticisms of Dodd-Frank by the congressional Republicans and the Trump administration, which has nominated him to serve as chairman, pending Senate confirmation.\u201cI don\u2019t get into the debate of Dodd-Frank as good or bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI view it as done and I\u2019m moving on into the future.\u201dHe added that Congress had \u201cgotten it right\u201d with regard to swaps regulation in the 2010 law, though some of the implementation by regulators had fallen short of the law\u2019s intentions, in his view.The Financial Choice Act, which the House is expected to pass on Thursday, wouldn\u2019t alter Title VII of Dodd-Frank, the portion that pertains most to the CFTC and derivatives regulation. The Choice Act faces Democratic opposition in the Senate and is unlikely to become law.In response to Republican questioning, Mr. Giancarlo said he would continue to look for a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d on the issue of the threshold for minimum aggregate trading amount needed to register as a swaps dealer.The current threshold is $8 billion, but it would fall to $3 billion in December 2018 if the agency doesn\u2019t take action, according to the current phase-in schedule for a rule passed during the Obama administration.The CFTC currently has just two members, Mr. Giancarlo and Democratic Commissioner       Sharon Bowen,        so it cannot act on the issue without a quorum. Ms. Bowen favors the $3 billion threshold, which some market participants and congressional Republicans think ensnares too many end-users.Write to Gabriel T.

He\u2019s everywhere, and nowhere. He dismisses questions, pooh-poohs our silly obsession with uncorrupted elections, provokes a saucer-eyed look from NBC debutante       Megyn Kelly.       And now? He has a virtual miniseries on Showtime.The Putin InterviewsBegins Monday, 9 p.m., ShowtimeIf any news was going to erupt out of \u201cThe Putin Interviews,\u201d which were conducted by       Oliver Stone       and will occupy four hours over four nights, it likely would have leaked by now (though only parts 1 and 2 were made available for review). In the absence of startling revelations, what\u2019s fascinating about this elaborate production is the theater of it all. Also, the degrees of arrogance on display. And the unspoken motives: Why would Mr. Putin have agreed to spend 30-plus hours with film director Stone, whom the viewer will find hard enough to swallow in the hour-long doses Showtime is dispensing?Anyone familiar with Mr. Stone\u2019s politics or movies, including his three films about       Fidel Castro       (which include 2003\u2019s \u201cComandante\u201d), know he\u2019s going to be a welcoming conduit for the likes of Mr. Putin, who, despite having a sympathetic interviewer, is something of a nightmare subject. No matter what Mr. Stone says, or suggests\u2014and some of it, even basic history, is magnificently uninformed for someone given the opportunity to interview the president of Russia\u2014Mr. Putin reflexively contradicts him. You did this, Mr. Stone says, you did that; no, no, Mr. Putin responds, and then proceeds to split whatever hair necessary to make himself right. It\u2019s an obvious power strategy, as well as a cheap one.But one can hardly blame Mr. Putin for the occasional look of annoyance, or bewilderment, or withering amusement he casts in Mr. Stone\u2019s direction, whether in response to the superficiality of the questions or the \u201cThis Is Your Life\u201d approach taken by the director of \u201c      JFK,       \u201d \u201cPlatoon\u201d and most recently \u201c      Snowden,       \u201d about Mr. Putin\u2019s most famous guest. Shot over two years, \u201cThe Putin Interviews\u201d allows wide latitude to the former KGB agent and FSB director to make his case that Russia is a victim, that NATO is unnecessary, that what he is really after is \u201crapprochement\u201d with Ukraine. Part 2 of the interviews ends in what is apparently mid-2016, with Mr. Putin affirming that \u201cwe never interfere with the domestic affairs of other countries,\u201d and refusing to pick a favorite in the coming U.S. election. (Part 4, conducted in February of this year, may deliver some sensational news. Can\u2019t say.)For his part, Mr. Stone talks about America as if he\u2019s not a part of it, which comes across as a symptom of towering arrogance, as well as an attempt to position himself as Mr. Putin\u2019s equal. While the Oscar-winning director can certainly spin, on Mr. Putin\u2019s turf he\u2019s a relative amateur. And a blunderer: When Mr. Stone refers back to a       Charlie Rose       interview\u2014in which the Russian president apparently acknowledged his czarist aspirations\u2014Mr. Putin says he was misunderstood. Mr. Stone offers, \u201cYou should shoot the interpreter,\u201d which seems, at best, an unkind thing to say, especially with a Russian interpreter standing right there.Mr. Putin isn\u2019t quite agile enough to avoid his own rhetorical potholes. \u201cDo you have bad days?\u201d Mr. Stone asks, to which the Russian responds, \u201cI\u2019m not a woman, so I don\u2019t have bad days,\u201d then makes it worse by going on about \u201ccertain natural cycles.\u201d Would he ever shower at the gym with someone he knew was gay?

Whether or not he was right, it\u2019s difficult to know what space Grant occupies in contemporary pop consciousness. Is he just another relic being given CPR by TCM? Or is he appreciated for what he was\u2014the consummate star of classic Hollywood, an actor who could do it all?Becoming Cary GrantFriday, 9 p.m., ShowtimeThe man gets his due in \u201cBecoming Cary Grant,\u201d a moody jewel of a film that draws on Grant\u2019s unpublished autobiography for much of its narration (delivered by actor       Jonathan Pryce      ) and on a wealth of home-movie footage that provides a Grant\u2019s-eye view of a bygone world. It probably shouldn\u2019t be a shock that someone with the actor\u2019s empathic gifts for both drama and comedy would also have been a profoundly complex, even unhappy individual; the gods were certainly kind to him, but they have their limit. Much of the story within director Mark Kidel\u2019s movie involves Grant\u2019s turn to LSD therapy in the \u201960s and how it freed him from the traumas of a dysfunctional English childhood that included the loss of his mother when he was just 11 years old. His father told the boy\u2014then       Archie Leach,        as everyone probably knows\u2014that       Elsie Leach       had simply gone away, and later that she\u2019d died. In fact, she\u2019d been committed by her husband to an insane asylum, so he could live with another woman. Archie, who had become Cary, didn\u2019t discover all this until 20 years later, when his mother was released and they were reunited.In the memoir, Grant acknowledges that what he presumed was maternal abandonment affected his relationships with women throughout his life (he was married five times) and that the LSD treatments helped him see his problems for what they were. Interspersed throughout the film are clips from some of his greatest films, as well as some early and decidedly not great work, done at the beginning of a journey toward a screen persona that would be molded by the likes of       George Cukor,       Howard Hawks       and       Alfred Hitchcock,        while Grant the man remained static.

He also confirmed he told Mr. Trump that he wasn\u2019t under investigation as part of the FBI\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Comey\u2019s public testimony lasted more than 2 1/2 hours and allowed the former FBI chief to speak publicly on a range of topics surrounding his interactions with the president, including his decision to document all conversations with the president because he believed Mr. Trump \u201cmight lie\" about them later.Mr. Comey began his testimony by protesting Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of his firing, saying the administration\u2019s \u201cshifting explanations...confused me and increasingly concerned me.\u201d He later said investigators are looking at whether Mr. Flynn lied to the FBI and suggested that they had additional information on Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his dealings with Russia.After the hearing, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said Mr. Trump was pleased that Mr. Comey said publicly that the president wasn\u2019t personally under investigation. But he disputed much of Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony about his private conversations with Mr. Trump and pointed out that Mr. Comey \u201cunilaterally and surreptitiously\u201d released \u201cprivileged communications with the president\u201d to the media.Thursday\u2019s hearing made it clear Mr. Comey believed the president had actively tried to influence the course of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Mr. Flynn, who was forced to resign after making false statements about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But because the most damning accounts involved one-on-one encounters with the president\u2014and Mr. Trump disputes Mr. Comey\u2019s version\u2014investigators face a challenge as they examine the matter.\u201cIt\u2019s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,\u201d Mr. Comey said.Mr. Comey said he understood the president to be urging him to move quickly to conclude the investigation, which he felt would clear his name. \u201cI interpreted that as he was frustrated that the Russia investigation was taking up so much time and energy...and it was making it difficult for him to focus on other priorities of his,\u201d he said.In his testimony Thursday, Mr. Comey described Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with him about the Flynn investigation as \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and \u201cvery concerning.\u201d Mr. Kasowitz denied that the president asked Mr. Comey to drop the probe.As to whether the president\u2019s alleged statements amounted to obstruction of justice, Mr. Comey said, that was \u201ca conclusion I\u2019m sure the special counsel will work towards, to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that\u2019s an offense.\u201dMr. Comey also suggested investigators are pursuing several lines of inquiry, including Mr. Flynn\u2019s statements to investigators and Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. Later in the day, the former director spoke to lawmakers in closed session.In his remarks, Mr. Kasowitz criticized government officials who he said \u201care actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications.\u201d He added: \u201cMr. Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump tweeted on May 12 that Mr. Comey \u201cbetter hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press,\u201d Mr. Comey testified Thursday that he decided to provide information to the media.Mr. Comey said he ensured that a friend, Columbia Law Professor Dan Richman, would provide the contents of memos Mr. Comey had written on his discussions with Mr. Trump to the media, including one in which he recalled Mr. Trump saying he hoped the director could see his way \u201cto let Flynn go.\u201d\u201cI thought [the memos] might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,\u201d Mr. Comey said. The former director said he began writing such memos because he was concerned the president might misrepresent their encounters. Because of \u201cthe nature of the person,\u201d he said, \u201cI was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meetings.\u201dMr. Comey added, \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d White House representatives have repeatedly declined to confirm or deny whether there is a White House taping system.Mr. Kasowitz pushed back Thursday on Mr. Comey\u2019s statement that Mr. Trump, during a private dinner at the White House, had told Mr. Comey he expected loyalty.\u201cThe president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including suggesting that Mr. Comey \u2018let Flynn go,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kasowitz said. \u201cThe president also never told Mr. Comey, \u2018I need loyalty, I expect loyalty\u2019 in form or substance.\u201dMr. Comey said he assured the president he was not under investigation during a Jan. 6 briefing in which he discussed the existence of a dossier containing unsubstantiated, salacious allegations about Mr. Trump. He made that assurance at other points, as well.Mr. Comey said he wanted to reassure Mr. Trump this was not a \u201cJ. Edgar Hoover type situation,\u201d referring to the FBI\u2019s first director, who was notorious for keeping damaging information on powerful officials. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him thinking I was briefing him on it to have it hanging over him in some way.\u201dMr. Comey\u2019s abrupt firing on May 9 set off a chain of events that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia probe.The Senate Intelligence Committee, and several other congressional panels, is investigating Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election. The Russian government denies that, and Mr. Trump has called the probes a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He has said no one on his campaign had coordinated with the Kremlin.At the hearing, senators of both parties asked Mr. Comey why, if he found the president\u2019s conduct objectionable, he didn\u2019t raise the alarm or confront Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a great question. Maybe if I were stronger I would have,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cI was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in.\u201dAfterward, lawmakers expressed concern about various parts of Mr. Comey\u2019s account. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said the FBI and Justice Department need to be independent but that Mr. Trump may not have been familiar with accepted practices.\u201cThe president\u2019s new at this. He\u2019s new to government. He probably wasn\u2019t steeped in the long-running protocols that established the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. When a reporter noted that Mr. Trump has a large staff to advise him, Mr. Ryan said he was \u201cnot saying it\u2019s an acceptable excuse\u2014it\u2019s just my observation.\u201dSen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) said the legal case for obstruction of justice is a \u201ccritical question that the special counsel must examine further.\u201d\u201cWe must also keep our eye on the larger issue: Russian interference in our elections,\u201d he said.Mr. Comey didn\u2019t spare his former bosses, Mr. Sessions and his predecessor, Loretta Lynch. He said said he felt \u201cqueasy\u201d last year when Ms. Lynch asked him to call the FBI\u2019s probe of Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server a \u201cmatter\u201d rather than an \u201cinvestigation.\u201dAnd he said he wasn\u2019t able to discuss the Russia investigation with Mr. Sessions because he was \u201caware of facts that I can\u2019t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.\u201dEarlier in his testimony, Mr. Comey said he believed the president had mistreated him and the FBI by claiming the bureau was poorly led and disorganized.\u201cAlthough the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI, by saying the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cThose were lies, plain and simple.\u201d\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus, Kristina Peterson and Erica Orden contributed to this article.Write to Del Quentin Wilber at del.wilber@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Comey Says He Felt Trump Directed Him to End Probe.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 14:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/comey-says-trump-administration-defamed-him-and-the-fbi-1496932512", "news_title": "Comey Says He Felt Trump Directed Him to Drop Flynn Probe", "keywords": " comey, comey's testimony, donald trump, former fbi director,james comey, president, senate intelligence committee, trump,FBI,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Some questions about \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d a movie that goes beyond defying comprehension to being truly incomprehensible:What is       Tom Cruise       doing here? He\u2019s had his ups and downs over a long career, but a Tom Cruise movie has come to mean a professional production that is, if nothing else, good to look at. This one, his worst ever, isn\u2019t worth a first look, let alone a second one, unless you thrill to a luridly silly villain\u2014more about her in a bit\u2014and an infestation of digital mummies munching everyone in sight. The plot is subprofessional chaos with vague aspirations to parody. Mr. Cruise, who plays a soldier of fortune named       Nick Morton,        looks like a baffled bystander when he isn\u2019t running, jumping, shooting and fighting his way through the subterranean reaches of contemporary London. (That\u2019s where much of the story is set, even though spasms of action take place in Iraq, and on sand dunes meant to evoke \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d)How could Nick have been made so nonlikable? Unlike Indiana Jones, an archaeologist with a buoyant spirit (or the perfectly pleasant       Rick O\u2019Connell       in those mummy movies with       Brendan Fraser      ), Nick is basically a robber of graves and antiquities. What\u2019s more, according to       Jenny Halsey,        a beautiful archaeologist played vervelessly by       Annabelle Wallis,        he\u2019s a lover who cannot simulate human feelings for more than a few seconds at a time. (We are mercifully spared any love scenes, or even suggestions of sexual chemistry.) Jenny does say at several points that there\u2019s a good man inside him. While that man is struggling to get out, though\u2014struggling with an evil curse that threatens to turn \u201cThe Mummy\u201d into \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d\u2014Nick says unheroic things like \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Neither do we, and we don\u2019t give a damn. (The director was       Alex Kurtzman.      )What\u2019s going on? This question is less general than situational. The basic plot is perfectly comprehensible. An ancient, and particularly nasty, princess raises hell on earth after the inadvertent unearthing of her sarcophagus. More often than not, however, it\u2019s hard to know where we are, and exactly when. Nick is afflicted by music-video visions that take him here, there and everywhere in temporal spurts, while the script is afflicted by serious continuity glitches. In one of them, a battle between good and evil is raging in a tunnel of the London Underground, but then Nick and Jenny are suddenly underwater, and not because they borrowed too much on their mortgage.Why is the villain so intractably silly? No reason why the mummy shouldn\u2019t be female this time around; her name is Ahmanet, she\u2019s played by Sofia Boutella and she\u2019s formidably statuesque, with a fierce visage enhanced by hieroglyphic tats, though sometimes sullied by holes in her cheeks \u00e0 la Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cCorpse Bride.\u201d But she roareth too much to little avail, whether she\u2019s summoning up a sand storm in London (as if London hadn\u2019t suffered enough lately) or straining against her chains in a Victorian-looking laboratory of the Prodigium. That\u2019s a shadowy organization presided over by       Russell Crowe\u2019s       Dr. Henry Jekyll, who, questioned about his outfit\u2019s mission, says only that \u201cour business is evil.\u201dWhy has all human feeling been effaced from the film, if indeed feeling was ever present? This question is argumentative, but irresistible, in the wake of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Last week we were treated, lavishly, to a summer spectacular that proved the genre could still be thrilling, surprising and deeply affecting. This week, in a resumption of the downward spiral that has afflicted summer movies for many years, we have a dumb retro wheezer that not only damages the career of its star but diminishes the cause of big-screen entertainment. \u201cBe careful,\u201d Jenny tells workmen lifting Ahmanet\u2019s sarcophagus. \u201cThat\u2019s 5,000 years old.\u201d The film doesn\u2019t feel much younger.Why would we want to see more of the similar, if not quite the same? This question is prompted by the place \u201cThe Mummy\u201d occupies as the kick-off attraction of The Dark Universe. These days universes are being discovered with increasing frequency by astronomers, and created, with interconnected characters, by Hollywood production and marketing executives. For them a universe is the core of a franchise, and creating franchises is considered the best way, or maybe the only way, to keep vast numbers of multiplex seats reliably filled. Thus we have DC Comics universes competing with Marvel Comics universes, and now the Dark Universe, a far-reaching Universal Pictures venture that will recycle such classic treasures as \u201cThe Bride of Frankenstein\u201d and \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d into big-budget, new-fashioned oldies. (We have not seen the last of Dr. Jekyll.) In an industry cursed by a paucity of ideas, \u201cThe Mummy\u201d points to the future by exhuming the past.Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 14:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mummy-review-a-sand-trap-for-tom-cruise-1496945250", "news_title": "\u2018The Mummy\u2019 Review: A Sand Trap for Tom Cruise ", "keywords": " annabelle wallis,arts in review,movie, sofia boutella,the mummy, tom cruise,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,movies,reviews"}, {"content": "Taut, smart, intense and genuinely scary, Trey Edward Shults\u2019s \u201cIt Comes at Night\u201d fulfills the promise, and then some, of the filmmaker\u2019s 2015 debut feature, \u201cKrisha.\u201d This small-scale prodigy of a post-apocalyptic horror flick provides a new vision of isolationism in the persons of a family\u2014father, mother and 17-year-old son\u2014taking refuge in a boarded-up house from which they venture only rarely, and with gas masks over their faces when there\u2019s a chance of contact, or even proximity, with someone affected by a lethal plague that\u2019s sweeping the planet.Claustrophobes had best not line up for tickets.

Yet       Roger Michell\u2019s       lush psychological thriller, starring       Rachel Weisz       and       Sam Claflin,        is more intricate, and interesting, than it first seems. It\u2019s a modified Gothic take on the       Daphne du Maurier       novel about a young Englishman, Philip, who plans to take revenge on his older, mysterious cousin for killing his beloved guardian, then falls madly in love with her and can\u2019t decide, any more than we can, whether she\u2019s guilty of murder or as innocent as she is beautiful.The novel, published in 1951, was brought to the screen the following year, with       Olivia de Havilland       and       Richard Burton       in the leading roles; that black-and-white production, currently available through streaming services, is worth watching after you see the new film, which is in elegant color.

The same goes for a wider spectrum of sexual energy. The earlier film was relatively decorous, with semi-bridled passions that befit the story and the era in which it was filmed. Now the lovers let loose, or at least looser, but wittily as well as ardently; Ms. Weisz and Mr. Claflin, superb performers individually, make an electrifying couple on screen.But what is a contemporary adaptation to do with the more conspicuous plot devices and melodramatic excesses of the Du Maurier novel? Mr. Michell and his stars choose to wink at them\u2014not so subtly that we don\u2019t notice, but not so blatantly that we\u2019re completely distanced from the essence of the drama. We are, if truth be told, partly distanced from several deep-purple passages, but at those times the film functions as a sort of modern interactive museum. Here, it is saying in effect, are old-fashioned conventions that still have life in them, but to appreciate them we need to approach them playfully.

If allowed to escalate, it risks undermining the U.S. campaign against Islamic State and the war in Afghanistan, both run out of the Al Udeid base near Qatar\u2019s capital Doha.The crisis over Qatar began just days after Mr. Trump essentially endorsed Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim to lead the Arab and Muslim world at a summit with dozens of regional leaders convened by       King Salman       in May in Riyadh. That claim is far from being universally accepted, even in Saudi Arabia\u2019s immediate neighborhood where Qatar\u2014fueled by its natural-gas wealth\u2014has long been a maverick.Whether Saudi Arabia brings Qatar to heel, and at what cost, will be a major test of the kingdom\u2019s rising ambitions.Geopolitical rivals including Turkey, Russia and predictably Iran are already lining up behind Qatar to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. On Wednesday, Turkey\u2019s parliament rushed a vote authorizing the dispatch of as many as 3,000 troops to Qatar. With Saudi airspace now closed to Qatari planes, Turkey and Iran have also offered a logistic lifeline allowing Doha to escape isolation.The immediate trigger for the Qatar crisis was almost comical in nature: a statement, allegedly by Qatar\u2019s emir, that criticized Saudi Arabia and Mr. Trump. It was published online by the Qatari news agency following the Riyadh summit. Qatar quickly said the news agency had been hacked and that the emir,       Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad,        never made these remarks. But by then, it didn\u2019t really matter.State-controlled media in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt went on a campaign against Qatar, demanding it end support for Islamist groups such as Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas and distance itself from Iran.After a defiant Sheikh Tamim made a phone call to the Iranian president, the Saudi-led nations on Monday cut diplomatic ties with the emirate and closed their land, airspace and ports to Qataris and Qatari trade. Unless Qatar buckles, these states envision additional sanctions such as punishing international companies that do business with Qatar.\u201cFor now, the Saudi camp seems to be dealing with Qatar as a Saddam with chemical weapons. They are adamant to escalate until the Qataris bow down,\u201d said       Hassan Hassan,        a fellow at the think tank Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.These steps are extraordinary considering that, just a week ago, Qataris, Emiratis and Saudis could freely live and work in each other\u2019s countries under Gulf Cooperation Council rules.But Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the U.A.E. have all nursed their own longstanding grievances with Qatar.Egyptian President       Abdel Fattah Al Sisi       resents Qatar\u2019s traditional support for the Muslim Brotherhood, his key domestic foe ever since he overthrew President       Mohammed Morsi,        a Brotherhood member, in 2013. One of the charges on which Mr. Morsi has been jailed is spying for Qatar. And one of Mr. Sisi\u2019s first steps after seizing power was also to detain the staff of Al Jazeera, the Doha-based TV network that reflects Qatar\u2019s ambitions to be a regional power.The U.A.E., one of Mr. Sisi\u2019s key backers, has its own history of hostility with Qatar. The U.A.E.\u2019s de facto leader,       Crown Prince Mohammed       bin Zayed, is staunchly opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood and has championed an uncompromising crackdown on Islamists across the region.This approach has put Qatar and the U.A.E. on opposite sides of the civil war in Libya, in addition to dividing them over Egypt. U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia briefly recalled their ambassadors from Doha in 2014.Then there is the issue of Iran. Qatar\u2019s main natural-gas field\u2014the source of the emirate\u2019s wealth\u2014is shared with Iran, a reality that forces Doha to adopt a relatively soft line toward Tehran. Unlike Saudi Arabia and a number of its allies, Qatar didn\u2019t cut diplomatic ties with Tehran after the Saudi Embassy there was ransacked in January 2016. But it did join\u2014until this week\u2019s expulsion\u2014the Saudi-led coalition fighting pro-Iranian Houthi forces in Yemen.With Qatar facing Saudi and U.A.E. pressure to expel exiled members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, the crisis has already provoked a rupture between Saudi Arabia and another major Sunni power, Turkey.Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan,        an Islamist himself, has refused to recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Sisi\u2019s rule and has offered shelter in Turkey to the Brotherhood and Hamas. In a departure from his recent rapprochement with Riyadh, he has condemned the sanctions against Qatar and praised the emirate\u2019s \u201ccoolheadedness\u201d and \u201cconstructive approach.\u201dThe harshness of the Saudi-led campaign against Qatar has also given pause to Kuwait and Oman, two fellow GCC monarchies that are trying to mediate the dispute. Both fear they could be next if Qatar loses the ability to run its affairs autonomously, something that already happened to Bahrain following a 2011 deployment there by Saudi and Emirati troops.Kuwait has Muslim Brotherhood members in parliament and, like Oman, is trying to remain neutral in Saudi Arabia\u2019s confrontation with Iran.From Tehran\u2019s standpoint, meanwhile, the Qatar crisis can only offer benefits, at least in the short run. The dispute has already undermined the GCC, weakened attempts to establish Sunni unity against Iran, and is likely to undermine Turkish-Saudi cooperation on behalf of Sunni rebels in Syria, said       Vali Nasr,        dean of School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a former State Department official.\u201cThe split, Tehran thinks, shows Saudis to be heavy-handed,\u201d Mr. Nasr said. \u201cThat will worry many actors and open doors for Iran in the region and across the Muslim world.\u201dWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The U.A.E. is a backer of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.

Drag racing is for morons and children, with a lot of Venn overlap between. Formula One is so numbing you could pierce my ears during the simulcast and I\u2019d never know.Le Mans is the 1%. The 24 Hours of Le Mans (this year, June 17-18) is the world\u2019s oldest endurance road-racing event, first staged in 1923 by the Automobile Club de l\u2019Ouest (ACO) in the Sarthe department of central France. The modernized, 8.47-mile circuit combines sections of public roads\u2014running through the villages of Arnage and Mulsanne\u2014with geologically scaled features such as the mighty Indianapolis curves, through which the elite prototype cars stream at 180 mph, even at night, headlights slashing the darkness, apparitions cloaked in Doppler-warped roar. This is a landscape of giants.Unlike Nascar\u2014a lame and noisy ruse to sell chicken wings\u2014the 24 Hours of Le Mans still means something. Using the world\u2019s most prestigious race as leverage, the ACO has required competing auto makers to lower consumption and invest in propulsion technology that might benefit a wider world. For example, some top-class Le Mans hybrid prototypes (LMP1\u2019s) have used lithium-ion batteries to store energy, while others have experimented with flywheels and supercapacitors.Consider the anatomy of last year\u2019s winner, the Porsche 919 Hybrid: a 2.0-liter, turbocharged V4 gas engine (500 hp) combined with huge electric power in front (400 hp) and two separate systems to recuperate energy: regenerative braking and exhaust gas turbines, both charging the lithium-ion battery. The LMP1 cars are allowed 8 megajoules (2.2 kwh) of energy-recovery per lap.However imperfect an instrument, the ACO\u2019s rules have gotten results. Last year\u2019s winning 919 Hybrid delivered about double the efficiency of Porsche\u2019s own Le Mans-winning GT1 of 1998; and the 919 covered hundreds of more miles in the process.Beneath my romantic exterior, I am a bitter cynic. I know international endurance racing is a business proposition, driven by global auto makers\u2019 money and marketing needs.             Toyota,       Porsche, Chevrolet Corvette come to Le Mans to sell cars. The ACO isn\u2019t exactly Unicef, either.But once the tricolore flag drops at 15h00 local time, nothing of the mercantile and pecuniary matters. Over the next 24 hours, the good and the wicked are betrayed equally. That is Le Mans\u2019 teachable moment. As French philosopher       Michel Foucault       observed, human reality is teased out only in the fraying of extreme experience. Or as I like to say, racing proves there is no God.Just ask Toyota. On a brilliant Sunday afternoon one year ago, the #5 Toyota prototype sports car, driven by       Kazuki Nakajima,        was leading the race with six minutes to go, comfortably ahead of the pursuing Porsche 919, which had made a late stop for tires. Scripts had been loaded into the teleprompters; champagne was chilling in the garage; victory hats waited in boxes. The Japanese flag had already been moved to the winner\u2019s rostrum.It\u2019s fair to say that everyone\u2014friend and foe, even team members of Porsche\u2014would have been happy to see the Japanese giant win, finally\u2014a mood of Please, put us out of your misery. In 18 appearances on motorsports\u2019 biggest stage, and after spending the hundreds of millions of dollars required to develop spaceshiplike prototypes, Toyota had placed second on four previous occasions, each an abyss of regret for team and company. Now victory was at hand.The last few minutes of a 24-hour endurance race are surreal anyway, as a whole day and night of heroic effort and purpose, armies of men and machines, all the genius and folly that is global motorsports become consecrated in just a few telling minutes.It\u2019s at this point that the Zen of Le Mans emerges. All the wheel-to-wheel combat you see, the dicing, the brake rotors glowing like jack-o\u2019-lantern? It\u2019s an illusion. To win, a car must cover the most distance in the elapsed 24 hours. Period. For example, last year\u2019s 919 Hybrid completed 384 laps while putting 3,252 miles under its carbon keel. As far as timing and scoring goes, cars might as well be alone on the track.The #5 Toyota was about this solitary mission when, at 14:54 local time, Mr. Nakajima radioed that the car had lost engine power (investigators later determined a failure in the turbocharger plumbing). The hybrid streamliner suddenly slowed, limping around the vast track until, pitilessly, it stopped at the start/finish line, between the packed grandstands and Toyota\u2019s own garages, which were even then swelling with dignitaries and guests.In the grandstands, flags stopped waving and horns grew quiet, as a couple-hundred thousand fans fell into a groan of bemused awe. Perhaps Kaz thought the race was over? Moments later the #2 Porsche 919 Hybrid that had chased the Toyota for six hours blasted past in a ruthless blur, on its way to Porsche\u2019s record 18th overall win.\u2018Unlike Nascar\u2014a loud and noisy ruse to sell chicken wings\u2014the 24 Hours of Le Mans still means something.\u2019As millions joined the broadcast, race commentators groped for words: cruel, unimaginable, gutting. Somehow, Toyota had managed to lose at Le Mans again from a position of dominating speed and limitless resources. Even in the Porsche garage there was no schadenfreude. \u201cTo give away such a great race this way on the last lap is something you wouldn\u2019t wish on your worst enemy,\u201d said team principal       Andreas Seidl.But while the Europeans in Toyota\u2019s pits allowed themselves tears, the Japanese executives and team managers just stood there looking up at the monitors, as impassive as Easter Island\u2019s moai. My God, that was a manly display. Cam Newton, take note.As I pack up for my 12th Le Mans, I hereby declare my partisanship in favor of Toyota. I demand justice. Motorsports fans remember that Toyota also competed in Formula One for eight seasons (2002-2009), spent hundreds of millions and never won a single race! The Curse of the Bambino was nothing compared with the hex on Toyota.I feel horrible for them, for it, I guess. Stipulated, Toyota is a soulless industrial concern employing hundreds of thousands. But it does exhibit a will, and an ego, and a personality, co-located in the boardroom of Toyota City. And around that table, I know they desperately want to win.Think of the national jubilation in Japan last month when Tokyo native       Takuma Sato       won the Indy 500. Sports victory on the global stage is very much a general joy in Japan, and motorsports\u2014with its resonances of national might\u2014brings particular validation.

It contained a kilogram of the opioid drug furanyl fentanyl\u2014and the name of an obscure Chinese company called Shenzhen Unique-Peptide Biotechnology Co. Ltd.The DHL package, with the firm\u2019s return address, was delivered to one of several alleged New York Bloods gang members who were indicted in March for drug trafficking, according to Paul Molinaro, a New York Police Department detective. The Chinese firm sent another package to the defendant\u2019s relative, and a third package that investigators believe was delivered to another defendant, said Det. Molinaro of Brooklyn\u2019s gang major case unit.Reached by phone, the Chinese firm denied sending the packages, saying it doesn\u2019t sell fentanyl compounds. The defendants who allegedly received the furanyl fentanyl have pleaded not guilty to all charges in the indictment.The direct purchases from China are part of a general migration of gang activity away from the street and toward the internet, which gangs see as less risky terrain. Increasingly, law-enforcement officials say, gangs are using the web to recruit members, steal credit information and contact drug suppliers.The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s New York branch says it is involved in multiple investigations in New York involving various gangs using the web to purchase fentanyl from China. The practice may also have surfaced in Chicago, where the DEA office says it is investigating a member of the Latin Kings gang that investigators believe bought fentanyl online from China.The charges against the alleged New York Bloods members are among the first high-profile indictments illustrating the trend. The alleged gang members started out buying many of their narcotics from a trafficking source in Phoenix, investigators say. But over time, some began buying directly from Chinese suppliers online, eliminating middlemen that can make drugs more expensive, according to Det. Molinaro.James Hunt, special agent in charge of the New York office of the DEA, said more gangs are using encrypted networks known as the dark web to make these purchases from China. He added that cutting out intermediaries makes the purchases harder to investigate because it deprives law-enforcement officials of human sources of intelligence.\u201cIt makes our job a lot harder. It\u2019s not the traditional narcotics investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this dark web...you pay for it on             PayPal,       you never have to meet the person or see the person and it\u2019s anonymous,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cThis is tough to penetrate.\u201dThe indictment in state court in Brooklyn alleges that 34 defendants sold heroin, cocaine and furanyl fentanyl, a relatively new form of fentanyl to surface on the black market.Various types of fentanyl have helped drive U.S. overdose death rates to records. Like heroin, fentanyl is an opioid, but it is many times more potent and is also cheaper and easier to produce, made from chemicals instead of poppies. In New York City, a proliferation of fentanyl compounds helped push fatal overdoses in 2016 to approximately 1,300, or triple the number of homicides.Furanyl fentanyl is a controlled substance under U.S. federal law but not yet under New York state law, where the health department is working to classify it as one. The New York indictment charges the alleged furanyl fentanyl transactions as attempted sales of a controlled substance because the defendants peddled the substance as heroin, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Office.The DEA says much of the illicit fentanyl hitting the U.S. market originates in China, often with a stop first in Mexico, where drug cartels mix it into heroin to stretch their supply. The manufacturers are often small companies operating in China\u2019s lightly regulated chemicals market, according to the DEA, although little has been reported about the firms.Shenzhen Unique-Peptide isn\u2019t named in the March indictment and hasn\u2019t been named publicly. The firm\u2019s corporate registry filing with the Chinese government shows the company is owned by a woman named Tang Li, and was incorporated in August 2016. The filing describes the company as a biotechnology firm involved in everything from researching pharmaceuticals to selling compounds used in cosmetics production.Ms. Tang couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Zhang Xueyou, who identified himself as a manager at the company and friend of Ms. Tang\u2019s, described Shenzhen Unique-Peptide as a tiny operation that has never dealt in fentanyl or related compounds, known as analogues.\u201cI have never heard of these products, and don\u2019t even know what they are,\u201d Mr. Zhang said of fentanyl compounds, adding that the company had had no contact with New York police over the case. \u201cWe are doing legal business,\u201d he said.Until very recently, the firm, based in Shenzhen in southeastern China, had an English-language             Facebook                   page where it promised seamless delivery. \u201cNo custom problem, promise reship for any package held by customs,\u201d said one December post. Another post said the firm accepts payment by methods including Western Union, Bitcoin and PayPal. The firm\u2019s Facebook page went offline late last month.The package allegedly shipped from the firm to the New York defendants was addressed to Kristian Cruz, a 22-year-old charged in the indictment with conspiracy, attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance and other crimes. The package was sent to Mr. Cruz at an address in Manhattan\u2019s East Village neighborhood, according to Det. Molinaro. Mr. Cruz pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. His lawyer declined to comment.Investigators seized the still-sealed package and the furanyl fentanyl it contained during a search of a second defendant\u2019s home\u201439-year-old Queens resident Joseph Raffone, according to Det. Molinaro.Det. Molinaro described Mr. Cruz, Mr. Raffone and many of the 34 defendants as members of the New York Bloods gang.In New York City, the Bloods gang is divided into factions, or crews, based off of the borough, neighborhood or even housing project where members reside, law-enforcement officials say. Det. Molinaro said these members grew up in Brooklyn and stretched their trafficking network throughout New York City to upstate New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arizona.The indictment alleges that Mr. Cruz and Mr. Raffone received both heroin and furanyl fentanyl through the mail, and supplied drugs to other members of the alleged trafficking ring for sale. Mr. Raffone is charged with conspiracy, the criminal sale of a controlled substance and other crimes. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.Reached by phone, Mr. Raffone denied that he was a member of a Bloods gang and described Mr. Cruz as his godson.DHL said it \u201ccontinually invests in screening and detection equipment as well as works very closely with local authorities to deter the shipment of drugs via our network.\u201d\u2014Kersten Zhang, Brian Spegele and Thomas MacMillan contributed to this article.Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com and Jeanne Whalen at jeanne.whalen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Gangs Cut Out Middleman.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 13:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-gangs-open-an-online-chinese-connection-for-opioids-1496943112", "news_title": "Drug Gangs Open an Online Chinese Connection for Opioids", "keywords": "chinese drug manufacturing,dark web,drug gangs,opioids,the bloods,New York Police Department,drug,substance usage,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,gangs,heroin,opioid usage,criminal enterprises,social issues,trafficking,smuggling"}, {"content": "Two elections in two countries within the space of three days, and history appears to be reasserting itself. The U.K. is turning away from the European Union and France turning toward it.Britain\u2019s suspicion of Continental entanglements dates back centuries. After World War II, its leaders shunned the Franco-German project that became the EU, certain it would fail. It finally joined in 1973, attracted by its economic success that contrasted with own decline. Now, once again, it is now turning its back.In almost every U.K. election outcome predicted by opinion polls, Britain moves further away from the EU. Even as anxiety rises in some business sectors\u2014not least about their ability to hire overseas workers post-Brexit\u2014and as higher inflation begins to erode living standards because of the drop in the pound following last year\u2019s referendum, the U.K. seems to be headed ineluctably out of the EU.France seems to be going in the other direction. President       Emmanuel Macron       campaigned on an unmistakably pro-EU ticket and has driven all before him. Opinion polls suggest that his new party\u2019s candidates will sweep the board in elections for the National Assembly, the first round of which is on Sunday. That will give him the mandate to push through long-awaited changes to the French economy that he hopes will cut unemployment and spur growth.\u201cThe elites in Britain and France have always had very different views on the merits of EU membership,\u201d says       Charles Grant,        director of the pro-EU Centre for European Reform.There are other differences across the English Channel. Mr. Macron has marginalized the traditional center-right and center-left parties of French politics, creating a powerful new force in the middle. The Gaullists and Socialists will be left as shadows on the fringes of the National Assembly, opinion polls predict.In the U.K., meanwhile, a political realignment seems as far away as ever and the traditional two-party system appears to have reasserted itself. Most constituency battles in England were two-way fights between the Conservative and Labour parties, though Labour\u2019s path to government is held back by the Scottish National Party\u2019s domination of Scotland, once a happy hunting ground for Labour.That difference is as much a consequence of the two countries\u2019 different political traditions as of any fundamental difference in political attitudes. Political realignments are more common in France\u2019s mixed presidential and parliamentary system. Britain\u2019s winner-take-all parliamentary system has made political transformations a once-in-a-century phenomenon.In both countries, voters appear to have been unsettled by globalization. Though Mr. Macron has promised economic reform, he has also supported Buy Europe policies, increasing trade defenses and boosting controls over foreign investments in important industrial sectors.\u2018The elites in Britain and France have always had very different views on the merits of EU membership.\u2019In the U.K., both Conservatives and Labour responded by moving to the left and pledging control over immigration. Labour promised a return to free school meals and free college tuition, as well as the nationalization of railways and utilities.For their part, the Conservative manifesto deviated dramatically from       Margaret Thatcher\u2019s       free-market legacy. It declared \u201cWe do not believe in untrammelled free markets.\u201d It added \u201cWe must reject the ideological templates provided by the socialist left and the libertarian right and instead embrace the mainstream view that recognises the good that government can do.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t had such an illiberal pair of political leaders\u201d in many decades, says Mr. Grant.Britain and France are thus diverging. A reform-minded French president has doubled down on the EU while the British have turned their backs on the bloc and seem less convinced of the power of markets.Both economies start out on these different paths at a similar size. Their different future trajectories will have a demonstration effect that could have important consequences for the future of Europe.If the British economy performs successfully, confounding the expectation of most economists who think Brexit makes success less likely, then leaving the EU may look less perilous to others. If the French economy outperforms while it is embedded inside the bloc, the economic arguments for other countries to leave will be weakened.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 13:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elections-in-u-k-and-france-reveal-diverging-eu-paths-1496943021", "news_title": "Elections in U.K. and France Reveal Diverging EU Paths", "keywords": "brexit,conservative party,emmanuel macron,eu future,eu membership,european union,french elections,french national assembly, labour party,theresa may,u.k. election,uk general election 2017,European Union,National Assembly,Scottish National Party,Emmanuel Macron,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "ROME\u2014A deal among Italy\u2019s biggest parties on a new electoral law fell apart Thursday, throwing into doubt the possibility that the country could hold snap elections as soon as the fall.Last week, Italy\u2019s main parties reached a tentative agreement on a new law that could have paved the way for elections as soon as September, far earlier than the 2018 timetable many had expected.Italy must hold national elections by May 2018. However, the country needs a new electoral law to eliminate discrepancies between the rules to elect members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Moreover, a court ruled earlier this year that parts of the current rules are unconstitutional.Last week, Italy\u2019s four main parties, including the ruling center-left Democratic Party and the antiestablishment 5 Star Movement, agreed on new rules whereby each party is awarded parliamentary seats in proportion to the votes it wins in an election, with a 5% threshold needed to enter the legislature. That deal raised speculation that Italy could go to vote as soon as September.But on Thursday, that deal fell apart over a minor amendment to the legislative proposal regarding the rules to elect candidates in an autonomous region in northern Italy. The vote on that amendment reflected fissures within the parties over the broader law, thus sinking the overall bill.\u201cThe electoral law is dead,\u201d said       Emanuele Fiano,        the Democratic Party lawmaker who sponsored the bill. Deliberations on the bill were immediately suspended. The Italian stock market surged 1.4% on investor relief that Italy could avoid an early poll.According to analysts, an agreement on a new law is still possible, but could take time and mean that Italy would go to the polls next spring.Alternatively, the government could present a new electoral law in the form of a legislative decree, thus avoiding a parliamentary vote.

His firm has seen wallcovering sales increase 6% over each of the past five years.Over the same five years, a 27% jump in wallpaper sales to the hospitality and commercial realms (where trends that spread to homes typically surface) \u201cspeaks to where the residential market is going,\u201d said       Matt Bruno,        head of the Wallcoverings Association.The cautiously curious might mix papers by sticking to one print in two colorways, said Farrow & Ball head of creative       Charlotte Crosby      : \u201cYou maintain the pattern but flex a bit with color.\u201d In the London living room shown here, she paired the coral and gray versions of her firm\u2019s Hornbeam print. Papered entirely in coral, the room might have overwhelmed, she said, but restricting the coral to underneath the chair rail \u201cgrounds the space.\u201dBraver souls can choose two or more patterns that share a color scheme. In his small TV room, also shown here,       Martyn Lawrence Bullard       of Los Angeles stuck to gray palettes, covering the walls with a Moorish geometric print and the ceiling with a striped pattern that mimics the look of Bedouin tents (both options come from his eponymous to-the-trade line). As a finishing touch, he bordered the two papers with black gift wrap. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Moroccan womb,\u201d he said.The truly intrepid can take a third tack: outfitting a room with two or more disparate wallcoverings in a wide range of patterns and hues that hang together thematically. Designer       Solange Azagury-Partridge       nailed this approach in her polychrome English country home. The key to working with seemingly chaotic mixes, she noted, lies in choosing papers with similar stylistic influences (all 1960s modern, for example). In her bedecked bedroom and its adjoining hallway, shown here, the walls all speak with an Asian inflection; she combined a wallpaper printed with a bamboo-trellis design and ornate chinoiserie fabrics found on eBay. Repeated notes of orange-red and citron also help the surfaces feel unified\u2014and entrancing. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m supposed to be watching television, I\u2019ll just be looking at the wallpaper,\u201d Ms. Azagury-Partridge said.So how does the design fan who\u2019s barely warmed to the idea of pattern on the wall navigate the options? Draw on this field guide to the flora, fauna and wild cards of the wallcovering world, with tips on how to master mixing.Capitalize on a common themeThe Satori kintsugi wallpaper and the National Gallery\u2019s portrait print speak to each other in hushed tones about the hand of the artist, and the woman\u2019s skin picks up the Satori\u2019s peachy hues. \u201cI would install the portrait paper at the end of a long hallway with the side walls washed in the softness and shimmer of the kintsugi,\u201d said Boston designer Melissa Hammond.Limit your paletteAn easy path to a pleasing match: Hew to a single color scheme. For Charleston designer Betsy Berry, the warm whites and creams in Aerin for Lee Jofa\u2019s Beaujeu Metallic Paper (far left) and the palest colorway of Arte International\u2019s Align pattern blend comfortably, the overall effect being \u201celegance with an organic touch.\u201dTurn up the contrastDark versus bright, serene versus energetic: The right angles of Callidus Guild\u2019s geometric paper (far left) contrast with the curves and droops of the de Gournay print (here, in Terracotta), but the two designs share warm tones. They \u201cfeed off each other beautifully,\u201d said Mitchell Hill, a Charleston designer, who pictures the combo in a library or breakfast room.Cut and pasteGet the lively mixmaster effect with a single wallpaper by hanging it both horizontally and vertically. This works best with lines (such as Timorous Beasties\u2019s Blotch Stripe), noted New York designer Richard Mishaan, who called the look \u201ca DIY Sol LeWitt,\u201d referring to the 20th- and 21st-century American artist who famously juxtaposed graphic patterns.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'WALLPAPER:An A-to-Z GUIDE.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 13:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-look-of-wallpaper-an-a-to-z-guide-1496942251", "news_title": "The Wallpaper Trick That Wows: An A-to-Z Guide", "keywords": "interior design,maximalism,mixing wallpapers,wall coverings,wallpaper,wallpaper as art,wallpaper murals,Charlotte Crosby,Dennis Shah,Kirill Istomin,Martyn Lawrence Bullard,Matt Bruno,Phillip Thomas,Solange Azagury-Partridge,political,general news,home improvements,living,lifestyle,real estate,property,converted paper products,paper bags,treated paper,technical services,design services,interior design services,business,consumer services,consumer goods,construction"}, {"content": "In September 1678, a brilliant young Irish scientist named       William Molyneux       married the beautiful       Lucy Domville.       By November she had fallen ill and become blind, and the doctors could do nothing for her. Molyneux reacted by devoting himself to the study of vision.He also studied vision because he wanted to resolve some big philosophical issues: What kinds of knowledge are we born with? What is learned? And does that learning have to happen at certain stages in our lives? In 1688 he asked the philosopher John Locke: Suppose someone who was born blind suddenly regained their sight? What would they understand about the visual world?In the 17th century, Molyneux\u2019s question was science fiction. Locke and his peers enthusiastically debated and speculated about the answer, but there was no way to actually restore a blind baby\u2019s sight. That\u2019s no longer true today. Some kinds of congenital blindness, such as congenital cataracts, can be cured.More than 300 years after Molyneux, another brilliant young scientist,       Pawan Sinha       of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has begun to find answers to his predecessor\u2019s questions. Dr. Sinha has produced a substantial body of research, culminating in a paper last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Like Molyneux, he was moved by both philosophical questions and human tragedy. When he was growing up, Dr. Sinha saw blind children begging on the streets of New Delhi. So in 2005 he helped to start Project Prakash, from the Sanskrit word for light. Prakash gives medical attention to blind children and teenagers in rural India. To date, the project has helped to treat more than 1,400 children, restoring sight to many.Project Prakash has also given scientists a chance to answer Molyneux\u2019s questions: to discover what we know about the visual world when we\u2019re born, what we learn and when we have to learn it.Dr. Sinha and his colleagues discovered that some abilities that might seem to be learned show up as soon as children can see. For example, consider the classic Ponzo visual illusion. When you see two equal horizontal lines drawn on top of a perspective drawing of receding railway ties, the top line will look much longer than the bottom one. You might have thought that illusion depends on learning about distance and perspective, but the newly sighted children immediately see the lines the same way.On the other hand, some basic visual abilities depend more on experience at a critical time. When congenital cataracts are treated very early, children tend to develop fairly good visual acuity\u2014the ability to see fine detail. Children who are treated much later don\u2019t tend to develop the same level of acuity, even after they have had a lot of visual experience.In the most recent study, Dr. Sinha and colleagues looked at our ability to tell the difference between faces and other objects. People are very sensitive to faces; special brain areas are dedicated to face perception, and babies can discriminate pictures of faces from other pictures when they are only a few weeks old.The researchers studied five Indian children who were part of the Prakash project, aged 9 to 17, born blind but given sight. At first they couldn\u2019t distinguish faces from similar pictures. But over the next few months they learned the skill and eventually they did as well as sighted children. So face detection had a different profile from both visual illusions and visual acuity\u2014it wasn\u2019t there right away, but it could be learned relatively quickly.The moral of the story is that the right answer about nature versus nurture is\u2026it\u2019s complicated. And that sometimes, at least, searching for the truth can go hand-in-hand with making the world a better place.Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'What the Blind See (and Don\u2019t) When Given Sight.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 13:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-blind-see-and-dont-when-given-sight-1496941631", "news_title": "What the Blind See (and Don\u2019t) When Given Sight ", "keywords": "alison gopnik, blindness, cataracts, health, medicine, molyneux, project prakah, research, science, sight, sinha,political,general news,psychology,sciences,humanities"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014            Toshiba Corp.        TOSYY -2.51%       didn\u2019t know its U.S. nuclear subsidiary was preparing for a bankruptcy filing even after the unit had hired lawyers for the task, according to court records and Toshiba\u2019s official timeline.In a Nov. 30, 2016, letter, a lawyer at New York firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP wrote that Toshiba unit Westinghouse Electric Co. had engaged the firm to work on \u201cthe potential filing and administration of a chapter 11 proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code.\u201dA Toshiba spokesman, reiterating earlier statements by company executives, said this week that no one at Tokyo headquarters was aware of the potential for major losses or bankruptcy at Westinghouse until early December 2016. Toshiba Chief Executive       Satoshi Tsunakawa       learned of the problem in mid-December, the spokesman said.At a news conference on Dec. 27, Mr. Tsunakawa said Toshiba was facing a multibillion-dollar loss in connection with cost overruns at Westinghouse nuclear projects in the U.S. but didn\u2019t discuss a possible bankruptcy.If Toshiba\u2019s timeline is accurate, it suggests poor communication between parent and subsidiary contributed to letting the problems at Westinghouse get out of hand. Toshiba, one of Japan\u2019s biggest and oldest conglomerates, has said it has doubts whether it is a going concern because of its unit\u2019s bankruptcy.Conversely, if Toshiba did know about the unit\u2019s bankruptcy plans ahead of time but failed to disclose them promptly, it could worsen trust among investors at a time when stock-exchange officials in Tokyo are weighing whether to delist Toshiba shares.Cost overruns and delays have long plagued nuclear-reactor projects undertaken by Westinghouse in Georgia and South Carolina. Some analysts had speculated for years that Toshiba might take a large hit on its Westinghouse holding. The Japanese company announced a write-down of some Westinghouse goodwill in April 2016 but maintained the nuclear unit had a bright future until revealing the larger losses at the Dec. 27 news conference.The Toshiba spokesman said the company began to consider a bankruptcy filing by its U.S. subsidiary around the time of that news conference\u2014about a month after the U.S. unit had already hired lawyers to prepare the filing.Westinghouse filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 on March 29. Toshiba, which owned 87% of Westinghouse at that point, has estimated that Westinghouse-related write-downs led to a loss of \u00a5950 billion ($8.65 billion) in the year ended March 31, 2017.A Westinghouse spokeswoman declined to comment. Lawyers at Weil Gotshal didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The November letter was part of court records released in April, but it didn\u2019t get wide notice at the time.In 2016 and early 2017, a key executive on the nuclear issue was Shigenori Shiga, who was chairman of Toshiba and long responsible for the company\u2019s energy business including Westinghouse, where he had earlier served as chairman of the board.Toshiba\u2019s account suggests either that Mr. Shiga didn\u2019t know Westinghouse had hired lawyers for a possible bankruptcy filing or, if he did know, that he didn\u2019t immediately convey news of the preparations to board colleagues in Tokyo including Toshiba\u2019s CEO. Toshiba declined to make Mr. Shiga available for comment and he couldn\u2019t be located.Toshiba didn\u2019t get its auditor\u2019s approval for October-December 2016 quarterly results and has yet to release audited results for the full fiscal year ended March 2017, citing a dispute with its auditor over whether its internal controls were adequate in accounting for Westinghouse.A self-regulatory body at             Japan Exchange Group Inc.,       which operates the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is reviewing Toshiba\u2019s status for possible delisting after a previous accounting scandal.Naoki Fujiwara,        a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management, said any evidence that Toshiba knew about Westinghouse\u2019s problems earlier than it has acknowledged \u201cwould give a bad impression in terms of appropriate disclosure\u201d and could affect the exchange\u2019s review. Others said Toshiba\u2019s reputation was already tarnished and its listing was being kept alive by political considerations such as the company\u2019s large workforce in Japan.An exchange spokesman declined to discuss specific issues in the review but said outside influences wouldn\u2019t affect the outcome.\u2014Takashi Mochizuki, Russell Gold and Peg Brickley contributed to this article.Write to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 13:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-didnt-know-its-nuclear-unit-was-preparing-for-bankruptcy-timeline-shows-1496922977", "news_title": "Toshiba Unaware Its Nuclear Unit Was Preparing for Bankruptcy, Timeline Shows ", "keywords": " bankrutpcy, nuclear power,toshiba, westinghouse,Toshiba,6502.TO,Westinghouse Electric,Weil Gotshal & Manges,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,nuclear power generation,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,legal services,technical services,business,consumer services,electric utilities,technology,utilities"}, {"content": "Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co. has spent roughly nine months working to reform the sales culture that led to a $185 million fine, public humiliation and the departure of its chief executive. Now, the bank is confronting\u00a0a new challenge: growing again.So far, the San Francisco-based lender has focused on cutting costs and urging investors to be patient, though shareholders, analysts and some employees question how the bank will match its past performance without the sales tactics that got it in trouble.Complicating the bank\u2019s challenge are broader factors including low interest rates and a sluggish U.S. economy. \u201cIf you turn the clock back 10 years ago, we were in an environment where the economy was growing more quickly and revenues, candidly, were a little bit easier to come by,\u201d Chief Executive       Timothy Sloan       said during an investor conference\u00a0last week.Wells Fargo was fined $185 million in September by regulators for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts that used fictitious or unauthorized customer information. The bank and regulators disclosed then that the bank had fired 5,300 employees over five years for improper behavior including opening up accounts for customers without their knowledge.Since the fall, the bank\u2019s revenue growth has slipped for the first time in years. Its shares are the worst performing of the four biggest U.S., banks both year to date and since the November election.Asked about growth, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman noted the bank\u2019s diversified business model and strong, steady results as well as opportunities in its wholesale, wealth and investment management, and consumer businesses.Getting the\u00a0retail division right is crucial for Mr. Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives.\u00a0It sits in the bank\u2019s community banking unit, which last year accounted for more than 50% of Wells Fargo\u2019s overall net income.Wells Fargo\u2019s return on equity, a key measure of profitability, was down to 11.5% last quarter from its recent high above 14% in 2014.Even as it contends with broader economic trends affecting all banks, Wells Fargo must address lingering and potentially distracting impacts of the scandal. Agreements with regulators have put the bank in a less likely position to ask for approval on certain deals it would have pursued in the past.In December, the bank was sanctioned over its \u201cliving will\u201d contingency plan, required of all banks, on how it would avoid a taxpayer bailout if it were about to go bankrupt. In March, it was downgraded on its ability and willingness to serve lower-income populations. The bank later passed the living-will test, and it is cooperating with other investigations.As it moves ahead, Well Fargo has many among its 75,000 retail-bank employees who feel hamstrung by the company\u2019s new way of doing business. The bank eliminated product sales goals, concluding they had been emphasized too much and led employees to use questionable tactics to meet their numbers.A new incentive-compensation system this year seeks to change the orientation of the retail division from lofty product-sales goals to a focus on customers\u2019 overall satisfaction. Employees are measured on customer service, customer usage and deposit growth, among other factors.Questions, however, persisted about the new strategy and growth during the bank\u2019s Investor Day last month.\u201cIt seems like a lot of what you\u2019re saying over retail strategy is pretty ambitious, and it seems like there\u2019s a fundamental tension between a lot of what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d UBS Securities LLC analyst Saul Martinez\u00a0said during the bank\u2019s investor day\u00a0last month.Mary Mack,        the executive in charge of Wells Fargo\u2019s retail branches, responded to Mr. Martinez that there is \u201calignment\u201d between the business changes she has enacted and the bank\u2019s growth plans. She also told analysts Wells Fargo was increasing its \u201cloans, deposits and investments.\u201dShe is also focused on shifting the bank\u2019s culture through\u00a0manager training\u00a0this summer and recent executive shuffling in her unit. \u201cWe have to help people continue to get comfortable with the change and create clarity\u201d for employees, she said in a recent interview.In preparing for certain reviews recently, a bank finance manager advised some regional executives they should be prepared for conversations\u00a0with Ms. Mack to shift from seeking stability postscandal \u201cto growth and strategies around spurring growth,\u201d according to an April email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Yet some employees have expressed concern it isn\u2019t clear how to drive new business absent the bank\u2019s prior emphasis on product sales. One executive said questions among employees include:\u00a0\u201cHow am I going to grow the business\u2026with these constraints? How do I do it in a way that doesn\u2019t appear to be sales pressure?\u201dMeanwhile, Wells Fargo\u2019s numbers are falling. In March,\u00a0the most recent data available, consumer checking-account openings at Wells Fargo fell 35% and credit-card applications dropped 42% from a year earlier.While the decline is less severe than seen soon after the September announcement, bank executives said last week that they don\u2019t expect the credit card business to bounce back for a few quarters. A spokeswoman noted that internal customer-loyalty scores had increased since the scandal.Speaking at last week\u2019s industry conference, Mr. Sloan said it would take time for the company\u2019s postscandal approach to bear fruit. \u201cYou don\u2019t just roll out a plan to 75,000 people and say, \u2018Good Luck,\u2019 right?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of management that is required to make sure that that plan is in place.\u201dWrite to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 12:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-focuses-on-pivot-from-scandal-to-growth-1496914205", "news_title": "Wells Fargo\u2019s New Mission: Growth, Not Scandal", "keywords": "consumer credit,financial products,financial regulations,retail banking,revenue growth,u.k. banks,Wells Fargo,WFC,WFCL,Saul Martinez,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Belgium\u2019s dysfunctional, understaffed security apparatus and outdated legal restrictions prevented the arrests of the main assailants ahead of the Paris terror attacks in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016, according to a parliamentary inquiry.A special committee of the Belgian parliament, established to examine failings in the lead-up to the terror attacks, Thursday presented a 500-page report prepared\u00a0after hearing nearly 200 witnesses. The committee concluded that Belgian police, intelligence and judicial services failed to share crucial leads and \u201cmissed the opportunity to dismantle the terror network in time.\u201dSome errors were particularly glaring. As reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier this year, police failed to analyze the contents of phones, laptops and USB drives seized during a February 2015 house search of the Abdeslam brothers, two of the assailants in the attack on Paris, in which 130 people were killed.Due to the high number of cases that Belgian counterterror police were tracking, the seized devices stayed untouched until after the Paris attacks in November 2015. One of the phones got lost while in custody. Found late last year, the phone turned out to contain             Facebook                   instant messages dating back to 2014 between       Brahim Abdeslam      \u2014one of the Paris suicide bombers\u2014and his neighborhood friend,       Abdelhamid Abaaoud,        who was a wanted Islamic State operative at the time. Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of the Paris cell, was killed in a shootout with French police a few days after the Paris attack.In addition to the lost phone contents, Belgian counterterror police had other tips that the Abdeslam brothers were radicalizing and in touch with Abaaoud. But, due to lack of resources, they were unable to substantiate those claims and in June 2015, a judge closed the case against them for lack of evidence.The parliamentary committee recommended better information sharing in so-called fusion cells, where intelligence officers would share leads on ongoing terror investigations with counterterrorism police and the relevant local police chiefs.Another recommendation is to give prison managers security clearances to access a national list of suspected terrorists. The committee discovered that       Oussama Atar,        the suspected mastermind of the March 22\u00a0attacks on Brussels, visited       Ibrahim       and       Khalid el-Bakraoui       in prison 20 times. The brothers were later suicide bombers in the Brussels attacks.Mr. Atar, a former detainee and terror suspect to U.S. authorities who held him in the Iraqi prison at       Abu Ghraib,        returned to Belgium in 2012 after he convinced Belgian authorities he was suffering from a severe illness, which turned out to be false. Mr. Atar, who is still at large, coordinated the travel of the Paris and Brussels attackers from Syria to Europe.Mr. Atar is a cousin of the El Bakraoui brothers, who were jailed for armed robberies, he is believed to have radicalized them during his visits to the prison, which weren\u2019t flagged to security services, says       Laurette Onkelinx,        one of the lawmakers who drafted the report. The El Bakraoui brothers were released on parole in 2014 and Ibrahim attempted to travel to Syria but was intercepted by Turkish authorities and put on a plane to Amsterdam.The committee recommended that parole officers receive special training to detect signs of radicalization and to more stringently follow-up on convicts released early.Under current rules, convicts can be released on parole as long as they weren\u2019t convicted of murder.In response to the parliamentary probe, Prime Minister       Charles Michel       said his government will analyze the recommendations and decide whether legislative changes are needed. His office said that since 2015, several measures had been taken to increase the country\u2019s security budget, hire more personnel and expand telecommunications surveillance to more categories of suspects. Over the past two years, Mr. Michel\u2019s office added, 267 terrorism suspects were convicted and 59 are currently in custody awaiting trial.Write to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 12:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brussels-report-on-terror-attacks-highlights-security-services-failings-1496934109", "news_title": "Brussels Report on Terror Attacks Highlights Security Services Failings", "keywords": " brussels attacks, brussels security services, counter extremism, europe counterterrorism, is,paris attacks,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations,domestic politics,prisons,prisoners,regional politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "David B.

Yet motive is frequently fabricated and used politically to undermine an opponent\u2019s arguments. Now the court is in the motive guessing game which, since it is not fact based, has no limits. The authors suggest this approach is \u201can invitation to the judiciary to direct the nation\u2019s foreign and defense policies.\u201dConsider a court order prohibiting the president from firing cruise missiles into Syria after its use of chemical weapons because Syria is a Muslim country. Consider a court order invalidating a revised Nafta agreement less favorable to Mexico because in a campaign speech the president said: \u201cThey are not our friend, believe me,\u201d and accused the country of intentionally sending drug dealers, criminals and rapists to the U.S. The hypotheticals are limitless.Using surmised motive beyond the facts of a bill or executive order to determine constitutional compliance is nothing more than a license to legislate.Glen EsnardNewport Beach, Calif.It appears that the judiciary has become a major front in a civil war conducted by other means. When the courts become the main political arena and so politicized that judges\u2019 votes on contentious issues can be foreseen with near certainty, and when neither party seems willing or able to consent to the selection by an opposing president of judges at the highest level, the system is broken.Bill DouglasMedford, Mass.The original travel ban imposed in late January sought a 90-day moratorium on travel to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim nations.More than four months have passed, ample time for the Trump administration to adopt the new rigorous protocols cited in the ban, thereby invoking the doctrine of \u201cmootness,\u201d enshrined by Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution.Absent a \u201ccase or controversy,\u201d the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would better serve the country by ensuring prompt implementation of the tightened vetting procedures rather than squandering more tax dollars on a moot appeal.Gregory G. SarnoCastro Valley, Calif.Messrs. Rivkin and Casey cite Kerry v. Din (2015), a case in which the justices affirmed a denial of a visa to a complainant\u2019s husband who had been a member of the Taliban. Sounds reasonable. We don\u2019t want any members of the Taliban gaining entrance to the U.S. They then use this as their precedent, referring back to the language of \u201ca facially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d to deny entry. So from that very individual case, do the gentlemen mean to say that all proposed entrants to the U.S., the many hundreds of thousands or even millions, who come from the banned list will be and can be denied entry because we know in advance there will be a facially legitimate and bona fide reason? This, before the fact, as in a blanket denial?If it walks, talks and looks like discrimination, it is discrimination.

In the case of the travel ban, federal judges are crying foul because policy outcomes don\u2019t have an acceptably proportionate effect on all religious groups.

Another official identified three of the people involved in the attacks as Iranians.Iranian authorities haven\u2019t released the attackers\u2019 identities but the Intelligence Ministry published grisly photos purporting to be of five of their bodies, along with their first names.The twin attacks took place at Iran\u2019s parliament in Tehran and the shrine of Ayatollah       Ruhollah Khomeini,        the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding figure, which lies south of the city center. They were the first Islamic State-claimed attacks inside Iran, bringing the regional battle against the Sunni Muslim extremist group to the heart of Shiite Iran.The breach in security at two heavily guarded and symbolic pillars of the Iranian system could raise questions about the country\u2019s military strategy and the ability of newly re-elected President       Hassan Rouhani\u2019s       ability to shield it from extremism, analysts have said.Many Iranians were defiant in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, exchanging messages on social media expressing togetherness, although some also pointed to the costs of Iran\u2019s military involvement in Syria and Iraq and its failure to keep extremism at bay.Iranian leaders, including Mr. Rouhani, said the attacks would only strengthen Iran\u2019s resolve to fight terrorism. \u201cThe Iranian nation will withstand terror, violence and extremism more resiliently than before,\u201d he said, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.Islamic State claimed responsibility shortly after the attacks in a statement posted to its official Amaq news agency.The attackers were working in concert with Islamic State in areas of the Middle East controlled by the extremist group, Mr. Seifollahi said.Islamic State once held large swaths of territory across its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, but has more recently fallen back on guerrilla-style suicide attacks as it faces battlefield losses.The attackers had joined Islamic State and left Iran to fight in Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, an intelligence ministry statement said Thursday.

In mid-December, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington released satellite photos that showed China deploying weapons on artificial islands constructed in the past three years. These developments have alarmed Southeast Asian nations because they suggest Beijing intends to further change the status quo in the South China Sea with force or the threat of force.Beijing has repeatedly said that such moves are defensive, and that it can do what it likes on its own territory. And it\u2019s true that a state generally has the right to do as it wishes on sovereign territory.But features in the Spratly Islands are claimed by five other claimants. International law on the responsibility of an occupying state in a disputed area is far from clear.China\u2019s actions are all the more surprising given its self-image as the region\u2019s peacemaker. Last month, President       Xi Jinping       called the Belt and Road Initiative an attempt to \u201ccreate . . . a big family of harmonious co-existence.\u201dThe most prudent course for all claimants in the South China Sea would be to refrain from provocative activities, especially those that involve irreversible changes to a feature. The Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea concluded between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states in 2002 explicitly exhorts parties to \u201cexercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.\u201d Beijing has warned its neighbors not to increase their presence on features under their control.In April, Philippine President       Rodrigo Duterte       ordered his military to occupy features under the country\u2019s control in the South China Sea. The president also mentioned that he might visit Thitu Island (also known as Pag-asa Island), the largest feature the Philippines occupies in the Spratly Islands.A week later, after Beijing had some strong words with Mr. Duterte, the president made an about-turn, announcing that he would no longer push through with his plan. He explained that the Chinese government convinced him that it would cause trouble if \u201cevery head of state of the contending parties . . . will go there to plant their flags.\u201dBeijing\u2019s call for restraint wasn\u2019t based on claims that Mr. Duterte\u2019s proposed actions were unlawful. Rather it was prompted by the likelihood that such actions would raise tensions and spark off a negative spiral of action and reaction.The reasoning behind China\u2019s advice to the Philippines could also usefully be applied to Beijing\u2019s island-building and construction activities as well as its reported deployments of weapons and equipment on features it occupies. China isn\u2019t the only nor the first claimant to engage in such activities, but the speed and scale of development has dwarfed others and caused much anxiety in the region and beyond.Moreover, none of China\u2019s actions in this respect bolster its claims in the South China Sea. A court or tribunal doesn\u2019t look at state actions after a dispute arises to determine sovereignty.In pursuing these actions, Beijing is likely motivated more by the worrying goal of seeking to change the status quo on the ground. Enhancing its physical presence on features increases its ability to project power in the region.Some analysts have criticized China\u2019s island-building and construction activities, as well as its \u201cmilitarization\u201d of features for flouting a 2016 United Nations tribunal\u2019s decision on the South China Sea. But such criticism is misguided.The tribunal didn\u2019t rule on whether China\u2019s island-building and construction activities as well a militarization of the high-tide features it occupies in the Spratly Islands, including Fiery Cross Reef, were unlawful. The lawfulness of these acts depend on whether China has sovereignty over these features, which the tribunal did not determine, and the responsibility of an occupying state in disputed areas, which is unclear.Rather, the tribunal ruled that China\u2019s island-building and construction activities were unlawful because they violated environmental obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), aggravated and extended the dispute before the tribunal and had the effect of permanently destroying evidence of the natural condition of features in question.Nevertheless, China\u2019s actions, including recent reports of deployments of weapons, are worrying because they undermine trust, heighten tensions and encourage retaliatory measures by other parties. They also run counter to the obligation of restraint under the 2002 declaration between China and Asean member states.All parties who have an interest in lowering tensions in a fraught region should hold themselves to two tests: first, adherence to international law, including Unclos; and second, restraint where action might not necessarily be unlawful but would nonetheless increase tensions. Peace and stability in the region depend on this.As China comes bearing gifts and countries seek to assess its intentions, Beijing\u2019s willingness to consistently abide by these two tests will be an important gauge of its sincerity in seeking a \u201cbig family of harmonious co-existence.\u201d It will also indicate the type of power China will be.

Lower interest rates tend to make euro-area assets less attractive to investors and weaken the currency.The euro briefly dipped below $1.12 following the announcement. It later recovered a bit to trade at $1.1208 late in the afternoon London time, down 0.5% on the day.\u201cThe tone was really dovish\u201d from the ECB, said       Cosimo Marasciulo,        head of European fixed income at Pioneer Investments. \u201cClearly the revision down in inflation is significant.\u201dInvestors were expecting a revision to inflation projections following media reports\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that said the ECB was preparing to cut its inflation outlook. That may have limited Thursday\u2019s currency move given the euro fell on the back of those reports that day.ECB President       Mario Draghi       said the central bank had lowered its inflation forecasts to 1.5% in 2017 from 1.7% previously, to 1.3% in 2018 from 1.6% beforehand and 1.6% in 2019 from 1.7%. Lower inflation could point to lower rates and other looser monetary policy, such as continued bond buying, which would hit the euro.German government bonds rallied slightly, with the yield on the 10-year note declining slightly following the announcement to end roughly flat on the day at 0.256%, according to Tradeweb. Yields fall as prices rise.Riskier eurozone government debt, meanwhile, built on gains made earlier in the day. The yield premium to hold 10-year Italian government debt over ultrasafe German bonds narrowed more than 0.1 percentage point from Wednesday\u2019s close to 1.91 percentage points, according to Tradeweb. Italian bonds received a boost following reports Thursday the country is now unlikely to hold snap elections.\u201cThe ECB\u2019s dovish tone is also helping the rally,\u201d said Mr. Marasciulo.ECB officials said in their statement that the bank\u2019s \u20ac60 billion ($67.55 billion) monthly purchase program would continue until at least the end of 2017 and could be increased or extended if needs be.

Markets shouldn\u2019t confuse the move however. The message remains very dovish.Importantly, ECB staff, despite raising their growth outlook, cut forecasts for inflation to 1.5% in 2017, 1.3% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019\u2014still some distance from the target of \u201cbelow, but close to\u201d 2%.

So while the ECB dropped its easing bias on interest rates\u2014a cheap concession, since no one expected a further rate cut\u2014it officially remains ready to extend or expand its bond-purchase program. That makes it hard to see Thursday\u2019s tweak as a real step toward the exit from ultraloose monetary policy.But further bond buying may yet prove tricky. In the past two months, purchases of German bonds have fallen short of the amount indicated by the \u201ccapital key\u201d that divides up buying across eurozone members by size. That has raised some concerns about scarcity of paper to buy.Mr. Draghi insisted that the program had flexibility built into it. It buys debt from public-sector entities, not just central governments. UniCredit suggests, for instance, that bigger purchases of German states\u2019 bonds could be an option, although they are illiquid and hence harder to buy.Still, this is reason to expect a slower pace of purchases in 2018 versus the current \u20ac60 billion ($67.5 billion) a month, even though the ECB clearly doesn\u2019t want to talk about it now. The ECB has already had to revise its program by allowing the purchase of bonds yielding less than the deposit rate of minus-0.4%. Other limits, such as abandoning the capital key or raising the 33% issuer limit, are much harder political lines to cross.Investors, judging by the calm in the euro and European interest rates, seem willing for now to be patient.

Private-equity giant             KKR                   & Co. last week closed a $9.3 billion fund dedicated to investments in Asia, the largest such in the region, citing \u201crising consumption and urbanization trends,\u201d as well as attractive valuations.             Carlyle Group                   LP and Warburg Pincus LLC have also raised Asia or China funds during the past year.The pickup suggests Asia-focused private-equity funds are ready to stock up on cash again after slowing to concentrate on using the money they had already collected, and to let some surging valuations\u2014particularly in Chinese startups\u2014come down. Private-equity fundraising for Asia dropped to $42 billion last year from $68 billion in 2014, while unused capital\u2014so-called dry powder\u2014rose to $147 billion as of September 2016 from $110 billion at the end of 2014, according to data provider Preqin.Now, industry watchers say that many investments in Asia look reasonably priced again, while global investors are flush with cash from a few years of good private-equity returns.In the first quarter of this year, more funds targeted Asia to deploy their investments than any other region in the world except North America, according to Preqin. Asia-focused private-equity funds have raised about $29 billion so far this year, ahead of the roughly $20 billion raised in the first half of last year, Preqin said.\u201cThere\u2019s no denying underlying tailwinds, such as a rising middle class, that present Asia as an attractive opportunity,\u201d said Christopher Elvin, Preqin\u2019s head of private-equity products.Morgan Stanley\u2019s new fund will be the fifth from its Asian private-equity arm, and is expected to be slightly larger than the previous one, which raised $1.7 billion in 2014. The funds are weighted heavily toward investments in China and in industrial- and consumer-product companies.They have had successes including a return of nearly five times the $26 million investment in Hong Kong financial services firm AMTD Financial Planning Ltd., when Morgan Stanley sold the majority of its stake in 2015, according to an internal marketing document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The funds netted investors an annual return of 19.4% after fees as of September 2016.Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia has had one significant black eye, however: Chinese chemicals firm Tianhe Chemicals Group, in which it invested a few years before the company went public on the Hong Kong exchange in 2014.Hong Kong regulators recently suspended Tianhe from trading over concerns that the company\u2019s initial public offering prospectus and other statements had \u201cmaterially false, incomplete or misleading information,\u201d Tianhe said in a securities filing. Tianhe said it is seeking legal advice on how to address the regulator\u2019s concerns and resume trading.All-Stars, which has more than $1 billion under management, was also an early investor in Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and Airbnb Inc. rival Tujia. It is looking to put money in domestic internet startups again, now that the skyrocketing valuations that many Chinese tech firms had a few years ago have come down, said Mr. Ji, a former Morgan Stanley analyst who left to start the fund in 2014 with his colleague Fu Mingxia.Mr. Ji said part of the pressure on valuations has come from a scarcity in dollar funding for Chinese startups due to the tightening in China\u2019s capital controls during the past year. That tightening has made it harder for the Chinese investors who provided some of that funding to convert their yuan into dollars. Investors are also skeptical about the outlook for China\u2019s economic growth, he said. That growth is expected to continue slowing during the next few years.Still, All-Stars bets that Chinese internet companies and other tech firms will continue to grow fast even if traditional industries falter, he said. The new fund has attracted interest from Chinese technology firms and U.S. billionaires, Mr. Ji said.Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Private-Equity Funds Take Aim at Asia.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 12:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-aiming-to-raise-2-billion-for-new-asia-private-equity-fund-1496937517", "news_title": "Private-Equity Funds Place Multibillion-Dollar Bets on Asia        ", "keywords": "pe fund news,private equity funds,Warburg Pincus L.L.C.,Didi Chuxing Technology,KKR &,KKR,Airbnb,Xiaomi,Tianhe Chemicals Group,AMTD Financial Planning,Tujia Online Information Technology (Beijing),Carlyle Group,CG,Richard Ji,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,chemicals,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,retail,wholesale,etailing,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,basic materials,resources,credit,cellular,mobile phones,e-commerce,financial services,handheld electronic devices,internet,online,investing,securities,leisure,arts,hospitality,smartphones,technology,sharing economy services,tourism"}, {"content": "THE WINES OF SPAIN are unquestionably popular, but while the reds and whites sell very well, the ros\u00e9s, well-made and affordable, often sit on the shelves.

At each of the four Gary\u2019s stores in suburban New Jersey there are around 100 different ros\u00e9s\u2014the vast majority from France, and the vast majority of those from Provence. On the shelf in front of us, only six hailed from Spain. \u201cWe really have to listen to the customer,\u201d said Mr. Visser. \u201cIf they want Provence, that\u2019s what we have to give them.\u201dMr. Visser brought Spanish and French ros\u00e9s to the store\u2019s tasting desk. The Spanish ros\u00e9s that were pale and packaged with simple, tasteful labels like the Proven\u00e7al wines did well, he said. The French know how to turn out bestsellers, as in the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans Whispering Angel from C\u00f4tes de Provence, whose pale hue and flagon-shape bottle helped make it a hit.The 2016 Vega Sindoa ros\u00e9 from Navarra, Spain, looked downright lurid by comparison, with its neon-bright label and dark red color. Such a wine has to be actively promoted by the staff, said Mr. Visser. It was, in retail parlance, a \u201chand sell.\u201dEric Solomon       of European Cellars in Charlotte, N.C., has imported wines from France and Spain for several decades and often advises producers on what will sell stateside. For example, he counseled the winemakers behind Bodegas Izadi in Rioja on their 2016 Larrosa ros\u00e9, from production to packaging. The result\u2014a pale-peach-colored wine\u2014looks a lot like Whispering Angel, is quite refreshing and lively and, at $12 a bottle, is a very good deal.Mr. Solomon acknowledged that achieving the Proven\u00e7al style was a driving force behind the design, but he also believes the paler Spanish ros\u00e9s reflect a general retreat from big, dark Spanish wines. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that mirrors the move away from extraction and the \u2018big is better\u2019 approach that defined much of the emerging Spanish wine landscape for red wines in the late 1990s and early 2000s,\u201d he wrote in an email.The portfolio of Polaner Selections, an importer based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., includes several pale ros\u00e9s from various parts of Spain. \u201cIt\u2019s Proven\u00e7al or Proven\u00e7al-looking wines and then everything else,\u201d said       Adam Rieger,        Polaner\u2019s Spanish-wine portfolio director. One of my favorites among Polaner\u2019s offerings came about almost accidentally, when an Australian importer asked the winemaker at Bodegas Exopto in Rioja\u2014a Frenchman named       Tom Puyaubert      \u2014to produce a ros\u00e9 for Australia. Mr. Puyaubert had a vineyard, planted to Garnacha, that was a bit too cool to produce a fully ripe red but ideal for making a ros\u00e9. The result, the 2016 Bozeto de Exopto Rosado, was such a hit that Mr. Puyaubert began bottling more and selling it abroad.According to Ana Fabiano, the North American trade director of the Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Rioja (DOCa) and the author of \u201cThe Wine Region of Rioja,\u201d her group counsels Rioja\u2019s rosado producers to label their wines ros\u00e9s, as that is \u201cthe universal market term,\u201d said Ms. Fabiano. (Spanish producers can use either or both words on labels; in Rioja, they can also use \u201cclarete\u201d to indicate a particular kind of pale wine with an orange tinge.)\u201cProbably about 80% of the ros\u00e9s from Spain are made in Rioja,\u201d Ms. Fabiano said. Other ros\u00e9-producing regions include neighboring Navarra, whose ros\u00e9s tend to be more deeply colored\u2014much like Basque Txakolina ros\u00e9s, which range from light-red to frothy and pink.I found a few attractive Txakolinas, including a delicious if rather expensive sparkling Ameztoi \u201cHijo de Rubentis\u201d Txakolina ros\u00e9 ($28) and a lively still one from the same producer ($18), as well as a couple of ros\u00e9 cavas. The Jaume Serra Cristalino ros\u00e9, a fun, fruity, dark-red sparkler, goes for a mere $10.\u2018The Spanish ros\u00e9s that were pale and packaged with simple, tasteful labels like the Proven\u00e7al wines did well.\u2019Still, the majority of the wines I bought were from Rioja, in the requisite pale-salmon color. Some were made entirely from Garnacha or a blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha and the white grape Viura. One of my favorites, a wine I buy year after year, the soft and beguiling 2016 Muga Rioja Ros\u00e9 ($12), has the prescribed pale color\u2014though it was not made in response to the market, said Muga\u2019s export director,       David de la Fuente.       Muga has been making this style \u201csince the foundation of the winery in 1932.\u201dThe pale Rioja ros\u00e9s were refreshing and bright, apart from a few rather simple, dilute ones. The more substantial Rioja ros\u00e9s paired well with food. The cherry-colored 2016 Bodegas Ilurce Rio Madre Rioja Ros\u00e9 ($8), for instance, had a richer, fruitier profile that proved a boon to sausage cooked on the grill.Those unsold bottles on the shelves notwithstanding, the larger picture is bright for Spanish ros\u00e9s. More than 40 Rioja producers are selling ros\u00e9s in this country today, compared to just 15 in 2014. At Gary\u2019s Wine, sales are up 100% over last year, said Mr. Visser. Is it thanks to their pale color, better packaging and low prices, or is it simply because they\u2019re a real pleasure to drink?\u2014Email Lettie at wine@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   About 80% of the rose\u0301s from Spain are from the regions of Rioja and Navarra, says the Denominacio\u0301n de Origen Rioja.

They include supercharging the bloc\u2019s securities regulator, softening rules for small investment firms and supporting markets to unload sour loans plaguing bank balance sheets.The announcement comes the same day as\u00a0Britain goes to the polls for a national election that will likely determine the country\u2019s strategy for exiting the EU.The commission has been working since 2015 on a plan to energize the bloc\u2019s economy by boosting capital markets and reducing\u00a0Europe\u2019s dependence on bank lending.\u00a0Traditional loans account for some 75% to 80% of total economic funding in Europe, a far higher share than in the U.S.But since September the commission said it was accelerating and amplifying the project because of Brexit.Critics say the original capital markets union project wasn\u2019t ambitious enough, in part because it was crafted with an eye toward avoiding objections to excessive EU intervention in national affairs from the U.K., which is set to leave the bloc by\u00a0March 2019.Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, said Thursday\u2019s measures were nothing new.\u00a0\u201cThe commission once again presents old wine in new skins and wants everyone to applaud,\u201d Mr. Ferber said.EU commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen acknowledged at a press conference\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that building a capital markets union would take time\u2014perhaps\u00a0up to 10 years.The commission said it plans to put forward proposals that would strengthen the European Securities and Markets Authority by late 2017. Paris-based ESMA is likely to acquire supervision powers over\u00a0EU markets. The regulator is currently only directly\u00a0responsible for supervision in two areas\u2014trade repositories and credit-rating firms.In addition to bolstering capital markets, the EU is focused\u00a0on promoting the nascent fintech sector rather than regulating it given London is one of the bloc\u2019s leading fintech hubs.The commission said it was considering an EU-wide passport that would allow fintech firms\u2014companies ranging from digital banks and payment-services providers\u2014to operate without having to obtain licenses in each EU country. Divergent regulation is currently obstacle to such businesses since\u00a0national authorities each have different capacities, experiences and attitudes toward the industry.Lastly, the commission is working on legislation that would break down barriers to entry for investors interested in the bloc\u2019s nonperforming loan market. Other initiatives would seek to harmonize insolvency laws that vary across nations to recuperate collateral in a timely manner.Nonperforming loans amount to over \u20ac1 trillion (about $1.12 trillion) across Europe.Write to Julia-Ambra Verlaine at julia.verlaine@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 11:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-unveils-steps-to-bolster-capital-markets-and-investment-after-brexit-1496937333", "news_title": "EU Unveils Steps to Bolster Capital Markets and Investment After Brexit ", "keywords": "brexit,capital markets,esma,eu,european commission,european securities and markets authority,european union,fintech,European Commission,European Union,economic performance,indicators,bank loan data,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "DUBAI\u2014P&O Maritime, a subsidiary of Dubai-based DP World, has bought a Spanish maritime services provider, in a move that will help the company tap new markets and grow its services businesses.DP World in a brief statement Thursday said the acquisition of Reyser allows the company to consolidate its market position in Spain and secure entry into new geographies.

Hedge fund returns from actively trading public stock markets in recent years have often been poor, while concerns have grown that strong gains from passively tracking equity markets could quickly reverse.Private equity returns, in contrast, have been buoyant of late. Funds produced an annualized 15.3% over the three years to September, according to a blended return from funds compiled by data group Preqin. Hedge funds\u2019 annualized return was just 5.6% over the same period.Elliott, which runs $32.7 billion and is well known for activist campaigns in stocks such as         Akzo Nobel               and         Arconic Inc.       and a lengthy and successful battle over payouts to Argentine debt holders, has invested in private equity for years.

Tools introduced in the province of Ontario in April, most notably a tax on foreign house buyers, may already be playing a role in cooling Toronto housing, the bank said.\u201cThe financial system weaknesses and exposures that helped transform a house-price correction into a large and persistent rise in unemployment during the 2007-09 crisis are not present in Canada,\u201d the central bank said. It said a risk associated with a prolonged slump in commodity prices has dissipated, and the economy is gradually improving.The Bank of Canada\u2019s semiannual review assesses vulnerabilities in the financial system, and identifies potential risks to financial stability that may not necessarily be triggered. The central bank last published its review in December.On eight occasions starting in 2008, federal and provincial authorities in Canada have introduced measures to tamp down housing exuberance. But housing has been a crucial growth engine for the country, as TD Bank estimates that 40% of Canadian economic output since 2014 is tied to real estate.The International Monetary Fund said last week authorities should consider more tax-based measures to discourage housing speculation.In Canada, the ratio of household debt to after-tax income is nearing 170% in Canada. Borrowing\u2014the bulk in mortgages and drawdowns on home-equity lines of credit\u2014has climbed at a roughly 6% pace from a year ago in recent months, or well above wage gains. This can be attributed to \u201cexceptionally strong\u201d annual house-price gains of 32% in the Toronto area as of April, and above 20% in greater Vancouver, the bank said.In Toronto, price growth \u201chas been too fast for normal market activities,\u201d the central bank said. It said speculation and what it calls \u201cextrapolative expectations\u201d\u2014or a widespread belief among buyers and investors that house prices will continue to move upward\u2014are driving the Toronto market. When combined with elevated levels of debt, \u201cthis activity can be destabilizing.\u201dRecent data suggest Toronto-area housing activity could be slowing, amid nonrate tools to contain exuberance.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Kim Eckart.Socially responsible investing has long been an option for investors who want to support companies aligned with their ideals. In recent years, there has been a growing subset of SRI known as biblically responsible investing, or investing in companies that embody Christian values.BRI is a space with enormous potential: According to a study by Kingdom Advisors, evangelical Christians control $6.7 trillion of assets in the U.S., not counting their primary residence, and they are increasingly looking for an investment approach that supports their point of view.At its core, BRI is based on investors\u2019 biblical beliefs. My firm\u2019s approach to BRI, and that of other advisers who practice it, is to put in the portfolio companies that uphold Christian values, excluding those with a record of, for example, human-rights violations. We never want clients to earn money from something they don\u2019t believe in.To determine whether a company is a good fit, we use third-party technology to screen and score companies based on internal research and public data on large- and small-cap companies world-wide. Advisers can establish their own methods for evaluating and scoring companies, depending on the criteria they want to use and the market they want to attract. For example, perhaps they want to focus on environmental stewardship, or on how companies treat their workers. From there, they can choose individual stocks or mutual funds that meet their needs.There\u2019s a lot of overlap between BRI and SRI, but when it comes to certain issues, BRI makes different determinations based on Christian values. A company that supports, for example, abortion in some way, or gambling or predatory lending would be excluded from the portfolio. Now, some investors, or even advisers considering entering this space, might not agree with BRI stances on certain issues. But they may also decide that overall, they like the approach and the financial results it yields. No matter the case, it\u2019s important advisers are prepared to discuss the subject.When a potential client asks about BRI, we take them through a process we call \u201cdiscover, explore, invest.\u201d We go through their current portfolio, drill down on those companies, and compare that to what a BRI portfolio would look like. We then show them how we can modify the portfolio according to their moral values and still potentially do well financially. The process helps us ensure we are properly serving our clients\u2019 interests, but it\u2019s also proven useful to developing our practice: About 70% of those who undergo the process end up bringing all of their business to our firm.The successes we\u2019ve had in this area of SRI supports my view that wherever clients fall on the social or political spectrum, investors these days care about what companies are doing. Offering BRI is a way to draw, and even maintain, clients who are eager for this kind of strategy.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 11:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/biblically-responsible-investing-a-lucrative-niche-for-advisers-1496934820", "news_title": "Biblically Responsible Investing: A Lucrative Niche for Advisers", "keywords": "corporate,industrial news,corporate social responsibility,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "The European Central Bank made its first significant change to its forward guidance in many months Thursday, dropping its bias toward lower interest rates in a move that came as little surprise given the pickup in eurozone growth since the start of the year. But in a shortened news conference, ECB President       Mario Draghi       made it clear the shift didn\u2019t mark the start of a move to reduce the stimulus provided by policy makers, stressing that changes in the jobs market were keeping wage increases lower than would be needed to ensure the inflation rate rises to the bank's target level of just below 2% and stays there. Here are five takeaways:1. Forward Guidance. Before Mr. Draghi spoke, the ECB issued a statement in which it said that its key interest rates would \u201cremain at their present levels for an extended period of time,\u201d dropping a reference to the possibility that they could be lowered. But it retained its reference to increasing its bond-purchase program in both size and duration should conditions worsen. Mr. Draghi said policy makers had removed \u201csome of our easing biases\u201d because the risk of severe setbacks that could lead to deflation had been eliminated.2. Forecasts. Mr. Draghi gave a more upbeat assessment of the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects. The ECB\u2019s economists raised their forecasts for gross domestic product growth and now see output rising by 1.9% in 2017, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. In each case, the forecast rate is a 10th of a percentage point higher than expected in March. However, their projections for inflation moved in the opposite direction. They cut their inflation forecast for this year to 1.5% from 1.7% and their forecast for 2018 to 1.3% from 1.6%, in each case below the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%.3. The Jobs Market. Mr. Draghi explained that one of the reasons stronger growth isn\u2019t translating into higher inflation is a changed jobs market. He once again claimed some credit for the creation of five million new jobs over recent years, but went on to describe them as being of lower quality than in the precrisis years. \u201cMany of these new jobs are so-called low-quality jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about temporary employment, part-time employment.\u201d4. The Discussion. Mr. Draghi said there was a consensus among the 25 members of the governing council in favor of the change in guidance, but that no discussion had taken place around the means and timing of a reduction in stimulus. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any discussion on normalization,\u201d he said.5. The Reaction. The euro slipped against the U.S. dollar after the ECB lowered its inflation forecasts and Mr. Draghi made it clear any change in policy is some way off.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 11:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-takeaways-from-ecb-president-mario-draghis-press-conference-1496934672", "news_title": "Five Takeaways From ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s Press Conference", "keywords": "bond buying,central banks,european central bank,european job market,inflation,inflation targets,interest rates,job growth,job market,mario draghi,quantitative easing,European Central Bank,Mario Draghi,monetary policy,euro zone,currency,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "There was a great hue and cry recently when the Alamo Drafthouse chain scheduled a number of females-only screenings of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d But this is a film about empowering women, and who could doubt that women find it easier to feel empowered when they don\u2019t have to put up with noisy, obnoxious teenage boys and their equally repellent fathers? I\u2019m sure that a lot of them would welcome females-only yoga classes as well. Just a hunch.Personally, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with screenings limited to a specific gender, nationality, age or hat size. Last year I was picking up my daughter at the airport and had a couple of hours to kill, so I went to see the only film showing at 8:30 p.m.: \u201cBad Moms.\u201d Right away, I knew I was out of my element. There were about 300 women in the theater. There were two men. They sat by themselves.I felt like a jerk in that setting, like I had to laugh every time the movie ridiculed men, even when the ridicule got nasty and personal. I felt like I was crashing a party to which I had specifically not been invited.

Aficionados of a specific kind of film get the chance to enjoy it in the company of people with the same mind-set. Movies based on videogames like \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d are aimed at young people who play videogames. Everybody else should stay out.With that in mind, I propose Aussie-only screenings of films starring       Cate Blanchett,       Nicole Kidman,       Hugh Jackman       or       Russell Crowe.       No-millennials screenings of \u201cFlashdance.\u201d Libertarians-only screenings of \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales.\u201dHow about special screenings of foreign films just for foreigners? If you can\u2019t speak Farsi, go home. If you can\u2019t say, \u201cPlus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose\u201d with an impeccable Parisian accent, you will not be admitted to the 7 p.m. show of the new       Isabelle Huppert       movie. Sorry, French Canadians, it\u2019s on again at 9:30.How can theaters ensure that no one sneaks into a film that has been declared off-limits? If a man is determined to see \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in a room full of women, he can always try to sneak in dressed up as Wonder Woman. If he gets in, there\u2019s not much anyone can do about that.But other films make things easier on security\u2014for example, movies that appeal only to slobs who want to see films in the company of other slobs and do not want nice, polite people who finished grade school wrecking the ambience. If you don\u2019t have terrible hair, at least three profane tattoos, a T-shirt with an offensive message emblazoned across it or pants that don\u2019t quite cover everything that needs to be covered, you\u2019re not getting in.The same applies for holier-than-thou-only screenings. If you don\u2019t honestly believe that seeing movies about Mongolian female falconers or idiosyncratic beekeepers makes you a superior human being, we\u2019re not letting you in. And don\u2019t try faking it by wearing that Yo-Yo Ma T-shirt. The ticket-takers all went to MIT.

To stay ahead of the competition, bar owners are pushing the envelope in a variety of ways.Some, like the newly opened Library of Distilled Spirits near Union Square, are doing it by creating\u00a0encyclopedic\u00a0menus. The bar features about 1,000 different spirits, including 170 Scotches, 140 American whiskeys and even 25 Japanese whiskies. In keeping with the library theme, the bottles are displayed on bookshelves, with bartenders having to use a rolling library ladder to reach the offerings on top.Additionally, the bar will feature about 200 books on spirits.\u201cWe might even let people take them out with our own library card,\u201d said       Tom Dillon,        co-founder of parent hospitality group APICII.Other drinking spots have similarly exhaustive menus, but with a focus on a particular spirit category. Masa y Agave at Rosa Mexicano, a Tribeca bar that opened in 2015, pours around 400 different agave spirits\u2014not only tequila, but also mezcal, raicilla and sotol.\u201cWe just wanted to be a place where people could explore,\u201d said       Courtenay Greenleaf,        corporate beverage director for the Rosa Mexicano restaurant group.The more-is-more philosophy overtaking the New York bar scene also applies to the drinks themselves.Consider the Mega Mule, a plus-size version of the popular Moscow Mule cocktail, that is now being offered at the PHD bars, located at the Dream hotels in Midtown and downtown. The 164-ounce drink, which is typically shared by a group, includes more than half a bottle of vodka and is served in a gigantic copper cup. The price: $150 to $185, with cost varying upon location.It is very much designed to be an attention-getter, says       Matt Strauss,        managing partner of the TAO Group, which owns the bars. And it seems to be having the desired effect. As soon as one table orders it, another soon follows, Mr. Strauss says.The bigger-is-better approach can indeed help ring in the sales, say bar-industry insiders and observers. It doesn\u2019t necessarily come cheap.The Oscar Wilde bar ran $4.2 million, according to the owners.\u00a0They expect that the bar\u2019s size will be an initial draw. But to keep customers returning, they say good drinks and good service are a must.They hope Oscar Wilde, which seats 225 and will likely open at the end of June, will be seen as a convivial gathering place rather than just a superlong bar.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 11:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-bars-go-bold-and-big-to-stand-out-in-new-york-1496934001", "news_title": "New Bars Go Bold and Big to Stand Out in New York", "keywords": "bars,drinks,oscar wilde bar"}, {"content": "I\u2019ve got a reissued Fender Japan \u201962 Custom Telecaster [similar model shown] that I put through a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe Lacquered Tweed amp.

They returned at the end of the year with their three children, enrolled them in a British school and rented, for about $5,600-a-month, a 10,000-square-foot modern mansion with views of the sea and mountains in Los Monasterios, a country-club community about 25 minutes north of Valencia.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want another London or New York, which is why we didn\u2019t want Madrid or Barcelona,\u201d Spain\u2019s first- and second-largest cities, said Mr. Craigie, who left his post as chief executive officer of Hotwire PR, a public-relations firm headquartered in London. He is now collaborating with his wife,       Ellen Raphael,        who works as a consultant, on a book about the future of the industry, and working on building a new public-relations firm, he said.Spain\u2019s third-largest city has a population of just under 800,000. It is attracting a growing number of expats who move to the region purely for lifestyle reasons as opposed to corporate relocation, real-estate agents say.The area is known for some of Spain\u2019s best weather, with nearly year-round sunshine. There are orange tree-lined streets, beaches, bike paths, good restaurants and the City of Arts and Sciences, a collection of futurist museums and cultural buildings designed in large part by native-son architect       Santiago Calatrava.       The Jard\u00edn del Turia, a lush urban park that snakes through the city like the river it used to be, offers ample space for sports, picnicking and cultural events. Valencia is also the birthplace of paella. Luxury apartments sell for about half as much in Valencia as in Barcelona, said       Alejandro Aznar,        an agent with Engel & V\u00f6lkers Valencia.Real-estate transactions in the first two months of this year were up 9.4% compared with the same year-earlier period, said       Juan Luis Herrero,        Valencian partner of       Lucas Fox,        a Barcelona-based real-estate company that specializes in luxury sales to foreigners. Prices across Valencia are up 4.6% compared with the first quarter of last year, while prices in the historic Old Town area of the city have risen by 8.9%, Mr. Herrero said.On a drizzling day in April, Mr. Aznar and his colleague, agent       Jorgen Cordy,        led a tour of two apartments on the market in the city\u2019s upscale Eixample neighborhood. The first was a roughly 3,100-square-foot home in a 1914 building designed by Francisco Javier Goerlich, considered one of Valencia\u2019s leading architects of Modernisme, a style characterized by nature-based motifs and curved lines. The apartment, with five bedrooms and three bathrooms, is listed for $1.69 million.Another apartment, steps from the Mercado Col\u00f3n, a Gaud\u00ed-like market occupied by upscale cafes and shops, is on the market for $1.35 million. The highlight of the three-bedroom apartment is a curved staircase leading to the front door. Mosaic-tiled floors and curvy, wood-encased windows exemplify Modernisme style.Marcus Collardin,        50, a private-equity investor who most recently lived in San Francisco, moved this week to Valencia with his fianc\u00e9e and infant. He said he began searching for a new home after the presidential election. As a dual U.S. and German citizen, he had his choice of European countries, but wanted warm weather. Rejecting Barcelona as \u201coverrun by tourists,\u201d he flew to Valencia in November to explore the city.In February, Mr. Collardin closed on a 2,700-square-foot, five-bedroom apartment for $750,000. Transaction costs added about $100,000 and remodeling about $110,000 more, he said.\u201cI love the architecture, the juxtaposition of old and new, the beaches and unbelievable weather,\u201d Mr. Collardin said of Valencia. And \u201cit\u2019s much cheaper than San Francisco,\u201d he added.Mr. Craigie and Ms. Raphael enlisted the services of       Christa Brokke,        owner of moving2valencia Relocation Support. In 2004, Ms. Brokke and her husband, both originally from Holland, moved to Valencia where they live with their two children, she said.Most of Ms. Brokke\u2019s clients want to live in the central Eixample area, which is home to many popular bars and restaurants. In the most elegant part of the neighborhood, she advises clients that restored properties run between about $450,000 and $2.8 million; rentals range from about $1,700 to $5,000. Prices can be highly negotiable, said Ms. Brokke, a sentiment echoed by Mr. Aznar, who said negotiability for luxury properties can be 15% to 20%.On a recent tour of properties in Los Monasterios, where Mr. Craigie is currently looking to buy a house, agent Pau Moll\u00e1 of brokerage Class Home Inmobiliaria pointed out the homes of famous soccer players and business executives. The neighborhood population is approximately 40% expats, said Mr. Moll\u00e1, who are drawn to the community mainly because of an American school, a British school and other private schools nearby. Large, modern houses, with pools and views of both the Mediterranean and the Sierra Calderona mountains, range roughly between $675,000 and $3.4 million; rents start at about $1,900 and go up to about $6,800.Negatives to life in Valencia include an unemployment rate a point higher than Spain\u2019s overall 18.75%. Locals grumble about corruption and public-works boondoggles, such as a second provincial airport that has barely been used. Another quibble: noisy streets. A tradition of festivals, plus lots of cafes with outdoor seating, make for a loud cityscape. Valencia\u2019s economy, traditionally based on exports of citrus, furniture, ceramics, and automotive parts, increasingly relies on tourism, which is evident everywhere.Mr. Craigie said his family loves the school, the surrounding mountains and sea, and the quick commute into the city and airport. Another favorite thing: the local cuisine.\u201cThe food is really good, fresh produce is amazing here, and it\u2019s not expensive,\u201d said Mr. Craigie.Write to Katy McLaughlin at katy.mclaughlin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'A Simpler and More Seductive Spain.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 10:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-valencia-expats-adopt-a-simpler-and-more-seductive-spain-1496932338", "news_title": "In Valencia, Expats Adopt a Simpler and More Seductive Spain", "keywords": "city of arts and sciences , eixample valencia , housing market, luxury homes, luxury real estate,spain real estate,valencia, valencia real estate,political,general news,education,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,real estate,property,school,market research,public relations,opinion polling,advertising,marketing,business,consumer services,construction,moving,relocation services"}, {"content": "James Bond meets Midcentury Modern. Italianate villa\u2014with a sky bridge. A white stucco and steel home primarily designed for cars.These are some of the luxury home styles you\u2019ll find in Austin, Texas, where the transformation of the city from laid-back college town to high-tech magnet is rapidly reshaping the architectural landscape.New homes are going up fast. Single-family home permits are up 138% over the past five years, according to census data. The median price for single-family homes has increased 48.2% from $250,000 in April 2012 to $370,600 in April 2017, according to the Austin Board of Realtors.Meanwhile, city ordinances designed to limit the size and density of new homes have had some unintended consequences. To get around size restrictions, homeowners are adding more carports and screened-in porches, which qualify for a larger exemption than garages. The result: some odd workarounds and construction quirks that add to the eclectic look of many new or renovated homes.Right now, the landscape is \u201cfluid,\u201d says Matt Fajkus, principal of Austin firm Matt Fajkus Architecture. \u201cSometimes, while we are working on a house, the entire neighborhood will change,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting challenge. Are you designing something for the way the neighborhood is now or how the neighborhood will be?\u201dIn older neighborhoods near downtown, tiny, dilapidated shacks sit across the street from new boxy white contemporaries. Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired mansions are cattycorner to what look like breezy beach bungalows.Mr. Fajkus, who is also an associate professor of architecture at the University of Texas, recently finished designing a 1,000-square-foot, one-bedroom home in the Bouldin Creek neighborhood that cost about $1 million to build. The modern white stucco and steel house was designed around a couple\u2019s vast vintage-car collection and includes 2,000 square feet of garage and outdoor space. The home\u2019s upper-level cantilevers are 20 feet out from the box-shaped lower level.The owners, John and Lisa Weinberger, moved from Chicago to Austin in 2014, when many homes in Bouldin Creek were rundown. They bought a new four-bedroom spec house, then bought the lot next door and built their new modern home\u2014mainly used as a place to put their cars.\u201cHouses are coming down by the week,\u201d says Mr. Weinberger, 85, an auto-dealership owner and car racer.Just down the block from the Weinberger property, a plain 1,412-square-foot house is listed for sale\u2014with marketing that suggests it is ideal as a teardown or gut renovation. (\u201cWhat a lot!\u201d) The asking price: $650,000.The rapid change has some locals fearing that Austin will lose its identity. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the streetscape and character we are losing, it\u2019s also visual elements of our city\u2019s past,\u201d says Kathie Tovo, an Austin City Council member and the city\u2019s mayor pro tempore.Scott and Cindy Trainer recently custom built a 3,700-square-foot, four-bedroom brick-and-stucco home for over $1 million last year in the Zilker Park neighborhood. Asked to describe the style, Mr. Trainer hesitates: It\u2019s a combination of Midcentury Modern and classic James Bond, he says, pointing out both the long cedar roof overhangs and the floor-to-ceiling steel-framed glass walls.Austin Architect Michael Hsu, whose firm designed the Trainers\u2019 house, says \u201cluxury is being redefined here.\u201d The only unifying stylistic theme he sees is what he calls \u201ccasual modernism,\u201d which he describes as modernism that is authentic and accessible. His clients are moving to Austin from places like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco because they want a lifestyle shift; they don\u2019t want the kinds of homes they\u2019ve left behind. \u201cEveryone deserves a place to live of their choosing. There\u2019s not a prescription for Austin for how you should be.\u201dMr. Trainer, 57, moved to Austin in 1982 from upstate New York after visiting his brother. He got an environmental-engineering job and moved to the Zilker Park area, first buying a small bungalow for $56,000, renovating it and selling it for $100,000 in 1991. That same year he bought a \u00bc-acre lot for $50,000 and built a three-story home, selling it in 2011 for $1.3 million because he and his 46-year-old wife, a real-estate agent, wanted a home better suited for their two children.Their new house replaced a larger, 4,500-square-foot home with a pool they bought for $650,000 that hadn\u2019t been updated since 1959. Mr. Trainer, who became a commercial real-estate developer in 2004, had admired the property for years because it is on a bluff overlooking a large park and part of the Austin skyline.The house, slightly angled, is designed with minimal windows facing the street. Instead, all-glass walls on the back of the home face the park and expansive skyline. It has concrete floors, soaring ceilings and a splayed back that folds around a courtyard and swimming pool. The master bedroom and bathroom are in a wing that is 4 feet higher than the rest of the house, a way to get separation, since the subdivision doesn\u2019t allow homes with more than one story.Currently, the City of Austin has what it calls \u201cMcMansion regulations\u201d that limit the scale and bulk of new construction, remodels, and additions to make sure homes are compatible with existing neighborhoods.While the goal of the McMansion ordinance was to preserve the character of neighborhoods and has helped curb size, some detractors say it has also had negative effects. For example, carports don\u2019t count as square footage under the ordinance, but garages do. As a result, more carports have been built, affecting the appearance of the neighborhoods.Recently, the city has proposed a new land-development code that may further change the face of neighborhoods. Dubbed CodeNext, the goal is to update and consolidate regulations and deal with the issues of neighborhood density, affordability and livability. \u201cThe goal is to preserve what we love and improve what we don\u2019t,\u201d says Alina Carnahan, who is working on CodeNext for the city.Jamie Chandlee, a 2005 graduate of the University of Texas, moved back to Austin in 2010 to take a job with             Facebook,       which had just opened an office there. She met her future husband, Blake, who also worked for Facebook, and in 2012 they moved into a five-bedroom, five-bathroom mansion they bought in the Tarrytown neighborhood.Two years ago, the couple embarked on a $300,000 addition to their 6,000-square-foot home, built in the Italianate style, with a red-tile roof and rounded rooms. They wanted a playroom but couldn\u2019t change the footprint of the house because of limits on \u201cimpervious surfaces\u201d\u2014which is any surface like a roof or driveway\u2014that can\u2019t absorb rainwater.So they asked Hugh Jefferson Randolph\u2014the home\u2019s original architect\u2014to enlarge the space over the garage and link it to the second story of the main house with a sky bridge. The addition gives their Old World-style home some decidedly modern touches.Since they moved to Tarrytown, there has been nonstop construction in the neighborhood, Mrs. Chandlee, 34, says. Around the corner, a modern home sits next to a small bungalow. A few doors down a nondescript two-story, five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home with a three-car garage and a swimming pool is replacing a 2,972-square-foot ranch house built in the 1950s.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of variety. That\u2019s what makes Austin unique,\u201d says Mrs. Chandlee.Write to Nancy Keates at nancy.keates@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 10:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/austins-housing-boom-makes-way-for-quirkier-home-styles-1496931111", "news_title": "Austin\u2019s Housing Boom Makes Way for Quirkier Home Styles ", "keywords": " architecture,austin, building regulations, codenext, home styles, luxury homes,new construction, real estate,architecture,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,real estate,property,building construction,residential building construction,construction"}, {"content": "Alibaba Group Holding        BABA -0.39%       said its annual revenue in fiscal 2018 could grow as much as 49%, sending its shares 11% higher in early trading Thursday.The Hangzhou-based company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer       Maggie Wu       said at the firm\u2019s investor conference earlier that day that revenue growth would accelerate as its e-commerce unit would benefit from offering consumers more tailored shopping experiences and benefit from its data technology capabilities.Even though Alibaba posted revenue growth of 56% in fiscal year 2017, Ms. Wu said sales were boosted by the consolidations of acquisitions such as Southeast Asian e-commerce company Lazada and video-streaming site Youku Tudou. Revenue growth last year would have been about 45% without those one-off factors, she said.Alibaba, the operator of China\u2019s largest e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, has seen its stock surge more than 40% in New York this year as more Chinese shoppers move their shopping online. In May, the internet giant reported net income in the quarter ending March 31 nearly doubled from a year earlier to 10.65 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) as rising incomes in China drove online consumption.This rally in Alibaba shares, which now trade close to a record high, has outstripped its U.S. peers such as             Facebook Inc.       and             Amazon.com Inc.The big four U.S. technology companies Facebook, Amazon,             Netflix Inc.       and Google parent             Alphabet Inc.,       all gained more than 20% so far this year, propelled by strong earnings growth and overall investor enthusiasm for technology stocks.Addressing investors at the conference in Hangzhou, Ms. Wu said the technology giant will continue to invest in expanding the number of consumers on its platforms, improve its customer experience, and grow its market share in the business-to-consumer market.Chief Executive Officer       Daniel Zhang       said Alibaba\u2019s most important asset was its data collection, and analyzing the data collected would allow them to provide better services for customers, advertisers and businesses.\u201cIf we use one sentence to describe Alibaba,\u201d he said. \u201cAlibaba is an economy, driven by big data.\u201dStill, neither Zhang nor Wu mentioned when their new businesses, such as cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, which are still money-losing, would turn profitable.Alibaba chairman       Jack Ma       and its vice chairman       Joe Tsai       are set to address investors on Friday.Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 10:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-shares-rise-after-cfo-says-revenue-growth-will-accelerate-1496930842", "news_title": "Alibaba Says Revenue Could Grow 49%; Shares Jump", "keywords": "alibaba,annual meeting,chief financial officer,earnings,investor conference,profits,revenue,sales,Alibaba Group,BABA,Youku Tudou,Facebook,FB,Amazon.com,AMZN,Maggie Wu,financial performance,sales figures,earnings projections,share price movement,disruptions,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,broadcasting,television broadcasting,e-commerce,internet,online,internet protocol television,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "Once again, economists must consider the risk that Congress may be unable to easily deal with the nation\u2019s statutory borrowing limit.Forecasters in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s monthly survey have raised their assessments of the risk facing the U.S. economy. For the first time since the presidential election, a majority of economists in the survey are concerned the economy could do worse than forecast.That is a reversal from earlier in the year, when the possibility of rapid moves to reform the tax code or create a $1 trillion infrastructure package seemed like they could happen quite quickly and boost the economy.Congressional deadlocks over fiscal policy have repeatedly lasted until the 11th hour in recent years, raising the specter of the government not paying the nation\u2019s debts. Congress has always ultimately raised the debt ceiling, but one skirmish in 2011 led Standard & Poor\u2019s to lower its rating of U.S. debt.The nation hit its debt ceiling back in March, and the Treasury has been relying on cash-management strategies to pay the nation\u2019s bills. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank that tracks Treasury\u2019s cash balances, estimates those strategies may only work through October, and Congress is running low on legislative days before taking its August recess.\u201cI believe cooler heads will prevail, but the risk is not zero,\u201d said Amy Crews Cutts, chief economist of Equifax.The debt ceiling is a law passed by Congress putting a limit on the amount of money the Treasury is allowed to borrow. The measure puts the Treasury Department in a bind, as Congress sets taxes and requires the Treasury to spend money with one set of legislation, and then forbids borrowing to covering any difference. Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       has asked Congress to raise the debt limit without attaching conditions.\u201cSometimes the heated rhetoric can get away from the debt zealots, and that\u2019s when accidents happen,\u201d said       Rajeev Dhawan,        the director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.Many in Congress have become accustomed to using the debt ceiling as leverage, withholding votes to win changes to other legislation. In 2011, however, the disagreements lasted until the U.S. was just two days away from running out of money, and possibly defaulting on its debt.That episode led S&P, the bond-rating agency, to strip U.S. bonds of their AAA-rating and many forecasters worried the episode would be so damaging to confidence that the U.S. could tip into a recession. While the U.S. avoided recession, the stock market fell nearly 20% that summer.Researchers believe these fights raise the government\u2019s borrowing costs by raising doubts about the safety of U.S. debt, a perverse effect from legislation meant to control debt.Congress still has time before the current episode becomes so acute, economists say.\u201cAt present, we expect this perpetual issue to keep getting addressed by temporary arrangements,\u201d said Derek Holt, the head of capital-market economists at Scotiabank.The Journal\u2019s survey is a panel of financial, business and academic economists who produce professional forecasts. The survey of 60 economists was conducted June 2-6.Their estimates for growth, inflation and unemployment were little changed over the past month. Most expect the economy to grow slightly above 2% for the next couple of years, and for the unemployment rate to slowly decline a bit further, reaching 4.1% at the end of 2018 from the current 4.3%.The panel places the risk of a recession in the next 12 months at about 16%, or 1 in 6. The chance of a recession had been fading from where it was last summer. It is far lower than in mid-2011 when the odds were placed at nearly 1 in 3, showing that a repeat of the 2011 crisis isn\u2019t seen as likely.Until Congress has resolved the issue this time, many forecasters say they will remain on alert.\u201cThis is a dumb way to toy with the credibility of the U.S. on the global stage,\u201d said Diane Swonk, the founder of DS Economics. The debt ceiling \u201cwas never intended to be used as a tool of mass destruction.\u201dWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 10:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unresolved-u-s-debt-ceiling-casts-a-shadow-over-many-forecasters-economic-outlooks-1496930401", "news_title": "Unresolved U.S. Debt Ceiling Casts a Shadow Over Many Forecasters\u2019 Economic Outlooks   ", "keywords": "statutory borrowing limit,u.s. borrowing,u.s. economic outlook,u.s debt ceiling,wall street journal econ survey,wsj economists survey,wsj survey,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,treasury department,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Economists almost unanimously expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates next week, but are split over when the central bank will raise rates after that.The share of business and academic economists expecting officials to lift rates at the Fed\u2019s\u00a0two-day\u00a0policy meeting ending Wednesday rose to 93.2% in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s latest survey, compared with 88.1% of those polled a month ago.More than half of economists quizzed by the Journal, 54.2%, expected the Fed to raise rates for the third time this year at its Sept. 19-20\u00a0meeting. About a third of economists, 33.9%, expected the Fed\u2019s third rate increase of the year to come in December.Fed officials in March lifted their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 0.75% and 1% and penciled in two more quarter-point moves this year.The Fed is juggling a number of factors on the monetary policy front, the economists noted in the survey. One is the uncertain political outlook for tax cuts and government spending, which could stimulate stronger economic growth if enacted. Another is recent mixed economic signals. While the labor market is strong, inflation has softened recently, ducking below the Fed\u2019s 2% target after hitting it briefly this year.\u201cThe period between June and December will likely be used to assess data plus policy and market risks,\u201d said       Derek Holt       of Scotiabank.The economists surveyed also expressed different views on when the Fed will start shrinking its $4.5 trillion holdings of bonds and other assets. The central bank currently maintains the size of the portfolio by reinvesting the proceeds from its maturing assets, but officials have agreed on a strategy to reduce it over time by gradually tapering that process. They could announce their plans as soon as next week.In the latest poll, 42.1% of the respondents expected officials to begin winding down the portfolio in December, while 24.6% predicted the process would begin in September.Expectations differed widely about how long the process would take and the likely size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet once it finishes. Economists\u2019 median expectations were for the portfolio to stop shrinking in the second quarter of 2021, and to be worth $2.5 trillion at the end.The Fed accumulated most of its assets during and after the financial crisis through bond-buying programs aimed at lowering long-term interest rates and boosting economic growth. Reducing the balance sheet likely will cause long-term rates to rise.Fed officials have considered a strategy in which they would pause rate increases when they begin winding down the balance sheet, so they can assess how markets react before raising rates further.The Journal surveyed 60 economists June 2-6, but not everyone answered every question.Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 10:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-rate-rise-in-june-seen-as-done-deal-but-economists-split-on-whats-next-1496930401", "news_title": "Fed Rate Rise in June Seen as Done Deal, but Economists Split on What\u2019s Next", "keywords": "econ survey,fed,fed june meeting,fed meeting,fed rates,fomc,interest rates,wsj economists survey,wsj economist survey,wsj econ survey,wsj survey,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,economic news,economic predictions,forecasts,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

The core index also excludes government-controlled tariffs such as bus fares, which were raised in Mexico City to compensate for the big jump in gasoline prices at the start of the year.The rise in the inflation rate has prompted the Bank of Mexico to more than double its overnight interest rate since December 2015, as it seeks to keep the impact of higher fuel costs and the depreciation of the Mexican peso from affecting medium and long-term inflation expectations.Central Bank Gov.       Agust\u00edn Carstens       said last week that the rate increases, which began while inflation was still below the central bank\u2019s 3% target, have helped keep inflation in check and to hold down expectations, and insisted that inflation isn\u2019t out of control.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t done anything it\u2019s likely we\u2019d have inflation close to 8% and inflation really would have been unanchored,\u201d he said.The central bank expects the annual rate to remain well above the 2%-4% target band this year, but that it will begin to ease by year-end and return toward the target in 2018.The bank raised rates for a sixth consecutive meeting in May, and is widely expected to raise the rate by another quarter percentage point to 7% on June 22.Several board members said the rate-raising cycle could be approaching an end when they agreed unanimously last month to raise rates.

Graduate on time.At four-year schools, only about 40% of full-time students graduate on time, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education.For some students, it is because they sign up for too few courses in certain semesters and don\u2019t earn enough credits in time. Other students can enroll in too many courses that don\u2019t count toward a degree. In still other cases, students have to work to cover their expenses, which sometimes interferes with studies.Such delays add up. An additional year of school in a public four-year college will cost $22,826, on average, according to the nonprofit Complete College America. Then there is lost income to consider. Students who stay in school an additional year miss out on about $45,327 in salary, on average.All told, Complete College America estimates that an extra year of college can cost as much as $68,153.More colleges and universities are trying to improve their on-time graduation rates. The move, some say, is a response to the rising cost of tuition and stagnating family incomes. But it also makes financial sense for the schools. When students are on track to graduate on time, dropout rates fall and revenues rise.Many new initiatives urge students to earn more credits each semester. To that end, a number of colleges now charge a flat rate for a semester, rather than charge by the credit. Adams State University in Alamosa, Colo., revised its tuition policy so that students pay the same for 20 credits as they pay for 12, and have an incentive to take a heavier course load. Also, its tuition won\u2019t increase for four consecutive years for full-time students.\u201cWe are trying keep the cost of education as low as possible,\u201d says       Karla Hardesty,        director of marketing and enrollment management at Adams State.The average course load for degree-seeking undergraduates at Adams State rose 11% between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2015, according to school officials. The university\u2019s goal is to have more than 20% of its students graduate in four years by 2020. For the freshman class of 2009, the rate was 11%.Students at many colleges take 12 credits a semester, or 24 credits a year, which is considered full time by federal financial-aid programs. But students usually need 30 credits a year to earn the necessary 120 credits to graduate on time.If students start taking more credits from the outset, education experts say, it sets a precedent that is likely to stay with them throughout their time at school. Students at four-year schools who took 15 credits their first semester or 30 credits their first year were more likely to graduate than students who attempted 12 or 24 credits, according to a recent study of data from Tennessee public colleges.\u201cThe longer students stretch out their studies, the more life intervenes and the more likely students won\u2019t finish,\u201d says       Davis Jenkins,        co-author of the study and senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College. The report also found that students who stayed the course paid $52 (14%) less per credit and $13,310 (20%) less per degree.Some states have made enrolling in 30 credits a year a requirement to receive state scholarship money. New York state\u2019s Excelsior scholarship, included in the 2018 state budget, requires recipients to enroll in 30 credits. Indiana\u2019s 21st Century Scholar and Frank O\u2019Bannon Grant, both approved by the Indiana General Assembly in 2013, also predicate funding on earning 30 credits.Miami-based Florida International University this fall will start encouraging students to consider earning credits in summer. Promoting a summer semester may offer more flexibility for students who work and attend classes, says       Elizabeth Bejar,        vice president for academic affairs.Congress made it possible for more students to attend summer sessions when it signed an appropriations package last month that included an amendment to the Higher Education Act allowing students to use Pell Grants year round.In another approach to helping more students graduate in four years, some schools now require, or encourage, picking an area of study as early as possible. Degree maps, which show all of the courses required for each major (in the right sequence), are promoted on some college websites and through introductory courses.\u201cStudents should be clear on what to do and when, not just handed a book and told to figure it out,\u201d says       Courtney Brown,        vice president at the Lumina Foundation, a private foundation that works to make higher education more available.One big reason for failing to graduate on time, experts say, is that certain required courses aren\u2019t offered frequently enough for all students who need them to enroll.Temple University, based in Philadelphia, works to prevent such situations with its Fly in 4 Graduation Partnership, an agreement that offers certain safeguards but requires students to be proactive in their class scheduling. To participate, students must be full-time freshmen or transfer students who begin in a fall semester, and they must agree to complete 30 credits a year. The students are also required to meet with an academic adviser at least once a semester, register early each semester and let advisers know immediately when a required course isn\u2019t available so that a possible solution can be found.For a Fly in 4 student who meets all of his or her obligations but still fails to graduate on time because a required course wasn\u2019t available at the necessary time, Temple says the student can complete his or her degree requirements fee and tuition free. But if students fail to meet the terms of the contract, Temple won\u2019t pay for any additional time in school.For the first Temple students who signed the contract, in 2014, 61.6% are on track to graduate on time in 2018. For those who declined, 46.5% are on track, school officials say.Another tool being used to keep students on track: data analytics. At Georgia State University, in Atlanta, about 100 full-time advisers receive electronic alerts when students enroll in the wrong course, a course out of sequence or receive a bad grade. The advisers must then reach out to students within 48 hours.\u201cWe are trying to approximate elite institutions that notice and redirect students when they make a bad choice,\u201d says       Timothy Renick,        vice provost at Georgia State, where 80% of students work full or part time.The school\u2019s four-year graduation rate has doubled to 29% over five years. Moreover, the average bachelor\u2019s degree student is graduating with eight fewer credit hours than five years ago, translating into about $15 million in savings for this year\u2019s graduating class, Mr. Renick says.The University of Texas in Austin has used data from academic transcripts and personal records to identify the 25% of students least likely to graduate on time. Those most at risk are put in the University Leadership Network, which pays students $5,000 each year if they earn 25% of their degree requirements and maintain a 2.0 grade-point average, school officials say. Students also are required to attend weekly seminars and do internships on campus.David Laude,        senior vice provost at the University of Texas, says the school\u2019s four-year graduation rate rose to 61% in 2016 from 50% in 2011. The goal for this year\u2019s graduating class was 70%, he says, but the school doesn\u2019t know yet if it met that goal.\u201cIt creates a network on campus,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when students have a problem, they seek out someone at UT rather than taking a bus home.\u201dMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

But last month, this ornate staff, known as a crozier, made an unusual trip into the outside world to meet the 16th-century original on which it was based.\u201cThese croziers haven\u2019t seen each other since the 1920s,\u201d said Bishop Dietsche, who drove the crozier downtown for the reunion. \u201cIt was just fun.\u201dThe original crozier, from 1501, is temporarily at the Yeshiva University Museum, located at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square neighborhood. The approximately 50-item exhibit, titled \u201c500 Years of Treasures from Oxford,\u201d is comprised of a collection of artifacts, including rare manuscripts and books, on loan from Oxford University\u2019s Corpus Christi College.It runs through\u00a0Aug. 6.The original crozier is displayed near the entrance of the exhibit. The ornate six-foot-tall staff, constructed of silver with gold leaf, belonged to       Bishop Richard Fox,        the founder of Corpus Christi College. Made by an anonymous London craftsman, it is valued at about \u00a31,500,000, or nearly $2 million, according to the center.\u201cThe way the exhibit is arranged, it\u2019s the first thing you see when you walk in the room,\u201d said       Joel Levy,        the center\u2019s president and chief executive, of the crozier. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the story: This college was founded by a priest.\u201dThe exhibition\u2019s curator,       Peter Kidd,        said the crozier also provides variety among the many books and manuscripts. \u201cIt makes quite a splash when you first walk into the room,\u201d he added.The crozier\u2019s replica stems from the 1920s, when a committee that included the then-Bishop of London sought to celebrate the alliance between the diocese of New York and that of London by copying the original crozier. \u201cThe crozier was given as a way of symbolizing the Anglo-American friendship,\u201d Bishop Dietsche said.The replica wasn\u2019t exact: Unlike the original, it had details representing both New York and London, including the arms of the bishops of both cities, of George Washington, and others. In the crook of the replica is the figure of Saint John the Divine, whereas the original has Saint Peter.The replica was intended to be used at St. John the Divine, the cathedral of New York\u2019s Episcopal diocese in Manhattan\u2019s Morningside Heights neighborhood. The replica is back at the cathedral, said Bishop Dietsche, with no future reunions planned.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/16th-century-ceremonial-staff-meets-replica-1496926800", "news_title": "16th-Century Ceremonial Staff Meets Replica ", "keywords": " 16th century crozier,500 years of treasures from oxford, center for jewish history, corpus christi college, corpus christi college books,crozier, croziers, oxford university, pastoral staff, saint john the divine, st. john the divine, yeshiva university museum,Center for Jewish History,Yeshiva University Museum,Oxford University,St. John the Divine,Andrew Dietsche,art,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,food,drink,health,living,lifestyle,religion,theaters,entertainment venues,museums,historical sites,gardens,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Leading Arab states are drawing up a list of demands that Qatar must meet to return to normal diplomatic and economic relations, including steps to significantly scale back the Al Jazeera media network, said Arab and U.S. officials involved in the discussions.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and their allies are also seeking guarantees that Qatar\u2019s government will stop its alleged financing of Middle East extremist groups and sever relations with the political leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, a global Islamist movement, according to these officials.Some of the Brotherhood\u2019s leaders, particularly from Egypt, are in exile in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital city.These Arab states severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday and closed their land and air borders, claiming the gas-rich monarchy was destabilizing the Mideast. Saudi and Emirati officials said they are preparing more steps to punish Qatar, including imposing additional economic sanctions, in the coming days.U.S. President       Donald Trump       spoke by phone with Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman on Tuesday and with the emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al- Thani on Wednesday. Mr. Trump also spoke with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who drives U.A.E. policy.The White House said Mr. Trump stressed the importance of maintaining unity among Gulf states, but not if doing so compromises efforts to eliminate funding for extremism or to defeat terrorism.However, Germany and Turkey made a show of support for Qatar on Wednesday, weighing in on a regional crisis that is beginning to drive a wedge between the U.S. and some of its closest allies.In a meeting with his Saudi counterpart in Berlin, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called on Saudi Arabia and others to help de-escalate the crisis, saying cooperation is necessary to fight Islamic State. Like Germany, Turkey\u2014another close ally of both the U.S. and Qatar\u2014has criticized the hard-line stance of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries against Qatar.Senior U.S. officials said Mr. Trump told the Arab monarchs he is prepared to mediate the dispute between the Arab states, some of whom host major American military installations. But the Trump administration stressed it needed a clear list of grievances to pass on to Qatar\u2019s leadership, and that Washington wouldn\u2019t necessarily endorse them.These Arab and U.S. officials said this official list of demands is being compiled and could be completed in the coming days. Qatar\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Meshal bin Hamad Al-Thani, said in an interview on Wednesday that his government still didn\u2019t know the specifics behind these Arab states\u2019 decision to sever ties. He stressed that Doha is open to the Trump administration trying to mediate a diplomatic resolution.\u201cUntil now, there have been no clear requests,\u201d said Mr. Al- Thani, a member of Qatar\u2019s ruling family. \u201cWe are working toward de-escalation.\u201dSaudi and Emirati officials have publicly accused Qatar of channeling funds to al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria and Yemen and providing a diplomatic safe-haven for the Muslim Brotherhood.Ambassador Al-Thani denied Qatar knowingly has provided funding to any terrorist organizations. He said Doha is willing to take additional actions.The Brotherhood took power in Egypt in 2012 following the political revolt against Cairo\u2019s longstanding strongman,       Hosni Mubarak.       The Egyptian military overthrew his elected successor, the Islamist politician Mohammed Morsi, the following year.Qatar also has hosted the political leadership of the Palestinian militant group, Hamas, which is affiliated with the Brotherhood and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. Both the Obama and       George W. Bush       administrations at times used Qatar as a diplomatic channel to Hamas, according to current and former U.S. officials.\u201cDo we need to do more? We all need to do more,\u201d the Qatari official said. \u201cWe have to take action.\u201dAl Jazeera, the pan-Arab television network, has emerged in recent years as a particular source of tension between Qatar and many of its Arab neighbors. Qatar staunchly supported the political rebellions that spread across the Middle East in 2011. And Al Jazeera and affiliated media organizations have regularly provided a platform for Muslim Brotherhood leaders.Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E, and Egypt, in particular, charge Qatar has used Al Jazeera to try to destabilize their countries. One Arab official said reining in the media network will definitely be among the demands on the list.\u201cThis has been going on for years,\u201d said the senior Arab diplomat involved in the discussions.In a statement, a spokesman for Al Jazeera, which is funded by Qatar\u2019s government, said the network is \u201can established player in the international news and current affairs market\u201d and has long operated in a restrictive environment.\u201cThe current crisis represents a new challenge and new circumstances,\u201d said the spokesman, Muhammad Ihtisham Hibatullah. \u201cBut Al Jazeera remains committed to continue its pioneering and courageous journalism around the world in a professional, balanced and objective manner.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s offer to help resolve differences among the parties came a day after he appeared to take credit for the rift and sided with Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. in the dispute.But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump offered to host all of the parties at the White House, \u201cif necessary,\u201d according to a White House statement.He also said: \u201cA united Gulf Cooperation Council and a strong United State-Gulf Cooperation Council partnership are critical to defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability.\u201dThe GCC includes Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.Unlike a series of tweets on Tuesday singling Qatar out, Mr. Trump on Wednesday \u201cemphasized the importance of all countries in the region working together to prevent the financing of terrorist organizations and stop the promotion of extremist ideology,\u201d in a White House statement.\u2014Andrea Thomas, Margherita Stancati and Margaret Coker contributed to this article.Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arab-states-drawing-up-list-of-demands-for-qatar-1496875243", "news_title": "Arab States Drawing Up List of Demands for Qatar", "keywords": "arab states, demands al jazeera,diplomatic relations, doha, egypt, extermist groups,gulf countries,hamas,islamic state, mediation, muslim brotherhood,persian gulf, qatar, saudi arabia, terrorism, trump, united arab emirates,white house,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,terrorism,broadcasting,television broadcasting,satellite broadcasting,media,entertainment,satellite television"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014A South Korean court convicted two former officials of abuse of power and embezzlement in a case involving the contentious merger of two             Samsung                   affiliates in 2015. Legal experts say the ruling strengthens prosecutors\u2019 cases against the country\u2019s former president and a top corporate figure.The case is at the heart of an influence-peddling scandal that last year sparked massive protests in South Korea over the cozy ties between the country\u2019s conglomerates and its political class. The events sparked an investigation that led to the indictment of both former President Park Geun-hye and the de facto head of Samsung, the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerate.The court on Thursday sentenced South Korea\u2019s former health minister Moon Hyung-pyo to a 2.5-year prison term for ordering the country\u2019s National Pension Service to cast the decisive vote in favor of a merger between two Samsung affiliates in which the pension service was a large shareholder.That deal\u2014which was widely opposed by proxy advisory firms and other shareholders as detrimental to shareholders\u2014strengthened the control of Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong over Samsung Electronics.The defendant \u201cexercised his influence to violate the independence of the National Pension Service and damaged its shareholder value,\u201d the court said, calling that \u201ca matter of grave illegality.\u201dMr. Moon\u2019s conviction is likely to strengthen the case against his former boss, Ms. Park, some legal experts say. Prosecutors say Ms. Park had ordered Mr. Moon to ensure that the pension service voted for the deal. Ms. Park has denied involvement in the approval of the merger.The legal experts say Thursday\u2019s ruling is also likely to help the case against Mr. Lee, who prosecutors accuse of funding a consulting company linked to a Park friend in return for government backing for the merger. Mr. Lee, whose trial is expected to end in upcoming weeks, has denied wrongdoing. He has been imprisoned since February as he awaits a ruling.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this case is linked to Ms. Park\u2019s case,\u201d said Byun Jong-pil, a law professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. He said the court\u2019s assessment of Mr. Moon\u2019s charges will likely weigh in on the continuing trials of both Ms. Park and Mr. Lee.The court also sentenced Hong Wan-sun, the pension service\u2019s former head of asset management, to 2.5 years in jail for approving the merger between the two Samsung affiliates.Neither Mr. Moon nor Mr. Hong\u2019s lawyers responded to requests for comment. Messrs. Moon and Hong can appeal the verdict to a higher court.Mr. Moon, no relation to South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in, was arrested by prosecutors in December and indicted the following month on charges of perjury and abuse of authority. He was the first to be detained by a special prosecutorial team looking into the national scandal.In March, Ms. Park was removed from office over accusations that she helped a friend win bribes from Samsung and other South Korean conglomerates. Ms. Park has been indicted with 18 charges centering around bribery and has been in jail while on trial.South Korea\u2019s family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, helped pull the nation out of poverty but many South Koreans now see their dominance as an obstacle to a more competitive economy.Riding that wave of frustration, South Koreans elected President Moon, their first left-leaning president in nine years. He has pledged to improve chaebols\u2019 corporate governance by giving more clout to minority shareholders and moving to clearer holding-company structures.Write to Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/court-convicts-south-korean-officials-in-samsung-linked-bribery-case-1496909073", "news_title": "Samsung-Linked Convictions Strengthen Case Against Former South Korean President ", "keywords": "south korea bribery, south korea samsung, south korea trials,National Pension Service,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,SSNLF,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,embezzlement,financial crime,fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,computers,consumer electronics,audio,video equipment,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private pension funds,consumer goods,durable household products,financial services,home electronics,appliances,investing,securities,pension funds,technology"}, {"content": "When new technology threatens a company\u2019s core product, the company often buys into the new technology. Catalytic converters\u2014a product electric vehicles may make obsolete\u2014offer an unfolding case study for the wider automotive industry.Two global suppliers\u2014London-listed         Johnson Matthey               and Brussels-listed         Umicore              \u2014grew rich on the chemistry of catalytic converters, which use precious metals to stop harmful gases from leaving tailpipes. Each new set of emissions rules brought another wave of profits. The European diesel-car boom proved particularly lucrative, as diesel engines need more sophisticated devices to filter out the extra nitrogen oxide and soot they produce.This growth story is now being disrupted by plummeting demand for diesel engines in the wake of         Volkswagen\u2019semissions fraud. The impact on catalyst-device specialists is complex. Supplying gasoline engines is less lucrative. But to meet carbon dioxide standards, car makers will likely turn to efficiency-improving technologies, such as so-called direct injection, that require extra catalysts.In the longer run electricity, stored in batteries and requiring no catalysts, looks primed to replace both diesel and gasoline. This is the real threat for Johnson Matthey and Umicore. Both companies have responded by investing in the chemistry of cathodes, the key component in batteries.Umicore is far ahead of Johnson Matthey. Its profitable battery business dates back to the early 1990s, when lithium-ion batteries started to be used in Walkmans. Last month the company responded to a \u201cbig surge in orders\u201d by announcing a \u20ac300 million ($337.7 million) investment program. By 2020 its factories in Korea and China will be able to produce six times as many cathodes as they did in 2015.Brokerage Liberum Capital forecasts growth here will more than offset the decline of Umicore\u2019s catalyst business. The risk is that the company exchanges a comfortable competitive position\u2014like Johnson Matthey, it controls roughly a third of the autocatalyst market and makes double-digit margins\u2014with a fight for share against more aggressive East Asian cathode rivals. The consumer electronics market, from which Umicore partially withdrew in the face of new Chinese suppliers, is an ominous precedent.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.Meanwhile, Johnson Matthey\u2019s battery-materials revenues fell 2% over the year through March. The chemical compound in which it specializes, which is different from Umicore\u2019s, wasn\u2019t favored by a change in Chinese legislation. Johnson Matthey is now shifting staff and resources to Umicore\u2019s compound, but doesn\u2019t yet have a commercial product.There is plenty of life left in Johnson Matthey\u2019s catalyst business: It has been winning orders for ever more sophisticated diesel technologies to meet new emissions tests based on so-called real-world driving, and its big truck business doesn\u2019t face the pressures in the car market. Total catalyst sales rose 4% over the year through March. This legacy business should generate substantial cash for some time.A major gap has emerged between the companies\u2019 valuations: Johnson Matthey\u2019s stock is cheap for the chemicals sector, on 13 times earnings, while Umicore\u2019s is expensive on 23 times. But with mounting evidence that car makers are turning to batteries to solve their emissions problems, Johnson Matthey shares could become a value trap. Umicore\u2019s growth looks the less risky bet.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-investors-can-avoid-getting-hit-by-electric-cars-1496925757", "news_title": "How Investors Can Avoid Getting Hit by Electric Cars ", "keywords": " catalytic converters, electric car batteries,electric cars, heard on the street,Umicore,UMI.BT,BE:UMI,Johnson Matthey,JMAT.LN,UK:JMAT,Umicore S.A.,Volkswagen,XE:VOW,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,emission markets,motor fuel markets,primary metals,non-ferrous metals,automobile electronics,motor vehicles,automotive parts,tire stores,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "Adam Scott won twice on the PGA Tour last season, a feat that will long be remembered by himself, his caddie and several members of his immediate family. But in the events that everyone else recalls, otherwise known as golf\u2019s major championships, the Australian former world No. 1 finished no better than 18th place.This year, Scott plotted a change in strategy. No longer is he taking off the weeks before majors, as he did for years. Now, he is playing in those run-up events, not to improve his best golf but rather to bring it out during the four weeks that matter most.\u201cI\u2019m trying to peak,\u201d he said.Two weeks ahead of the U.S. Open, the notion of peaking at the right time is foremost on the minds of most of the best players in golf. Yet even as players gain more knowledge about their swings, their bodies and the courses they compete on, controlling the timing of peak performance remains golf\u2019s version of a Rubik\u2019s Cube.Many players try. Far fewer are confident that they\u2019ve solved it, even those that have won a major. Some are continually in search of a different approach. Others bristle at the very idea, arguing that it simply isn\u2019t possible.\u201cIt\u2019s a very inexact science,\u201d said four-time major winner Rory McIlroy. \u201cYou\u2019re always trying to figure out the best way.\u201dThe root of the dilemma is the variance that is inherent in the sport. One week, a player like McIlroy can look like the greatest golfer on the planet. The next week, that same player can miss the cut, and it barely registers as a shock. In time, the best will rise to the top of bigger-picture measures such as the world rankings and the prize money list. But none of those measures earn players prestige, fame and endorsements like the majors do.That reality prompts players to plan their year around those four weeks in several ways. Scheduling is one part of it. Some players believe competing the weekend before a major prepares them best. Some believe they\u2019re better off resting. They are sure one way is smarter \u2013 until they think maybe the other way is smarter.The extent to which their routines revolve around the majors is evident even in the winter. Butch Harmon, the legendary swing coach whose current pupils include world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, said players typically want any changes in technique to be made early enough in the year that they are comfortable with them before the Masters.In the weeks leading up to a major, some players treat other tournaments like glorified warm-ups. For example, Harmon said if the site of an upcoming major tends to favor right-to-left shots into greens, a player might hit them even though the hole they are playing favors the opposite trajectory.\u201cWe spend the whole year preparing for the four majors,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with upper-echelon guys, that\u2019s what their focus is.\u201dFor all that, relatively few players ever win a major. Among them, it isn\u2019t always obvious which ones have learned to peak and which ones merely catch lightning in a bottle.Since 2008, 29 players have won at least one major title. But even within that elite group, relatively few have demonstrated any sustained knack for raising their games at the majors.The sports data company Stats LLC analyzed the average finishes of those 29 players at majors versus non-majors and found that only Jason Day, the 2015 PGA Championship winner, has been markedly better at majors. Day\u2019s average finish at majors is 26th place, compared to 43rd at non-majors.Tiger Woods no doubt excelled in majors, winning 14 of them. But he was also the undisputed best player in the world. According to Stats\u2019s analysis, Woods\u2019s career average finish at majors (26th) is actually lower than his average finish in non-majors (18th).\u201cI knew guys, good friends, that tried to get everything timed up, where they could say, \u2018This is going to be a great week,\u2019\u201d said 2003 U.S. Open winner Jim Furyk. \u201cSometimes it worked, and sometimes they missed the cut.\u201dThat begs the question: To what extent does it make sense for players to consume themselves with major championship preparations to the neglect of other events? Among top players, the answer varies.\u201cIt\u2019s always so funny to me,\u201d said Justin Thomas, who has four PGA Tour wins but no major titles. \u201cEveryone is like, \u2018I want to be prepared and ready for the majors.\u2019 Well, what about the other 22 events you\u2019re playing in? You\u2019re basically telling everyone I\u2019m not going to prepare for these events to win.\u201dThe tournaments that fall before majors don\u2019t lament their status as final tune-ups. Some of them embrace it. The Houston Open, held the week before the Masters, conditions its course to simulate Augusta National. This week\u2019s Fedex St. Jude Classic in Memphis arranges a charter flight for players heading to the U.S. Open\u2014held at Erin Hills in Wisconsin this year\u2014on Sunday night.The Scottish Open, played the weekend before the British Open, sells its preparation value to players. In March, around the time players are plotting their summer schedules, the tournament noted on Twitter that seven of the top 11 finishers at last year\u2019s British Open prepared by playing in the Scottish Open.But when it comes to the choices players can make before the majors, predictive insights remain scarce.\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can possibly predict when you\u2019re going to peak,\u201d said 2009 British Open champion Stewart Cink. \u201cThis game is not like that. Preparation doesn\u2019t always lead to success. Over a long haul, it does, but not in one specific instance.\u201dWrite to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-peak-for-the-majors-no-one-in-golf-really-knows-1496925600", "news_title": "How to Peak for the Majors?

But members of Congress from rural areas are wary.That is because private investors are looking for infrastructure projects that throw off steady streams of revenue, from which they derive their profits, and those tend to be found near population centers.Some rural lawmakers have already begun to raise doubts about the few specific infrastructure proposals Mr. Trump has made.Republicans such as Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas have questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of a plan to privatize the air-traffic control system, saying private ownership could give short shrift to small rural airports.Sen. John Barrasso, (R., Wy.), chairman of the Senate\u2019s environment and public-works committee, has told local media outlets that an infrastructure package shouldn\u2019t require tolls on the lightly traveled highways in his state, the least populous in the country.Support from Republicans, many who represent rural areas, will be crucial in getting a large infrastructure package through the GOP-led Congress, since many Democrats have said they would oppose efforts to rely on tolls, rather than federal aid, to pay for building projects.Mr. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have expressed concern about his proposals to rely on private investors to fulfill his $1 trillion promise since the administration\u2019s first days. Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito,        (R., W.Va.), quizzed Transportation Secretary       Elaine Chao       during her confirmation hearing in January about how the administration would apply its plan in rural states, which can lack the traffic necessary to raise funds for investors through tolls and user fees.Ms. Chao avoided the question. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue that demands the best thinking of all of us,\u201d she said.That question looms large now that the administration has said it would intentionally shift more responsibilities to pay for infrastructure to cities and states, in some cases providing incentives to those local governments that are willing to raise fees and tolls on residents to do so.Incentives to bring in private investment will be beneficial, said       Ananth Prasad,        a senior vice president at HNTB and former secretary of transportation for the state of Florida.But, he said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t solve the overall problem\u201d of finding the revenue to pay for investments.Whether construction is funded and managed through traditional government outlays or through private investment consortia, Mr. Prasad and others in the construction business say, someone has to pay.Amid a whirl of other controversies such as the hearings on Russia\u2019s involvement in the election, Mr. Trump is continuing a series of events this week to highlight his commitment to infrastructure building, though the administration hasn\u2019t issued a detailed proposal and aides wouldn\u2019t say when one might emerge.The president was set to meet Thursday with mayors and governors at the White House to hear their views and concerns. And senior administration officials said the president would visit the Transportation Department on Friday to repeat his calls to cut back on permitting requirements that can delay the launching of major construction projects.The administration has signaled its openness to rural concerns. The White House told reporters on the way to a presidential speech in Ohio on Wednesday that the president\u2019s program would include federal grants for bridges, roads and waterways in rural areas. Because the administration hasn\u2019t released a concrete plan, it isn\u2019t clear whether similar grants will be offered to urban areas.Mr. Trump hinted at a willingness to raise the gas tax as one alternative way to fund an infrastructure package in an interview with Bloomberg last month. But White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       walked that back within hours, telling reporters Mr. Trump hadn\u2019t endorsed the idea.Mr. Prasad said that a gas-tax increase could be beneficial and that Congress should take its lead from Republican-leaning states, including Tennessee, Utah, Georgia and South Carolina, that have raised their own gas taxes to fund highway repairs.Some urban areas will be able to fund new projects like the Port of Miami tunnel, a public-private partnership Mr. Prasad helped oversee. That project is a 30-year partnership in which the state is reimbursing private investors who financed the construction through a series of \u201cavailability payments,\u201d paid out of Florida gas tax revenues, as an alternative to a toll.\u201cIt\u2019s a good model of public-private partnership,\u201d Mr. Prasad said, but one that requires a large and steady tax base, or a large stream of traffic that states are willing to toll to raise revenue.\u201cThat can\u2019t work on a reconstruction of I-70 in Kansas and Missouri,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if you\u2019re not going to toll that, they don\u2019t have the revenue to put together an availability payment.\u201dWrite to Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Infrastructure Runs Into a Divide.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-infrastructure-plan-faces-an-urban-rural-divide-in-congress-1496925503", "news_title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan Faces an Urban-Rural Divide in Congress", "keywords": "$1 trillion infrastructure plan,rural infrastructure,trump infrastructure,trump infrastructure plan,Donald Trump,Elaine Chao,political,general news,politics,international relations,urban planning,development,domestic politics,regional politics,transport"}, {"content": "When I asked a Beijing-based venture capitalist who travels to the U.S. frequently what foreigners need to know to understand the Chinese internet, he sent me a stream of comments he hears all the time:\u201cI thought without freedom of expression you can\u2019t innovate. I thought with censorship you\u2019d always be confused what product you can do. I thought American companies would be successful if it weren\u2019t for Chinese protectionism,\u201d ran his list. \u201cI thought Chinese people would really want to see American websites if they could.\u201dWhile censorship, protectionism and copying are often the first things that many foreigners associate with Chinese tech\u2014and they\u2019re undoubtedly important factors\u2014thinking beyond them is vital to understanding the Chinese internet.China leads the world in many ways: It is now the world\u2019s largest e-commerce and mobile-payment market. Of China\u2019s roughly 700 million mobile-internet users last year, half paid with their smartphones in stores and restaurants, 28% ordered meal delivery and 44% read online fiction, according to a government report.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Chinese internet and how it\u2019s influencing the rest of the world.1. Chinese aren\u2019t clamoring to bypass government internet filters to visit websites such as Google, YouTube and             Facebook.Yes, China heavily censors the internet. Many people are frustrated by the limits on life and work imposed by what\u2019s collectively called the Great Firewall.Still, the majority of Chinese aren\u2019t focused on what they can\u2019t reach because domestic websites more than fill the void.When a 13-year-old relative from the mainland came to visit me in Hong Kong earlier this year, I asked her if she wanted to watch videos on YouTube. No, she said, she prefers Chinese video sites. It\u2019s not about the language barrier; her English is excellent. It\u2019s about familiarity. She grew up watching Chinese TV dramas and variety shows online.2. Even when foreign apps aren\u2019t blocked, Chinese competitors win because so many people are using their products that they become indispensable.Internet calling and messaging apps Skype, WhatsApp and Slack are accessible, but they\u2019re just no substitute for Chinese products that locals are using in droves. Take             WeChat,       the social-messaging app from Tencent Holdings Ltd. that has more than 900 million accounts.\u201cChina runs on WeChat. So do our startups,\u201d says Ji Ke, program director at HAX Accelerator. The venture firm brings mostly North American and European hardware startups to Shenzhen to take advantage of the city\u2019s proximity to manufacturing facilities and supply chains. One of the first things HAX does with those foreign transplants, Mr. Ke says, is put them on WeChat so that they can communicate with locals, make payments and organize events.They tried to use Slack several times, he says, but reverted to WeChat after a few days because many of the people they were talking to didn\u2019t have Slack.3. Once a technology or a business model is out there, Chinese nimbly adapt it to the local market\u2014which in China is known as \u201cmicro-innovation.\u201dOppo and Vivo, the No. 1 and No. 3 smartphone brands by market share in 2016, appeal to young people and residents in smaller, less-wealthy cities. Their phones look like iPhones and pack many of the same features, but with China\u2019s lower cost base for manufacturing, they cost less than half the price of an iPhone.That has helped Oppo and Vivo double their market share, while Apple\u2019s has fallen by 13% to the fourth position.Meituan Dianping started as a copycat of             Groupon,       the daily-deals site. Now, Meituan delivers meals, books hotels, sells movie tickets and offers a             Yelp                  -like rating service.\u00a0Groupon remains, well, a daily-deals site.4. Rapid adoption is creating demand for new products and business models.Mobile payments, nearly nonexistent in China five years ago, are now everywhere\u2014restaurants, taxis, convenience stores\u2014making it possible to live a cashless life.China\u2019s mobile-payment volume rose by almost fourfold in 2016 to 58.5 trillion yuan ($8.6 trillion), according to iResearch. Some $800 billion of that went to ride services, games and shopping. By comparison, mobile payments in the U.S. rose 39% to $112 billion in 2016, according to Forrester Research.That\u2019s spawning new services, like shared bikes. Users can make payments and unlock the bikes via apps so there\u2019s no need for credit or stored-value cards or docking stations. The bikes have taken over Chinese cities.5. Now the copying has reversed\u2014in some ways.Facebook followed WeChat\u2019s footsteps in adding e-commerce, friend-to-friend money transfers and ticket buying\u2014which the website Tech in Asia called \u201cFacebook\u2019s WeChat-ification.\u201d Apple announced this past week that its iMessage service will also support a friend-to-friend payment transfer feature.When my Wall Street Journal colleagues reported last week that fast-food chains and high-end restaurants in the U.S. are expanding lunch-delivery services, my first thought was, \u201cThis is so China in 2015.\u201dWrite to Li Yuan at li.yuan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'A Glimpse Behind the Great Firewall in China.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-great-firewall-the-chinese-internet-is-booming-1496914383", "news_title": "Behind the Great Firewall, the Chinese Internet Is Booming ", "keywords": "china, internet, mobile, mobile payments, technology, wechat,political,general news,censorship,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,banking,credit,computing,financial services,mobile applications software,mobile payments,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits fell last week, the latest sign of steady job creation.Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., fell 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 245,000 in the week ended June 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 240,000 new claims.Estimates of jobless claims can be volatile from week to week, but generally have hovered near four-decade lows in recent months, suggesting that employers are holding on to workers.The four-week moving average of initial claims, which evens out weekly volatility, increased by 2,250 last week to 242,000.The number of claims drawn by workers for longer than a week\u2014so-called continuing claims\u2014declined 2,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended May 27.

But polling slip-ups are nothing new in Britain.Most pollsters had John Major\u2019s Conservative Party slightly behind the Labour Party in the 1992 election, according to data from PollBase. In the end,       Mr. Major       won handily, collecting the largest total amount of votes ever in a U.K. election. Investors applauded. The next day, the U.K.\u2019s benchmark FTSE 100 index jumped 5.6%, while the pound rose 1.4% against the dollar.Conversely, markets barely moved after       Tony Blair\u2019s       Labour Party swept to three comfortable victories in 1997, 2001 and 2005. Opinion polls had given him a healthy lead. In each case, the FTSE rose by less than 0.5%, while the pound declined by 0.6% or less.In 2010, polls suggested the Conservatives, or Tories, would win a majority of seats in Parliament. They didn\u2019t, giving Britain its first \u201cHung Parliament\u201d for over 25 years and leading to a Tory, Liberal Democrats coalition government. Investors hate uncertainty and the day after the vote the FTSE 100 fell 2.6% while the pound slipped by nearly 2%.The pollsters were wrong again for the 2015 election, after showing Labour neck-and-neck with the Tories. In the event, Conservative Prime Minister       David Cameron       won with a 17-seat majority. The FTSE 100 jumped over 2% and the pound rose 1.5% the next day.Fast forward to 2017 and the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s polling lead has narrowed sharply in recent weeks. In mid-April, some polls gave the Conservatives a lead of more\u00a0than 20 points\u00a0over\u00a0the Labour Party. That has narrowed to 8 points, according to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0average of opinion polls.\u00a0That should be enough to deliver       Mrs. May       a comfortable win.But with polls getting it wrong for so long, investors should prepare for big swings if there is another surprise late Thursday\u2014either to the upside or the downside.Write to Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-elections-matter-for-markets-1496915778", "news_title": "A U.K. Elections Surprise Could Give Markets Another Shock   ", "keywords": "british pound,conservative party,labour party,uk elections,uk polls,uk stocks,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,commentaries,opinions,routine market,financial news"}, {"content": "CLEVELAND\u2014Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night was the best game of the year.It had the most drama. It had the most at stake. It had the most of nearly everything there was to have in one game. It had the league\u2019s only teams capable of winning a title playing basketball at the highest level possible for so long that one of them simply couldn\u2019t for any longer. It had the most talented players on Earth doing the extraordinary things only they can do. It had 3-pointers from Stephen Curry, insane acrobatics from Kyrie Irving, unconscious shooting from Klay Thompson and utter brilliance from LeBron James. It even had a wild ending because it also had Kevin Durant.This was the game the entire NBA season was building toward, and the Golden State Warriors beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in a comeback 118-113 win that gave them a 3-0 series lead in the Finals and put them one game away from the first 16-0 postseason in the league\u2019s history may have actually been worth the whole year of anticipation.There was almost too much to appreciate. Game 3 was the basketball equivalent of sensory overload\u2014so let\u2019s turn off the lights, take a deep, deep breath and try to comprehend what exactly happened in Quicken Loans Arena last night. This was a game that\u2019s going to take some time.This was a game of absurd statistics. Irving had 38 points only to be outdone by James having 39 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists. Curry had 26 points, Thompson had 30 points and Durant had 31 points\u2014including the most important shot of his life.This was a game with a signature moment. It belonged to Durant, because of course it did. He took the ball from underneath Golden State\u2019s basket to the opposite 3-point line in only four dribbles and shot over James to give the Warriors a one-point lead with 45 seconds left after they\u2019d been down six points with three minutes left. The shot was devastating. Durant was delighted.This was a game that was crazy even before those last three minutes were so much crazier. The Warriors hit a record number of threes in the first quarter. James at one point was 10-of-11 from the field in the second quarter. Irving seized control with a series of plays in the third quarter that required instant replay to confirm their existence. But all that was forgotten when Golden State closed on an 11-0 run that was both remarkable and remarkably ordinary: Golden State had the most 10-0 runs of any NBA team, according to Stats LLC.This was a game that only could have improved on another made shot after Durant\u2019s\u2014and someone with a history of clutch shots against the Warriors had such an opportunity. From almost the exact same place on the court he launched a 3-pointer to win Game 7 of last year\u2019s Finals, a shot that was mathematically and maybe even metaphorically the biggest in NBA history, Irving unleashed an isolation three immediately after Durant\u2019s. This time it clanged off the front rim.This was a game the Cavaliers played well enough to win. They still lost. The Cavs forced 18 turnovers. They benefited from Draymond Green being in foul trouble. They had virtuosic performances from Irving and James. It\u2019s almost statistically impossible that Cleveland lost given what it got from James. He was on the court for 45 minutes and 37 seconds. The Cavs beat the Warriors in that time by seven points. He was off the court for 2 minutes and 23 seconds. The Warriors beat the Cavs in that time by 12 points. James was plus-seven in a five-point loss in which he barely took a breath. It\u2019s about as improbable as dunking over Durant. Which he also did.This was a game that was decided by a fundamental strategic question: How fast was each team willing to play? The Cavs insisted they weren\u2019t interested in slowing the game down. They believed they could beat the Warriors at their tempo. They were wrong. Cleveland was exhausted by the fourth quarter. The first half was played at a pace that would\u2019ve resulted in 112 possessions\u2014the fastest Finals game of the last two decades was only 108 possessions\u2014but the second half\u2019s pace was 94 possessions. The Cavs not being able to keep up with the Warriors in the first half cost them at the end of the second half. \u201cWe just kept telling the guys: They\u2019re going to get tired,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cStay in front of them. Force them into outside shots if you can. Fatigue will play a role.\u201dThis was a game that finally revealed how good the Warriors are. Golden State didn\u2019t need to care for most of the regular season and didn\u2019t get a challenge for most of the playoffs. Cleveland was supposed to be the team that would test the Warriors, but the first two games of the Finals were blowouts. Game 3 was the one the Warriors had been waiting for. They have been ferocious in Game 3s this year having learned from last year\u2019s Finals collapse that giving the other team life\u2014especially if that team has LeBron James in addition to life\u2014can eventually come back to haunt them.This was the game that will be remembered if the Warriors sweep the series\u2014and the entire postseason\u2014because it\u2019s the game that would have made them one of the NBA\u2019s greatest teams. \u201cEven when you\u2019re playing well,\u201d James said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to play, like, A-plus-plus.\u201dSo this was a game that might have been the last game that mattered this season. The Warriors now have a 3-0 lead and their eyes on a 16-0 postseason record. Which is why this was the game that almost certainly won the NBA championship.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-finals-drama-a-clutch-shot-and-a-knockout-punch-by-the-warriors-1496924217", "news_title": "NBA Finals: Drama, a Clutch Shot and a Knockout Punch by the Warriors", "keywords": "cleveland cavaliers,golden state warriors,nba,nba finals,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Good morning.

But even he will admit he\u2019s a little old fashioned. He likes his dining rooms quiet and the service leisurely. The response to his order of a gimlet should be, \u201cYes, of course,\u201d not a series of follow-up questions about newfangled brands of gin. For Dad, the food matters, but dining out is more about the occasion, the experience of sitting down and enjoying the meal.Which makes my father both the best and the worst person I could have invited to Made Nice, in Manhattan, the new \u201cfast-fine\u201d restaurant from Will Guidara and Daniel Humm. The pair has pedigree: Their flagship, Eleven Madison Park, widely celebrated for cosseting its customers, won the number one spot on this year\u2019s World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list, the influential annual ranking published by UK-based William Reed Media Group. In contrast, the service at Made Nice is purposefully quick, and the ambience is decidedly casual (read: noisy). The food is on trend, though thankfully not \u201cvegetable-forward,\u201d a buzzword that would send Dad\u2019s eyes rolling dangerously far into the back of his head.This is not just a tale of a pushy food writer and her father. It is a story that plays out over and over as long-held notions of what it means to dine out are challenged by a new breed of restaurants. Called \u201cfast-fine\u201d or \u201cfine-casual\u201d\u2014no one in the industry can even agree on the jargon\u2014these places are a hybrid of the assembly-line fast-casual format pioneered by Chipotle and the traditional fine-dining restaurant, where waiters deliver artfully arranged plates to your table.Service models vary, but at most fast-fine restaurants you order at a counter, then waiters bring the food to your table and let you order more drinks or dessert without queuing up again. So it goes at Souvla, Barzotto and Corridor in San Francisco; Destroyer and burgeoning franchise MidiCi in Los Angeles; and Chop Shop in Denver.The concept is shaped by mighty cultural and economic winds. Millennials crave value but demand sophisticated flavors, too, while restaurants seek to balance labor costs driven up by rising minimum wages and health-care costs.Dad and I arrived at Made Nice at 1:10 p.m., soon after its April 24 opening, and saw a line stretching out the door. The customers in front of us were hunched over their cellphones checking the menu; at a table nearby, another was eagerly photographing a dish of a daffodil-colored cauliflower curry. \u201cI\u2019m the oldest person here by 40 years,\u201d Dad shouted over the din. Then, looking at me, he conceded: \u201cWell, at least 27 years.\u201dAs we approached the front of the line, an open kitchen showcasing the restaurant\u2019s main selling point\u2014the top-level culinary talent and technique behind its dishes\u2014came into view. An affable young woman with an iPad took our order. Five minutes later, they called our name, and we carried our dishes from the counter to a table. Our food came chicly presented on what looked like slate trays (they are actually made out of old skateboards); our servings of New York state-made Cabernet Franc came in rather elegant but plastic tumblers. Dad tried the confit pork ($14), surrounded by a wreath of salad greens and orange and purple carrots, followed by that emphatically Instagrammable cauliflower curry ($11). \u201cThis food is too good for a place like this,\u201d Dad said. \u201cIt deserves to be appreciated.\u201dThe same features that cause my father to raise an eyebrow appeal to 20- and 30-somethings, who eat out, research shows, once, sometimes twice a day. At fast-fine restaurants, you get a proper meal, made to order, that allows you to sit down, briefly, then get back to work. The menus are modern and generally healthy-ish.Will Guidara, who is 37, said Made Nice represents his attempt to create the restaurant he would want to go to every day: \u201cMy life is not one where I can sit down [for long], especially during the day. What that means is that a few times a week I eat well and the rest of the time it\u2019s salads or burgers or tacos. This is our way of saying you can have restaurant-quality food without having to linger.\u201dThe goal\u2019s the same at Barzotto in San Francisco\u2019s Mission. Diners order big bowls of pasta ranging from $10 (paccheri with pecorino and black pepper) to $17 (pappardelle with braised beef, mushrooms and Parmesan). Compare that to much-lauded full-service SPQR over in Pacific Heights, where a plate of bucatini with blue cheese, walnut, kale and brown butter goes for an eye-popping $31.At L.A.\u2019s Destroyer, a $13 plate of rice porridge, caramelized broccoli and puffed rice looks like a work of art, but the set-up and no-reservations policy require guests to jockey for the rickety tables. Service, comfort and\u2014especially important to Angelenos\u2014parking are all sacrificed to offer extraordinary food for an affordable price.To date, millennials have favored fast-casual restaurants; 67% of them eat at them at least once a week compared to 59% of Gen-Xers and 45% of baby boomers, according to research firm Technomic. But fast-fine is \u201cgoing to hit an all-new sweet spot,\u201d said Eve Turow, author of \u201cA Taste of Generation Yum: How the Millennial Generation\u2019s Love for Organic Fare, Celebrity Chefs and Microbrews Will Make or Break the Future of Food.\u201d To this younger demographic, she added, \u201cit feels like an attainable, rational indulgence.\u201dMeanwhile, major cities have seen a recent spate of high-profile, fine-dining closings: Annisa and Da Silvano in New York; Bon March\u00e9 and Volta in San Francisco. The economics, restaurateurs say, no longer work. Rents are astronomical and minimum wages are gradually edging up to $15 an hour. This means that the lowest-paid employee will get $15 while managers are paid as much as $30 per hour. To cover those costs, restaurants will have to raise prices. And there are only so many people who are willing to shell out $18 for a green salad and $6 for an after-dinner cup of coffee.For       Charles Bililies,        CEO of San Francisco fast-fine chainlet Souvla, the question was, \u201cHow do we operate a profitable business in a very challenging environment?\u201d The number-one way: Reduce staff. From outside, Souvla looks a lot like a standard sit-down restaurant. There is no oversize menu board, no line of trash cans where guests bus their own plates. The food, a mix of rotisserie meats and vegetables, is served on sleek white-and-blue enamel trays, while the all-Greek wines are poured into elegant stemware. Each evening candles are lit on every table.\u2018\u2018This food is too good for a place like this,\u2019 Dad said. \u2018It deserves to be appreciated.\u2019\u2019But Souvla has no hostess, no sommelier and fewer servers than even a casual-dining restaurant. Its first location, a 42-seat space in Hayes Valley, serves, on average, 400 meals per service between sit-down, takeout and delivery, and has only two food runners delivering meals to tables. (A full-service restaurant of comparable size might be able to sell 100 meals in the same period, with a staff of about eight.) Mr. Bililies estimates his labor costs are as much as 15% lower than a traditional restaurant\u2019s, even though he provides medical benefits, paid vacation and a 401(k) plan to his 125 employees.\u201cYou\u2019ll see more and more of this out of need in expensive cities, and it will proliferate across the country,\u201d said Mr. Bililies. \u201cI firmly believe this is how people want to eat in 2017. They want quality, but they don\u2019t want to pay an arm and a leg for it.\u201dAt Made Nice, my father grasped this argument, though I could tell it challenged everything he believes about dining out. An artful bowl of porridge like those at Destroyer was not something he\u2019d want for breakfast, or maybe ever. But he couldn\u2019t deny the appeal of paying just a few bucks more than you would for a sandwich for a chef-worthy meal.In some quarters, change comes slowly. For my birthday last month, Dad took me to one of his favorite restaurants, La Chaumi\u00e8re, in Washington, D.C. At his urging, I ordered the Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9, tall and golden brown. The solicitous waiter presented it with a flourish. It isn\u2019t how I want to eat most of the time. But more than ever, it felt like a special occasion.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-grown-ups-guide-to-fast-fine-dining-1496923201", "news_title": "A Grown-Up\u2019s Guide to \u2018Fast-Fine\u2019 Dining", "keywords": "dining trends,fast-casual,fast-fine dining,fast-fine restaurants,fast food,fine dining,made nice,millennials dining out,world's 50 best restaurants,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,full-service restaurants,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "CARACAS\u2014Journalist       Laura Castillo       and a group of six writers and artists in Venezuela are fighting censorship here by delivering the news personally to their compatriots.Last month they started riding public buses around the capital city and reading three-minute news broadcasts from behind a square cardboard frame meant to evoke a television set. El Bus TV updates its viewers on the country\u2019s economic and social crisis in a way other news sources don\u2019t under President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro      \u2014a former bus driver, incidentally.\u201cWe want to hit at that wall of government censorship and we thought the bus is a medium that brings together the diverse population we want to inform,\u201d Ms. Castillo said.She and her colleagues launched volunteer-run El Bus TV in part to mark a troubling anniversary. Ten years ago last month, Venezuela\u2019s late strongman       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez       shut down what was then the country\u2019s most popular private media outlet, Radio Caracas Televisi\u00f3n. RCTV was overtly critical of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who blasted the media as an enemy of the people.Since then, 111 other radio stations, TV networks and newspapers in the country have had to close due to government sanctions, according to a tally maintained by the free-speech advocacy group Espacio P\u00fablico. The government denies accusations of censorship and says the media generates hysteria. It has blocked access to numerous foreign news websites and earlier this year took CNN en Espa\u00f1ol off air.In recent years, pro-government investment groups have bought out Venezuela\u2019s national daily papers and major private TV channels, gutting personnel and avoiding any reports that reflect badly on the Maduro government. Earlier this year, the country\u2019s attorney general, a longtime ruling-party stalwart, found her speeches no longer broadcast on state television after she slammed Mr. Maduro\u2019s efforts to redraft the constitution and brutally repress demonstrators.El Bus TV has no shortage of national news to report. Widespread food shortages, sky-high inflation and Mr. Maduro\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule have spawned more than two months of almost daily clashes between demonstrators calling for the president\u2019s ouster and state security forces, costing more than 60 lives. The Venezuelan press-workers union has documented 221 cases since March 31 of reporters being injured or robbed covering protests. In 163 of them, it said, the alleged perpetrators were members of the police or military.\u2018People hear the news and associate it with what they see every day.\u2019The government routinely closes Caracas\u2019s subway lines to frustrate protesters, but buses privately run by driver cooperatives still ply the city\u2019s traffic-clogged streets. Passengers regularly pass images that encapsulate the years of economic mismanagement and political unrest: families scrounging through trash for food; long, snaking bread lines; rows of National Guard in riot gear.\u201cIt\u2019s like watching the movie of our lives,\u201d said       Claudia Lizardo,        a 29-year-old writer working with El Bus TV. \u201cPeople hear the news and associate it with what they see every day.\u201dOn a recent day, El Bus TV delivered news on the recent winning streak of Venezuela\u2019s under-20 national soccer team before discussing how state-subsidized food wasn\u2019t reaching large parts of the city, leaving people with little more than mangos to eat.Amid the government crackdown on protesters, the reporters pointed out that each tear-gas canister fired by the National Guard costs as much as $40, more than the monthly minimum wage since the plunge in value of the national currency, the bolivar.\u2018How can I get news if I\u2019m on the bus four hours a day?\u2019Such critical perspectives have become harder to get as the government takes greater control over the airwaves. While social media have helped fill some of the gap, millions of Venezuela\u2019s slum dwellers lack internet access and can\u2019t afford data plans on their mobile phones, leaving them in the dark about the civil unrest rocking their nation.For many, time is another rare resource. \u201cHow can I get news if I\u2019m on the bus four hours a day?\u201d said       Rosalba P\u00e9rez,        a 61-year-old who rides the bus from her east Caracas slum to clean homes in a wealthier part of the city.Ms. Castillo, El Bus TV\u2019s co-founder, emphasizes that it promotes no political party, makes no calls to join protests and doesn\u2019t ask passengers for money, unlike the many musicians and beggars that hop on and off the buses.Passengers sometimes look confused, being more used to hearing salsa music blaring from bus speakers than staged news reports. But the reporters say most of El Bus TV\u2019s trips so far have been received positively, with riders applauding and shouting thanks. Many bus-drivers don\u2019t charge the journalists the 3 U.S. cents per person it costs to board.The El Bus TV team\u2019s low profile has helped them deliver the news on buses in western Caracas, a ruling-party enclave where government detractors have long been barred from marching.Their initiative is also growing. After their pilot run went viral on Twitter, El Bus TV found 50 volunteers ready to join at a training session last week. New groups have launched in the industrial city of Valencia and in the eastern city of Puerto la Cruz. Ms. Castillo said upcoming excursions will also include health professionals to give riders tips on nutrition as they grapple with food scarcity.\u201cThis is a chance to participate in a possible solution to the problems facing our country without the radicalization,\u201d said       Oswaldo Macho,        a theater actor and new recruit to El Bus TV. \u201cWe just want to fulfill everyone\u2019s basic right, which is to be informed.\u201dWrite to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/journalists-board-buses-to-challenge-venezuelas-censorship-1496923200", "news_title": "Journalists Board Buses to Challenge Venezuela\u2019s Censorship", "keywords": "venezuela censorship, venezuela crisis, venezuela media, venezuela protests, venezuela unrest,Laura Castillo,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,political,general news,censorship,civil unrest,national,public security,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Blackstone Group        BX 0.78%       LP, one of the world\u2019s largest private real-estate investors, has closed a \u20ac7.8 billion ($8.9 billion) fund that will focus on European commercial real estate, the biggest of its kind ever raised.The fund will follow an \u201copportunistic\u201d strategy, meaning it will typically buy riskier properties that need fixing up or repositioning. The goal is to deliver to investors double-digit returns. The fund could have about \u20ac24 billion worth of buying power because Blackstone often uses as much as 70% leverage when buying property. Blackstone overall has $368 billion of assets under management, including $102 billion of real estate.Blackstone has been a major player in the European property market through years of political and financial upheaval. The firm has kept buying through Brexit, the Greek debt crisis and worries about the possible collapse of the euro, partly because prices fell below what it cost to replace the properties.\u201cThere were a lot of negative headlines,\u201d said       Jonathan Gray,        Blackstone\u2019s head of real estate. But the firm believed it was being \u201cappropriately compensated\u201d for taking the risks because prices reflected the distress, he said.Mr. Gray said it might become tougher finding investments for the new fund because other investors are becoming more bullish on Europe. \u201cIt may get a little bit harder than it was previously,\u201d he said.The fund\u2019s closing comes just days after Blackstone\u2019s real estate unit announced a big European purchase and an even bigger sale. On Monday, the firm said it was buying             Sponda                   PLC, one of the largest owners of office and retail property in Finland, in a privatization that valued the company at \u20ac3.8 billion including debt.Last week, Blackstone announced it had agreed to sell Logicor, the European warehouse business itstarted in 2012, for \u20ac12.2 billion. The buyer in that deal\u2014one of Europe\u2019s largest property transactions ever\u2014is sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp.Blackstone\u2019s investments in Europe have spanned a range of countries and property types, often taking advantage of distressed situations. It has purchased thousands of Spanish apartments, a German office building company and billions of euros worth of distressed debt backed by property from European banks.After U.K. voters approved the Brexit referendum last year and some investors panicked, Blackstone swooped in and purchased a portfolio of industrial property from             Aberdeen Asset Management                   PLC.But concerns over Brexit did slow Blackstone\u2019s efforts to raise the current fund. It took about a year to raise the money, company officials said.Blackstone executives said they still see bargains stemming from distressed financial institutions in southern Europe. The firm also is looking to buy property in new technology centers in cities such as Berlin, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Dublin.Blackstone believes it has an advantage over other investors because the European market is harder to understand, more complicated legally and has less available public information than the U.S. market. Europe is \u201cmore opaque,\u201d said       Anthony Myers,        Blackstone\u2019s head of European real estate. \u201cExperience and having boots on the ground in a number of these locations is a real advantage.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Blackstone is buying Sponda PLC in a deal that values the company at 3.8 billion euros including debt.

E-commerce giant             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -0.39%      , social-media champion             Tencent Holdings Ltd.        TCEHY 3.69%       and search engine             Baidu Inc.        BIDU 0.74%       are betting that one-stop shops that match merchants with consumers represent the next wave of consumption.China\u2019s internet giants have been on a tear. Alibaba said Thursday that revenue in fiscal 2018 could grow as much as 49%, sending its shares higher. Both it and Tencent have notched stock-price gains of more than 40% this year, with analysts predicting even more growth.Still, the country\u2019s market of 731 million internet users is peaking, with several times the number of people accessing the web and shopping on smartphones as in the U.S. As growth opportunities narrow, the big three internet companies are increasingly cutting across each others\u2019 businesses, including online video streaming, cloud computing and internet finance.VIEW GraphicWith deep pockets and a powerful influence on day-to-day Chinese life, the companies have amassed a tangled array of investments, becoming kingmakers for startups and contributing to a funding glut that has created more than 100 billion-dollar startups in China, surpassing the number in the U.S.Tencent, China\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization, is a global gaming giant and owns China\u2019s largest social network, WeChat. The app is prevalent in the lives of its more than 900 million monthly users. In recent years, Tencent has accelerated its push into mobile payments. According to research firm Analysys, it had 40% of China\u2019s mobile-payments market, snatching some of that from Alibaba, whose affiliate Ant Financial at one time monopolized the industry.Alibaba\u2014which runs China\u2019s most popular e-commerce websites, Taobao and Tmall, and has more sales than Amazon and             eBay                   combined\u2014chronicles the spending habits of more than 450 million customers through its payments affiliate. It competes neck and neck with Baidu on internet mapping services in China.Baidu, whose market capitalization has lagged behind that of its two rivals of late, dominates internet searching in China and is often referred to as China\u2019s Google. It has bet heavily on artificial intelligence and driverless cars, a field that Tencent is moving quickly into.The frenzy to invest means the three tech giants sometimes overlap. Tencent and Alibaba are both investors in China\u2019s ride-hailing app, Didi Chuxing. Baidu and Tencent also jointly back electric-car maker NextEV, which will start production of an electric SUV in China this year.Currently, these three companies are fighting over the untapped segments of Chinese consumer lifestyles such as booking real-world services through the internet, referred to in the industry as online-to-offline services.China\u2019s internet-driven lifestyle-services industry is forecast to grow to 7.8 trillion yuan by 2020 ($1.15 trillion) from almost 5 trillion yuan in 2015, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, dwarfing that of the U.S.Alibaba has backed Koubei, a lifestyle search engine that is the newest entrant into the field. Koubei said in February that it had raised $1.1 billion from investors, giving it a valuation of $8 billion. Weeks later, Tencent-backed Meituan-Dianping said it had raised 1.5 billion yuan ($218 million) to start a venture-capital fund to help restaurant- and leisure-related merchants grow.Those apps go further than those available elsewhere, such as Yelp Inc. Users can not only order food and make an appointment with a hairdresser, they can also book day trips, holidays and educational classes, and hail rides.Meituan-Dianping dominates China\u2019s industry, with 75.5% market share last year, according to Analysys. Baidu\u2019s Nuomi is second, with 24%. Koubei has yet to establish a major presence.The competition offers another prize: a wealth of big data companies can use to unlock more money in a market where user growth is slowing. The data those services yield gives the companies more power to target consumers with tailored advertising, helping them capture a larger slice of the online-advertising pie. All three say their data analytics will win them a greater share.Beijing-based Baidu said it is accelerating efforts to use its artificial-intelligence technologies, such as virtual-reality hotel tours, to boost merchants on its platform. Its location and search data can also advise merchants on optimal locations to open a physical store: Several consumers searching for a manicure salon in an area could indicate demand for one.Koubei, whose name translates to \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d said it can sell services to businesses that want to better manage their customer base and customize promotions.\u201cRestaurants know very little about their customers,\u201d said Koubei CEO       Samuel Fan,        whose app leverages Ant Financial\u2019s customer database. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if he lives nearby, or is he a student or a professional? How does he shop online? We offer them our database of information to give them this insight.\u201dMeituan-Dianping, the $18 billion industry leader, uses order and browsing history to send targeted ads. It has added ride-hailing and homestay bookings to the app.The company has five million merchants on its platform, the most among the three. Nuomi has two million, while Koubei has 1.5 million.Koubei\u2019s funding salvo may delay profitability in the sector, but Meituan-Dianping\u2019s investors aren\u2019t perturbed. Meituan-Dianping\u2019s first-mover advantage and user reviews will help it hold on to its lead, said early-stage investor       James Mi,        Lightspeed China Partners\u2019 co-founder.\u201cIn such industries, there is usually only space for one big player,\u201d Mr. Mi said.\u2014Lilian Lin contributed to this article.Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 07:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/face-lifts-and-finance-chinas-kingmakers-tangle-over-the-internet-of-everything-1496921603", "news_title": "Face-Lifts and Finance: Where China\u2019s Tech Titans Are Hunting for the Next Big Thing", "keywords": " alibaba, apps, baidu,china, internet, lifestyle apps, technology, tencent,Alibaba Group,BABA,Baidu,BIDU,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,internet search engines,computing,e-commerce,internet,online,mobile applications software,technology"}, {"content": "YANGON, Myanmar\u2014The Myanmar navy and local fishermen pulled 39 bodies and airplane wreckage from waters off the country\u2019s southern coast Thursday, a day after a military plane disappeared carrying 122 people, many of them the family members of soldiers.Authorities in the Southeast Asian nation lost contact with the plane Wednesday afternoon as it was flying from the southern city of Myeik, also known as Mergui, to the country\u2019s largest city, Yangon, the military said.

The attacks are the first that Islamic State, a Sunni extremist group, has claimed in predominantly Shiite Iran; the two main branches of Islam have battled in other Middle Eastern countries for decades. If confirmed as the work of Islamic State, the attacks would serve as the latest evidence of the group\u2019s ability to direct operations away from its home bases in Syria and Iraq, where it is under mounting military pressure.Apple is playing catch-up in a product category it invented. Siri gained popularity for its ability to follow voice commands to handle simple tasks such as calendar appointments and text messaging, and had no real competitors for years.

He is so confident that its use in electric-car batteries will cause demand to surge that he has been buying and storing more than a thousand metric tons of the stuff\u2014worth more than $56 million at current prices.He feels he has little choice but to hold physical metal, since acquiring a cobalt position in financial markets is so hard.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money looking for a home in cobalt,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cThey really don\u2019t have a great way to play it.\u201dCobalt has long been a component in tires, magnets and smartphones. Now, it is the latest material, along with lithium and copper, to benefit from its use in the lithium ion-batteries that power electric vehicles.Slightly more than half of all cobalt bought or sold last year went toward rechargeable batteries, up from 20% in 2006, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.Battery manufacturers\u2019 soaring demand for the hard, silvery metal has propelled cobalt\u2019s value to its highest level since 2008. Prices are up 70% this year through\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0to $56,500 a metric ton, making it the top-performing commodity traded on a major futures exchange.Yet there is a problem for many investors eager to add a position: How do you get it?Reliable data on cobalt trading is hard to come by, since the majority of transactions occur directly between the handful of specialized trading houses, producers and consumers of the metal. The ranks of traders shrank after the financial crisis and subsequent collapse in commodity prices drove many firms that deal in cobalt out of the business, traders said.Physical trading activity still exceeds that of the seven-year-old futures market. While volume in cobalt futures on the London Metal Exchange quintupled during the first five months of 2017 over the same period last year, the lack of participants keeps prices vulnerable to sudden swings.\u00a0On\u00a0May 4, for instance, prices dropped by more than $3,000 a ton\u00a0in one day, driven down by one seller before recovering, traders said.Instead, some money managers have purchased shares of companies that produce cobalt. But since cobalt is a byproduct of copper and nickel mines, the big producers come with a lot of exposure to other metals. Copper is up 1.6% so far this year, but nickel has dropped by nearly 12%.The dearth of options has prompted investors like Mr. Mitchell, the general partner of Portal Capital LLC, to buy the mineral instead.Mr. Mitchell began buying cobalt in April last year, when it was trading at nearly $24,000 a metric ton. He also has taken positions in a number of minor metals, like uranium and germanium, that he felt were mispriced. Last year he began focusing on\u00a0cobalt and lithium,\u00a0in a bid to play the rise of electric cars.About 20% of his portfolio is in shares of companies that produce battery materials. The rest is in physical cobalt, which he stockpiles in two warehouses in 250-kilogram drums.He even stores cobalt for other investors who aren\u2019t invested in his fund but want to own the metal. He chose to keep his haul in Connecticut because the east coast receives big cobalt deliveries.Mr. Mitchell said whenever he is in New York for business meetings, he stops by the warehouse to talk with the warehouse managers about what they are \u201cseeing and hearing\u201d about the metal.Lithium surged early last year as             Tesla Inc.started to grow the market for battery-powered cars. Many investors seek to participate in lithium gains by owning shares of producers like             Albemarle Corp.       and             Galaxy Resources Ltd.Metals including copper, aluminum and nickel are also beginning to generate more demand related to electric cars. Electric vehicles use copper as a conduit for electricity, and aluminum is expected to increasingly replace steel as manufacturers seek to lighten automobiles.But no other commodity has been moving as fast as cobalt.       Matthew Langsford,        portfolio manager at Terra Capital, has about 35% of the fund\u2019s $100 million in assets invested in cobalt and lithium stocks.Mr. Langsford considered buying physical cobalt but was worried that offloading a big pile of cobalt might be difficult if he needed to sell quickly. Instead he purchased shares of cobalt miners like             eCobalt Solutions Inc.       and             Equator Resources Ltd.       last June.A Toronto-based firm called Cobalt 27 is hoping to capitalize on the booming demand for cobalt and its lack of investability by creating a publicly traded vehicle that buys the material and royalties on mining assets. The firm said it is in the process of raising money and is seeking a stock market listing.Battery makers are also purchasing more cobalt themselves, analysts and traders said, to stock up on cobalt before prices rise further.Cobalt faces other issues that threaten to make it scarcer. A lack of mine investment due to years of low nickel and copper prices could spark a shortage in cobalt supply in the next few years, analysts said.But some suggest the opposite is more likely:             Morgan Stanley                   analysts warn that the material\u2019s prospects may dim as battery makers buy cheaper metals instead of cobalt, and the restart of major copper mines adds to market supply.\u201cIt\u2019s been a rather boring, tedious market,\u201d said       Guy Darby,        owner of U.K.-based cobalt trading firm Darton Commodities. \u201cNow is the fun time.\u201dWrite to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-investors-amassing-cobalt-its-the-easiest-way-to-play-this-years-hottest-commodity-1496919601", "news_title": "Why Are Investors Amassing Cobalt?

The success of each film has helped fuel follow-ups so that even adaptations of virtually unknown comic books like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d have launched with the feel of major franchises.\u201cCinematic universes are becoming more and more what studios are doing and audiences are wanting,\u201d said       Alex Kurtzman,        director of \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and a producer on the monster movies set to follow it in what Universal is calling its \u201cDark Universe.\u201dMost major studios now have cinematic universes on screen or in development. They have supplanted the franchise, in which one big budget movie is followed by sequels or spin offs, as the biggest scale and potentially most profitable type of product Hollywood can muster.Launching a cinematic universe presents major challenges, however, because an early misstep can topple the movies intended to follow. That\u2019s what happened with             Sony        SNE 0.47%       Pictures\u2019 plans for \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man\u201d universes.Time Warner Inc.\u2019s        TWX 0.05%       Warner Bros. has made big adjustments to its DC superhero universe since Chief Executive       Kevin Tsujihara       in 2014 announced plans for 10 interconnected movies over five years, in part due to negative fan and critical reactions to its first two releases, \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201dWith \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d Universal is attempting to generate fan excitement for a universe featuring creatures like Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the Wolfman and the Invisible Man, but without making overly grand pronouncements that could set it up for embarrassment later.\u201cWe really want each movie to be able to stand on its own two feet,\u201d said Universal Chairman       Donna Langley.\u201cThe Mummy\u201d appears headed for a so-so opening of about $40 million in the U.S. and Canada, said people who have seen prerelease survey results. It may perform better oveseas though, as evidenced by its $6.6 million debut Tuesday in South Korea, the biggest ever opening day in that country.The film will open with a \u201cDark Universe\u201d logo to brand it as part of a new series. Mr. Kurtzman, working with writer-producer       Chris Morgan,        created an overarching story about a monster-hunting organization that will connect the pictures. Its leader,       Henry Jekyll,        is played by       Russell Crowe.Universal has already signed other big name actors to star in future films, including       Johnny Depp       as the Invisible Man and       Javier Bardem       as Frankenstein\u2019s monster.The only movie the studio has put on its release calendar, however, is a remake of \u201cBride of Frankenstein,\u201d for February 2019. The film will be directed by \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d director Bill Condon. It doesn\u2019t yet have a star, though the studio is hoping to cast       Angelina Jolie,        said a person close to the project.The other films are in development but not yet far enough along to have release dates. On at least one, the script was initially written without any connection to the broader universe, said a person involved.Unlike Marvel, where President       Kevin Feige       and his team carefully plot out each film\u2019s place in a larger story years in advance, Universal is figuring out how the pieces of its Dark Universe will fit together as it goes along, said people with knowledge of the matter.\u201cThe interconnectivity is going to build as the movies build,\u201d said Mr. Kurtzman.Universal decided to focus on its monster-movie universe following a 2014 meeting organized by NBCUniversal CEO       Steve Burke       to identify new franchises the media conglomerate could rally around, said a person with knowledge of the matter. Classic monsters were quickly identified as strong candidates, because while Universal doesn\u2019t own the literary characters, it produced a series of movies based on them in the 1930s, \u201940s and \u201950s and is closely identified with them.Universal also released a trio of successful \u201cMummy\u201d movies between 1999 and 2008. A 2010 version of \u201cThe Wolfman\u201d flopped, while 2014\u2019s \u201cDracula Untold\u201d performed modestly.If the films are successful, monster toys, cartoons and theme park attractions will likely be on the company docket.When Sony released a reboot of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d last year, it opened it with a logo for \u201cGhost Corps,\u201d signaling its intention to release a series of films set in the world of spirit hunters. But after that film fizzled at the box office, those plans were mostly shelved.Similarly, its plans for a Spider-Man cinematic universe that would follow 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\u201d were set aside after that movie turned in a weak box-office performance. Sony recently revived plans for two related movies, however, based on high expectations for this summer\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d which it is producing with Marvel.Warner Bros., meanwhile, has found it challenging to release DC films at the pace Mr. Tsujihara initially promised as it has dealt with directors who have dropped out, executive shuffles and efforts to lighten new films\u2019 tones after fans and critics complained that last year\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d were too grim.This past weekend\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d widely praised for its more upbeat feel, was a hit and will be followed in November by \u201cJustice League.\u201d But a \u201cFlash\u201d movie planned for next year has lost two previously attached directors, so the studio will release only one superhero movie in 2018, \u201cAquaman.\u201d Other DC projects, including \u201cShazam,\u201d \u201cCyborg\u201d and a second \u201cJustice League,\u201d remain in the early development stages, people at Warner Bros. said.Viacom Inc.\u2019s        VIAB 2.09%       Paramount Pictures is evolving its \u201cTransformers\u201d franchise, which has previously had a sequel every two or three years, into a cinematic universe, with a new installment every year.

Consumers turned off by the reduced flavor of lean lamb chops and cutlets switched to other meats such as pork.Per capita lamb and mutton consumption in developed countries fell by 36% between 1995 and 2015, whereas consumption of pork rose by 2.8% and chicken by nearly 40%, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Sheep numbers in New Zealand, which together with Australia accounts for more than 70% of global lamb exports, fell to 27.6 million last year from more than 70 million at their peak in 1982.Now, New Zealand is peddling fatty sheep again in an attempt to reverse the decades of decline. The country\u2019s farmers are pinning their hopes on a new lamb strain, dubbed Te Mana, which New Zealand started exporting last month after 10 years of experimental breeding.New Zealand\u2019s sheep industry has had other challenges in addition to its animals\u2019 fat content. From the 1990s, a slump in the price of wool\u2014a side business for some meat farmers\u2014and a later boom in dairy prices led farmers to switch to bovines from ovines. Another misstep was a sales-and-marketing strategy that focused on volume rather than quality, industry experts say.\u201cNew Zealand has just been sending undifferentiated lambs to the world,\u201d said       Peter Russell,        head of marketing at Alliance Group, one of the country\u2019s biggest livestock cooperatives.Engineering a turnaround will be tough. An internet survey of 2,000 American consumers last year found nearly 60% hadn\u2019t eaten lamb for at least six months. Lamb and mutton prices have lagged along with popularity, rising only 12% in the decade through 2016, versus 48% for beef and 54% for chicken, according to World Bank data.New Zealand\u2019s quest for a tastier sheep began in 2007, when 50 farmers from the Headwaters cooperative teamed up with the New Zealand government and Alliance Group to launch a breeding project. The group, dubbed the Omega Lamb Project, analyzed 500 separate genetic lines of sheep, looking for high levels of intramuscular fat and the ability to thrive in the cold hill country to which many sheep farms had been pushed, after lowland pasture was taken by more-profitable crops and dairy cows.The winner was Ram 211, a sheep that also had high levels of Omega-3, a fatty acid that around a fifth of Americans take as a nutritional supplement.\u201cHe was right in the top five for everything,\u201d said Ram 211\u2019s keeper, Lumsden farmer       Simon Saunders,        pointing out the animal on a recent afternoon.From Ram 211, the Omega Lamb Project developed a breed of sheep with high fat levels, which it eventually named Te Mana. The group experimented with feed as well, testing out around 20 different types of forage in summer, after the sun had dried out the grass in the hills. So far, the group has spent 25 million New Zealand dollars (US$18 million) on the project.The group is also paying close attention to marketing, taking a page from New Zealand\u2019s wine industry, which boosted profits by moving from a strategy of churning out cheap, bulk wine to focusing on high-quality vintages like a variety of Sauvignon Blanc that grows well in the country\u2019s chilly climate.The Omega Lamb Group has so far slaughtered 30,000 Te Mana lambs for trial sales, mostly in New Zealand. The group hopes exports will help increase that number to 60,000 next year and 1 million by 2025. New Zealand currently slaughters around 20 million lambs annually.Early sales suggest restaurants are willing to pay up to double the price of regular lamb for Te Mana, depending on the cut, says       Mike Tate,        general manager of Omega Lamb.\u201cThe difference between Te Mana lamb and other lamb is quite striking,\u201d said chef       Samuel Wilkes,        who tried out Te Mana at Japanese fusion restaurant Zuma in Hong Kong.Exports began in May, with farmers targeting Michelin-starred restaurants in Hong Kong\u2014part of a strategy to project a premium image. The group plans to export to Europe, North America and Dubai later.\u2014Lucy Craymer contributed to this article.Write to Ben Collins at Ben.Collins@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Can Fatter Lambs Fatten Up Sales?.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 06:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/woolly-bullies-new-zealand-breeds-fattier-lambs-to-beef-up-sales-1496917803", "news_title": "Woolly Bullies: New Zealand Breeds Fattier Lambs to Beef Up Sales", "keywords": " fat lambs, healthy eating, high-end eating, lean lambs, new zealand agriculture, new zealand farming,new zealand lamb,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,Mike Tate,Peter Russell,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,livestock,meat markets,agriculture,farming,sheep,goat farming,livestock farming"}, {"content": "Chinese companies growing appetite tapping an unconventional source of financing might not be a source of eternal bliss.Perpetual securities, bondlike instruments that pay interest but have no maturity dates, have become popular in China in recent years: Issuance jumped to $55 billion in 2016 from less than $1 billion in 2012, according to Dealogic. This year, Chinese companies have been keener to issue them in offshore markets, raising some $4.4 billion, more than their dollar-denominated issuance in all of 2016.A big reason Chinese companies like perpetuals is that they are classified as equity on their balance sheets. The accounting logic is that perpetual issuers don\u2019t ever have to repay the bond\u2019s principal and can choose to defer annual coupon payments\u2014making them similar to dividends.Treating perpetuals as equity means companies can report lower gearing ratios, a measure investors commonly use to assess a company\u2019s indebtedness. China Evergrande, the country\u2019s biggest property developer by assets, had a net debt-to-equity ratio of 120% as of December. That ratio would have jumped to 432% if its perpetual bonds had been counted as debt. Investors are happy to play along as the perpetuals usually pay higher yields. Evergrande effectively paid an 11% coupon on its perpetuals last year.But whatever the accounting rules say, perpetual securities still work much more like debt than equity in China. To start with, companies can defer coupon payments on perpetuals only if they aren\u2019t paying dividends to their shareholders. Given that Chinese companies often have a majority shareholder, and therefore nearly always pay a dividend, that clause rarely applies.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.Moreover, perpetuals in China often include a clause that automatically steps up the coupon rate, usually after three to five years. Since the step-up is usually quite steep, issuers have a strong incentive to redeem their perpetuals early\u2014making them not so perpetual, after all. The coupon on a recent $500 million perpetual bond issue from state-owned             Power Construction Corp.       of China will jump by 5 percentage points, more than double its initial yield, after five years.Debt or equity, perpetuals present a challenge because of their elevated financing costs. Payments on Evergrande\u2019s perpetual securities wiped out almost two-thirds of its net profit last year, for example. The company now says it will redeem all its perpetuals this year, one reason its share price has surged in recent weeks.Investors hoping to live happily ever after with perpetuals ought to scrutinize why companies are issuing such disguised debt in the first place\u2014and whether it is really in their interests.Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 06:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/perpetual-doesnt-mean-forever-in-china-1496917796", "news_title": "Perpetual Doesn\u2019t Mean Forever in China ", "keywords": " bonds, china, chinese, debt issuance, developers, equity,evergrande, financing costs, perpetual securites,China Evergrande Group,HK:3333,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic news,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Sign up:With one click,get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.The worst may be over for the marine shipping industry, after years of overcapacity and devastating price wars. An improving global economy is driving more oceanbound trade, with volumes in the dry-bulk sector expected to grow 3%, outpacing a projected 1% increase in capacity. Improved demand from China for thermal coal and iron ore are helping drive up demand for dry-bulk ships. The container market is also rebounding, with prices up 55% last month. Container shipping lines have greater control over capacity and rates on key routes after the biggest players consolidated into a handful of alliances, the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris writes. Collectively, these operators are likely to turn a profit this year, after multi-billion-dollar losses in 2016.

But farmers are hoping there\u2019s a little left over to fix aging inland waterways, the systems of locks and dams vital to the movement of crops from the heartland to the coasts, the WSJ\u2019s Jacob Bunge and Jesse Newman write. The U.S. river system ferries nearly three-quarters of export-bound U.S. grain to ocean ports, but most locks and dams, which allow river barges to move through various elevations, have outlived their intended 50-year lifespans. U.S. exporters absorb some of the financial toll of inefficient transport, with farmers on the Upper Mississippi or Illinois rivers receiving up to 21 cents less per bushel of corn in the event of unplanned closings of certain locks. Such closings could leave grain companies with less supply to bring to market and reduce economic activity by up to $2.4 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reliability concerns could also make U.S. farmers less competitive globally, as other farm powers like Brazil work to cut their transportation costs. Repairs won\u2019t be cheap: trade groups estimate that high priority repairs could total $8.7 billion.Chinese smartphone makers are making a name for themselves in developing markets where brands like             Apple Inc.       and             Samsung Electronics Co.       have failed to adapt. For example, Chinese manufacturer Transsion Holdings Ltd. became the top player in Africa by developing localized features like devices with two card slots for customers who had multiple SIM cards, and an optimized camera for people with dark skin. Oppo rolled out wide angle front facing cameras when it noticed its South Asian customers liked taking group selfies. These companies and others are clustered in China\u2019s Pearl River Delta, close to component makers that have graduated from contract manufacturers for Western technology companies to innovators in their own right. Cheap production costs and access to the latest advances have sparked fierce competition between Chinese smartphone makers, which now pose a threat to global giants. Oppo sell more than three phones in China for every two sold by Apple. Chinese makers are also making strides in the U.S. Smartphone makers from China increased their market share to 19% in the U.S. last year from 13% in 2012, at the expense of Apple and Taiwanese maker             HTC Corp.       But fierce brand loyalty among Apple customers means the different Chinese players are mostly competing against themselves.Bebe Stores Inc.       is selling some of the last vestiges of its brick-and-mortar past in order to guarantee a future online.

GOOGL 0.59%       and             Microsoft Corp.        MSFT 0.76%Those five stocks have accounted for 41% of the S&P 500\u2019s market-capitalization advance this year.\u00a0Of the 101 top-performing actively managed U.S. stock funds this year, 84 count two or more of those technology firms in their top five holdings, according to             Morningstar Inc.The best-performing funds by definition pick the best-performing stocks. While funds in the past have had large holdings of big tech firms, what\u2019s unusual about 2017 is that the biggest stocks are doing\u00a0particularly\u00a0well, meaning investors must make more outsize bets\u00a0to beat their benchmarks.The average price gain for the S&P 500\u2019s 10 largest U.S. stocks was 12% through the first five months of this year, the second-highest mark for that group over the past two decades, according to WSJ Market Data Group. The S&P 500\u2019s tech sector had gained 20% this year through May, compared with the broader index\u2019s 7.7% advance.Yet\u00a0gains by big tech companies\u00a0have left some investors uneasy, concerned that prices have run up too far, too fast but also reluctant to pare holdings on the market\u2019s strongest performers. Facebook, Apple and Amazon all climbed at least 32% this year through May; Alphabet was up 25%, while Microsoft had tacked on 12%.A survey of nearly\u00a0200 fund managers last month by             Bank of America                  Merrill Lynch found that money managers view the tech-oriented             Nasdaq Co      mposite Index as the world\u2019s \u201cmost crowded trade.\u201d\u201cThese stocks are up 30% [this year], and so are they getting pricey? Yeah,\u201d said       Michael Lippert       of the Baron Opportunity Fund, which owns big slugs of Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and             Netflix Inc.       and is up 29% this year through\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cBut ask yourself: What else do you want to own\u00a0five years from now?\u201dThe heady rally in technology and internet stocks is in some ways reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, when the promise of the information superhighway translated into bullishness that ultimately imploded with excess.In the dot-com boom, as now, there was pressure on fund managers to place large bets in the technology sector to keep up.Fund managers say one difference between then and now is that firms like Amazon and Alphabet\u00a0are more deeply entwined in the day-to-day lives of their customers, enjoy more of an edge over competitors and are expanding into more industries.\u201cThe reality is there are relatively few winners in the U.S. economy now,\u201d said       Justin White,        manager of the             T. Rowe Price                   New America Growth Fund, which is up 21% this year, according to Morningstar. It has large holdings of Amazon\u00a0and Facebook shares.The boost from big technology companies is helping stock pickers achieve one of their best starts to a year since the end of the financial crisis. Nearly half of all actively managed U.S. stock funds, about 49%, beat their benchmark through May. That is the highest percentage of those funds outperforming in that period since 2009, when 56% did so.The firms that try to beat the market have faced pressure in recent years from funds that aim to mimic the performance of broad market indexes, often at a much lower cost.The best-performing large-cap growth stock fund this year tracked by Morningstar is the\u00a0$4.7 million Zevenbergen Genea Fund, which was up 40% through Tuesday. Amazon by itself represented nearly 10% of the fund\u2019s portfolio holdings as of the end of March. The fund, launched in 2015, is a new entrant from Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a $2.15 billion Seattle-based asset manager that has focused on growth stocks for three decades.\u201cThe strong keep getting stronger. We don\u2019t see that theme changing any time soon,\u201d said       Anthony Zackery,        a portfolio manager at Zevenbergen. \u201cRecent performance is a manifestation of the scale these companies have built out in recent years.\u201dSome fund managers say they are wary of how fast tech shares are accelerating. Mr. White of T. Rowe Price said he dialed back some of his bets on technology firms because their shares have risen so much this year. He said, however, that he is reluctant to hold less of the sector than his fund\u2019s benchmark because there is still potential for further gains.The growth of large technology stocks this year is \u201cobviously unsustainable,\u201d said       Gavin Baker,        manager of the $15.1 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio. But he said the group was hit hard in late 2016, creating a low starting point.Mr. Baker, whose fund is up 25% year to date, called Google, Amazon and Facebook artificial intelligence companies that he expects to expand over the next five to seven years.By some comparisons, the shares have room to run. Tech stocks were an even bigger proportion of the S&P 500 back in 2000, representing 34.5% of the overall index compared with 23% today, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. And valuations were higher then. The average stock price of S&P 500 tech shares trades at 19 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next year, according to FactSet. That is above the S&P 500 index\u2019s price/earnings ratio of 17.7, but is far below the P/E of 53.4 that the tech sector traded at in March 2000.Stock pickers say one of the biggest threats Google, Amazon and Facebook are likely to contend with is new regulations targeting online privacy and the way customer data is collected and used. Investors also say that, while antitrust concerns are a risk, especially in Europe, there is no way to predict their timing or impact.There are also risks that as the companies expand they will compete with each other as their business models sprawl into new, overlapping industries.But the flip side, some say, is the dominance itself. Says Mr. Lippert of the Baron fund: \u201cWe are going to have a winner-take-all or winner-take-most world.\u201dWrite to Chris Dieterich at chris.dieterich@wsj.com and Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Tech Giants Bolster Active Stock Pickers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 06:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-reasons-stock-pickers-are-off-to-a-fast-start-facebook-amazon-apple-alphabet-microsoft-1496914381", "news_title": "Five Reasons Stock Pickers Are Off to a Fast Start: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft ", "keywords": " alphabet, amazon, apple, facebook, fang, google, investing, netflix,stock market,Amazon.com,AMZN,Apple,AAPL,Facebook,FB,Netflix,NFLX,T.

TSLA -0.91%       includes a 1,000-horsepower sports car burning rubber on a test track.At the Japanese auto maker\u2019s research center here this week, a race-car driver showed off a battery-powered electric version of the Acura NSX sports car, with flashy turns and screeching brakes. The car isn\u2019t for sale: It was built specially for a race up Pikes Peak last year in Colorado Springs, Colo. But it is a test for some of the technologies Honda is working on to stand out in an electric-car field that is getting more crowded.\u201cI want our R&D to establish how we can compete against and distinguish ourselves from Tesla,\u201d said Katsuya Hishiki, Honda\u2019s head of electric vehicle development, at the center two hours north of Tokyo.On Wednesday, Honda said a new electric vehicle is being designed from the ground up by Mr. Hishiki\u2019s team, and it plans to show off the results at\u00a0an auto show this fall. It is the first stage of Honda\u2019s plan to make two-thirds of the cars it sells electric-powered by 2030.Established auto makers are all rushing to devise electric-vehicle strategies, and many are hoping to draw attention away from Tesla.             General Motors Co.       late last year introduced its Chevrolet Bolt electric hatchback, which sells for about $30,000 after tax incentives\u2014less than half a Tesla Model S. Tesla is expected to roll out its own mass-market model later this year.Honda\u2019s goal is to keep its electric cars affordable but infuse them with a sporty feel in hopes of expanding its audience beyond people trying to make an environmental statement.Its initial effort, a battery-powered version of the Clarity sedan, will go on sale in the U.S. later this year. It has quick acceleration and nimble corner handling, according to Honda, and will cost about $35,000.But the battery-powered Clarity has a major shortcoming: driving range. It can travel only 80 miles on a single charge. That compares with up to 335 miles for the Tesla Model S and 238 miles for the Chevy Bolt. The Clarity\u2019s range is closer to that of             Nissan Motor Co.\u2019s       original Leaf model, which went on sale in 2010.Honda says that to cut costs, the Clarity was designed to house different types of power. In addition to the battery-electric version, there is also a hydrogen fuel cell version and a plug-in hybrid version. Honda\u2019s ambitions are limited: It plans to sell 75,000 units of the Clarity in the U.S. over four years, roughly the same number of cars it sold in May alone.Bigger hopes rest on the new electric vehicle that Honda is building from scratch. It didn\u2019t say when that will be available.Honda President       Takahiro Hachigo       hopes to pick up the pace of development. Once known for innovative vehicles born from its involvement in motor sports, the company has tended to lag in technology in recent years, including with electric cars, autonomous driving and even innovation in conventional vehicles.\u201cWe need to improve our future competitiveness with Honda-like electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles that instill a Honda-like feeling,\u201d Mr. Hachigo said. \u201cSometimes I think we\u2019ve only just started and have much to do.\u201dThe first attempt at breaking away from humdrum designs is the latest Civic sedan, which Honda engineers are calling a throwback to the company\u2019s glory days. The company threw away the budget and designed an entry-level vehicle, costing about $20,000, with a turbocharged engine and the latest autonomous driving software.Christopher Richter, an auto analyst at CLSA, said the company was still a strong competitor in the chase to design next-generation cars.\u201cThis is an engineering-driven culture that under promises and over delivers, compared to others who might be more marketing-oriented,\u201d he said.Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Honda Maps Electric Goals.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 06:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hondas-new-electric-is-inspired-by-car-that-buzzed-up-pikes-peak-1496914123", "news_title": "Honda\u2019s New Electric Model Is Inspired by Car That Buzzed Up Pikes Peak", "keywords": "000-horsepower sports car,1,automotive technology,battery powered vehicles ,honda ,honda motor,tesla ,tesla inc. ,Honda Motor,HMC,Tesla,TSLA,Christopher Richter,Katsuya Hishiki,plans,strategy,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,alternative fuel vehicles,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,technology"}, {"content": "Boeing Co.        BA 1.27%       is moving some work completing aircraft to China and other overseas markets but doesn\u2019t expect this to affect its U.S. manufacturing workforce, said the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest aerospace company.Dennis Muilenburg       is trying to reshape the company by boosting the profitability of its core commercial jetliner business and increasing defense exports while trimming costs with job cuts and more automation.\u201cMy goal over time is to add manufacturing jobs, but these will be different kinds of jobs,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said in a recent interview.Mr. Muilenburg and other manufacturing CEOs are under pressure to help deliver on President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pledge to boost employment in the sector in return for tax and regulatory changes. However, potential changes to trade policies sit uneasily with some big exporters such as Boeing.Boeing has been cutting its U.S. workforce through a mix of buyouts and involuntary layoffs, with the aim of revamping its factories through increased automation and use of new technologies it says can lower the cost of jet and defense systems\u2019 production. Boeing\u2019s employee roll fell to around 145,000 at the end of May, down 30,000 from 2012, though it hired 11,000 new workers last year.But Mr. Muilenburg said that overseas facilities such as the new plant it is building with a Chinese partner near Shanghai aren\u2019t directly harming U.S. jobs. He said the effort is an essential part of doing business in a China market that is expected to generate sales of 6,800 jets over the next 20 years.Employees at the Chinese plant will paint jetliners destined for the Chinese market and equip them with seats and other interior fittings. Boeing is building the plant in partnership with state-owned Comac, which is spearheading China\u2019s own efforts to develop a more advanced aerospace sector, recently flying for the first time its C919 jetliner, a competitor to the Chicago-based company\u2019s own best-selling 737.Comac also supplies Boeing with parts for its jets but has ambitions to produce a range of its own, recently inking a deal with a Russian aerospace company to develop a new widebody plane, the most profitable part of the industry.Mr. Muilenburg said: \u201cWe know as we\u2019re investing there we\u2019re also creating a competitor.\u201dOther aerospace executives such as             United Technologies Corp.       CEO       Greg Hayes       have flagged the potential impact of China\u2019s aerospace ambitions. \u201cThe Chinese will build aircraft someday, they will build engines someday, they will build aircraft systems someday and our goal is to continue to innovate to stay ahead of the curve such that we can capture those markets, and not them,\u201d Mr. Hayes said at a recent investor conference.Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter by dollar value, and while fast-growing customers such as China increasingly want to trade orders for more work in their own countries, Mr. Muilenburg said barters to secure cheaper labor costs wasn\u2019t part of Boeing\u2019s strategy.\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of taking large operations in the U.S. and moving them overseas,\u201d he said. Mr. Muilenburg credited the new administration with revising its own thinking on how global industry supply chains interact, recognizing how domestic jobs are tied to work carried out overseas.Boeing recently secured a potential $50 billion in defense and commercial sales from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi sales include a pact to complete some Boeing Apache attack helicopters in the kingdom, and the company is also interested in assembling fighter jets in India to secure a deal that could involve more than 100 planes.The Saudi agreements were sealed during the recent state visit by the president that included delegations led by Mr. Muilenburg and the CEOs of             Lockheed Martin Corp.       and             Raytheon Co.Boeing and Lockheed both supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal dumped by the Trump administration, but have retained close ties with the White House.Mr. Muilenburg said the company has a \u201cseat at the table\u201d when it comes to trade policy, tax and regulatory reforms and the defense budget.The executive, who enters his third year in charge as CEO in July, has been outspoken in calling the U.S. business climate uncompetitive, even after securing a record backlog of 5,700 jetliners and plans to boost monthly output of its workhorse 737 planes to 57 by the end of the decade from 42 at present. That would boost Boeing\u2019s annual deliveries to more than 900 by the end of the decade from an estimated 750 this year.New orders for Boeing and rival Airbus SE have been scarce this year, but while the U.S. company is considering an all-new plane that would sit between the 737 and the 787 Dreamliner that was plagued by delays, Mr. Muilenburg said the biggest benefits may come from changing the way it makes planes, rather than designing them.\u201cThe opportunity ahead of us in terms of transforming how we design and build how we manufacture is even greater than some of the product innovation that we\u2019re going to bring to the table,\u201d he said.Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-chief-says-overseas-plants-wont-hit-u-s-jobs-1496914203", "news_title": "Boeing Chief Says Overseas Plants Won\u2019t Hit U.S. Jobs", "keywords": "boeing jobs,boeing plant,china,chinese market,overseas plant,Boeing,BA,Dennis Muilenburg,capacity,facilities,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,lay-offs,redundancies,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,politics,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Citigroup,       the last truly cheap major bank in the U.S., is approaching two key turning points that should help its shares close in on a better valuation.The major overhang for the bank is excess capital. Its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% is significantly higher than the three other largest U.S. banks. A ratio of around 11.5% would be sufficient to keep it comfortably above regulatory minimums.These high levels of capital in turn drag down its return on equity, which at 7.4% in the first quarter remains decidedly subpar. This helps explain why the bank trades at just 0.8 times book value, compared with an average 1.2 times for its three closest peers.The Federal Reserve holds the key to solving this problem through theannual stress tests, which determine how much capital banks can return to shareholders. Following last year\u2019s test, Citigroup announced that it would return $10.4 billion to shareholders over four quarters starting in the third quarter of 2016. It later raised this amount to $12.2 billion. That still falls well short of the roughly $15 billion of net profits that Citigroup is likely to have earned over the period, meaning excess capital is still accruing.The results of the latest stress tests will be announced in late June, and investors are expecting to see a significant increase in Citigroup\u2019s dividends and share buybacks. If the company can start paying out more than it earns, as appears likely, it will start the process of reducing excess capital.Coincidentally, Citigroup\u2019s aggressive expansion of credit card lending is expected to start paying off around the same time, in the second half of this year. The bank began rolling out new cards in the middle of 2015 and said at the time that it would take around two years for them to become profitable as borrowers start to build balances and pay interest.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.Separately, Citigroup acquired American Express\u2019s Costco credit card business last June. It initially had to book provisions for losses on existing loans, but gave guidance indicating that the portfolio would start contributing to the bottom line in the second half of 2017.The bank\u2019s total credit card loans in North America were up 17.7% from a year earlier to $126 billion in the first quarter. The high rates on these loans should help Citigroup boost its overall returns. The risk, of course, is that defaults could be higher than expected, especially on its $44 billion portfolio of cards issued in partnership with retailers, which target less-creditworthy borrowers. Given recent signs that consumers are getting overstretched on auto and student loans, this risk bears watching in the quarters ahead.Nonetheless, the overall picture at Citigroup is of a bank finally turning the page on lingering issues.

But the act of businesses paying their suppliers and vendors remains relatively old-fashioned with a heavy reliance on checks.In 2016, just over half of so-called business-to-business payments in the U.S. were made by check, according to data from the Association for Financial Professionals, a trade group. That is down from 67% in 2010 but up a bit from 50% in 2013. For consumers, the percentage of bills paid by check fell to 17% in 2016 from 23% in 2013 and 37% in 2010, according to consulting firm Aite Group.Notably, in the field of person-to-person payments, banks have banded together to develop their own alternative to Venmo called Zelle that uses a bank-owned entity to transfer funds.In business-to-business payments, some banks, including KeyCorp and Fifth Third Bancorp, are opting to distribute AvidXchange\u2019s products rather than develop their own. Both banks earlier took a minority stake in AvidXchange in addition to signing commercial agreements.Mastercard will also promote AvidXchange to banks that issue credit cards that run on its network. By making the process more digital and giving customers and banks more access to data, Mastercard hopes firms will opt to use their commercial credit cards over checks when paying other businesses, said       Colleen Taylor,        Mastercard\u2019s executive vice president for new-payments business.AvidXchange CEO       Michael Praeger       said business-to-business payments have been so slow to move to more modern methods because the transfer of money has typically occurred at the end of a regimented process that includes multiple steps of coding invoices and getting them approved by various managers. \u201cYou don\u2019t generate hundreds of CFOs changing a back-office product overnight,\u201d Mr. Praeger said in an interview.Recently, venture-capital firms and other tech investors have spent big sums to acquire stakes in other firms focused on business-to-business payments. Last month,             FleetCor Technologies Inc.       said it agreed to pay around $675 million to acquire Cambridge Global Payments. Billtrust, a software company focused on automating the accounts-receivable process, said last month that it raised $50 million from Riverwood Capital Management and other investors.Founded in 2000, AvidXchange spent most of its first decade focused on making software to manage the sending and receiving of business invoices for small- and medium-size firms.After it migrated much of that process from paper to a computer-readable format, it offered software that allowed clients to pay their bills electronically through integrations with over 130 different accounting systems. More recently, AvidXchange entered the business of lending clients money against invoices that may not be paid for 30 days or so.The company has expanded to around 850 employees, including the recent addition of former senior executives from             eBay Inc       and             Capital One Financial Corp       to top roles.

The plan raises questions, however, about potential pitfalls for teenagers who might not be academically ready.By state data, only 25% of the test takers at LEAP Academy last year met the benchmark SAT score of 480 out of 800 that reflects college readiness in reading and writing. Meanwhile, 11% met the benchmark score of 530 in math.The charter\u2019s founder,       Gloria Bonilla-Santiago,        said she believes the seniors can handle a full schedule of college work because many have done well in these classes before. She said SAT scores aren\u2019t a good measure of the abilities of urban youth, who often lack the expensive tutoring and other resources that benefit more affluent peers.Most of the charter\u2019s students are poor, and black or Hispanic. According to 2016 state data, 93% of its students graduated high school in four years.The percentage of students who met SAT benchmarks for college readiness last year.*LEAP ACADEMYReading and Writing: 25%Math: 11%NEW JERSEY STATEWIDEReading and Writing: 71%Math: 53%*Reading and Writing 480, Math 530.Source: New Jersey Department of EducationMs. Bonilla-Santiago said tackling college would be more motivating than a fourth year of high school. \u201cSenior year is often a wasted year,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the kids are bored to death.\u201dMany high schools nationwide offer \u201cdual enrollment\u201d in colleges to expose students to the campus vibe and inspire them to pursue higher education. The so-called LEAP Early College plan, to start next fall with about 120 students, is unusual in that includes the entire senior class.The students will study with professors on the Camden campuses of Rutgers University and Rowan University, but will take classes only with other LEAP students.Evo Popoff,        former chief-innovation officer at the New Jersey Department of Education, said many students in low-income communities lack rigorous instruction and would benefit from the higher expectations of college, but \u201cat the same time, you don\u2019t want to make it so far out of reach that they fail.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure if everyone will be able to keep up with everything,\u201d said 17-year-old       Samuel Morales,        a LEAP valedictorian who already has taken several Rutgers courses. Even so, he praised the plan because getting a glimpse of advanced education will show students \u201cthey can\u2019t play around any more.\u201dAdam Lowe,        executive director of the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships, said such programs can help students at risk of struggling in college by giving them experience while they still have the supports of high school. But there are risks, he said. Bad grades likely will remain on their college transcripts and affect their GPA, he noted.LEAP officials said its teachers will lead review sessions, monitor students\u2019 work and tutor them if necessary. The charter school will use its public funding for the program and the universities will offer lower tuition, they said.Michael Sepanic,        spokesman for Rutgers in Camden, said the pilot project fit with its mission of increasing access. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t enter into this if we thought there was no way to support the kids,\u201d he said. Rutgers is offering courses in business and the humanities, including African-American history and cultural anthropology.Horacio Sosa,        a vice president at Rowan, said the students would be placed in math and writing courses according to ability. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold idea,\u201d he said. \u201cLEAP Academy is doing everything in their power to make sure every single student succeeds.\u201dThese institutions have worked together for years. Mr. Sosa is on the board of LEAP, along with several Rutgers officials in Camden.

When voters head to the polls for the first round of legislative election on Sunday, Ms. Reverso-Meinietti will represent Mr. Macron\u2019s party on the ballot, competing with seasoned candidates who would have likely brushed neophytes like her aside in any other year.Polls suggest 2017 will be a political year like none other in France\u2019s recent history. The wave of support that carried Mr. Macron, 39, to victory last month is likely to propel his fledgling political party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, into the driver\u2019s seat of the 577-seat National Assembly.A nationally representative survey conducted by Ipsos Sopra-Steria between June 2 and June 4 showed his party garnering 29.5% of the first-round vote, followed by the center-right Les R\u00e9publicains with 23%. Projections by the same pollster indicate the second-round vote on June 18 would hand Mr. Macron a clear majority, with between 385 and 415 seats.A victory for Mr. Macron\u2019s party in constituencies like Nice would amount to a deathblow for France\u2019s political establishment. It would also strengthen the new president\u2019s hand in pushing unpopular economic overhauls through parliament\u2014something Mr. Macron and his European allies say is vital to fixing the European Union and its common currency.By streamlining France\u2019s sclerotic labor code, Mr. Macron hopes to persuade Germany and other northern European countries to allow the strongest members of the eurozone to act as financial backstops for the weakest.\u201cWithout this majority we will be blocked for another five years,\u201d Ms. Reverso-Meinietti said.Mr. Macron\u2019s party flaunts the inexperience of its candidates as it makes a play for seats in conservative strongholds long considered impervious to challengers. Nice is the fiefdom of incumbent       Eric Ciotti,        a conservative stalwart and R\u00e9publicains party chieftain whose tough-on-terror r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has long made him unassailable for opponents from any party, including the far-right National Front of       Marine Le Pen.Nice was the target in July of an Islamist terrorist\u2019s truck attack that killed 86 people among the thousands lining the coastal city\u2019s promenade to watch a Bastille Day fireworks display. Mr. Ciotti, who headed a 2015 parliamentary commission on jihadist networks, has held his district for a decade.Mr. Macron has maneuvered to divide Mr. Ciotti\u2019s party by appointing senior lawmakers from Les R\u00e9publicains as ministers in his new government. The president has also backed away from fielding his own candidates in about 50 constituencies\u2014including some in the Nice area\u2014where Les R\u00e9publicains candidates have indicated they would ally with the French leader if elected.Mr. Ciotti said Mr. Macron was focusing on politicking \u201cwith the complicity of those who betrayed their beliefs to get a position.\u201dOn Saturday, the president dispatched top ministers\u2014one from Les R\u00e9publicains and the other a Socialist\u2014to Nice to campaign alongside Ms. Reverso-Meinietti.\u201cThere is a national reconfiguration taking place. We have to take part and leave our bitterness to one side,\u201d said Budget Minister       G\u00e9rald Darmanin,        an ally of former French President and Les R\u00e9publicains leader       Nicolas Sarkozy.As Mr. Darmanin arrived, Mr. Ciotti\u2019s supporters fanned out around city hall and a nearby flower market to hand out leaflets and urge voters not to give Mr. Macron a blank check.\u201cWe have a lawmaker who is doing the job. There\u2019s no reason to change,\u201d said       Anthony Bressy,        a 28-year-old campaigner for Mr. Ciotti.\u2018People in Nice want to be part of this dynamic. They don\u2019t want to be left at the back of the class.\u2019Ms. Reverso-Meinietti\u2019s foray into politics began in January when she spent 10 minutes filling out an online application to become a parliamentary candidate for Mr. Macron\u2018s movement.At the time, Mr. Macron was behind in the polls, and Ms. Reverso-Meinietti\u2019s friends mocked her as utopian, she recalled.Nice is one of the most challenging districts for Mr. Macron.       Fran\u00e7ois Fillon,        the presidential candidate for Les R\u00e9publicains, garnered the largest share of the vote here in the first round of the presidential election. Mr. Macron finished third behind Ms. Le Pen of the National Front, which is also fielding a candidate here for the legislative election.To qualify for the runoff, Ms. Reverso-Meinietti needs to either finish in one of the top two spots Sunday or garner support from more than 12.5% of registered voters. Doing so would require siphoning votes from Mr. Ciotti as well as driving turnout of leftist voters.\u2018Mr. Ciotti has done so much for the town of Nice. It\u2019s really the important point here.\u2019Mr. Macron\u2019s commanding presidential victory has given Ms. Reverso-Meinietti\u2019s candidacy a shot in the arm.\u201cPeople in Nice want to be part of this dynamic,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be left at the back of the class.\u201dOn the campaign trail here Saturday, Ms. Reverso-Meinietti handed out leaflets at a popular downtown park that Mr. Ciotti inaugurated in 2013.Sonia Adrien,        a bathroom janitor at the park, said she welcomed a young candidate but that wasn\u2019t enough to change her vote.\u201cMr. Ciotti has done so much for the town of Nice. It\u2019s really the important point here,\u201d Ms. Adrien said.Handing out leaflets for Ms. Reverso-Meinietti at the same market,       Nadine de Fondaumi\u00e8re,        a recently retired high-school teacher, said divisions among conservatives could help Mr. Macron\u2019s candidate win. Still, she expects it will be difficult for Ms. Reverso Meinietti.\u201cIf she beats Eric Ciotti, it would be a real thunderbolt,\u201d Ms. de Fondaumi\u00e8re said.Appeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Macron Bets on Rookies to Win Poll.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmanuel-macron-bets-on-rookies-to-win-french-parliamentary-election-1496914204", "news_title": "Emmanuel Macron Bets on Rookies to Win French Parliamentary Election ", "keywords": " french national assembly,french parliamentary elections 2017, french politics, la republique en march party,National Assembly,Caroline Reverso-Meinietti,Emmanuel Macron,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014House lawmakers aim to pass legislation by July addressing how the nation handles flood insurance, a senior Republican said, setting up a regional battle in the Senate over how the federal government covers property damage after natural disasters.The program has roughly 5 million policies nationwide, but it is running a deficit and is $25 billion in debt from large storm-damage payouts in recent years. Lawmakers face a dilemma in restoring the program\u2019s solvency without creating sticker shock to homeowners who have been paying artificially low rates, leading to competing proposals over how to restore the financially broken National Flood Insurance Program.\u201cUnfortunately, today many moderate-and low-income individuals actually subsidize others,\u201d House Financial Services Chairman       Jeb Hensarling       (R., Texas) said at a Wednesday hearing on flood insurance.Rep.       Sean Duffy       (R., Wis.), who is leading efforts on the issue in the House, is looking at a way to gradually raise rates to be more in line with the risk. Lawmakers are also considering proposals to update the maps used to assess rates and create incentives for more private insurers to enter the market. Mr. Duffy in an interview said he hopes the committee can pass a package to the House floor this month, but no later than August recess.\u201cThis is truly a discussion draft,\u201d Mr. Duffy said of his plan. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for people\u2019s input\u2026which will help us, I think, avoid some of the problems we\u2019ve had in the past.\u201dDemocrats support some of the provisions but have raised concerns about tinkering with rates, pointing to 2014 when Congress had to stall previously authorized rate increases that surprised consumers and depreciated home values.Rep.       Maxine Waters       (D., Calif.), ranking Democrat on the committee, said recent attempts to change flood insurance led to \u201cunintended consequences that I worked very hard to undo because we saw the premiums rise substantially.\u201d She said Mr. Duffy\u2019s proposal \u201cdoes not meaningfully address affordability and in some cases may actually make matters worse.\u201dDemocrats instead, have asked lawmakers to forgive the flood program\u2019s $24.6 billion in debt, a move Republicans oppose.Mr. Duffy said Republicans are focused on the program\u2019s $1.5 billion annual deficit and aren\u2019t yet ready to address its debt.Several senators have or are planning to weigh on the issue, suggesting lawmakers from flood-prone regions of the country, such as along the coasts, and areas with less flooding could once again battle over how to balance homeowner rates and subsidies. Sens.       Jon Tester       (D., Mont.) and       Dean Heller       (R., Nev.) introduced legislation earlier this year, for instance, while Sens.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.),       Kirsten Gillibrand       (D., N.Y.) and       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.) on Wednesday announced a different plan.Additional proposals are likely to emerge in the coming weeks from members in the Senate Banking Committee, which is charged with sending a final package to the Senate before authorization of the program expires Sept. 30.If Congress can\u2019t agree to a comprehensive bill to restructure the program, they can extend it temporarily in order to avoid a lapse that in the past led to thousands of stalled home sales.Mr. Duffy said he is hopeful Congress can approve a package before the program expires. \u201cWe\u2019re early here,\u201d he said.

The revision brings official data into line with signals from business surveys, which had pointed to an acceleration in the recovery as the year began.The confirmation of a first quarter pickup will likely amplify calls from Germany and some other parts of the eurozone for a winding down of the stimulus measures launched by the European Central Bank since mid-2014. ECB officials were meeting in Tallinn, Estonia Thursday to decide on their next moves.The European Union\u2019s statistics agency said that in the three months through March, gross domestic product\u2014a broad measure of the goods and services produced in the eurozone economy\u2014increased by 0.6% from the final quarter of 2016, and by 1.9% from the first three months of that year. Eurostat had previously estimated quarter-to-quarter growth at 0.5%, and year-to-year growth at 1.7%.That translates into annualized growth of 2.3%, up from 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the first quarter, the U.S. economy grew by 1.2%.The pickup was aided by another strong rise in investment spending, although that slowed from the previous quarter. Crucially, trade wasn\u2019t a drag on growth, as it was in the previous quarter, as exports matched the increase in imports.In addition to becoming stronger, growth also became more widespread across the eurozone\u2019s members. The Greek economy grew after a fourth-quarter contraction, while previously weaker economies such as Finland, Portugal and Italy experienced pickups.The ECB has acknowledged that the eurozone\u2019s recovery is becoming firmer, and its economists may raise their projections for this and coming years when they publish new forecasts Thursday, having already lifted them in March. However, policy makers have continued to see a greater risk that growth will be lower than expected than that it will be higher. Some analysts expect ECB President       Mario Draghi       to change that view and describe those risks as \u201cbalanced\u201d when he speaks in a news conference later Thursday.Despite the pickup in growth, policy makers remain cautious about removing the stimulus they have provided over recent years, awaiting clear evidence that the recovery is stoking underlying inflationary pressures. They have recently pointed to the large number of unemployed and underemployed workers in the eurozone as evidence that slack in the economy remains substantial. Central bankers look to the gap between what an economy can produce and what it is producing as an indicator of future inflation rates, and the ECB continues to see what is known as an \u201coutput gap.\u201dWrite to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Eurozone Growth Outpaced Estimates In First Quarter.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 05:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-grows-at-fastest-rate-since-2015-1496912402", "news_title": "Eurozone Economy Grows at Fastest Rate Since 2015", "keywords": " ecb,eurozone, eurozone gdp, eurozone growth,European Union,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,euro zone,currency,economic news"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014North Korea fired multiple cruise missiles into the waters between Korea and Japan on Thursday morning, a day after Seoul said it would suspend any further deployment of a controversial missile-defense system to conduct an environmental review.The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said they were likely antiship missiles fired from near the city of Wonsan on North Korea\u2019s east coast that flew about 125 miles.The missile launch comes less than a week after the United Nations Security Council passed a new resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea as punishment for its missile tests.It also comes a day after South Korean President Moon Jae-in formally said he would halt the deployment of a controversial U.S. missile-defense system in South Korea while the government conducts an environmental assessment of the site in southern South Korea.The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, battery currently has two launchers, short of the full array of six launchers that typically comprises a Thaad battery.The Moon administration said that those two launchers could remain, but that any further deployment would be subject to the review. The U.S. says that the battery, with its two existing launchers, is operational and capable of shooting down North Korean missiles.Both the White House and Pentagon referred questions about the launches elsewhere. Thursday\u2019s launch didn\u2019t appear to involve the use of ballistic missile technology, the primary concern of U.S. officials for its potential threat to the American homeland.Officials in Washington have avoided comment on the controversy surrounding the Thaad missile defense battery, saying they regard it as a domestic issue in South Korea. Proponents of the deployment said the system remains critical to efforts to protect South Koreans from Pyongyang\u2019s increasingly sophisticated abilities.\u201cI hope any environmental concerns related to the full deployment of Thaad will be dispelled with a quick and thorough review,\u201d said Rep. Ed Royce (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cAnd we must continue to press China and Russia to play more productive roles, since North Korea\u2019s nuclear program endangers us all.\u201dEarlier this month, Mr. Moon ordered an investigation after the South Korean Ministry of National Defense deliberately withheld information from the presidential Blue House about the arrival to South Korea of four additional launchers for the Thaad battery.Mr. Moon has said in recent weeks that he would put the Thaad battery through a full environmental review, following on his campaign pledge earlier this year that he would review the Thaad decision process. But during a meeting last week with Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, he said that he wasn\u2019t planning to reverse Thaad\u2019s deployment, according to the presidential Blue House\u2019s account.At other times, Mr. Moon has also appeared to soften his campaign stance against Thaad, notably in his inaugural speech last month, where he said he would work to strengthen the U.S.-South Korea alliance. \u201cStrong security is made possible with mighty defense capabilities,\u201d Mr. Moon said then.Thursday\u2019s test-firing comes nearly two weeks after the North\u2019s most recent missile launch, which Pyongyang later said was far more precise than any other missile it has launched. Before Thursday, North Korea had launched 12 missiles this year, claiming a number of technological advances as it ramps up its testing in pursuit of an arsenal of missiles that can threaten the U.S. mainland and its allies in the region.Last week, China and Russia joined the U.S. in passing the new U.N. sanctions, the first since 2013 to respond directly to a North Korea missile launch. The new sanctions target assets and ban travel for 14 individuals and four entities, including a North Korean bank.At a regular briefing Thursday, a spokeswoman from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry urged all relevant parties to refrain from provocative behavior and to make active efforts to ensure the stability of the region.\u2014Gordon Lubold & Carol E.

Her Conservative Party was riding high in opinion polls at the time, but its commanding lead has since crumbled. While no pollsters are predicting an outright defeat for Mrs. May, some have suggested a hung Parliament, whereby       Jeremy Corbyn,        a leftist whose popularity was limited to a narrow subsection of his Labour Party before a recent surge, would be in with a shot of forming a coalition government. As voters head to the polls, here are the key issues at stake for Britain and beyond.How Britons vote could have a decisive influence on the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union. Mrs. May\u2019s decision to call the election was a bet that she would secure a bigger majority in Parliament and more freedom to negotiate. Both she and Mr. Corbyn have said they would break from the bloc but unlike her rival the prime minister has said she is prepared to walk away from talks if unable to secure a satisfactory deal for Britain. Opinion polls in the U.K. have been wildly wrong before, but if they prove more accurate this time the path to Brexit may be bumpier than Mrs. May anticipated.The vote comes in the wake of three deadly terrorist attacks in the U.K., most recently a weekend car-and-knife rampage in London that killed eight people. Security has since taken center stage in the election debate, with Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn trading blows over police numbers and powers. Brexit could also play a role in the future of counterterrorism in the U.K. and abroad: Britain currently has access to the EU database that shares intelligence among member states on people deemed terror threats, but whether it would after it formally leaves the bloc is up for debate.Scots voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU last summer, and calls for a second Scottish independence referendum intensified after last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. Scottish First Minister       Nicola Sturgeon       has been unequivocal on her desire to give Scots another vote on the country\u2019s future in the U.K. That hasn\u2019t gone down well on Downing Street, with Mrs. May accusing the first minister of \u201ctunnel vision\u201d over the issue. While Labour also voiced strong opposition to a second Scottish referendum in its election manifesto, Mr. Corbyn has in the past been more amenable to such a vote.The pound has endured a choppy run-up to the election, and analysts are divided on how the currency may react to the result. The general thinking is that a convincing win for Mrs. May would be good for U.K. assets, while a hung Parliament, in which no party has a majority, could trigger a slide in sterling. However, some investors have warmed to a win for Labour and the formation of a coalition that favors closer ties with the EU. The outlook for stocks is just as uncertain: On the one hand, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s plan to raise corporate taxes doesn\u2019t bode well for companies; on the other, a weaker pound could make shares in the biggest companies attractive to investors.The result could have a bearing on the U.K.\u2019s relations with its closest allies. Mrs. May was the first foreign leader to visit President       Donald Trump       at the White House after he took office, and relations between the two have been warm since. Meanwhile, tensions with EU capitals over Brexit have risen. Mr. Corbyn, in contrast, has in recent days spoken out against Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and defended London Mayor       Sadiq Khan       in the face of a             Twitter                   attack from Mr. Trump. A poor showing for Mrs. May could bring about a realignment of these ties. The U.K.\u2019s next moves on Brexit could also have a strong bearing on the more than 3 million EU nationals living there.", "news_time": "2017-06-08 03:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-britains-election-matters-beyond-its-shores-1496905408", "news_title": "Why Britain\u2019s Election Matters Beyond Its Shores", "keywords": "brexit,uk election,uk vote,European Union,Jeremy Corbyn,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Chinese exports in May were up 8.7% from a year earlier, more than expected, as resilient global demand drove a third straight monthly increase.The increase followed an 8% gain in April and beat the 7% forecast of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.Imports in May were up 15%, the General Administration of Customs said Thursday, accelerating from April\u2019s 11.9% pace.

Since the beginning of the year, the yuan has been relatively stable against the dollar and a basket of currencies, providing a tailwind for exporters after a volatile 2016.The monthly trade data augurs well for global trade. While exports have become a less-important growth driver for China in recent years as its domestic economy expands, the country remains the world\u2019s top exporter as well as its top commodity importer, so its trade data is closely watched as a barometer of global demand.In April, the World Trade Organization forecast that global merchandise trade volume would grow 2.4% this year, up from last year\u2019s anemic 1.3%\u2014though it warned that policy uncertainty and protectionism could undermine a more-robust trade recovery.Guangdong Wanshida Industry Co., which exports stainless-steel cutlery to North America, Europe and the Middle East from the southern Chinese city of Jieyang, said its foreign orders have grown steadily in recent months, helped by lower raw-material prices and a weaker yuan.U.S. President       Donald Trump       pledged during his election campaign to impose punitive tariffs on China for what he termed unfair trading practices. Relations improved after Mr. Trump and President       Xi Jinping       agreed on a one-year plan to expand bilateral trade during an April meeting in Florida. But tensions remain.Smaller companies like Guangdong Wanshida remain highly vulnerable to protectionism, said       Chen Shaozhi,        its sales manager, although most of its orders come from markets other than the U.S.\u201cHopefully Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions won\u2019t have that much impact on us,\u201d Ms. Chen added.In late April, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce rejected U.S. claims that China is responsible for the global steel glut. The 117-page report attributed the glut to shrinking global demand and said it is \u201cuntenable\u201d for Washington to blame U.S. job losses on Beijing\u2019s support of its domestic steel industry.China\u2019s imports grew nearly twice as fast as expected last month, driven by residual demand from a strong property market, economists said. They added that they expect China\u2019s economic growth to slow gradually in coming months as Beijing tries to rein in debt and reduce systemic risk by imposing more restrictions on property buyers and on financial transactions.\u201cThe current strength of imports is unlikely to be sustained,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, economist with Capital Economics, in a report. Export growth is also likely to edge down, he added, \u201cbut should fare better than imports given the relatively upbeat outlook for China\u2019s main trading partners.\u201d\u2014Liyan Qi contributed to this article.Write to Mark Magnier at mark.magnier@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 02:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-exports-grow-for-third-straight-month-in-may-1496894218", "news_title": "China Exports Grew for Third Straight Month in May", "keywords": "china economy,china exports,china imports,china trade,china trade surplus,global trade,world trade,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,real estate markets"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Another wave of prominent advertisers, including both major U.K. political parties campaigning for Thursday\u2019s election, suspended commercials on YouTube after their ads appeared before videos promoting extremist ideology.The moves follow a deadly terror attack in London that killed eight, the third lethal attack in the U.K. in three months. Prime Minister       Theresa May       has castigated Silicon Valley for not doing enough to police content on social media and the internet. Marketers have for months complained about their ads popping up next to offensive content, in many cases pulling ads.Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative Party, the main opposition Labour Party, Etihad Airways, owned by the emirate of Abu Dhabi, and privately held meal-delivery business Deliveroo all said they would stop advertising on YouTube, a unit of             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google, saying the video site needed to better control where commercials appear.\u201cWe have made it clear to Google, it is completely unacceptable for our ads to be running on these videos,\u201d a Conservative spokesman said, adding the party won\u2019t resume advertising on YouTube \u201cuntil we receive suitable assurances that this will not happen again.\u201d Labour, Etihad and Deliveroo issued similar statements, as did             Marriott International Inc.,       which said it indefinitely paused YouTube ads in Britain after discovering one of its commercials alongside an \u201cinappropriate\u201d video.The Times of London reported finding the ads playing before videos promoting Islamic extremists, and the newspaper said it had informed the advertisers.A YouTube spokeswoman said Wednesday that the site had been reviewing its advertising policies and was working to further improve control of where ads appear, in addition to recently announced changes. \u201cWe never want terrorists to have a voice, or spread extremist material on our services,\u201d she said.The latest volley from advertisers underscores how YouTube has struggled to control where ads appear. Google in April released new measures to help marketers track where ads pop up. That came after a backlash from major advertisers, including the U.K. government. They complained that their commercials were appearing before objectionable videos.One of its new features allows third-party companies to monitor where ads appear on YouTube and to report back to marketers on the \u201cbrand safety\u201d of the videos. Advertisers have said Google also planned by the third quarter of this year to give them a tool that provides a full list of videos against which their ads appear and how many times their ads were displayed on each.One major British advertiser, London-based             Vodafone Group                   PLC, has gone beyond just complaining to Google. The world\u2019s second-largest mobile carrier by subscribers this week announced new guidelines that govern where Vodafone advertisements appear. Vodafone said employees at its advertising agency will track where the ads go.Vodafone spokesman Matt Peacock, who helped draft the guidelines, said that ad placement on YouTube is typically determined by a so-called blacklist approach. YouTube scans videos and their written description to determine whether they are related to pornography, gambling or other objectionable content. Then it can block a brand\u2019s ads from appearing before such videos.The problem is that it is hard for a computer to determine whether a video promotes extremist content or false news reports. \u201cYou need a human being to do the analysis,\u201d Mr. Peacock said. Vodafone is adopting a \u201cwhite list\u201d approach, he said. Using a mix of computer intelligence and humans, it is drawing up a shorter list of video creators that are \u201cbrand safe,\u201d and directs YouTube to post its ads only with that content.YouTube owner Alphabet reported a sharp increase in first-quarter revenue, continuing rapid growth that seemed unscathed by boycotts from some of its major advertisers. Many of the advertisers pulled their commercials after the first quarter concluded, however, so second-quarter results may shed more light on any impact.\u2014 Robert Wall contributed to this article.Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'YouTube Sees Some Ads Pulled In U.K. YouTube Ads Suffer In U.K. on Placement.'", "news_time": "2017-06-08 02:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-political-campaigns-more-companies-pull-youtube-ads-over-extremist-videos-1496855790", "news_title": "U.K. Political Campaigns, More Companies Pull YouTube Ads Over Extremist Videos", "keywords": "youtube ads,youtube advertisers,youtube extremist videos,youtube racist videos,Etihad Airways,Alphabet Inc.

Here\u2019s a glance at which parties are running and what they stand for.Who they are: The ruling center-right party, which has a significant anti-European Union wing, called the election looking to strengthen its 17-seat majority in Parliament ahead of Brexit negotiations to begin later in June.Brexit strategy: Leader Theresa May has promised to withdraw the U.K. from the European single market and to impose tighter limits on immigration. The party is also seeking a trade agreement with the bloc and to continue cooperation on security and defense, but says no deal with the EU is better than a bad deal.Response to terror attacks: They have vowed to overhaul Britain\u2019s antiterrorism legislation, and Mrs. May said she was prepared to change human rights laws to do so if necessary. The prime minister has faced criticism over cuts to police numbers when she served as home secretary with oversight of the police force.Key pledge: Apart from playing up their Brexit chops, the party has promised a reshaping of the social-care system to make elderly pay for their care using assets, including property, up to a certain amount. The policy, a risky strategy with its older voter base, was decried by opponents as a \u201cdementia tax\u201d and had to be recast days after was first announced to include an unspecified upper limit on contributions.Tagline: Strong and stable leadershipWho they are: The main opposition party, led by avowedly left-wing       Jeremy Corbyn,        has pledged to nationalize parts of British industry and raise taxes on high earners if voted into power.Brexit strategy: The party would enact Brexit but seek to retain the benefits of access to the EU\u2019s single market and guarantee the rights of Europeans living in the U.K. Labour has also pledged to give Parliament a final vote on the terms of any deal reached with Brussels.Response to terror attacks: Mr. Corbyn, who has previously questioned a shoot-to-kill policy, said after the London Bridge terror attack that he would support police in the use of \u201cwhatever force is necessary\u201d to save lives. The Labour leader called for action to cut off funding to terror networks in the U.K. and the Middle East but was criticized for having voted against every piece of counterterrorism legislation since he became a lawmaker in 1983.Key pledge: An increase in industry and infrastructure spending, paid for by raising taxes on those earning over \u00a380,000 ($103,552) and corporations. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has criticized the plan, saying it doesn\u2019t add up.Tagline: For the many not the fewWho they are: Until a massive electoral defeat in 2015, the center-left Liberal Democrats were the third-biggest party in the U.K. and for a term formed part of the ruling coalition with the Conservatives. But a broken campaign promise not to raise fees for university tuition and other power-sharing concessions damaged their electoral popularity. The party is opposed to Brexit and said it would keep the U.K. in the European single market and give Britons a final vote on any deal reached.Who they are: The right-wing party whose campaign to get the U.K. to leave the EU proved so successful it pretty much did them out of a job. The party gained its first lawmaker in the British Parliament in 2015, when they increased their vote share by 9.5% to nearly four million votes. A little over a year later, Britain voted to leave the EU.       Douglas Carswell,        the first UKIP lawmaker, quit the party earlier this year to run as an independent in this election.Who they are: The left-of-center ruling party in the devolved Scottish Parliament also sends lawmakers to Parliament in Westminster on a platform of gaining independence for Scotland from the rest of the U.K. They made strong gains in the 2015 U.K. election.Write to Joanna Sugden at joanna.sugden@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 02:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-election-who-are-the-main-parties-1496903975", "news_title": "U.K. Election: Who Are the Main Parties?", "keywords": " brexit, britain, conservatives, jeremy corbyn, labour, theresa may,uk election, uk vote,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Islamic State claimed credit for a coordinated attack on Iranian government targets Wednesday morning that killed at least 12 people.

That has set the bank on a collision course with officials in the euro area\u2019s largest economy, Germany.On Thursday, ECB chief       Mario Draghi       will announce the bank\u2019s latest policy decisions in Estonia\u2019s capital city, Tallinn. Investor expectations for changes are low, as top officials have stressed in recent days it is too early for any major moves.Still, some officials have warned against the dangers of moving too slowly as the economy recovers, which could harm the bank\u2019s credibility with investors. That suggests some change is in order, to pave the way for an exit from stimulus later in the year. Here are key questions ahead of the central bank\u2019s policy release, due at 1145 GMT (7:45 a.m. EDT).Baby steps. Policy makers are likely to express greater confidence in the economic recovery, an important signal that they are moving closer to reducing their monetary stimulus. They might also rule out any fresh interest-rate cuts. But changes to the stimulus itself\u2014which includes subzero interest rates and \u20ac60 billion ($68 billion) a month of bond purchases\u2014are unlikely.It is enjoying its longest growth spurt in almost a decade. Recent surveys suggest growth is accelerating and broadening to former weak spots like Finland and Portugal. Also, political uncertainties are fading following       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       victory in French national elections last month, though they haven\u2019t disappeared: Germany and Italy both face national elections over the coming months.Not so fast. ECB officials still are concerned about inflation, which, at 1.4%, is some way below the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%. They also may be wary of repeating previous policy mistakes in 2008 and 2011, when the ECB raised interest rates only to quickly change course as economic troubles ensued. Most economists expect a few more months\u2019 delay, until September or October, before the ECB signals a reduction of its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing.Clarify its next steps. Some investors are betting that the ECB will start raising interest rates before it has wound down QE, contrary to the bank\u2019s current guidance. Mr. Draghi might clarify that sequence, and announce an internal review into different exit strategies. He might also drop a pledge to accelerate QE if the economic outlook darkens, although that is considered unlikely at this stage.As the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has sprinted past that of the Federal Reserve, German officials have called ever more urgently for a policy change from Frankfurt. Chancellor       Angela Merkel       took the rare step last month of blaming the ECB for the nation\u2019s vast trade surpluses. Increasingly, Germany is no longer a lone voice: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a rich-country think tank, argued this week that the ECB should start winding down QE next year.

While economists had expected growth to be revised higher, they said the rundown in inventories meant that the overall picture of an economy gradually gaining strength hadn\u2019t changed.A government official said a decline in oil inventories was one of the main factors behind the slower growth, along with softer-than-estimated auto sales. Some analysts said the inventory drop would likely be a positive factor for growth in the current quarter.The revised figures also showed softer private consumption. The contribution of household spending to overall growth essentially halved. The weaker household spending partly reflects a lack of strong gains in wages despite robust corporate earnings, an issue that continues to subdue Japan\u2019s growth.Still, an improvement in capital spending offered a sign that firms are becoming more optimistic about the economic outlook. Firms spent 0.6% more on business investment in the first quarter than in the previous months, compared with an initial estimate of 0.2%\u2014a factor that many economists had cited in their earlier projections of faster growth.Looking ahead,       Yuichiro Nagai,        an economist at             Barclays,       said that while the overall economy is expected to improve, attention must be paid to potential risk factors such as a slowdown of the Chinese and the U.S. economies.A sharper slowdown in China or a strengthening of protectionist measures by the Trump administration could disrupt manufacturing activity world-wide in the coming quarters.\u2018There isn\u2019t much excitement, but the economy is on a firmer footing than last year.\u2019Other analysts took a slightly brighter view.Masayuki Kichikawa,        chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, said he expects the Chinese economy to stabilize and some U.S. fiscal stimulus to be implemented by the end of the year, with Japan\u2019s stimulus measures also giving support to the economy over the coming quarters.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much excitement, but the economy is on a firmer footing than last year,\u201d he said.Write to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-08 00:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-growth-revision-takes-some-air-out-of-celebrated-expansion-1496882672", "news_title": "Weak Spending Takes Some Pizazz From Japan\u2019s Growth Streak", "keywords": "abenomics,asia economy news ,japan's stagnant economy,japan economy,japanese gdp ,japanese growth,japan gdp,japan growth,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news"}, {"content": "Comey worried that Trump was seeking to secure his loyalty and wanted the then-FBI director to help \u201clift the cloud\u201d the probe of possible Russian election interference was casting over the administration, according to prepared testimony Comey is set to deliver in Congress.Trump said he intends to nominate Christopher Wray, a criminal defense lawyer and former top federal prosecutor, to lead the FBI.Attacks in Tehran by suspected Islamic State gunmen targeted Iran\u2019s parliament and the shrine of revolutionary leader Khomeini, killing 13 people.The extremist group has claimed responsibility for a flurry of attacks on three continents as its empire in Iraq and Syria crumbles.U.K. polls have shown a wide variation in the size of the Conservative Party\u2019s lead over Labour ahead of Thursday\u2019s election.North Korea fired multiple cruise missiles into the waters between Korea and Japan on Thursday.Beijing pushed back against a U.S. warning about the Chinese military\u2019s growing ambitions outside Asia, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201dKansas lawmakers called a halt to Gov.

The median rent rose in all categories, from studios to apartments with three or more bedrooms.The percentage of leases signed at new developments has risen over the last two years or so. In May, these leases made up 6.1% of the total, compared with 3.5% in May 2016, according to Mr. Miller.The competition among new developments and the need to rent many units quickly have driven up concessions offered by landlords, such as owner-paid brokerage fees or one or more months of free rent.These concessions were reported in 22% of new leases signed, compared with 17% in May 2016, according to a report by Citi Habitats, a real-estate brokerage with a large rental business. Typically rents rise in the late spring and over the summer, as newly graduated students take jobs in New York and look for apartments.\u201cWe remain in a price-sensitive rental market where incentives remain in play,\u201d said Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats.Citi Habitats put the vacancy rate in Manhattan buildings at 1.58%, its lowest level since August 2015.
