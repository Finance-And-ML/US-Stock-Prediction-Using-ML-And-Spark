Grain production fell in 2016 for the first time in 13 years, and production of sugar and cotton has fallen by more than a quarter in the past three years.The impact of those declines has been masked by sales from China\u2019s strategic stockpiles. But those will eventually run out, triggering a rise in demand for imports from the world\u2019s second-largest economy. That could be a boon to farmers from Brazil to the U.S. and Thailand.Growth in domestic production is likely to lag behind demand, said Andrzej Kwiecinski, senior agricultural policy analyst at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The country would import more feed grains, then more livestock and, eventually, more fruits and vegetables, as increasing labor costs make China less competitive, he said.The price supports and stockpiling that China is rolling back were introduced starting in the early 2000s to improve the well-being of its farmers, ensure production of key commodities and provide a degree of food security. The floors were raised annually to stimulate production even when global prices fell. The government added to demand by building strategic stockpiles.But by 2014, the government was facing challenges. Warehouses and silos were overflowing, and local prices were running well above those prevailing in global markets. Even so, China wasn\u2019t able to meet its domestic needs.With around a fifth of the world\u2019s population and 10% of the world\u2019s arable land, self-sufficiency in feeding China\u2019s people remains a priority for Beijing, particularly for staples such as rice and wheat. But the country shifted course for other products with an agriculture-policy statement in 2014. It said China needed to make rational use of international agricultural markets and establish stable and reliable trade relations, welcoming more imports.\u201c\u2018Moderate imports\u2019 officially forms part of the national food security strategy,\u201d said Zhang Hongzhou, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, in a 2016 report.The first price supports to go were for soybeans and cotton on a trial basis in 2014. The impact was immediate. Local futures prices for cotton fell 30% in 2014, and production fell 8% in the 2014-15 planting season. Wholesale soybean prices fell 11%, and production dropped by 1.5% over the next two years as farmers shifted to corn, which still had a price floor.China\u2019s foreign purchases of soybeans have risen 29% since the country removed the price floor. Global prices for soybeans rose 5% in 2016, as demand remained strong amid a glut in other grains.Government stockpiling of sugar disappeared in the same season. Domestic prices fell around 9%, causing production to drop by nearly a fifth in the following season. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates, imports, both legal and illegal, rose 18% to fill the gap.Last year, the government said it would stop guaranteeing the price of corn. Domestic prices plunged to 44% below their 2015 peak. China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture forecasts that corn production will fall more than 2.3% for the season ending Sept. 30 \u00a0and expects it to fall a further 3.6% the following year.\u201cThis cascaded through commodities\u2014first cotton, soybeans and sugar; then rapeseed, now corn,\u201d said Fred Gale, senior economist specializing in China and international trade at the USDA. \u201cChina\u2019s efforts to stabilize their domestic markets have spilled over to contribute to volatility in the international market.\u201dThe market effects could grow as China works through its stockpiles and turns to imports to fill the gap. China is sitting on 54% of the world\u2019s cotton stocks, 45% of the world\u2019s corn and 22% of the world\u2019s sugar reserves, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Analysts think much of that product is deteriorating after years in storage.Sugar reserves could be quickly depleted given the 4.2 million-ton total shortfall between the country\u2019s production and imports and what China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture has forecast it will consume this year and next. Corn could take longer because the country\u2019s production and consumption are largely in balance.China still spends a lot to support its farmers. In 2016, the country plowed $246.9 billion into the agricultural sector, equivalent to 2.2% of gross domestic product, according to the most recent OECD data. That is down from 2.5% in 2015 but remains about four times the average in OECD countries. Much of that goes toward price supports for wheat and rice, but a growing share is going to land consolidation, mechanization, and research and development to improve productivity.The country could also tap the brakes on imports, as it did with sugar and cotton, or roll back changes that prove too painful. Still, many China watchers think there has been a shift toward accepting more global supply.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually possible for China to be self-sufficient in the initial range of products they targeted. I think that\u2019s what they\u2019ve acknowledged,\u201d said John Phelan, chief economist at agricultural news and analysis service Agrimoney. \u201cThey are just going to have to rely on overseas suppliers for some of these things.\u201dWrite to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Agriculture Overhauls to Lift China Imports.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 23:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-farmers-have-a-lot-to-gain-from-chinas-flagging-production-1499932871", "news_title": "China Cut Agricultural Subsidies and American Farmers Have a Lot to Gain ", "keywords": " brazil farmers,china farmers, china imports, farm supports,food imports, price supports, thailand farmers, u.s. farmers,Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,Andrzej Kwiecinski,Fred Gale,John Phelan,Zhang Hongzhou,output,production,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,grains,edible oils markets,agriculture,farming,oilseed,grain farming,cotton,silk farming"}, {"content": "LIMA, Peru\u2014A judge ordered the arrest of former President Ollanta Humala and his wife Thursday night as they face money laundering and conspiracy accusations tied to a construction scandal involving Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA.The preventive detention, which would keep Mr. Humala and his wife,       Nadine Heredia,        in jail for up to 18 months while they are investigated, came after prosecutors argued the couple could flee Peru to evade justice.Shouts of protest could be heard in the courtroom as Judge Richard Concepcion issued his ruling.The allegations against Mr. Humala stem from testimony by the former head of Odebrecht, who said he illegally contributed $3 million to Mr. Humala\u2019s 2011 presidential campaign. The couple is also accused of taking undeclared funds from the late Venezuelan leader       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez       during a previous, unsuccessful presidential bid.Mr. Humala, who finished his term in 2016, never declared the contributions and prosecutors argue he and his wife conspired to hide them for personal gain.Mr. Humala, 55, has insisted he has no intention of fleeing the country and has said he looks forward to defending himself against what he calls baseless charges.\u201cWe\u2019re staying here, we\u2019ve even handed over our passports,\u201d he said earlier Thursday during a brief meeting with reporters who had gathered for three days outside his home. \u201cIn every moment we\u2019ve shown our roots and good will.

Mr. Toledo is in the U.S. fighting attempts by Peruvian authorities to have him deported to answer the charges.Authorities across Latin America have been moving to charge officials accused of taking some $800 million in bribes from Odebrecht. The company acknowledged the bribes when it signed a plea agreement in December with the U.S. Justice Department.The bribes include some $29 million paid in Peru for projects built during the administrations of Mr. Toledo, Mr. Humala and former President Alan Garcia.The same scandal has ensnared former Brazilian President       Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,        who was convicted Wednesday and sentenced to almost 10 years in jail for taking gifts from another Brazilian builder who along with Odebrecht allegedly paid bribes to politicians in exchange for government contracts.Mr. da Silva denies the accusation and will remain free while he appeals what he says are politically motivated charges.", "news_time": "2017-07-13 22:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/peru-judge-orders-ex-president-jailed-in-corruption-case-1499999701", "news_title": "Peru Judge Orders Ex-President Jailed in Corruption Case", "keywords": "ollanta humala,peru corruption,peru ex-president,peru odebrecht,Odebrecht,Nadine Heredia,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,money laundering,financial crime,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Tiffany        TIF 0.08%       & Co. tapped an executive with experience at rival luxury jeweler Bulgari SpA as its next chief executive, as the company struggles to mend a prolonged sales slump and entice younger shoppers.Alessandro Bogliolo       will take the reins Oct. 2, Tiffany said Thursday. He will succeed       Frederic Cumenal,        who was ousted by the New York-based company in February after it had posted declining sales and profits for two years in a row. Chairman       Michael Kowalski       served as interim chief while the company searched for a successor.Mr. Bogliolo, 52 years old, recently served as CEO of Italian apparel and accessories company Diesel SpA. Before joining Diesel in 2013, Mr. Bogliolo spent 16 years at Bulgari\u2014before LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE took control of the company in 2011\u2014and then served as North American operating chief at LVMH\u2019s Sephora unit for a little more than a year.In a research note, Jefferies & Co. analyst Randal Konik said the \u201cnew CEO appointment is a strong fit,\u201d saying Mr. Bogliolo revitalized Diesel by improving the customer experience, something that Tiffany is trying to do at its 310 retail stores.But Citi analyst Paul Lejuez questioned the choice, writing: \u201cAfter not being happy with its prior CEO\u2026we had suspected TIF might look to go in a different direction than bringing in another executive from a European luxury house.\u201dMr. Lejuez added that even though Tiffany\u2019s experience with Mr. Cumenal, another LVMH veteran, didn\u2019t end well, the company \u201cis still not giving up on tapping into the talents and connections of execs with LVMH roots.\u201dTiffany\u2019s shares closed up 1.7% at $94.04 on Thursday. They have recovered from a low of $60 in June 2016.Tiffany, as it works to balance high-end and low-end offerings and rejuvenate its image, is also facing pressure from activist investor Jana Partners LLC. Jana, now Tiffany\u2019s third-largest shareholder according to data from FactSet, worked with Tiffany to add three directors to the jeweler\u2019s board in February, including former Bulgari CEO       Francesco Trapani.       Mr. Trapani, who had previously worked with Mr. Bogliolo at Bulgari, was part of the Tiffany board\u2019s CEO search committee.Tiffany\u2019s newest leader won the job partly because directors wanted someone who could shake up its culture and revive performance, something his predecessor was unable to do, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201cHe makes sure his teams have accountability and those that don\u2019t aren\u2019t on the boat,\u2019\u2019 one of the people said, adding that Mr. Bogliolo will likely expand Tiffany\u2019s online presence and offer strategies to compete better globally.During the early 1990s, Mr. Bogliolo helped Italian manufacturer Piaggio open China\u2019s market for its popular Vespa scooters, according to one such person. But his U.S. experience is confined to 18 months he spent in San Francisco while working at Sephora.Mr. Bogliolo is the latest executive to join Tiffany\u2019s management team, which has seen considerable turnover in recent years, including a new finance chief and new chief artistic officer.\u201cWe believe the new leadership will be key in accelerating the pace of product newness and innovation,\u201d Mr. Konik wrote.New designs represented less than 10% of jewelry sales last year, and Tiffany is still selling collections that were introduced in the 1960s.\u2014Joann S.

The Russian online search giant will own 59.3%, while Uber will hold 36.6%, valuing the new entity at $3.7 billion. Employees of the joint venture will own the remaining stake.The deal is another surprising twist for Uber, which has invested billions of dollars to expand its app in more than 70 countries, giving cash bonuses to drivers and discounted fares to riders in a broad effort to vanquish its ride-hailing rivals. Uber has met its match in some countries, however, with unyielding, cash-rich competitors that have local ties and are willing to endure cutthroat price wars.In August 2016, Uber called an end to its combat with Chinese ride-hailing startup Didi Chuxing Technology Co. after both companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars bitterly vying for market share.Uber sold its UberChina unit to the competitor in exchange for a 20% stake in Didi and a promise it would invest $1 billion in Uber, the companies said at the time.In Russia and several neighboring countries where the new venture will operate, Uber said it had lost roughly $170 million over the past three years as it battled Yandex.Taxi on its home turf.The Russian company launched three years earlier than Uber and demonstrated an eagerness to slash fares to attract riders.The agreement with Yandex is structured differently than the Uber-Didi deal in that the companies are creating a new venture, which doesn\u2019t yet have a name.As in China, though, Uber is effectively relinquishing control in a major market while earning potential future profits as an investor. Uber is investing $225 million in the company, while Yandex is putting in $100 million.Rapid global expansion is no longer the priority at Uber, as investors exert greater pressure on the company to address its cultural and financial challenges. Benchmark was among a group of investors in the ride-hailing startup that last month pressured co-founder       Travis Kalanick       to relinquish his role as chief executive in the wake of an investigation into sexual harassment and sexism at the male-dominated company, people familiar with the matter have said.Uber began discussing a merger with Yandex in February in talks that were led in part by       Emil Michael,        the former chief business leader who was a confidant of Mr. Kalanick, and corporate development       executive Cameron Poetzscher,        according to people familiar with the deal.Mr. Michael resigned last month after an investigative report by the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder       recommended his ouster to the board.Uber was able to sign the Russian transaction despite having no CEO, no finance chief or operating chief. A 14-person committee of top executives is currently steering decision-making.The move in Russia suggests Uber may be willing to capitulate in some markets where it is bleeding capital in order to shrink its losses and make the business more palatable to investors in an eventual initial public offering. Uber reported sales of $6.5 billion last year but its losses swelled to well over $3 billion.\u201cCombining Yandex\u2019s local expertise in search, maps and navigation with our leading global experience in ride-sharing will enable us to build the best local services and provide a credible alternative to car ownership across the region,\u201d Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber\u2019s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in an email to employees on Thursday.The combined company will operate in 127 cities in six countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan. For riders, the Uber and Yandex.Taxi apps will remain unchanged, while the app for drivers will eventually look the same across both services.Yandex had dominated the market for ride-hailing in Russia, where the firms competed not only with traditional cabs and personal cars, but also with overcrowded public transportation.Yandex in June had nearly double the amount of rides and revenue as Uber in Russia and neighboring countries, according to data the companies provided investors on Thursday, as seen by The Wall Street Journal.In June, Yandex expected to be on track to book about 285 million rides a year for roughly $1 billion in gross revenue, before giving a cut to drivers. In that period, Uber expected to book about 134 million rides for gross revenue of about $566 million, according to the data shared with investors.Yandex.Taxi was the first taxi-hailing service to launch in Russia in 2011, a year after Uber launched its first app in the U.S. Uber expanded to Russia in 2014.After the close of the deal, which is expected in the fourth quarter, Uber\u2019s U.S. customers who are traveling to Russia will be able to open an Uber app and summon cars from the combined company\u2019s pool of drivers, an Uber spokesman said.Russian users of Yandex will be able to do the same in the U.S.Write to Douglas MacMillan at douglas.macmillan@wsj.com and Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Uber Yields to Its Rival in Russia.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 22:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-merges-russian-arm-with-yandex-taxi-1499940002", "news_title": "Uber Merges Russian Arm With Yandex.Taxi ", "keywords": " joint venture, ride hailing, russia, taxis,uber,vc ma, yandex,Yandex,YNDX,Uber Technologies,Yandex.Taxi,Yandex N.V.

Comments that were posted onto Chinese social-media sites were often quickly censored. Still the discussion of Mr. Liu, even obliquely, stood in contrast to the silence that surrounded him in the last years of his life, as he served an 11-year sentence for inciting subversion in a prison in northeastern China.\u201cWith his passing, a monument of the Chinese people\u2019s relentless struggle for freedom has been erected,\u201d said a statement announcing an alliance dedicated to preserving Mr. Liu\u2019s memory signed by several dozen supporters, including leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests Mr. Liu helped shepherd.\u201cIn death, freedom at last,\u201d read the title of an obituary written by his friends that circulated on Chinese social-media sites Thursday night.A former literature professor who went on to pilot China\u2019s democracy movement, Mr. Liu died at 61 years old after a battle with liver cancer. In his final days, friends and supporters lobbied furiously for Mr. Liu to be allowed to seek treatment abroad, and for other countries to pressure Beijing to let him leave.Senior European Union officials on Thursday called on Beijing to permit Mr. Liu\u2019s family to bury him in a manner of their own choosing and to allow       Liu Xia,        his wife, and       Liu Hui,        his brother-in-law, the freedom to leave China. U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       also issued a statement calling on Beijing to release Ms. Liu.Ms. Liu has been under de facto house arrest since her husband was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. She couldn\u2019t be reached Thursday night.Over the past week, the United Nations and several Western countries, including the U.S., issued statements asking Beijing to release him. China\u2019s government, which considered Liu Xiaobo a criminal, rejected those calls as attempts to interfere in its judicial process, though authorities did invite doctors from the U.S. and Germany to examine him in China.In an extraordinary event, representatives from the hospital where Mr. Liu was treated held a late-night news conference to defend his care.At the news conference in Shenyang, the northern China city where Mr. Liu died, tumor specialist       Liu Yunpeng       told reporters that Liu Xiaobo was examined soon after he reported discomfort and was brought from prison to the hospital. Dr. Liu said that the foreign doctors were called in at Mr. Liu\u2019s request, but his condition deteriorated quickly after their consultation, leaving him too weak \u201cto sustain long travel.\u201d The explanation appeared at odds with the assessment by the foreign doctors, who said the activist was strong enough to travel.Another doctor at the hospital told reporters that the activist died at 5:35 p.m. local time surrounded by his wife, brothers and other family and that soon after his body was taken to a mortuary.The doctors turned aside questions about Mr. Liu\u2019s family and whether he was held at the hospital against his will, saying that as doctors they only dealt with his care. Mr. Liu was able to walk about in the hospital at first, but soon was unable to do so because of the cancer\u2019s progression, Dr. Liu said.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, one of few government leaders to publicly call for Mr. Liu\u2019s release, said in a post on her Twitter account that Taiwan stood ready to help China achieve democracy. \u201cI believe this is what he would have wanted,\u201d she wrote.In a statement emailed to reporters, U.S. Ambassador to China       Terry Branstad       described Mr. Liu as a \u201cdeeply principled role model\u201d who deserved adulation, \u201cnot the prison sentences to which he was subjected.\u201dThe White House said in a statement Thursday that President       Donald Trump       was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by Mr. Liu\u2019s passing.\u201cA poet, scholar, and courageous advocate, Liu Xiaobo dedicated his life to the pursuit of democracy and liberty,\u201d the statement said.Posts mourning and memorializing Mr. Liu quickly appeared, and were just as quickly taken down, on China\u2019s Twitter-like social-media platform Weibo. Candle emojis were also blocked. Many posters wrote cryptic expressions of sorrow to evade censors.One of the censored posts was written by E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. Chief Executive       Li Guoqing,        who took part in the 1989 protests. Without directly naming Mr. Liu, Mr. Li praised the \u201cenormous moral sacrifice\u201d the man he had once heard lecture in Beijing made for the rights of individuals in China.Censorship appeared less heavy on the             WeChat                   messaging platform, where users posted photos and poems in honor of Mr. Liu.On both Chinese platforms as well as on Twitter, users remarked on a thunderstorm that erupted in Beijing shortly after his death was announced.\u201cThis night that Liu Xiaobo leaves us, there\u2019s rain, thunder and lightning in Beijing,\u201d veteran activist       Hu Jia       wrote in a post on his Twitter account. \u201cFive-thirty in the evening, July 13, 2017 is a historic moment, a black moment,\u201d he wrote.Write to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com and Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Tributes Pour In For Democracy Icon.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 21:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/death-of-liu-xiaobo-spurs-tributes-from-foreign-governments-activists-1499972935", "news_title": "Death of Liu Xiaobo Spurs Tributes From Foreign Governments, Activists", "keywords": "chinese democracy movement,chinese dissident,liu hui,liu xiaobo,nobel laureates,nobel peace prize,Liu Xiaobo,Liu Xia,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014China defended a 10.5% rise in its trade with North Korea in the year\u2019s first half as part of a normal economic relationship with its neighbor in areas not covered by United Nations sanctions.The rise in trade was driven by a 29.1% increase in exports from a year earlier, while imports fell 13.2%, said       Huang Songping,        spokesman for the General Administration of Customs, at a briefing Thursday. He said China was abiding by U.N. sanctions \u201ccomprehensively, carefully, accurately and seriously\u201d and that the first-half data doesn\u2019t reflect Beijing\u2019s current stance on its neighbor.He said imports from North Korea have fallen for the past four months and all coal imports were made in the first two months of the year, before China suspended coal purchases from Pyongyang. He said coal imports were down 74.5% for the full first half from a year earlier.Goods exported to North Korea were largely items such as textile products not covered by sanctions, Mr. Huang said.China is by far North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner, accounting for more than 80% of the hermit state\u2019s external trade for the past five years. After North Korea\u2019s successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, U.S. President       Donald Trump       in a tweet cited a rise in China\u2019s trade with Pyongyang in the first quarter, questioning Beijing\u2019s willingness to ratchet up pressure on its neighbor.The U.S. has since stepped up its rhetoric, moving toward unilaterally tightening sanctions, targeting Chinese companies and banks the U.S. says are funneling cash into Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program.Beijing has resisted suggestions it isn\u2019t doing enough to pressure North Korea, countering that Washington must directly engage Pyongyang to dissuade its nuclear ambitions. China backed tougher U.N. sanctions last year on North Korea\u2019s coal exports, while ensuring an exemption for \u201chumanitarian\u201d needs. Chinese officials say the February suspension of imports of North Korean coal for the rest of this year was part of efforts to enforce those sanctions.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry says Beijing has played an \u201cindispensable\u201d role in trying to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. On Thursday, a ministry spokesman said Chinese imports of iron ore in the first half were allowed under the U.N. sanctions as they are for \u201ccivilian use\u201d and generate no income for North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons program.\u2018China is implementing the North Korea-related resolutions in a full and strict manner.\u2019The data on the customs agency\u2019s website didn\u2019t break out iron-ore imports from North Korea in the first half.China\u2019s imports of the steelmaking material from all countries jumped 16% from a year earlier in June and rose 9.4% for the first half, customs data showed, as a lasting property boom has spurred demand from the construction sector.The Foreign Ministry spokesman,       Geng Shuang,        also reaffirmed Beijing\u2019s commitment to the U.N. sanctions. \u201cChina is implementing the [North Korea]-related resolutions in a full and strict manner,\u201d he said.In the first quarter, total trade between China and North Korea grew 29.2% from a year earlier, according to Chinese customs data.

American retail stores are shutting at a record pace. Amazon.com is experimenting with new formats for brick-and-mortar stores and its $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods Market is seen as a sign of accelerating change.For a glimpse of the future, U.S. retailers and e-commerce companies should take a look at China, which is already a big test lab.Chinese companies have been busy weaving together the online and offline worlds, trying for an ever more seamless fit. Convenience stores that have no sales assistants or cashiers are popping up in big cities. E-commerce company             Alibaba Group Holding        BABA -0.39%       and its rival             JD.com        JD 0.54%       have poured money into department stores and grocery chains.Alibaba is launching fresh-produce grocery stores in the Whole Foods vein, with the first 13 open in three cities. There, customers can order, eat in, take out and arrange for groceries to be delivered to their homes\u2014all done by phone. No cash or credit cards. Only Alibaba\u2019s affiliated payment app, Alipay, is accepted.Joe Tsai,        Alibaba executive vice chairman, explained the virtues in a recent call with investors: \u201cSo now the store knows your preferences and can give you a personalized selection of products on your mobile app no matter where you are. It knows you and can predict your needs.\u201dTo do this, companies are creating efficiencies by integrating payment systems and streamlining inventory and delivery. More important, investors say, it is the gathering of data on consumer habits that is crucial: It creates opportunities for retailers to cater to customer needs and leverage sales online and offline.\u201cChina has about the most fertile soil for testing out new formats of retail,\u201d says Zhang Ying, a partner at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in the unmanned-convenience-store startup F5 Future Store.Chinese e-commerce giants\u2019 offline acquisitions and presenceChina is an ideal market for experimenting because its traditional banking and retail industries are weak. A generation ago, stores had little to offer and service to match\u2014legacies of the planned economy. Credit cards, nonexistent back then, still aren\u2019t common, while smartphones are everywhere.China\u2019s e-commerce market is now bigger than those of the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany, France and South Korea combined, according to consultancy McKinsey. Meanwhile, sales growth for China\u2019s top 100 brick-and-mortar retailers fell to zero or contracted in the past three years, from double-digit growth only five years earlier, according to the official China National Commercial Information Center.Chinese also have rapidly taken to using their smartphones to make payments and to scanning QR codes, those waffle-patterned bar codes that can be affixed to goods or store shelves. Roughly 67% of China\u2019s 731 million internet users used mobile-payment technology in 2016, according to government data, and half did so in physical stores.True, the e-commerce companies are going offline because they need to. As big as China\u2019s e-commerce industry is, sales of online merchandise made up only 13% of the total last year. And the growth of online merchandise sales has slowed from 50% in 2014 to 33% in 2015 and 26% last year.Companies and investors say that the more data retailers collect on online and offline spending, the more accurate their customer profiles can be\u2014and the more targeted their offerings. Two consumers who purchase the same toilet paper, for example, could have vastly different income levels\u2014and thus greatly differ in what they spend on other products and services.For venture capitalists, the hottest retail experiment is the cashierless convenience store. In recent weeks, GGV Capital announced an investment in startup Bingobox and Sinovation did so in F5. Alibaba unveiled a cashierless convenience-store concept last weekend. Amazon\u2019s version, Amazon Go, has been delayed by technical glitches; its high-tech system of cameras, sensors and algorithms to track customers got overwhelmed when more than 20 people were in the test store at one time.\u2018I came to the convenience store for convenience, not human interaction\u2019While the Chinese ones are in testing mode, too, they are still being rolled out, fixing bugs as they go. F5 is upgrading its cooking machine to reduce the time to prepare food. BingoBox had to shut a store in Shanghai this month because the indoor temperature was so high the doughnuts melted.The attraction for investors is scale. Convenience stores are the fastest-growing category of retail, driven by younger consumers more willing to pay for convenience than their cost-conscious elders. The consumer-profile data, says Sinovation\u2019s Mr. Zhang, could be more valuable than the food and drink sales.At an F5 outlet in the southern city of Guangzhou recently, 24-year-old Carson Zhang ordered a bowl of hot noodles with balls of minced fish for 10 yuan ($1.47) by clicking an image on a screen. He paid by scanning his smartphone, waited for about one minute for the food to be delivered by a robotic arm to a pickup point and ate at a counter. \u201cI came to the convenience store for convenience, not human interaction,\u201d the pharmaceutical salesman said as he left to catch a movie.\u2014Follow Li Yuan on Twitter @LiYuan6 or write to li.yuan@wsj.com.Write to Li Yuan at li.yuan@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'In Retail, China Serves as a Test Lab.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 20:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-you-should-look-to-china-for-the-future-of-retail-1499938383", "news_title": "Why You Should Look to China for the Future of Retail ", "keywords": " alibaba, china, e-commerce, jd.com,retail, retailers,Alibaba Group,BABA,JD.com,JD,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Sinovation Ventures,Bingobox,F5 Future Store,Joe Tsai,Zhang Ying,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,mixed retailing,etailing,convenience stores,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump\u2019s       budget proposal would shrink federal deficits by nearly a third over the coming decade but not eliminate them as the White House says it would do, the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday, presenting a challenge to the administration\u2019s economic-policy plans.Under the Trump budget, the federal deficit would total $720 billion in fiscal 2027, compared with a $16 billion surplus estimated by the White House, the CBO said in an analysis of the proposal.The main reason for the difference: The White House projects the economy will grow much faster than the CBO.The White House estimates economic output will expand at an average annual rate of 2.8% over the next decade\u2014implying more federal revenue and less spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance\u2014while the CBO projects 1.9% growth a year on average under the Trump budget.Critics have called the administration\u2019s economic projections overly optimistic. The administration has said its estimates are justified by its plans for a broad rewrite of the U.S. tax code, an overhaul of financial and other regulations, infrastructure spending, tougher trade positions and other policies.The CBO said it wasn\u2019t provided with enough information about some of the proposals to conclude they would charge up the growth rate.\u201cThe president\u2019s proposals would affect the economy in a variety of ways; however, because the details on many of the proposed policies are not available at this time, CBO cannot provide an analysis of all their macroeconomic effects or of the budgetary feedback that would result from those effects,\u201d the report said.The CBO assessment shines a light on a challenge the administration could face later this year when it tries to advance its tax-overhaul proposals. Administration officials have said the proposals will partially pay for themselves because they will spur faster economic growth. If congressional scorekeepers disagree, it could become harder to pass the overhaul.Democrats pointed to the CBO analysis as evidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s first fiscal blueprint doesn\u2019t provide a realistic path for eliminating deficits. The Trump budget is \u201cbuilt on fantasy projections,\u201d said Rep.       John Yarmuth       (D., Ky.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the president\u2019s executive office, said the administration is \u201cthrilled\u201d with the analysis. \u201cCBO agrees that this is the largest deficit reduction package in American history,\u201d OMB spokeswoman Meghan Burris said.The Trump White House in the past has been critical of the CBO, arguing its forecasts are often inaccurate and possibly politically motivated. In an interview in late May, OMB Director       Mick Mulvaney       suggested the day of the CBO \u201chas probably come and gone.\u201dIn its report, the CBO said the Trump budget would reduce federal deficits to a range of 2.6% to 3.3% of gross domestic product over the next 10 years, down from the CBO\u2019s projection that the deficit will total 3.6% of GDP this year.Federal debt held by the public would total 80% of GDP by 2027, 11 percentage points below the CBO\u2019s projection under current policy.The bulk of the savings would come from significant cuts to mandatory federal spending, including Medicaid, food stamps and Social Security disability insurance\u2014programs that some Republicans have been unwilling to trim given their popularity among constituents.The CBO and Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, which helped evaluate the proposal, relied on administration cost-saving estimates for some policy proposals that it deemed \u201cachievable targets.\u201d In some cases when proposals lacked specificity, including a plan to save $139 billion by reducing improper government payments and $35 billion by easing financial regulations, the CBO and JCT didn\u2019t count the potential savings in their estimates.The CBO also said the White House proposal for tax overhaul \u201clacked the specificity necessary to evaluate any [economic] effects from such a change.\u201d For that reason, the report used the administration\u2019s estimate that the proposal would have no net budgetary effect.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'CBO Challenges Trump Budget.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 20:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-budget-would-shrink-deficits-by-one-third-by-2027-cbo-says-1499962532", "news_title": "Trump Budget Would Not Balance in 10 Years, CBO Says", "keywords": " budget,cbo, congressional budget office, deficit, surplus,Congressional Budget Office,Donald Trump,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news"}, {"content": "New YorkSam Gold is a top contender for the title of America\u2019s Hottest Stage Director. A still-new face who made his professional debut less than a decade ago, everything he does these days attracts attention. Nor is he any kind of phony: I\u2019ve been quite impressed by some of his shows, \u201cFun Home\u201d in particular. On the other hand, certain of Mr. Gold\u2019s other productions have showed signs of an ostentatious, self-regarding austerity that is the mark of a director who cares more for his interpretations than the plays that he\u2019s interpreting. It\u2019s suggestive that his revivals tend to be less sure-footed than his productions of new plays, and the \u201cOthello\u201d that he directed for the New York Theatre Workshop last December, his first       Shakespeare       production ever, was more a flashy medley of Shakespeare-our-contemporary clich\u00e9s than a fully realized piece of creative work.HamletPublic Theater, 425 Lafayette St.  $115 and up, depending on availability, 212-967-7555, closes Sept. 3All of which brings us to Mr. Gold\u2019s new Public Theater production of \u201cHamlet.\u201d Like his \u201cOthello,\u201d in which Daniel Craig played Iago, it\u2019s a vehicle for a movie star, in this case       Oscar Isaac,        lately of \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse,\u201d whose mere presence in the cast ensured that tickets to \u201cHamlet\u201d would be as scarce as orchestra seats for \u201cHamilton.\u201d Nevertheless, this Hamlet is no stunt: Mr. Isaac, like Mr. Craig, is an accomplished actor with classical training and extensive stage experience, and there\u2019s a good reason why Mr. Gold should have chosen to work with a man who looks much younger than his 38 years. His \u201cHamlet\u201d is all about youth\u2014youth and the intimacy made possible by the fact that the Public is presenting the play in its 275-seat Anspacher Theater, where everyone in the audience is no farther from the playing area than a pebble\u2019s toss.If a small-scale \u201cHamlet\u201d strikes you as a contradiction in terms\u2026well, you\u2019re right. \u201cHamlet\u201d is an opera, not a string quartet: Its emotions are titanic in scope and implication. Mr. Gold\u2019s \u201cHamlet,\u201d in which the actors don ultra-casual modern dress (Mr. Isaac wears a hoodie in one scene) and sit around the kind of folding table that you might find in a church basement, is something else again. It\u2019s a conversational \u201cHamlet,\u201d one well suited to the tastes of theatrical novices who\u2019ve never seen a Shakespeare play and might well be discomfited by the space-filling rhetoric of classical acting. But it\u2019s no less serious in purpose for its modesty of scale, and if it isn\u2019t exactly my kind of \u201cHamlet,\u201d it\u2019s still exciting in its own up-close-and-personal way.In some ways, it\u2019s almost straightforward, albeit in a demilitarized, postmodern manner. The animating premise appears to be that Hamlet and Ophelia (Gayle Rankin) are na\u00efve youngsters who are broken on the hard stone of reality. Unable to come to terms with a world in which adults do terrible things to one another for selfish reasons of their own, they go mad with grief and spin wildly toward the grave. This, I assume, is why Ms. Rankin plays Ophelia as an uptalking millennial, and why she drops her vocal mannerisms after Hamlet murders Polonius (      Peter Friedman      ), her father, in the process rudely thrusting her into adulthood. For the same reason, Ritchie Coster\u2019s Claudius is more mature in every way than Mr. Isaac\u2019s Hamlet\u2014and much more given to the kind of classical acting that Mr. Isaac eschews entirely. Indeed, Mr. Isaac\u2019s performance would make little sense in a large theater, for his throaty, colorless tenor doesn\u2019t have anything like the range and rainbow-like vocal variety of a true classicist. Nevertheless, his interpretation is singularly intelligent\u2014every line reading is fresh and spontaneous\u2014and to see and hear him in the close quarters of the Anspacher Theater is to be caught up anew in the burning immediacy of the moment.Mr. Gold\u2019s staging, a few too-clever touches notwithstanding, serves the text rather than obscuring it, and one scene in particular, in which Ophelia buries Polonius and herself in full view of the audience, will stay in my memory permanently. He\u2019s even managed to shoehorn another celebrity into the cast, Keegan Michael-Key, who is surprisingly convincing as Horatio. I also like the way in which Mr. Gold integrates a cellist (Ernst Reijseger, whose incidental music is an impeccably theatrical blend of jazz and Arvo P\u00e4rt-style minimalism) into the onstage action, treating him as if he were another member of the cast. All in all, his \u201cHamlet\u201d is much more than satisfying, and I hope that Mr. Isaac and the Public resist the inevitable temptation to move it to a big Broadway house, where it would rattle around pointlessly. It\u2019s just right where it is.\u2014Mr. Teachout is the Journal\u2019s drama critic. \u201cBilly and Me,\u201d his new play, opens at Palm Beach Dramaworks on Dec. 8.

Mr. Will is also stepping down from his role as chairman of the board, and will remain with the trucker on a consulting basis for another year.The leadership change comes at a challenging time for Indianapolis-based Celadon, which has grown rapidly in recent years through a series of acquisitions. The firm\u2019s finances have been under scrutiny over a joint venture that closed in December involving its leasing division, and it has been negotiating with lenders as it pursues a refinancing plan to boost liquidity.In May, Celadon said it expected to post a $10 million operating loss for the quarter ending March 31, 2017, and that financial statements covering more than a year of its operations couldn\u2019t be relied on after its auditor withdrew its reports for those periods.The company appointed a new chief operating officer and launched a review by the company\u2019s audit committee.

During the closedown period, the amount of sand taken from the beach will be lowered to a maximum of 240,000 tons a year from an average of almost 300,000 that state regulators say had been taken out over the past three decades.The facility is one of the few left in the nation that harvest beach sand, and the last to do so along Monterey Bay\u2014a national marine sanctuary and major California tourist attraction.\u201cI have to tell you, I am elated,\u201d said       Ed Thornton,        professor emeritus of oceanography at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey and a leader in the fight against the mine. \u201cMost of the beach erosion here is caused by this mine.\u201dCemex operates dozens of mines across the U.S. that harvest sand for construction and water filtration, but the Marina plant is the only one that uses beach sand. Harvesting beach sand here was common in the early part of the 20th\u00a0century, but by the 1980s five of the mines that operated on public beaches here were ordered shut down by federal regulators because of erosion concerns\u2014leaving just Cemex\u2019s 100-acre facility.Since that mine harvests sand that falls into a private lagoon above a tidal line monitored by federal regulators, opponents of the process say it fell into a legal gray area for many years. Cemex officials have long contended they didn\u2019t need a state coastal permit to mine the sand, because their operations predated California coastal rules enacted in 1976. Environmentalists have argued an increase in mining in recent decades brought the facility under the rules.Efforts to reach a settlement ramped up last year after the city of Marina and coastal commission began proceedings to find the company was operating without a required permit.In accepting the agreement, Cemex officials didn\u2019t admit to any wrongdoing and attributed the erosion to other factors.\u201cCemex always strives to be a good neighbor and address the concerns of people in the communities in which we live and operate,\u201d the company\u2019s Cemex USA division said in a statement. It added that Cemex worked with state and local officials to reach an agreement \u201cthat is mutually acceptable and which respects the interests of our employees, the community and other stakeholders.\u201dWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Deal Ends Mining of Sand Near Monterey.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cemex-sand-mine-on-california-beach-to-close-1499989089", "news_title": "Cemex Sand Mine on California Beach to Close", "keywords": "agreement,beach,california,californial coastal commission,cement,cemex,cemex sab,environment,environmental news,marina,mexico,monterey,sand mine,u.s.,Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.

Some $1.1 billion was pulled this week from the $7.5 billion          Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity exchange-traded fund,       according to FactSet.The fund buys developed-economy stocks outside the U.S. and, like other currency-hedged ETFs, employs derivatives to neutralize the impact of a rising dollar for U.S. investors.A strong dollar, which hit a 14-year high after November\u2019s U.S. elections, has played a key role in driving the performance of foreign-stock funds in recent years, because U.S.-based buyers must exchange their dollars for the local currency when buying shares abroad.Recent outflows in the currency-hedged ETF indicate that at least one large investor is \u201ccomfortable owning overseas stocks, and the currencies too, because they think the dollar is dead, or that it will flatline or trade lower for the next couple of months,\u201d said       Paul Weisbruch,        vice president of ETF trading at Street One Financial.Bets that favor a strong U.S. dollar also are falling out of favor as central bankers are signaling that firmer growth will allow for the removal of stimulus efforts set up in the wake of the financial crisis. The prospect of higher rates overseas in the years ahead is pressuring the dollar, which suffered its worst first half in 2017 of any year since 2011.The dollar has dropped in recent weeks after central-bank officials in Europe and Canada offered strong signals that they could soon begin winding down monetary-policy measures designed to spur economic growth.The Wall Street Journal reported that European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       is scheduled to address the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole, Wyo., conference in August for the first time in three years. Investors see the conference as a chance for Mr. Draghi to signal changes to the ECB\u2019s program of quantitative easing.Recent rhetoric has sparked a sharp uptick in global interest rates, sending currencies such as the euro and Canadian dollar rallying.Investors continue to reach for international-stock funds this year, just not those with a currency-hedged component. Demand for overseas stocks comes as the U.S. economy muddles along, and questions linger about lofty valuations for domestic shares.Some $98 billion has moved into international-stock ETFs this year, compared with $75 billion into U.S. ones, according to             Credit Suisse.Indeed, $1.9 billion moved into the $31 billion          iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF       over the past week, an indication to Mr. Weisbruch that one large investor might have rotated out of the hedged ETF and into a nearly identical, unhedged one.Currency-hedged ETFs enjoyed a boom in demand in recent years as the ECB and Bank of Japan embarked on stimulus efforts, which weighed down local currencies and lifted their home stock markets. Currency-hedged ETFs provided an elegant way to wager on the trend. Some $40 billion flowed into currency-hedged ETFs in 2015, according to Morningstar.The tide started to change last year amid signs of more synchronized global economic growth. Some $20.7 billion flowed out of currency-hedged ETFs in 2016.RiverFront Investment Group is among the investment firms that have moved away from currency-hedged ETFs in recent months in favor of the unhedged foreign-stock variety. In part, that is because the recent French election quelled worries that the eurozone was at risk of coming apart, another factor that has hit the dollar relative to the common currency, said       Chris Konstantinos,        director of international portfolio management.\u201cGiven the volatile nature of currency hedging, you need to have high conviction about where a currency will go relative to the dollar,\u201d said Mr. Konstantinos. \u201cThere are too many crosscurrents right now.\u201dWrite to Chris Dieterich at chris.dieterich@wsj.com and Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Hedging Ebbs as U.S. Currency Weakens.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedging-ebbs-alongside-u-s-currency-1499982143", "news_title": "Hedging Ebbs as U.S. Currency Weakens   ", "keywords": "dollar, dollar etfs, dollar flows, etfs, investors,RiverFront Investment Group,Mario Draghi,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,corporate hedging,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,equity markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "For decades the United Federation of Teachers has protected perverts, drunkards and other classroom miscreants from being fired. Now the union\u2019s allies plan to put some of these teachers back in New York City schools.On Monday the city\u2019s Department of Education said it will require city schools to fill between 300 and 400 vacancies from the Absent Teacher Reserve, or ATR. This is the politically sanitized name for the \u201crubber rooms\u201d where teachers who couldn\u2019t be fired but no one wanted would sit from 8:15 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. collecting a paycheck as they napped or played cards. After a horrified public learned of the practice, the city abolished rubber rooms in 2010.But many of those same teachers are now in ATR, which is no long a physical room but remains a form of employment limbo. Some teachers are there because their last school closed. But trained, licensed teachers in ATR can apply for vacant positions in 1,700 other public schools. If a teacher can\u2019t find another job in such a large system, there\u2019s probably a good reason principals don\u2019t want him.Three years ago schools Chancellor       Carmen Fari\u00f1a       vowed \u201cthere will be no forced placement of staff.\u201d But now she would effectively mandate that schools take teachers they initially rejected. This includes teachers who end up in ATR because they drink too much, have abused students, or for some other misconduct that renders them unfit for the classroom.The underlying problem is a tenure system that makes it all but impossible to fire teachers after they\u2019ve spent four years on the job. Those suspended for misconduct continue to receive pay, pension contributions and benefits as disciplinary hearings stretch on and on, sometimes for years. Unions have the power each year to approve or reject the arbitrators who decide misconduct cases.Under this rigged system, New York fired a mere 61 of its 78,000 teachers over a decade, the American Enterprise Institute found in 2014. Each teacher in ATR costs taxpayers about $100,000 a year, so no wonder many have declined the city\u2019s $50,000 buyout offers.The logical solution would be to make it easier to fire bad teachers, but Mayor       Bill de Blasio       is a wholly owned union subsidiary. Poor students will bear the real cost of his rubber-room rebound as their education suffers with a subpar teacher\u2014or worse.

Mr. Cordray has been in the crosshairs of Republican lawmakers and administration officials critical of his agency\u2019s aggressive and independent stance in policing the financial industry.\u201cI am surprised to receive your letter,\u201d Mr. Cordray wrote in his response to Mr. Noreika, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cAt no time during the [two-year process of preparing the rule] did anyone from the OCC express any suggestion that the rule that was under development could threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system.\u201dThe argument between the two top regulators relates to the CFPB\u2019s new arbitration rule, which aims to make it easier for consumers to band together and sue banks to resolve disputes over financial products including credit cards, student loans and bank accounts. The rule has drawn strong opposition from industry groups and Republican lawmakers, who are considering various steps to overturn it. The rule is scheduled to become binding in March.\u201cThe Acting Comptroller is reviewing Director Cordray\u2019s letter and considering additional response,\u201d said       Bryan Hubbard,        the OCC\u2019s deputy comptroller for public affairs.Mr. Noreika\u2019s view of the rule is notable because both he and Mr. Cordray are members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a government body consisting of top regulators that has the authority to delay proposed federal regulations. The bar for such action is high, however, because the group must prove a given rule threatens the stability of the broader financial system.Writing to Mr. Cordray on the day the arbitration rule was unveiled, Mr. Noreika requested the data the CFPB used to support the regulation, saying that OCC staff have reviewed the CFPB\u2019s arbitration proposal and have concerns about its potential impact on the institutions that make up the federal banking system and its customers. He added the OCC was concerned the rule \u201cmay potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs.\u201dIn his response letter, Mr. Cordray said a majority of banks and credit unions today operate without the kind of arbitration agreements that the new rule will ban, and that they have shown they are \u201ccapable of operating safely and soundly.\u201d\u201cIndeed, the deterrent effect of the rule is designed to prevent exactly the type of unlawful conduct that itself can raise safely and soundness concerns, as it did in the lead-up to the financial crisis,\u201d the CFPB chief wrote.Mr. Cordray added that the CFPB estimates an annual cost for additional litigation at federal courts for all covered financial institutions at $523 million, while the banking industry that earned more than $171 billion in profits last year.Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-regulators-tussle-over-new-arbitration-rule-1499988214", "news_title": "Financial Regulators Tussle Over New Arbitration Rule", "keywords": "arbitration,cfpb,consumer financial protection bureau,correspondence,finreg,keith noreika,letters,occ,office of the comptroller of the currency,richard cordray,Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,Richard Cordray,Keith Noreika,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "California Governor       Jerry Brown       plans to host a global climate summit next year, and there\u2019s no better exhibit of the tension between the left\u2019s environmental and social justice goals. Witness the Democratic rupture over reauthorizing cap and trade.Democrats control a supermajority in both legislative chambers that lets them increase taxes without GOP support. Because the state raises revenues by auctioning emissions permits, a two-thirds vote is needed to extend cap and trade through 2030 (from 2020) and insulate the program from legal challenges.The Governor says cap and trade is essential to meet the state\u2019s statutory requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels\u2014the same goal that Europe committed to in Paris. His problem is that Democrats from low-income areas are reluctant to extend cap and trade after voting this spring to raise gas taxes and impose a new vehicle registration fee.Manufacturers, oil refiners and food processors\u2014major employers in low-income areas\u2014will have to buy permits or expensive new equipment to comply with the state\u2019s emissions cap. Cap and trade has raised the cost of gas by about 12 cents a gallon and this surcharge will increase as emissions controls tighten. Californians already pay about 65 cents more per gallon than the national average.To win support from business and balky Democrats, Mr. Brown has offered to extend a partial sales tax exemption (3.94%) for manufacturing equipment that renewable companies could also exploit. So businesses will get a small discount on the millions of dollars they will have to spend to comply with the emissions restrictions while the renewables lobby gets another fillip. What a deal. Mr. Brown has also agreed to suspend a fee on rural residents for fire prevention\u2014which may be struck down in court anyway\u2014through 2031 and prohibit local air quality management districts from imposing more stringent emissions standards than those of the California Air Resources Board.The California Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable suffer from Sacramento syndrome and have endorsed Mr. Brown\u2019s green bargain. They fear a more liberal Governor like       Gavin Newsom       or       Tom Steyer       would impose more costly regulations. But there\u2019s nothing to stop Democrats with a simple majority from doing the same as they have repeatedly ratcheted up the state\u2019s renewable mandate.This year the state Senate passed legislation doubling the renewable mandate to 100% by 2045\u2014and, by the way, California is producing so much solar power on some days that it has to pay other states to unload it. Senate Democrats have also proposed jacking up the price of emissions permits and imposing a border carbon fee to tax out-of-state imports.Yet groups like the Sierra Club say the Governor\u2019s deal gives businesses too much flexibility. Facing opposition from his party\u2019s progressive and moderate factions, Mr. Brown wants Republicans to provide the votes he needs to extend cap and trade. GOP support would let Democrats in competitive districts off the hook and make it harder to break their supermajority in 2018. If Republicans go along, they can look forward to being a permanent superminority.Appeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-cap-and-trade-problem-1499988474", "news_title": "California\u2019s Cap-and-Trade Problem", "keywords": "political,general news,climate change,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Republican leaders unveiled a revised health-care bill on Thursday, setting up a Senate watershed next week. Few votes will reveal more about the principles and character of this Congress.Months of stations-of-the-cross negotiations between conservative and GOP moderates have pulled the bill towards the political center, and for the most part the new version continues the journey. This leftward shift is Majority Leader Mitch       McConnell\u2019s       bid to meet the demands of still-recalcitrant Republican moderates. The bill remains a net improvement over the       Obama      Care status quo, but the question now is whether they\u2019ll take yes for an answer.In the new bill, the GOP\u2019s economic growth wing made a major and bitter concession by retaining the 3.8-percentage-point surcharge on investment income. This political capitulation doesn\u2019t even phase out the tax. Repealing this millstone on investment and rising wages has allegedly been a Republican goal for years, and the Senate voted to do so as recently as 2015. Markets have also been expecting relief, meaning the retreat will undercut an economy that can\u2019t afford many political shocks.As worrisome is what this capitulation shows about GOP fortitude against relentless progressive opposition. Moderate Republicans folded amid a false if completely predictable tax-cuts-for-the-rich narrative, as if they\u2019ll somehow get credit for reneging. Has opposition to the bill lessened even an iota? Choking over the tax doesn\u2019t bode well for tax reform, when Democrats will be invoking \u201cthe affluent\u201d at every turn.The priority has to be growth and increasing incomes, not the short-term politics. Or maybe Republicans could do a better job making a political argument about jobs and wages instead of nothing. Any reform worth passing is difficult, and Republicans have sent a signal they\u2019ll give up at the first whiff of grapeshot.The new bill uses the revenue from the investment tax to pay for spending the moderates favored, which might once have been called tax-and-spend liberalism. This includes expanding eligibility for insurance subsidies, increasing subsidies for out-of-pocket expenses and higher up-front spending in Medicaid, such as for hospitals that provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. Financing for high-risk pools and insurance market stability is tripled.It also dispenses $45 billion for heroin and opioid abuse treatment. In February 2016, President Obama proposed a $1.1 billion plan that would increase access to addiction therapy, boost public-health education, stockpile the anti-overdose medicine naloxone, deter fentanyl trafficking, expand needle-exchange programs and make sundry grants to law enforcement and rural communities. The Senate bill is 40 times as large. Don\u2019t believe anyone who claims this isn\u2019t enough money, because it probably reaches the limit of what government can do to mitigate the crisis.The most important residual virtue of the McConnell rewrite, and the main reason it is still worth passing, is that it maintains the original Medicaid reform. This would transition the program to per capita block grants and equalize payments for the poor and the disabled compared to ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion population of able-bodied adults. The revision is too generous in the early years and has a long runway to give Governors time to plan and adjust, but it shifts to a budget growth rate in a decade that is fiscally sustainable.Moderates intensely opposed this transformation, but structural changes are the only way to make the entitlement state even remotely affordable. The discipline will save $772 billion over 10 years.Conservatives gained a modest expansion of Health Savings Accounts and a version of       Ted Cruz\u2019s       \u201cfreedom option,\u201d which would allow insurers that sell ObamaCare-compliant plans to also sell deregulated plans. Combined with state waivers, this could lead to significantly lower premiums for most consumers.The Senate bill has never been the \u201croot and branch\u201d repeal that some Republicans overpromised, but any legislation with a chance of passing must negotiate both political reality and health-care conditions that have developed over decades. The bill is now a pragmatic, modest compromise that tries to satisfy all camps.Most Senate conservatives like Mr. Cruz are warming to the bill despite previous concerns about ObamaCare Lite, and we\u2019ll support it too despite its watered-down tax cuts and reform. Moderates now have to decide if they can say the same, having extorted almost everything they asked for and then some.Moderates never objected to the repeal-and-replace agenda and surely benefitted from the slogan politically, yet some are still threatening to vote against even allowing a debate. If what they really want is ObamaCare, they should have said so earlier, though now at least they\u2019ll be accountable for their true position. Mr. McConnell is right to hold a vote next week to force Republicans to honor their avowed principles\u2014or betray them.Appeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-moment-of-truth-1499988378", "news_title": "ObamaCare Moment of Truth", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,commentaries,opinions,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Liu Xiaobo,        the 2010 Nobel laureate, died on Thursday, only weeks after he was moved to hospital from a prison cell. The Chinese government bears responsibility for failing to competently diagnose and treat his liver cancer. To Beijing\u2019s shame, the only other Peace Prize winner to die in custody was       Carl von Ossietzky,        a prisoner of Nazi Germany who won in 1935 and died in 1938.Liu played a pivotal role in the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square, helping to negotiate the peaceful departure of the last students to occupy the square. He kept the spirit of that movement alive in 2008 when he helped to write Charter 08, a democracy manifesto.

So this is a moment to take stock of some of the larger political dimensions of the ObamaCare debate.Legislative progress has been slower and more difficult than it might have been for a party that ran for seven years on a repeal-and-replace agenda. The benefit is that Senate Republicans are better educated about health-care substance and prepared to make hard governing choices\u2014if they can persuade the remaining Bartlebys.One remaining debate is over       Ted Cruz\u2019s       \u201cfreedom option.\u201d The Texas Senator\u2019s amendment says that any insurer that offers at least one ObamaCare-compliant plan could also sell other types of coverage off the exchanges. The expectation is that a more competitive and dynamic insurance market will emerge outside of ObamaCare. Released from federal mandates and price controls, insurers could offer many more innovative products designed for individuals, rather than standardized coverage planned in Washington.Mr. Cruz acknowledges that insurance markets could \u201csegment,\u201d meaning that younger and healthier people would gravitate to the Cruz option, where premiums are likely to be much cheaper. Older people with more health expenses would remain on ObamaCare, which bars insurers from charging higher premiums based on health risks and bans exclusions for pre-existing conditions.ObamaCare\u2019s logic is that low-cost people must be charged more in order to charge high-cost people less. But these transfers aren\u2019t a good value for low-cost people, which is why enrollment in ObamaCare has been so disappointing. This in turn has led to a cycle of higher premiums and less enrollment.The logic of the Cruz proposal is that there is a rough consensus among Republicans that government should guarantee access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. In that case, government should pay for this guarantee, in the form of a de facto high-risk insurance pool, rather than hiding the cost in cross-subsidies imposed on private citizens.The virtue of this approach is transparency and honesty. In a bifurcated market, premiums would be much higher for ObamaCare plans. But they\u2019d be offset for consumers by much higher federal subsidies that rise with premiums, and the Senate bill also includes at least $50 billion for market stabilization and probably more once this exercise concludes. Federal spending might be higher as a result, but at least the taxes to pay it aren\u2019t indirect and unfairly distributed.One danger is that the Cruz amendment could precipitate a wave of market failures, where the ObamaCare side becomes so expensive that insurers quit even if they have to quit the deregulated side too. People whose incomes are too high to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies and then develop medical problems would also get a worse deal.The political disadvantage is reopening the emotional pre-existing conditions brawl, which the GOP doesn\u2019t want to fight. But under the Cruz plan, they could point out that ObamaCare protections would remain in place while adding more options for people who want them.Mr. Cruz\u2019s amendment has the makings of a sensible political compromise between conservatives and moderates\u2014i.e., free-market prices in health care, with subsidies for those who can\u2019t afford free-market prices. But if moderates make the Cruz plan a red line, conservatives will have to decide if they want to insist on it. Is the freedom option worth losing the other gains of the overbill bill, including the first major Medicaid reform since 1965, repealing the individual and employer mandates, reversing a chunk of ObamaCare\u2019s tax hikes and other types of deregulation such as state waivers?Meanwhile, some GOP centrists are still pretending that if the bill dies, both parties will come together and pass some glorious compromise. This ignores the vast philosophic differences between conservatives and liberals on health care and the role of government, and it assumes that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats who have pledged total resistance to       Donald Trump       will negotiate in good faith. There will be no such mercy.GOP moderates have already moved the health bill toward the political center and earned zero Democratic interest in return\u2014not even from       Joe Manchin,        though Mr. Trump carried West Virginia by 42 points, or       Heidi Heitkamp,        though Mr. Trump won North Dakota by 36. On Monday       Mr. Schumer       sent a letter laying out his price to start negotiations, citing four bills as the basis for his \u201cbipartisan\u201d terms\u2014all sponsored by Democrats alone.Politically, a grand bargain would throw a lifeline to the likes of Missouri Democrat       Claire McCaskill,        whose home state is facing an exodus of ObamaCare insurers. She\u2019ll claim she voted to solve a problem Republicans caused, even if the practical effects are nil.Republicans running for re-election in 2018 will see no similar upside, because no deal the GOP could cut with Democrats can repair the ObamaCare exchanges before the election while their pro-repeal voters will be demoralized. The trade Mr. Schumer is offering is political insulation for Democrats while inviting Republicans to accept the blame for surging premiums and diminishing coverage.Once Senators have time to inspect the new bill, better to vote for the motion to proceed and bring the legislation to the floor. That will start a robust debate and the amendment process. Every idea will get a vote and the public can see which command a majority.Republicans are fast approaching a binary choice. They can either repeal and replace ObamaCare with a center-right reform, or they can collapse in failure and throw power to Mr. Schumer.

In particular, she pointed out that an organization called SAVE\u2014Stop Abusive and Violent Environments\u2014had been singled out for its views by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Ms. Brodsky said these kinds of groups weren\u2019t appropriate for the topic. \u201cThat is not productive, that doesn\u2019t get them to the right answers,\u201d she said.SAVE didn\u2019t immediately return a call for comment.The meeting Thursday was part of a broader effort by the department to review guidance issued by the Obama administration in 2011 in the wake of growing complaints that schools were routinely ignoring allegations of sexual assault. The guidance, included in a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter to colleges, placed the responsibilities of how colleges and universities handle sexual assault allegations under a federal law called Title IV, which prohibits discrimination based on gender at schools which receive federal funding.Campuses rewrote policies to lower the burden of proof for finding a student culpable of assault, increasing penalties\u2014sometimes recommending expulsion. The changes were followed by an increased number of reports of sexual offenses at colleges.Advocates for men who have been falsely accused have lobbied the department to take the investigations out of the purview of schools and to let law enforcement handle them.\u201cIf the dear colleague letter is rescinded it would be devastating,\u201d said Laura Dunn, the executive Director of SURVJustice, a victims rights organization in Washington, D.C. \u201cI think schools will take it as a signal that this administration is not going to take sexual assault as seriously as the previous administration.\u201dWrite to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/education-department-holds-hearings-on-sexual-assault-on-college-campuses-1499976034", "news_title": "Education Department Holds Hearings on Sexual Assault on College Campuses   ", "keywords": "alexandra brodsky,betsy devos,college campuses,department of education,enforcement,liz hill,men,national women's law center,sexual assault,sexual assault survivors,southern poverty law center,stop abusive and violent environments,women,Southern Poverty Law Center,political,general news,crime,legal action,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sex crimes,university,college,government bodies,education department,executive branch"}, {"content": "Online fantasy-sports operators DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Inc., which set aside their fierce rivalry last year and announced plans to merge, called off the tie-up Thursday in the face of opposition from regulators.The Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit last month to block the proposed merger amid concerns the deal would harm consumers.Neither DraftKings nor FanDuel, in separate statements issued Thursday, mentioned any legal or regulatory headwinds in the decision to call off the merger.The private companies, which run the two largest daily fantasy-sports websites, announced their plan to merge in November.DraftKings Chief Executive Jason Robins said in an interview that the FTC challenge caused the company to rethink its approach to the deal.\u201cNow that this added additional cost and time and distractions, it was the right time for us to take a step back and say, \u2018Is this worth it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Robins said.He added that the company felt it was facing fewer legal and regulatory challenges than last year, saying \u201cwe really like our situation as a stand-alone company.\u201dFanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles said in a statement that the company felt the merger \u201cwould have increased investment in growth and product development,\u201d but determined \u201cit is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers, employees and partners\u201d to end the merger. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Eccles declined to comment beyond the statement.The FTC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The rival companies each offer daily games in which consumers pay to assemble virtual sports teams made up of real athletes that do battle against other virtual teams. The \u201cmanagers\u201d of winning teams that amass the best statistics take home cash prizes. The companies make money through entry fees.The companies came to prominence as aggressive television advertisers in the U.S. in advance of the 2015 National Football League season, with DraftKings ranking as the country\u2019s top TV advertiser in September 2015. That came thanks to backing from major sports leagues and media companies: DraftKings has investments from Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and             21st Century Fox Inc.       (            News Corp,       parent company of The Wall Street Journal, shares common ownership with 21st Century Fox.) FanDuel has investments from the National Basketball Association and a subsidiary of             Comcast Corp.That advertising blitz helped lead to regulatory and legal probes by several state attorneys general who said the sites violated state gambling laws. The companies, which deny any wrongdoing, have also faced civil lawsuits from consumers, as well as investigations by the Justice Department.Last year, Eilers & Krejcik Gaming projected that the industry would hit more than $800 million in revenue by 2020; this year the forecast was revised down to around $500 million, reflecting in part greater-than-expected user burnout and the loss of some markets because of state regulations.The merger was intended to allow both companies to save on legal and regulatory costs by combining efforts, freeing up more cash to invest in new products. The FTC sued to block the deal on the theory that it would have reduced competition.Some analysts now question whether the market for daily fantasy sports is large enough to support two profitable companies.Chris Grove, managing director at industry consultant Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, said he believes there is room for only one major profitable player in the industry. But he said there are other forces at work that could allow both companies to succeed, especially the investments from major sports leagues.\u201cWe could argue about the inherent quality of the business model, but what is not debatable on any level is that daily fantasy sports players watch more minutes of more games,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just more engaged than the typical fan, and that\u2019s a critical outcome for teams and leagues.\u201dDraftKings\u2019 Mr. Robins said he disagreed with the notion that the industry isn\u2019t large enough for two large players. He said the company is in \u201ca completely different and vastly better place than it was two years ago,\u201d pointing to the fact that more than a dozen states have passed laws allowing daily fantasy sports.\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge market,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fundamental about fantasy sports that makes it so that two companies can\u2019t build healthy profitable businesses.\u201dWrite to Chris Kirkham at chris.kirkham@wsj.com and Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Fantasy Sports Deal Called Off.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/draftkings-fanduel-call-off-merger-1499976072", "news_title": "DraftKings, FanDuel Call Off Merger", "keywords": "daily fantasy gaming,daily fantasy sports acquisition,draftkings fanduel,draftkings merger,fanduel merger,fantasy sports gaming,pe deals,vc ma,DraftKings,Federal Trade Commission,FanDuel,Nigel Eccles,Jason Robins,plans,strategy,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,gambling industries,leisure,arts,hospitality,online gambling"}, {"content": "Catania, SicilyLate last month a Jewish community was established here in southern Italy\u2014the first such founding since       King Ferdinand       and Queen Isabella ordered the expulsion or forced conversion of the Jews more than 500 years ago. On the same day the community was revived, the Catania city government gave the top floor of a palace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea to the International Institute for Jewish Culture. The small community is now looking for a rabbi and raising money to furnish the space, which will be used as a synagogue.While anti-Semitism is on the upswing in many parts of Europe, Judaism and Jews are experiencing a renaissance in Italy. The country is most strongly associated with the Roman Catholic Church, but Jews have been here for thousands of years. Given Italy\u2019s place as a political laboratory in the Western world, its role in the revival of Judaism\u2014particularly in the south\u2014is worth watching.In 2015 the bishop of Palermo gave a Jewish group a local church to convert into a synagogue. The same year Catholic authorities in       Trani,        on the mainland, did the same. Yet the situation in Catania is unique, as it fully revives a Jewish community abolished in 1492. This community was only one of the 52 disbanded at the time, and other communities in Italy are in the process of being revived.       Baruch Triolo,        a Catanian attorney who converted to Judaism while living in Miami, is leading the revival project. He has received support from numerous local and regional governments, as well as the island\u2019s philo-Semitic Masonic groups.State support for the Jews extends beyond helping to revive communities. The federal government helped finance the Italian translation of the first volume of the Talmud. The new volume was first presented at the country\u2019s most prestigious cultural institution, the Accademia dei Lincei, on the banks of the Tiber river in Rome. The first two runs of the translation sold out almost immediately, and the buyers are overwhelmingly non-Jewish, according to the publisher.Perhaps the clearest indicator of the strength and depth of Jewish popularity comes at mealtime. Jewish food, including kosher food, is suddenly chic. Restaurants in Rome\u2019s Jewish ghetto are regularly packed. You can even get fried artichokes made \u201cJewish style\u201d at takeout stands. Kosher food and wine are now regularly featured at national food fairs and can be purchased at upscale stores throughout the country.\u201cRegular people are selling and buying Jewish food precisely because it\u2019s Jewish,\u201d says the Italian journalist       Carla Reschia.       \u201cFood is an example, but you can see it also in literature: In a country where Jews number less than 0.1%, Jewish authors are disproportionately popular.\u201dItalian historians, archaeologists and anthropologists are hard at work to document the presence of Jews from ancient times into the early modern period. There is no lack of evidence, some of which dates back to the first century, following the Roman conquest of ancient Israel. Yet many museums are not aware of the considerable quantity of evidence they have in their archives and deposits. In recent years, Sicilian cities have begun to publish catalogs of this material, and I recently attended a public meeting in southeastern Sicily that featured professors and government officials intent on creating a tourist guide to Jewish Sicily, from Taormina to Siracusa and Noto.It is hard to overstate the enthusiasm for the Jewish revival. Cooperative ventures between Italian and Israeli universities are under way. These efforts should produce new experts and new historical finds in the coming years. Such activities will be reinforced as other communities emulate the Catania model and new centers of Jewish life are created.There is a lot of work to be done before the Italian Jewish revival is fully realized. Anti-Semites are particularly active in northern cities like Milan and Turin. The country is also a landing point for many Islamic immigrants, many of whom are openly anti-Semitic. Possible descendants of the old communities will want to formalize their faith by converting, and there is a shortage of rabbis qualified to do that.

Yet in another area, the G-20\u2019s attempt to regulate global finance, Mr. Trump signed on to a communiqu\u00e9 that runs counter to his promises on the campaign trail and in office.The summit\u2019s official statement lauds the Financial Stability Board\u2019s \u201cconsiderable progress\u201d in developing new international regulations. It says G-20 leaders \u201cwelcome the FSB assessment of the monitoring and policy tools available to address risks from shadow banking.\u201dThe FSB is a group of central bankers and regulators deputized by the G-20 in 2009 to set up an international system to supervise finance. The U.S. is represented on the board by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But most of its members are European officials. It is difficult to understand how Mr. Trump, who has promised to reduce financial regulation in the U.S., could possibly endorse the FSB\u2019s effort to create an even more stringent global system of financial regulation.Once the FSB received its mandate in 2009, it moved aggressively\u2014with the full support of the       Obama       administration\u2014to create a regulatory structure covering all financial services and institutions in developed countries, including the U.S.As the G-20 communiqu\u00e9 suggests, the FSB\u2019s particular focus has been developing a framework to capture what it calls \u201cshadow banks,\u201d which it broadly defined as any financial firm engaging in \u201ccredit intermediation\u201d outside the regulated banking system. That includes, according to a 2013 FSB statement, \u201csecurities broker dealers, finance companies, asset managers and investment funds, including hedge funds.\u201dDuring the previous administration, it was realistic to believe that the U.S. would join this scheme. President Obama was a supporter of the G-20\u2019s international regulatory program. Not only that, in the U.S. the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was given the power to regulate and prohibit \u201cactivities\u201d it judged as a threat to financial stability. This power alone would enable it to impose in the U.S. virtually all the regulations the FSB might develop.The FSB\u2019s rules were not intended to be voluntary. The group\u2019s chairman, Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney,        made clear in memorandums to other FSB members that all G-20 countries, including the U.S., were expected to adopt its regulations in their own jurisdictions. Compliance, he said, would be monitored.It is not difficult to see that this is a power grab by the regulators who sit on the FSB. They are trying to leverage an international agreement to create a closed, uniform, global system of financial regulation and supervision. Trapping American firms in this kind of complex web is clearly inconsistent with President Trump\u2019s promise to deregulate the financial system and put the American economy first.Unfortunately, the G-20 communiqu\u00e9 has now created the impression\u2014mistaken, one hopes\u2014that Mr. Trump favors the FSB\u2019s program. If he does not, he should make his position clear by withdrawing the U.S. from the FSB. Then he should restrict the Financial Stability Oversight Council to acting only as a consultative body for financial regulators, with no special powers to regulate or prohibit financial activities.

In \u201cOpen Heart,\u201d British cardiac surgeon       Stephen Westaby       shares often astonishing stories of his own operating-room experiences, illuminating the science and art of his specialty through the patients whose lives he has saved and, in some cases, lost.Because the heart is \u201ccomplex and idiosyncratic,\u201d as Dr. Westaby puts it, there are all sorts of problems that can get in the way of its fundamental function: pumping roughly 2,000 gallons of blood daily through the body. Fortunately, he notes, advances in medicine have enabled patients to escape a death sentence from conditions such as heart failure, a progressive disease that renders the heart unable to pump the blood the body needs.Despite the advent of heart transplants in the 1960s, donor hearts were not an option for many, and by the 1990s Dr. Westaby and other surgeons began using new artificial heart devices, including pumps that were implanted in the chest or temporarily attached outside the body. Connected via a cable in the belly to power sources such as battery packs, they could maintain circulation and rest failing hearts. For some patients, such devices served as a bridge to an eventual transplant or as a permanent alternative to one; for still others, they became a temporary \u201cbridge to recovery.\u201dBy Stephen Westaby  Basic Books, 287 pages, $27In 1996, Dr. Westaby opened his own surgical heart-failure service at his Oxford hospital to treat the thousands of heart-failure patients in Britain, where there were fewer than 200 heart transplants each year. His vision was to provide lifetime blood-pump support, a solution \u201cthat didn\u2019t need a dead person or frantic donor-heart retrieval by helicopter in the middle of the night.\u201d It is a mission he has pursued ever since, adopting every technological advance possible and collaborating with colleagues around the world.Long before medical school, Dr. Westaby tells us, when he had a porter\u2019s job at a local hospital, he was fascinated by autopsies, watching a scalp \u201cincised from ear to ear and peeled forward over the face like an orange.\u201d Early signs of his inventiveness came as a surgical resident, when, after a pub visit, he realized that he couldn\u2019t stand through a four-hour operation without having to take a bathroom break. He decided to run a rubber tube used for incontinent men from his groin down into the big rubber operating boots that surgeons wear to stand in sloshing puddles of blood and guts. Unbeknownst to others on the team, he slowly filled the boots.During his training, Dr. Westaby learned to handle stress but did less well with the detachment that also comes with the territory. Early on he was told to \u201cget over it if you want to be a surgeon,\u201d because empathy can bring unsustainable misery. What makes Dr. Westaby\u2019s stories so compelling, though, is that he can\u2019t quite suppress his humanity. When he meets the mother of an African child with a grievous injury or a pregnant woman with a failing heart who is fighting to keep her baby, it is the desire to help them that drives him the extra mile when the case seems hopeless.Mastering cardiac surgery required learning how to operate on the lungs and esophagus as well, and Dr. Westaby was frequently called on for extreme trauma cases. An engineer working in an industrial complex when a boiler explodes, for instance, sustained burns to the inner lining of his windpipe so severe that \u201cwhole sheets of necrotic membrane sloughed off from the lining of his bronchial tubes,\u201d obliterating his airways. Dr. Westaby relied on instinct and ingenuity while elbow-deep in the victim, fashioning a tube long enough to pass through the burned larynx so that the patient could cough up secretions and begin to heal.Patients get their due in Dr. Westaby\u2019s account, such as Peter Houghton, a man suffering from heart failure who agreed to be Dr. Westaby\u2019s guinea pig for one of the first permanent artificial hearts. The American physician and inventor       Robert Jarvik       personally brought his Jarvik 2000 high-speed miniature turbine device from New York, and a surgeon from the Texas Heart Institute came to assist. The procedure involved implanting the turbine pumping device and screwing a titanium plug, Frankenstein-like, into the skull to carry electricity to the pump through a cable in the neck and chest. Houghton, thereafter a bionic cyborg, became a fierce advocate for Dr. Westaby, working tirelessly to draw attention to his efforts.One theme in \u201cOpen Heart\u201d is Dr. Westaby\u2019s frustration with Britain\u2019s National Health Service, which, he says, values saving money over saving lives. He grows frustrated as he tries to get the reluctant government-run payer to cover the costs of advanced interventions. There are other problems too: Dire situations often get worse, he says, because of treatment delays and poor attention to best practices, like administering clot-busting drugs after a heart attack. Medical directors, he says, seem intent on ensuring that \u201cno one does anything new or interesting.\u201dRegrets, he has a few, including neglect of his family: \u201cWhile I spent many hours striving to save other people\u2019s children, I never spent enough time with my own.\u201d And he can no longer operate due to a job hazard for surgeons: Metal instruments slapped into the hand may eventually deform it. But he is looking ahead, he says, to working on new heart-saving devices and other breakthroughs. Let\u2019s hope he keeps his heart in the field for years to come.Ms. Landro, a former Journal health columnist, is the author of \u201cSurvivor: Taking Control of Your Fight Against Cancer.\u201dAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Priming The Pump.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/priming-the-pump-1499987748", "news_title": "Priming the Pump", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,medical conditions,reviews"}, {"content": "\u2018Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President       Putin,       \u201d       Donald Trump       tweeted Sunday. \u201cNothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!\u201d Hours before the two presidents met, Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       underlined this tough line on sanctions by appointing Russia hawk       Kurt Volker       as chief U.S. envoy on Ukraine.Messrs. Trump and Putin made limited progress on Syria, but Moscow has been intensifying its efforts to destabilize Ukraine. Mr. Putin has been reluctant to deploy large military forces, but fighting in Eastern Ukraine claims five or six lives a week. Of late the Kremlin has escalated its aggression with military attacks on civilian targets, assassinations, cyberattacks to cripple the state and economy, and the economic and partial political integration of the occupied region into Russia.Mr. Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine has boomeranged. His aggression has consolidated popular opinion, with one recent poll showing that 92% of those on territory controlled by Kiev now see themselves as Ukrainians. A decade ago that number stood at 75%. While a portion of this shift is attributable to the absence of data from occupied portions of Ukraine, most of it comes from shifting public attitudes. Mr. Putin is further stymied by Ukraine\u2019s growing military capability and frustrated by signs of its economic recovery, both results of President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s reforms.For Mr. Putin, this is unacceptable. Russia is paying a large economic price because of Western sanctions. It also faces a growing threat of social discontent in the impoverished parts of Ukraine it controls. With 1.8 million residents internally displaced on Ukraine-controlled soil and 600,000 resettled in Russia, the self-styled Donetsk and Luhansk \u201cpeoples republics,\u201d known by the acronyms DNR and LNR, have a combined population of more than 3.5 million. Many are retirees dependent on Ukrainian state pension payments. Others are miners and industrial workers whose plants were deeply integrated into the Ukrainian economy.Mr. Putin\u2019s response has been to step up the aggression. The first five months of 2017 saw a steep increase in attacks on hospitals, schools, factories and other civilian targets, resulting in 44 fatalities. Terrorist bombings and assassinations in Kiev and elsewhere have become commonplace. On June 27 and 28 car bombs killed two colonels from Ukraine\u2019s security service. On June 1 a Russian citizen posing as a correspondent for the French newspaper Le Monde shot but failed to kill a Chechen volunteer in the Ukrainian militia. In late March an assassin from Russian-annexed Crimea killed a former Russian parliamentarian and Putin critic who had received asylum in Ukraine.Russia is also accelerating the integration of occupied Donbas into Russia. On Feb. 18, Mr. Putin issued a decree enabling Russian state and private institutions to accept passports and other identity documents issued by the self-styled DNR and LNR. The Russian press widely promoted the view of Luhansk separatist leader       Igor Plotnitsky       that the decree is a \u201cstep along the path of international recognition of our sovereignty.\u201dThe DNR and LNR economies have begun rapidly converting to the Russian ruble. A further step came March 5, with the confiscation by the \u201crepublics\u201d of some 40 major privately held Ukrainian companies. These enterprises had provided employment for locals while paying taxes to Kiev and scrupulously withholding them from the renegade authorities.Although these \u201cnationalizations\u201d\u2014a war crime under the Geneva Conventions\u2014had been accelerated by an unofficial embargo of trade with the region started by Ukrainian civic activists in January, the swiftness of the confiscations suggested they had long been planned. On the day of the takeovers, senior Russian managers appeared at the \u201cnationalized\u201d workplaces to announce they were taking charge.In mid-March, Kremlin-controlled media publicized the launch of a \u201cCommittee for the Integration of the Donbas and Russia\u201d in Russian-annexed       Yalta,        Crimea. The Russian media trumpeted a call there by Mr. Plotnitsky for a referendum on the accession of the LNR to Russia.In early April,       Vladimir Pashkov,        a former deputy governor of Russia\u2019s Irkutsk region, arrived to administer Eastern Ukraine\u2019s key industrial holdings, according to Russia\u2019s RBK news agency. On April 25 came news that the Russian Parliament was readying legislation backed by Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       to simplify the procedure for granting Russian passports to residents of the occupied Donbas. A group of lawmakers called the Russian Friends of the Donbas announced they would set up centers to assist in the naturalization process.Russia is also escalating its interference in the internal political life of the rest of Ukraine, including cyberattacks against government and business targets and the use of fifth columns. These steps come from the well-known playbook that Russia used to foment separatism in Georgia\u2019s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions. There, too, Russian military forces helped seize territory from a sovereign state, installed Russian advisers, and distributed Russian passports. The Kremlin now recognizes both entities as independent states.None of this means the Kremlin is irrevocably committed to the permanent separation of the DNR and LNR from Ukraine. What Mr. Putin wants above all is to ensure that whatever the future status of these regions, Moscow, not Kiev, will call the shots. Still, the radical steps Russia is taking, including terrorism, make clear that Mr. Putin seeks to derail the 2015 Minsk II process, even as he points the finger at Ukraine for lack of progress toward peace.The U.S. and Europe must respond forcefully to this new intensification in Russia\u2019s hybrid war.

Yet I don\u2019t feel guilty ordering most of my family\u2019s household goods on Amazon. In a world of fair competition, there will be winners and losers.But when a mail truck pulls up filled to the top with Amazon boxes for my neighbors and me, I do feel some guilt. Like many close observers of the shipping business, I know a secret about the federal government\u2019s relationship with Amazon: The U.S. Postal Service delivers the company\u2019s boxes well below its own costs. Like an accelerant added to a fire, this subsidy is speeding up the collapse of traditional retailers in the U.S. and providing an unfair advantage for Amazon.This arrangement is an underappreciated accident of history. The post office has long had a legal monopoly to deliver first-class mail, or nonurgent letters. The exclusivity comes with a universal-service obligation\u2014to provide for all Americans at uniform price and quality. This communication service helps knit this vast country together, and it\u2019s the why the Postal Service exists.In 2001 the quantity of first-class mail in the U.S. began to decline thanks to the internet. Today it is down 40% from its peak levels, according to Postal Service data. But though there are fewer letters to put into each mailbox, the Postal Service still visits 150 million residences and businesses daily. With less traditional mail to deliver, the service has filled its spare capacity by delivering more boxes.Other companies, such as             UPS                   and             FedEx,       compete with the Postal Service to deliver packages. Lawmakers, to their credit, wanted a level playing field between the post office and its private competitors. The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for the Postal Service to price parcel delivery below its cost.But with a networked business using shared buildings and employees, calculating cost can be devilishly subjective. When our postal worker delivers 10 letters and one box to our home, how should we allocate the cost of her time, her truck, and the sorting network and systems that support her? What if the letter-to-box ratio changes?In 2007 the Postal Service and its regulator determined that, at a minimum, 5.5% of the agency\u2019s fixed costs must be allocated to packages and similar products. A decade later, around 25% of its revenue comes from packages, but their share of fixed costs has not kept pace. First-class mail effectively subsidizes the national network, and the packages get a free ride. An April analysis from             Citigroup                   estimates that if costs were fairly allocated, on average parcels would cost $1.46 more to deliver. It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip\u2014a gift card from Uncle Sam.Amazon is big enough to take full advantage of \u201cpostal injection,\u201d and that has tipped the scales in the internet giant\u2019s favor. Select high-volume shippers are able to drop off presorted packages at the local Postal Service depot for \u201clast mile\u201d delivery at cut-rate prices. With high volumes and warehouses near the local depots, Amazon enjoys low rates unavailable to its competitors. My analysis of available data suggests that around two-thirds of Amazon\u2019s domestic deliveries are made by the Postal Service. It\u2019s as if Amazon gets a subsidized space on every mail truck.I do not know which stores in my neighborhood will be gone five years from now, but I am certain my household will continue to receive numerous boxes from Amazon. I also believe that society would be better off if competing retailers, online or brick-and-mortar, continue to thrive. Congress should demand the enforcement of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, and the Postal Service needs to stop picking winners and losers in the retail world.

They said 4,145 new units have been completed since the initiative began in 2014. Officials said the city lost an estimated 7,500 units of rent-stabilized housing last year.City officials said the about $41 billion, 10-year plan eventually would help an estimated half a million people continue to live in New York City.The initiative is a central piece of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda. The Democrat was elected in 2013 promising to address the city\u2019s rising income inequality, or what he called, a \u201ctale of two cities.\u201dRents have risen sharply in recent years. Between 2000 and 2014, for example, the median rent in the city rose by nearly 20% in real dollars, according to city data.The trend has made it increasingly difficult for people with low- and moderate-incomes to afford to live in New York City and lead the city\u2019s shelter population to grow to about 60,000 last year.The city is using a host of tax incentives, public funds, private investment and city capital dollars to build and preserve the housing. Of the $41 billion total, about a quarter comes from city funds. The city said this year it will contribute an additional $1.9 billion.About half of the affordable housing financed so far under Mr. de Blasio is for families earning between $42,951 and $68,720 a year, while a third is for those earning under $42,950.Renata Pumarol,        deputy director at New York Communities for Change, a nonprofit group, said the plan doesn\u2019t include enough units of housing for extremely low-income residents. Ms. Pumarol said the city\u2019s designation of $42,951 to $68,720 as \u201clow-income\u201d was disingenuous. \u201cIf you go into any truly low-income neighborhood in New York, those numbers are absolutely laughable,\u201d she said.City officials said they use federal income measures in the plan. Officials have said creating units for extremely low-income residents is difficult because it generally requires substantial rental subsidies.The city\u2019s largest reservoir of affordable housing is its more than 176,000 units of public housing, which the city has struggled to maintain with less and less federal funding in recent decades.Deputy Mayor Ms. Glen said public housing had been \u201cstarved\u201d of federal support for years now, leaving the city with fewer ways of creating affordable housing. \u201cAre we relying too heavily on the private sector?\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no alternative.\u201dWrite to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-officials-say-affordable-housing-push-is-working-1499987177", "news_title": "New York City Officials Say Affordable Housing Push Is Working ", "keywords": "affordable housing,bill de blasio,nyc,ny housing, rent protections ,Bill de Blasio,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,social issues,welfare,social services,building construction,residential building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "Three important things happened this week. Two were insufficiently noted.Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul, fallen three years ago to Islamic State, was liberated by forces of the Iraqi government. Not long ago ISIS, the first and true sustained scum of the 21st century, was seen as militarily formidable and ideologically perhaps indomitable. Now they\u2019ve disappeared into the hills. The fall of Mosul is a blow to their mystique, and that of radical Islam. As for the Iraqi military, not long ago it was derided as unprofessional and barely loyal to its own country. Now it has succeeded, with the help and encouragement of the U.S., including its special forces.Whatever your convictions about America\u2019s presence and policy in the Mideast, whether you trend nationalist or neoconservative, America First or Lead From Behind; whatever your personal disposition, be it bitterness over the blunders of the past or half-mad with schemes for the future; and whether you judge the ultimate beneficiary of Mosul\u2019s liberation to be the current Iraqi government, the idea of a stable democracy, or the schemers of Iran, we should pause to recognize what just occurred and say:Good. Bravo.This is a victory. For what? Civilization.The second story too involves admirable people in uniform.This week the New York City Police Department buried one of its own, also one of our own. We should put aside a moment to mourn.The murdered officer was Miosotis Familia, 48, reportedly the youngest of 10 children of Dominican immigrants and the first in her family to attend college. She had three children and cared for her own ailing mother. She\u2019d been a cop for 12 years. She was one of the people who keep my city of 8.5 million up and operating each day, in both its personal and public spheres.She was on the midnight shift in the Bronx on Wednesday, July 5. Her killer, 34-year-old Alexander Bonds, was a lowlife and prison parolee with untreated mental illness. He posted threatening anticop rants on Facebook. The night of the murder he walked up to her police vehicle and fired once through the window, shooting Officer Familia in the head. Police shot him dead soon after.Here is NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill at her funeral this week at the World Changers Church: \u201cLet me tell you something. Regular people sign up to be cops. They sign up for this job of protecting strangers knowing the inherent risks. .\u00a0.\u00a0. But not one of us ever agreed to be murdered in an act of indefensible hate. Not one of us signed up to never return to our family or loved ones. So where are the demonstrations for this single mom who cared for her elderly mother and her own three children?\u201dThe 4,000 mourners stood and burst into sustained applause. Mr. O\u2019Neill continued: \u201cThere is anger and sorrow, but why is there no outrage? Because Miosotis was wearing a uniform? Because it was her job? I simply do not accept that. Miosotis was targeted, ambushed and assassinated. She wasn\u2019t given a chance to defend herself. That should matter to every single person who can hear my voice in New York City and beyond.\u201dIt should.Unnamed but a clear focus of Mr. O\u2019Neill\u2019s remarks was the radicalism and rage of the Black Lives Matter movement, coupled with a national media too often willing to paint the police, in any given incident, as guilty until proven innocent. This sets a mood that both excites and inspires the unsteady and unstable.Mr. O\u2019Neill: \u201cWhen we demonize a whole group of people, whether that group is defined by race, by religion or by occupation, this is the result. I don\u2019t know how else to say it. This was an act of hate, in this case against police officers\u2014the very people who stepped forward and made a promise to protect you day and night.\u201dWe are not paying enough attention to what is happening to the police throughout the country. As this was being written, Newsweek reported the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund claims that the number of officers killed in the line of duty was up 30% for the 12 months ending June 30, compared with the preceding year. That number doesn\u2019t include Miosotis Familia. The head of the Memorial Fund said: \u201cOfficers have been targeted for the job they do, shot and killed, or hit with vehicles.\u201dIt should be a major, sustained national story when cops are killed for being cops. Yet each incident never gels into a theme. The media caravan moves on.Orwell spoke of forcing inconvenient stories down the memory hole. It is a feature of our age that we now force them down the hole before they\u2019ve had a chance to become a memory.Now to the story that did get attention. Can you hear your columnist sigh?Donald Trump Jr.      \u2019s adventure with sketchy characters claiming to represent Russia made me think of a quote from a deadly old 19th-century European diplomat. It\u2019s no trick to fool a man who thinks himself clever, he said, but a plain, honest man\u2014that can be a challenge.One of the things campaigns always have to watch out for is bumptious oafs who think themselves sophisticated.The White House defense of the Trump Jr. meeting is essentially a question: Who wouldn\u2019t take a meeting with someone who has negative information on your political opponent?But that\u2019s not the question. This someone was purportedly representing a foreign government. And that government was an adversary of the U.S.Who wouldn\u2019t take that meeting? Anyone with a brain and a gut. Anyone who didn\u2019t think \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is a moral template for modern political behavior.Former opposition researchers are angry. I asked one, who worked in George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign: Suppose a representative of a foreign state, or a person claiming ties to that state, contacted you and said: \u201cWe have some dirt on your opponent.\u201d What would your reaction have been?\u201cImmediately we would have walked away,\u201d he said.What if the foreign government was an adversary of the U.S.? \u201cHell no. You don\u2019t go there.\u201dHe recalled there was chatter in 1988 that the Stasi, East Germany\u2019s domestic spy agency, had dirt on the Democratic presidential nominee. The Bush campaign rejected any possible contact out of hand. \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing as self-discipline,\u201d he said.It is wrong to let another nation take an active role in a campaign for the U.S. presidency. It is imprudent, and also rather unpatriotic. It\u2019s not their government, it\u2019s ours. It can be assumed that we will attempt to look out for America\u2019s interests, and they will not.What should Donald Trump Jr. have done when the music promoter urged him to meet with the representative of the Russian government who had secret, big-league, deep, dark info on       Hillary Clinton      ?As Sen.       Lindsey Graham       told President Trump\u2019s FBI nominee: \u201cIf you get a call from somebody suggesting that a foreign government wants to help you by disparaging your opponent, tell us all to call the FBI.\u201dI add: And send word of the contact to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, with the information that you have not and will not respond.

Prosecutors said they would retry the case.The turn of events reverberated through the New York Legislature, which has been grappling with the fallout from Mr. Silver\u2019s scandal since his arrest two years ago. And Thursday\u2019s decision drew mixed reactions from Mr. Silver\u2019s longtime lower Manhattan district where locals still debate his legacy.\u201cHe still has a mountain to climb,\u201d said       Mel Miller,        the former New York Assembly Speaker whose own conviction, on fraud charges, was overturned in 1993. \u201cBut if he wins his retrial, then people will remember him in a different way than they do now.\u201dMr. Silver, a 73-year-old Democrat, ascended to the state Assembly in 1976 as a 32 year-old lawyer. He was known as a taciturn legislator who gained support behind-the-scenes before he was elected speaker of the Assembly in 1994.Mr. Silver has been a lifelong fixture on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, known as a skilled advocate for the city\u2019s landlords, trial attorneys and labor unions. His tenure as Speaker was marked by scandals within his conference, including sexual harassment allegations and coverup accusations.His reign came crashing down when he was convicted in 2015 on charges he abused his power through extortion, honest-services fraud, and money laundering.Mr. Silver has been replaced in his seat by Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, who ran as a reformer and Silver critic. On Thursday,       Ms. Niou,        a Democrat, maintained that Mr. Silver had hurt the community. \u201cMy district has suffered tremendously from this betrayal,\u201d she said.The conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court Thursday that said a U.S. Supreme Court decision after Mr. Silver\u2019s conviction narrowed the definition of certain public-corruption crimes.Some Silver constituents were pleased. \u201cWe were all shocked that he got convicted,\u201c said       Daniel Kronenfield,        an 85-year-old Lower East Side resident. \u201cSilver did a lot a lot of good for this neighborhood.\u201dIn Albany, ethics watchdogs raised concerns that the decision could create a more permissive atmosphere in a state capital with a long history of scandal.\u201cThere are public officials who might view this as good news,\u201d said       Blair Horner,        who runs the government watchdog New York Public Interest Research Group. \u201cBut there are far more officials in the pokey whose convictions have not been overturned.\u201dThose concerns were compounded by the loss earlier this year of Preet Bharara as the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan.       Mr. Bharara       aggressively pursued state legislators on corruption charges. He was dismissed by President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration and his permanent successor hasn\u2019t been named.A number of legislators said the ruling shows new state laws are needed to police legislative conduct.\u201cFor years we have been relying on federal prosecutors to bring the lion\u2019s share of corruption cases,\u201d said Sen.

Last week Illinois passed its first budget in two years, raising taxes by $5 billion\u2014despite already having a state and local tax burden that\u2019s among the highest in the nation. Connecticut\u2019s deficits are so big, according to the fiscal watchdog group Truth in Accounting, that every taxpayer would have to pony up an extra $49,500 to pay off all the liabilities. In Oklahoma, where low oil prices have tanked state revenue, some public schools open only four days a week.Liberal groups warn that President       Trump\u2019s       proposals would make things worse by reducing the funds Washington sends states under programs like Medicaid. Governors and mayors, the argument goes, would be forced either to slash social services or raise taxes to make up the difference.But focusing on federal support obscures the real problem. The biggest cause of states\u2019 budget woes is the anemic condition of the national economy. Over the past eight years, growth in state and local revenue has slowed to a crawl. In fiscal 2017, total state revenue rose by less than 1% after adjusting for inflation, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.What states need most to regain fiscal health are national policies that accelerate the growth of the economy. Governors and mayors should be lobbying nonstop for the tax cuts proposed by Mr. Trump, which would revitalize state finances.When the federal government cuts taxes, more money is left in the hands of businesses and workers. The Trump plan would free up an estimated $2 trillion to $4 trillion over 10 years\u2014an enormous influx of cash for state and local economies.Compare state finances during the go-go Reagan years with President       Obama\u2019s       tenure, beginning after the end of the recession each president faced. After the recession of 1983, the national economy grew an average of more than 4% a year through 1990. During the Obama recovery between 2009 and 2016, the economy grew just over 2% annually. Remember that those effects compound: Strong growth year on year increases the size of the economy over time.If state and local tax revenue had grown under President Obama at the rate it did under President Reagan, receipts in 2016 would have been greater by about $650 billion, or 26%, according to national income and product account data. If the economy in the Obama years had grown at 3.5% to 4%, the average rate for postrecession recoveries, states and cities would have had about $430 billion more. Think what they could do with nearly half a trillion dollars in additional tax revenue each year.Even if Republican tax reform eliminates the federal deduction for state and local income taxes\u2014a move we support\u2014its effect on states would still be overwhelmingly positive. When federal income taxes were high in the 1970s, people could write off as much as 70% of their state and local taxes. Slashing rates in the 1980s brought that figure down to as low as 28%. Yet state fiscal health improved dramatically in the \u201980s. The main effect of eliminating the deduction today would be to reduce the federal subsidy to high-tax states.Critics will say this forecast for economic and revenue growth is wishful thinking, but it is based on the historical record. In the seven years after the Kennedy tax cuts, real state and local receipts grew by more than 60%, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In the seven years after the Reagan rate cuts, the real increase was 37%. After Mr. Obama\u2019s tax increases, real growth was a meager 10%.The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that after 10 years the Trump tax reform would increase America\u2019s long-run gross domestic product by up to 8.2%. State and local governments capture about 13% of GDP in taxes according to 2016 Internal Revenue Service data, meaning the growth spurred by the proposed cuts would give them about $200 billion more each year by 2027 to balance their budgets, reduce taxes, or spend on education and social programs.With the Trump tax cuts in place, the cumulative increase in state and local revenue over the following 10 years would be roughly $1 trillion. Could any imaginable tax increase raise that kind of money?Amazingly, the bean counters at the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax Committee completely ignore this effect when they tally the \u201ccost\u201d of tax cuts in terms of forgone revenue. Almost a third of the lost federal revenue from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax reform would be recouped by states and cities.We only have one question: Why aren\u2019t more governors and mayors\u2014especially those in economically depressed areas\u2014demanding the Trump tax cuts?Mr. Laffer is chairman of Laffer Associates.

The last such service to Manhattan ended in late 2001, partly because of restricted water access around lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to Glen Cove city officials.An MTA spokesman said he didn\u2019t have ridership numbers for the ferries, but ridership has been low according to commuters and Glen Cove officials. A recent 4:30 p.m. trip from Wall Street, for example, carried just 36 commuters out of nearly 150 available seats.The spokesman declined to share the MTA\u2019s cost for the service.GlenCoveBRONXNEW JERSEYMANHATTAN34th St.Wall St.Pier 11QUEENSSunset Park", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/long-island-commuters-test-renewed-ferry-service-to-glen-cove-1499985401", "news_title": "Long Island Commuters Test Renewed Ferry Service to Glen Cove", "keywords": "boat rides,commuter,commuters,ferry service,glen cove,lirr ,long island,long island rail road,mass transit,mass transit repairs,metropolitan transportation authority,mta,new york,new york city,summer of heaven,summer of hell,water taxis,Long Island Rail Road,Metropolitan Transportation Authority,Glen Cove,Seymour B.

Hassan Yunis Khidhir, a bakery worker who fled his neighborhood last week, said he had his three sons, aged 14, 17 and 20, wear full niqabs, the black face coverings worn by conservative Muslim women, when Islamic State came looking.VIEW Interactive\u201cWhen we finally made it out to the security forces, we were so happy that we all cried because we never expected to make it out alive,\u201d Mr. Khidhir said.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday after nearly nine months of fighting to recapture Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, which Islamic State had held for three years.Some fighting continued in subsequent days as Iraqi forces coordinated airstrikes with a U.S.-led military coalition on buildings in the Old City\u2019s narrow streets where Islamic State fighters were believed to be holed up.But the fighting seemed to have died down to a large extent on Thursday. Streets in the Old City were strewn with rubble and the twisted metal of bombed-out cars.Iraqi counterterrorism forces cleared the last buildings in their area of operations on Wednesday afternoon, commanders said, though the forces brought a gray-bearded man wrapped in a blanket on the hood of a Humvee to their headquarters west of the Old City on Thursday morning\u2014a newly captured Islamic State suspect, according to an Iraqi soldier.The Iraqi army was also still battling groups of three or four Islamic State fighters in the Old City on Thursday, according to a commander with those forces who asked not to be named.Iraqi forces recaptured eastern Mosul in January, and had cornered Islamic State fighters into a shrinking portion of the Old City in the west in recent months.Surrounded by Iraqi forces, the militants recalled fighters from other areas of the Old City to defend their last patch of territory, said Lt. Col.       Salam al-Obaidi,        a top field commander in Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism forces.The final push against the militants began on Saturday, at which point Iraqi forces had Islamic State fighters pinned in a long strip of territory in the Old City, running along the western bank of the Tigris River, according to commanders.As the U.S.-trained counterterrorism forces tried to push from south to north, Islamic State fighters turned to desperate tactics, commanders said.The militants wore suicide vests with the aim of detonating themselves if they encountered Iraqi forces in close combat, according to a high-ranking officer who asked not to be named. Around 60 suicide bombers were blowing themselves up every day at the end, he said.Women, some carrying babies, also wore suicide vests and blew themselves up when they reached Iraqi forces, said Lt. Col. Obaidi.\u201cIn this last small area, they weren\u2019t able to use their traditional weapons like car bombs, mortars and drones, so they used suicide bombers,\u201d he said Thursday in the Old City, smoking a cigarette and drinking Red Bull to stay alert after a grueling battle. \u201cMany were women. More than 25 women detonated explosive vests targeting our troops in the last few days.\u201dThe extremists also piled up berms of dirt and rubble at the entrances of narrow alleyways, forcing Iraqi forces to go in on foot to clear buildings before bringing in armored bulldozers to plow paths for armored vehicles, according to Lt. Gen.       Sami al-Aridhi,        another counterterrorism commander.\u201cWe had to give up all our vehicles and heavy weaponry,\u201d he said.Islamic State fighters, most of them foreigners, had confined around 1,000 civilians to the area, commanders said. That meant Iraqi forces had to be tentative when calling in airstrikes.On Sunday, when Mr. Abadi arrived in Mosul, there was still a pitched battle for control and the front lines had moved little from the previous day, Iraqi commanders said.The counterterrorism forces adopted a new strategy, pushing through the middle of the unconquered territory. Separately, Iraqi army units pressed from the north and west, commanders said.By Monday morning, that strategy was paying off as the forces drew closer to wresting the entire patch from Islamic State and most civilians were evacuated, they said.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Islamic State Turned Desperate in Mosul Fight, Iraqis Say.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-turned-desperate-in-mosul-fight-iraqis-say-1499986902", "news_title": "Islamic State Turned Desperate in Mosul Fight, Iraqis Say ", "keywords": "iraq, isil, isis, islamic state, mosul, mosul old city, suicide bombers,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "We interrupt this week\u2019s Don Jr. loop to tell a tale of a real ethics scandal. It\u2019s one perpetrated not by the Trump administration, but by the man atop Washington\u2019s ethics-industrial complex:       Walter Shaub.If you\u2019ve never heard of Mr. Shaub, you soon will. He is resigning as director of the Office of Government Ethics\u2014effective next week\u2014so that he can continue more publicly the war he\u2019s been waging against the administration internally since last fall. Unquestioning media outlets are providing him a big podium for his accusations, so it\u2019s worth noting some facts.Mr. Shaub was already playing the indignant watchdog on Sunday, as he explained his resignation on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d He complained that the White House was consistently \u201cchallenging OGE\u2019s authority to carry out its routine and most basic functions.\u201d Understanding those \u201cfunctions\u201d is critical to realizing the Shaub drama is so much grandstanding.The OGE isn\u2019t a watchdog or an inspector general\u2019s office. As its own website makes clear, it doesn\u2019t adjudicate complaints, investigate ethics violations, or prosecute misconduct. Rather, it was set up in 1978 to help the White House. Its job is to \u201cadvise\u201d and to \u201cassist\u201d the executive branch in navigating complex ethical questions, a job undoubtedly more frustrating and messy under President Trump. Nonetheless, Mr. Shaub\u2019s attempt to act as ethics czar, to ride herd on the Trump operation, is outside his office\u2019s mission. It\u2019s the act of a pious political operator who doesn\u2019t like this president.Only weeks after the election, as speculation swirled about how Mr. Trump would handle the ethical complexity of his business dealings while president, Mr. Shaub was already trolling, posting a series of sarcastic tweets about divestiture to the Office of Government Ethics\u2019 official account. When Mr. Trump released his plan for his assets, Mr. Shaub blasted it at a public event with press in attendance. So much for the \u201chelp\u201d part.The best insight into Mr. Shaub\u2019s methods can be seen in the long fallout from Kellyanne Conway\u2019s bone-headed February attempt to defend Ivanka Trump by calling on Americans to buy her clothing line. Deputy White House counsel       Stefan Passantino,        who leads the internal ethics team, reached out within minutes to reassure Mr. Shaub the situation would be reviewed. Mr. Shaub nonetheless waited only four days before dropping a public letter essentially demanding action against Ms. Conway.In a Feb. 28 response to Mr. Shaub, Mr. Passantino noted that some of the OGE\u2019s ethics regulations do not apply to White House staff. He nonetheless immediately reassured Mr. Shaub that a separate regulation did hold them to some of the same standards and that he had reschooled Ms. Conway in them.Mr. Shaub\u2019s response was to ignore this White House reassurance and instead to fan a firestorm over Mr. Passantino\u2019s first point\u2014which he clearly saw as an affront to the OGE\u2019s power. In a March 9 letter he slammed the White House for failing to discipline Ms. Conway, going on to say he remained \u201cmore concerned about the extraordinary assertion that \u2018many\u2019 of OGE\u2019s regulations are inapplicable.\u201d Democrats and the media fell all over this Shaub claim, never bothering to read Mr. Passantino\u2019s real words.And Mr. Shaub didn\u2019t let up. In a separate letter in May to       Mick Mulvaney,        director of the Office of Management and Budget, he blasted the White House for thinking that it was \u201cbeyond the reach of basic ethics requirements universally applicable to millions of executive branch employees.\u201d That letter was also sent to hundreds of government ethics officials, every inspector general, and the chairmen and ranking members of numerous congressional committees.Mr. Shaub also ginned up outrage over a blanket waiver to the Trump ethics pledge\u2014a waiver allowing staffers to communicate more freely with the media. Never mind that Mr. Trump was under no obligation to create the pledge in the first place.Then Mr. Shaub worked with Democratic senators like       Elizabeth Warren       to cause a hullabaloo over whether Mr. Passantino violated rules by not recusing himself from ethics questions involving a former client,       Carl Icahn.       Never mind that Mr. Icahn isn\u2019t an employee of this administration and thus not subject to ethics rules.None of this is to criticize the OGE\u2019s staff, which has worked diligently on the tough job of getting this particular administration\u2019s nominees compliant with the rules. But wait for the howls when Mr. Trump appoints as the OGE\u2019s acting head someone who isn\u2019t a Shaub-like showboater and who tries to return the office to its core mission. The left and media will skewer him or her as a sellout.As for Mr. Shaub, he\u2019s taking a job with the liberal Campaign Legal Center to push for greater OGE powers. No word on whether he negotiated that job even as the legal center was interacting with government, or whether he signed the Trump pledge barring officials from \u201clobbying\u201d for five years after leaving government. (The OGE did not return a call for comment.)

Collins,        wounded the institution.The current report, prepared by an NIH team led by former U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary       Stewart Simonson,        is based on 70 interviews of more than 600 NIH participants between July 2016 and this May. It concluded that the inquiry by the outside group called the Red Team \u201chad a profound, negative impact on staff morale\u201d at the hospital, which is called the NIH Clinical Center.Recent internal reports of the patient census at the Clinical Center, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, also support the conclusion that the Red Team report damaged the hospital\u2019s reputation and still affects its operations and research capacity, NIH doctors say.The out-patient census, a measure of the number of research patients who come into the hospital for chemotherapy and other treatment, has fallen from a high of 9,601 patient visits per month in March 2016, to 7,836 this June. NIH doctors say the lower census results in less research overall and thus potentially fewer groundbreaking scientific findings.Meanwhile, the in-patient census of monthly patient days\u2014the measure of research participants hospitalized\u2014has rebounded some in the past six months, but at 3,528 patient-days is down far from 4,256 last April.The NIH said Thursday that \u201csome of the changes\u2014both up and down\u2014 can be attributed to the natural ebb and flow of completed and new research protocols.\u201dApril 2016 was a pivotal time. That month the Red Team commissioned by Dr. Collins published its conclusions that NIH doctors had allowed patient safety \u201cto be subservient to research.\u201d It is this central contention that has been most disputed by NIH physicians.This claim \u201cevoked the strongest response\u201d of the year-ago findings, concluded the draft Simonson report, which was prepared for the Friday meeting of the hospital board. \u201cMany at the Clinical Center rejected the Red Team report outright because of this statement,\u201d the report reads.The NIH hospital has long been internationally acclaimed for treating thousands of patients under research protocols designed to create treatments for rare diseases. It has pioneered a range of new medical treatments such as chemotherapy for cancer and artificial mitral heart valve surgery.\u201cI used to be proud of working here,\u201d said one NIH doctor who spoke to The Wall Street Journal anonymously because of concern about professional repercussions, \u201cbut the NIH leadership has taken a place that was not broken, and broke it.\u201dThe entire episode was touched off in 2015 when fungus was found in two medicine vials at the hospital\u2019s pharmacy. The Food and Drug Administration found multiple deficiencies in the production of study drugs at the pharmacy. Dr. Collins subsequently convened the Red Team inquiry and removed the hospital\u2019s leadership.No one at the agency disputes the seriousness of the pharmacy findings, but NIH doctors say Dr. Collins overreacted and hurt the Clinical Center\u2019s reputation. He didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment, but has previously said that he \u201chad no choice but to take it with great seriousness, and not put a Band-Aid on it.\u201d Now, some senior NIH scientists question whether the Red Team\u2019s focus on NIH-produced drugs has actually enhanced safety.\u201cIt has become so much more difficult to do clinical research at the NIH resulting in patient treatment than it was before, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s any safer,\u201d acclaimed NIH cancer researcher       Steven A. Rosenberg,        chief of surgery at the NIH\u2019s National Cancer Institute, told The Wall Street Journal.Overall, the Simonson report concluded the Clinical Center \u201cis a great hospital\u201d and that \u201cthere is no other place in the world like the Clinical Center.\u201d It said, however, that this excellence has been achieved despite \u201ca fragmented organizational structure\u201d and \u201cdeclining state of infrastructure and equipment.\u201dWrite to Thomas M.

Because global oil and gas markets are already glutted, moves by the Trump administration to boost drilling and exports\u00a0can only play a marginal role.\u201cEasing regulation can help output on the margins, but markets will dwarf policy in determining the outlook for U.S. domestic energy production and exports,\u201d said       Jason Bordoff,        director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former energy official in the Obama administration.Russia dominates the European natural-gas market, and many on the Continent remember a time several years ago when Mr. Putin threatened to cut off countries, including Poland and Germany. It\u2019s a tall order to compete head to head with Russia, which operates an extensive network of pipelines into Europe.The first large-scale gas-exporting plant in the U.S. started operating last year,\u00a0and since then shipments of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, have skyrocketed.In the first four months of 2017, U.S. LNG exports, at 198 billion cubic feet, were nearly eight times what they were in the same period last year, according to the latest federal data.But that remains a fraction of the market. For European buyers, the biggest impact has been the ability to use LNG as leverage to get better prices on Russian gas. Before Lithuania\u2019s first LNG import terminal opened in 2014, state-controlled PAO Gazprom lowered gas prices to the country by 20%. Poland last month became the first former Soviet bloc country to receive a U.S. gas cargo, while Lithuania recently signed a deal with             Cheniere Energy Inc.       to receive gas exports this summer from Louisiana. Other countries in the region are building infrastructure to handle more LNG imports.That has\u00a0spurred Moscow to\u00a0lower\u00a0prices to compete and to try\u00a0to develop its own LNG facilities. Russia wants to build another large gas pipeline into Europe, a project opposed by Washington and Brussels.\u201cRussia has become very flexible in the way they are marketing their gas as they compete with LNG,\u201d said       Ira Joseph,        head of gas and power analytics at S&P Global Platts.Still, some see an opening for the U.S. to boost exports to Europe in coming years. Half of all long-term supply agreements into Europe\u2014the vast majority of which involve Russia\u2014expire in the five-year period that started in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency.\u201cU.S. gas is a powerful alternative to Europe\u2019s other options,\u201d IEA chief\u00a0Fatih Birol\u00a0said.The sea change in U.S. oil exports occurred in\u00a0December 2015,\u00a0when Congress lifted a 40-year export ban on oil. Since then, U.S. oil shipments overseas have soared, topping one million barrels a day in some months of this year and moving to far-flung locations including China and India, which have voracious appetites for oil.While\u00a0the Trump administration has taken steps to remove barriers to production, some say they are unlikely to have a major impact due to lower commodity prices.This month,\u00a0Secretary of the Interior       Ryan Zinke       promised to speed up permitting for developing oil and gas on federal lands, but little output comes from such acreage because U.S. drillers are focused on private lands.\u00a0The Trump administration has moved to expand drilling off the coast of Alaska, a U-turn from the Obama era, but with crude prices below $50 a barrel, few companies are eager to drill in the challenging Arctic environment.The White House has also trumpeted the idea of approving more natural-gas export terminals along the Gulf Coast. Problem is, the market doesn\u2019t need them right now.Under President Barack Obama, 23 U.S. gas export facilities were approved. Four are operating, and by 2021 a total of nearly 13 billion cubic feet of gas a day could be shipped out, said John Best, managing director of Criterion Research, a Houston energy consulting firm.From Florida to Alaska, projects capable of exporting another 30 billion cubic feet of gas\u00a0have been announced but not yet approved.\u00a0Mr. Best believes approved facilities will ship out only around 8 billion cubic feet of gas, and many of the others will never be built because they no longer make financial sense.\u201cThe world can\u2019t absorb this much gas that quickly,\u201d he said.\u2014Timothy Puko  contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   By 2021, nearly 13 billion cubic feet of gas a day could be exported from the U.S., and projects capable of exporting another 30 billion have been announced but not approved. An earlier version incorrectly expressed these quantities in millions.

The fund for disability benefits is the smaller of the two\u2014$46 billion for disability, compared with $2.8 trillion for retirement. The longer projection for the smaller fund means Congress isn\u2019t immediately forced to grapple with looming shortfalls in any of its programs.The overall financial health of the entitlement programs hasn\u2019t improved, according to the report. If Social Security\u2019s retirement and disability funds are combined into one program, their funds will be exhausted in 2034, unchanged from last year.The trust funds were built when more people paid into the system than received benefits. As the population ages, benefit payments are projected to exceed revenues, drawing down fund balances. Under current law, when the trust funds are emptied, benefits from the programs will be abruptly reduced. The latest projections say retirement benefits would be slashed by 25%. The status of the funds is thus a potential trigger for reforms in the programs.Still, the annual report card on the finances of the nation\u2019s major entitlements, which are responsible for about 42% of federal spending, serves as a reminder that Social Security and Medicare are bound to face changes in coming years.The trustees report also provided an update on the Medicare trust funds, which will be depleted just\u00a012 years from now\u00a0in 2029 under current estimates. That is a one-year extension compared with last year\u2019s estimate.In 2016, over 50 million Americans received retirement benefits from Social Security and Medicare benefits were received by 56.8 million people. Spending on the programs is poised to grow as the nation\u2019s population ages.Shifting demographics explain part of why disability payments have come down, as those who reach retirement age leave the disability program and enter the retirement program. The number of people receiving disability insurance benefits fell to 10.6 million in 2016, down from 10.9 million in 2014.U.S. Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       said an improving economy may also be contributing to the decline.\u201cAs the labor market tightens, I think it\u2019s natural to see individuals have more work opportunities,\u201d Mr. Acosta said. \u201cWe must build on this good news.\u201dOne strategy that Congress has used in the past to postpone addressing the entitlements is to shift funds from the retirement program to the disability program. In 2015, Congress was forced to act when the disability program was projected to be completely depleted\u00a0within 2 years. By diverting some payroll taxes from the massive retirement program, Congress was able to keep the smaller disability fund in balance for a longer period.\u201cIf our leaders act soon, modest policy changes can be phased in gradually, allowing time to plan and adjust,\u201d said       Michael Peterson,        the president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation which advocates for reduction of the nation\u2019s debt. \u201cBut the longer we wait, the more difficult the problem becomes.\u201dPresident       Donald Trump       has pledged not to cut the programs. Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said the administration encourages Congress to act, but he emphasized that growing the economy is the administration\u2019s key plan to bolster the trust funds.\u201cTo help make these programs sustainable into the future we should focus on strengthening the economy today,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cCompounding growth will help ease projected shortfalls.Corrections & Amplifications   Medicare trust funds will be depleted\u00a012 years from now,\u00a0in 2029, under current estimates.

William McNabb III       in January.Vanguard, a pioneer of low-cost indexing mutual funds and the world\u2019s second largest asset manager, has pulled in new assets at a record pace in recent years as investors lost faith in more traditional money managers who handpick stocks and bonds.It now manages $4.4 trillion in assets under management, trailing only             BlackRock Inc.       in total size.Vanguard\u2019s dominance in the industry was perhaps most apparent last year as it attracted more new investor cash than all its rivals combined.During the first six months of this year, it pulled in roughly $214 billion in net new money. Industry-wide, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds attracted a net $387.3 billion in the first half of the year, according to Morningstar Inc.The new CEO isn\u2019t expected to take Vanguard in a new direction. But he will face a number of challenges as more rivals rush to match Vanguard in price, and stock pickers assert that passively managed shareholders like Vanguard have become too deferential to management.Other tasks will be to expand overseas, attract more money to a relatively-new financial-advisory service and improve customer services amid the company\u2019s meteoric rise.Some customers have complained of longer than normal customer wait times as assets have swelled, and earlier this year the firm suffered a website outage that left many clients unable to log into their accounts for part of a trading day.\u201cIt\u2019s an awesome responsibility,\u201d Mr. Buckley, 48, said of the new role.Vanguard\u2019s clients now range from millions of mom and pop investors to some of the world\u2019s largest pension plans and sovereign-wealth funds. It is a sizable shareholder in a number of giant American corporations, giving it increasing power over the fates of chief executives, takeovers and other crucial boardroom decisions.Passive Vanguard mutual and exchange-traded funds owned 5% or more of shares in 485 companies in the S&P 500 at the end of March, up from 12 in 2008, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from Morningstar Inc. and S&P Global Market Intelligence.Mr. Buckley will also face pressure to keep Vanguard\u2019s fund fees low and control operational expenses. Mr. McNabb started an internal campaign to reduce Vanguard\u2019s average asset-weighted fund fee to 0.10% by 2020. That figure stood at 0.12% at the end of 2016, a spokeswoman said.Continually lowering fund costs for the firm required both continued asset gathering and controlling spending. Head count has fallen more than 10% during Mr. McNabb\u2019s tenure.Mr. McNabb also halted plans to build a new campus for Vanguard on an old dairy farm because of concerns over the expense, and he revised Vanguard\u2019s strategy overseas, paring its network of offices and making the U.K. a bigger priority. Earlier this year, Vanguard began selling funds directly to investors there for the first time.Mr. McNabb told Vanguard executives about the planned leadership changes in the Majestic Building, which like all of the buildings on the firm\u2019s sprawling Malvern, Pa., campus, is named after a British battleship.That building is where Mr. McNabb typically holds his annual meetings with staff, referred to as crew. \u201cMy goal has always been to leave the woodpile higher than where I found it,\u201d Mr. McNabb said in an interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s the right amount of time for someone to run an organization like Vanguard,\u201d he said referring to his tenure as CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s complex, it\u2019s all consuming, and it\u2019s good to get fresh perspective, even with the kind of continuity we have here.\u201dMr. McNabb, 60, and Mr. Buckley are both longtime insiders at Vanguard who have worked together on a variety of firmwide projects. Mr. Buckley started as an assistant to Mr. Bogle in 1991 and Mr. McNabb met him during his interview. Mr. McNabb began his career with Vanguard in 1986 and became CEO in 2008, when Vanguard had $1.25 trillion in assets.Mr. McNabb will remain as chairman next year and eventually pass that role to Mr. Buckley as well.After passing the chairman role to Mr. Buckley, Mr. McNabb says he plans to spend time with his family and on philanthropic work in addition to advising or teaching at universities he attended.When asked if he would consider a role elsewhere in the money management industry, he said: \u201cAll my money is at Vanguard.

Vicky Hartzler       (R., Mo.). Twenty four House Republicans joined 190 Democrats in voting against the amendment, which was branded as \u201ccowardly\u201d by House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.).Ms. Hartzler\u2019s amendment had been contested by House Democrats and LGBT advocacy groups.\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned because of the harmful impact [the amendment] will have not only on service members, but family members who receive health-care military benefits from the Department of Defense,\u201d said       Ashley Broadway-Mack,        president of the American Military Partner Association.President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration has changed other policies regarding transgender issues that were instituted under the Obama administration.The departments of Education and Justice in February rescinded protections for transgender students in public schools that allowed them to use restrooms that correspond with their own gender identities, arguing that states and local school districts should establish those policies.In June, the administration delayed by six months a decision to open military enlistment to transgender people. That delay let stand a policy change by the Obama administration that allows transgender service members to remain in the military.The White House has levied more than two dozen other objections to the defense authorization measure, with the bill\u2019s price tag chief among them. It is $18 billion above what Mr. Trump outlined for defense spending in his own 2018 budget request.Other White House concerns include the removal of a provision allowing the Defense Department to close bases through a formal process if deemed necessary.Though       Mr. McConnell       wants to see the defense authorization measure passed by the end of August, senators also face an increasingly contentious health-care debate and backlog of nominations to key administration positions.\u2014Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Defense-Policy Bill Faces Hurdles.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 18:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-rejects-defense-bills-amendment-banning-medical-care-for-gender-transition-1499985780", "news_title": "House Rejects Defense Bill\u2019s Amendment Banning Medical Care for Gender Transition ", "keywords": "defense spending,transgender,Defense Department,Vicky Hartzler,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "PRINCETON, N.J.\u2014Don\u2019t tell       Cody McSherry       that the accordion is an instrument more suited to his grandparents\u2019 generation. The 14-year-old budding master of the squeezebox says he has too many gigs lined up to worry about whether it meets anyone\u2019s definition of cool.Cody is one of about 200 attendees at the American Accordionists\u2019 Association annual festival, a gathering of professionals, students and teachers that is being held this year at the Westin Princeton at Forrestal Village in New Jersey through Sunday.In many ways, musicians like Cody are key to the accordion\u2019s future. After years of seeing their instrument stigmatized as a relic of the Lawrence Welk era, accordionists are feeling hopeful that a new generation is starting to embrace it.Such pop and rock groups as the Lumineers and Mumford & Sons are featuring the accordion. Even Madonna has been known to have one on stage.Still, Cody, who entertained the festival\u2019s attendees with a brief set of classic European accordion music (as in polkas and more polkas) during a Thursday lunch, says it isn\u2019t so much the hipster factor that attracted him. Rather, it is the very personal nature of the accordion, an instrument that is literally strapped to a player\u2019s body.\u201cIt becomes a part of you,\u201d said Cody, who lives in Lancaster, Pa. \u201cYou breathe with it.\u201dThere was a whole lot of such breathing going on at the festival on Thursday. Younger players showcased their skills in a scholarship competition with $8,000 in prizes at stake. Older musicians attended workshops, including one by Brooklyn-based accordionist Will Holshouser that demonstrated how the instrument works in a wide range of international musical expressions, from French to Argentinian to Jewish-style klezmer.\u201cThere\u2019s no one overriding accordion tradition,\u201d Mr. Holshouser said during the workshop.To top it off, many attendees gathered for a rehearsal of the festival \u201corchestra,\u201d which is essentially an expanded accordion ensemble. The concert takes place on Saturday night.Not that there wasn\u2019t time for a little socializing\u2014or shopping. Vendors were on hand, selling\u00a0accordion-themed novelties\u2014think a bumper sticker that declared, \u201cI\u2019d rather be squeezin\u2019\u201d\u2014to actual instruments themselves.Frank Busso Jr., an accordion seller at the festival, says business has been good, with his annual sales rising 10% to 15% over the past five years. It helps that some of the newer top-tier models, priced over $10,000, are more lightweight and portable: Mr. Busso pointed to one instrument, made with what he called a \u201cspace-age metal,\u201d that came in at 23 pounds\u2014or several pounds lighter than what a previous iteration might have weighed.Either way, Mr. Busso, an accordionist himself whose father, sister and other relatives also play the instrument, says there is a timeless appeal to the squeezebox. For him, it is about the fact that an accordion can create so much sound.\u201cIt\u2019s like carrying an orchestra on your back,\u201d he said.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 18:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-accordion-is-still-music-to-some-peoples-ears-1499985720", "news_title": "Why the Accordion Is Still Music to Some People\u2019s Ears", "keywords": "accordion,accordion festival,American Accordionists' Association,Cody McSherry,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals,music"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       reiterated that he is planning to impose fresh curbs on steel imports, though he didn\u2019t elaborate on when he would move forward with the delayed action.\u201cSteel is a big problem,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during a flight Wednesday to France. \u201cWe\u2019re like a dumping ground\u2026And I\u2019m stopping it.\u201dAsked what type of measures he would use, the president said \u201cthere are two ways\u2014quotas and tariffs. Maybe I\u2019ll do both.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments, which weren\u2019t made public until Thursday afternoon, were made in response to questions from reporters traveling with him to Paris to join French President       Emmanuel Macro       for a Bastille Day celebration.Mr. Trump and Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       announced in late April that they would study the possibility of imposing new steel import limits in the name of \u201cnational security,\u201d and had said repeatedly that they would do so by the end of June.But the process has gotten bogged down amid debates among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, as well as strong pushback from U.S. trading partners, as well U.S. consumers of steel.In his comments Wednesday, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t say when he would impose the new measures, nor did he say how broadly they would be applied.\u00a0Many steel exporters have lobbied the administration to be exempted from the measures.Steel stocks reacted positively to the president\u2019s ongoing support of tariffs.             United States Steel Corp.       closed up 3.7%, and             AK Steel Holding Corp.       rose 7.1%, while             Nucor Corp.       finished up 2.6%Many analysts said that any U.S. tariffs would be ineffective at addressing the broader problem afflicting the steel industry\u2014massive Chinese overcapacity that is dragging down global prices\u2014because the U.S. already has imposed tight limits on Chinese steel imports and currently buys very little steel directly from Chinese manufacturers.While there is strong support for tariffs from U.S. steelmakers, allowing some imports to enter the country would allow U.S. steel users to continue buying certain types of steel from overseas that they can\u2019t obtain from domestic mills. The U.S. has long been a net importer of steel.Ohio-based AK Steel, which produces specialty steel used in electrical equipment said a \u201cbroad based remedy [for imports] is critical to preserve America\u2019s national security interests, especially in areas like electrical steels.\u201d The company said that as of May imports of electrical steel are on pace to double year over year.U.S. steel companies have said they are looking for more details about the administration\u2019s policy on imports after months of board statements about steel dumping and the need for tariffs.\u201cIt still up in the air what the remedy is going to look like,\u201d said a spokesman for             ArcelorMittal.In his remarks, Mr. Trump suggested he would impose the new limits on China and other trading partners, saying the problem is \u201cnot only China, but others.\u201d But he didn\u2019t say which other countries would face the tariffs or quotas, or if any countries would be exempted.On Capitol Hill Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross briefed senators on the options for steel barriers.\u201cHe clearly believes that the president should get a menu of options,\u201d said Sen.       Ron Wyden,        the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, which oversees trade.Sen.       Sherrod Brown       (D., Ohio), who backs strong measures to combat China\u2019s steel overcapacity, said Mr. Ross is hoping to announce a plan to address steel imports in the next week, depending on the White House.Some officials in the Trump administration are said to oppose broad tariffs on steel, fearing economic fallout, retaliation from trading partners and diplomatic setbacks.In his comments to reporters, Mr. Trump also indicated he would ramp up trade pressure more generally on China in advance of high-level economic meetings scheduled in Washington, D.C., for next week.\u201cWe are being absolutely devastated by bad trade deals,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe worst of all [our] trade deals is with China.\u201dDuring his comments, Mr. Trump also highlighted plans, announced this week, to try to amend the five-year-old free-trade agreement with South Korea.\u201cWe have a bad deal with South Korea,\u201d he said, citing the growth in the U.S. trade deficit with that country since the pact was signed. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible deal.

Several other Republican senators\u2014including Rob Portman of Ohio, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and       Bill Cassidy       of Louisiana\u2014said they had to digest the bill before committing.That leaves Mr. McConnell with a dangerously thin margin. The majority leader was forced to delay a vote on the bill\u2019s initial version two weeks ago due to lack of support, and he introduced a number of changes in the new draft\u2014notably a provision letting insurers offer less-comprehensive policies\u2014that drew praise from some conservatives. No Democrats are expected to support the bill.But one more defection would derail the bill, putting its fate largely in the hands of centrists, who greeted the bill tepidly.The new Senate GOP bill would still dismantle much of the ACA, setting up a new system of tax credits to help some people buy insurance and dramatically curbing federal spending on Medicaid. Unlike earlier versions, the bill unveiled Thursday would allow insurers to sell cheaper, less comprehensive plans. It also adds $45 billion to combat the opioid epidemic and retains two of the ACA\u2019s taxes on high-income households.\u201cI still have concerns,\u201d said Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W. Va.), who has expressed worry about proposed cuts to the Medicaid program.The latest version of the bill would preserve a 0.9% payroll tax and a 3.8% tax on investment income. Both taxes apply only to individuals with incomes above $200,000 and married couples making over $250,000.Conservatives have pushed for a more aggressive repeal of the ACA, often called Obamacare, while centrist GOP lawmakers complain that deep cuts to Medicaid would strip coverage from millions of people.Thursday\u2019s revisions appeared to tilt the bill toward conservatives, including the adoption of a controversial proposal by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. That proposal allows insurers that offer policies that follow ACA requirements to also sell less-comprehensive policies that don\u2019t comply.Mr. Cruz said this would cut premiums for many Americans, but centrists worry it would drive up costs for people with pre-existing medical conditions. Mr. Cruz, who had opposed the initial bill, applauded the inclusion of his measure.\u201cIt\u2019s very significant progress,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.But not all conservatives were sold. Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) said Thursday afternoon he was undecided on the bill. He is concerned about how GOP leaders modified Mr. Cruz\u2019s amendment, which he is worried could affect the premiums charged by insurers.In another gesture to conservatives, the revised legislation would for the first time permit people to use tax-advantaged health savings accounts to pay for their premiums.Democrats derided the new bill as essentially the same as the old one, which polls suggested was deeply unpopular. And they said the Cruz measure would let insurers sell bare-bones policies that do little to protect consumers.\u201cThat is like allowing car companies to sell cars without air bags, bumpers, or emergency brakes,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.). \u201cIt might make the cars cheaper, but the cars are too dangerous to drive.\u201dRepublicans, including President       Donald Trump,        acknowledged it was hard to bridge the gap between conservatives and centrists.\u201cI\u2019d say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is health care,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he traveled to Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s like this narrow road that\u2019s about a quarter-of-an-inch wide. You get a couple here and you say, \u2018Great\u2019\u2014and then you find out you just lost four over here.\u201dGOP leaders took fewer steps to address some members\u2019 concerns about the Medicaid program. The Senate bill would phase out enhanced federal money that the ACA sent to states that expanded Medicaid, and would also make steep cuts to the underlying program.Ms. Collins said that despite some tweaks to Medicaid funding, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there are hundreds of billions of dollars of cuts in the Medicaid program that would shift costs onto state governments.\u201dYet other Republicans said the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts were crucial to bringing costs under control, and they took issue with some GOP governors who oppose the cuts.\u201cIf we can\u2019t even deal with our governors back home, how will we ever deal with Medicare and Social Security?\u201d said Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.) \u201cOur governors, if they were in our position, would be doing exactly the same thing we\u2019re doing.\u201dThe revised bill did make some changes to court centrists, establishing a fund to give federal money to insurers so they could offset the cost of covering people with expensive medical conditions who buy ACA-compliant plans.The legislation also would give significant aid to Alaska, which has especially expensive medical costs. The state\u2019s Republican senator, Sen.       Lisa Murkowski,        has also been considered an uncertain vote due to concerns about the impact of Medicaid cuts on Alaska.Republican leaders now have just a few days to unify their party behind the new bill. A key moment will come early next week, when the Congressional Budget Office releases its estimate of the bill\u2019s impact on cost and coverage.Many senators said they would wait for CBO\u2019s assessment before deciding how to vote. Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.), who opposed the initial bill, said he is reserving judgment until he sees a CBO score, but that he was encouraged by some of the changes.The Senate procedural vote could come shortly after the CBO report, probably by the middle of next week. If the bill survives, a debate on the underlying measure would follow, including the offering of numerous amendments.In a surprise twist Thursday, Sens.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) and Cassidy (R., La.) pitched their own health plan, describing it as a fallback if Mr. McConnell is unable to secure enough votes for his bill.The Graham-Cassidy plan would retain most of the ACA\u2019s taxes and send that money to the states. The senators hope that might appeal to centrist Republicans and possibly some Democrats, since states could use the money any way they like, including re-creating state-level versions of the ACA.\u2014Michelle Hackman and Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'New GOP Health Bill Gets Chilly Reception.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 18:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/revised-senate-gop-legislation-will-allow-insurers-to-sell-cheaper-plans-with-fewer-benefits-1499962456", "news_title": "New Senate Health Bill Aims to Bridge GOP Gaps, But Resistance Remains ", "keywords": "aca,cbo,congress,congressionl budget office,donald trump,health care,health law,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,plan,scored,senate,trumpcare,Bill Cassidy,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,human services department,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Health-insurer Anthem Inc. has filed a civil suit alleging that drugmaker             Insys Therapeutics Inc.        INSY 1.68%       engaged in \u201cfraudulent schemes\u201d to secure reimbursement for the company\u2019s fentanyl painkiller Subsys.The suit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Arizona, alleges that Insys bribed doctors and lied to Anthem about patients\u2019 diagnoses to win reimbursement for prescriptions that wouldn\u2019t have been covered otherwise.Anthem alleges that as a result of the fraud, it paid in excess of $19 million for Subsys prescriptions that shouldn\u2019t have been reimbursed.A spokeswoman for Insys didn\u2019t immediately respond for comment.Anthem, based in Indianapolis, is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial, as well as an injunction barring Insys from continuing to engage in the alleged fraudulent conduct.Since at least 2013, Anthem alleges, Insys \u201chas engaged in a carefully orchestrated, illegal, and dangerous scheme to obtain millions of dollars in reimbursement from health insurers, including Anthem, that the company knew it was not entitled to.\u201dAnthem\u2019s lawsuit is the latest legal headache for Insys, a Chandler, Ariz.-based company that derives the bulk of its revenue from Subsys. The company and its former executives have been embroiled in multiple legal investigations related to the company\u2019s sales tactics for Subsys.On Tuesday, two former Insys saleswomen pleaded guilty in separate cases to violating the federal anti-kickback statute. One of the saleswomen,       Natalie Levine,        is married to former Insys Chief Executive       Michael Babich,        who was charged in December with racketeering conspiracy and other offenses related to his time at Insys. Mr. Babich pleaded not guilty.Shares of Insys fell 1.1% in after-hours trading Thursday after the Journal reported the Anthem lawsuit.Insys faces a deep-pocketed legal opponent in Anthem, one of the largest U.S. health-insurers. The company earned about $2.5 billion in profit last year, and it holds cash and cash equivalents of $6.77 billion.Subsys is a fast-acting fentanyl mouth spray and is among a class of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat severe pain in cancer patients. The drug is highly potent and addictive, and the FDA requires that Insys sell it through a special program that mandates all doctors, pharmacies and patients be registered in a database, and that doctors are educated about the drug\u2019s safety risks and proper uses.The FDA approves drugs for specific conditions and diseases, but doctors are free to prescribe drugs for nonapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d indications as well. However, many insurers, including Anthem, will only pay for Subsys prescriptions when they are written for cancer patients.Anthem alleges that Insys came up with a \u201ccreative, fraudulent and illegal\u201d solution for expanding the Subsys market to non-cancer patients: bribing doctors with payments disguised as promotional speaking fees, and the creation of an internal reimbursement unit that used misleading tactics to get Subsys prescriptions approved by insurers.Many of Anthem\u2019s allegations piggyback on criminal lawsuits brought by federal prosecutors against former Insys employees or doctors with close ties to the company. For instance, Anthem cites the conduct of       Xiulu Ruan,        an Alabama physician recently sentenced to 21 years in prison for offenses including taking kickbacks from Insys, and Connecticut nurse       Heather Alfonso,        who has pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks from Insys. Both Dr. Ruan and Ms. Alfonso prescribed Subsys to Anthem patients who didn\u2019t have cancer, Anthem alleges.Anthem supports its claim that Insys\u2019 reimbursement unit lied about patients\u2019 diagnoses by citing criminal complaints filed against Mr. Babich and other former Insys employees. Insys employees sometimes misrepresented themselves when speaking with insurers, asserted patients had cancer when they didn\u2019t, and falsely stated that patients had met Anthem\u2019s requirements that they try other pain medicines before Subsys would be covered, the suit alleges.Elizabeth Gurrieri,        the former head of Insys\u2019 reimbursement unit, pleaded guilty in June to one count of wire fraud conspiracy and is cooperating with a federal investigation of Insys being led by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Boston, according to court documents.Write to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Anthem Alleges Fentanyl Fraud.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 18:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-files-civil-suit-against-insys-therapeutics-1499980305", "news_title": "Anthem Files Civil Suit Against Insys Therapeutics", "keywords": "anthem lawsuit,fentanyl,insys lawsuit,subsys,Insys Therapeutics,INSY,Anthem,ANTM,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,fraud,pharmaceuticals,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services,botanical,homeopathic drugs,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Qatar and four other Arab nations to meet directly to end a feud between the crucial U.S. allies now in its second month.The chief American diplomat\u2019s shuttle diplomacy over the past several days didn\u2019t break a stalemate between the sides on Thursday. And Arab officials said it was unlikely all of the parties would meet together soon. But Mr. Tillerson said he saw more willingness between the Middle Eastern nations to communicate.\u201cRight now the parties are not even talking to one another at any level,\u201d he said on a plane from Qatar to Washington. \u201cWe\u2019d love to get them to the table, face to face, to begin a discussion around addressing these issues.\u201dSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and imposed a transport ban against the tiny Gulf nation on June 5 in response to what those countries described as concerns about support for terrorist groups and meddling in their domestic affairs.The U.S. has taken on a diplomatic role in the dispute because the five countries are vital political and economic allies to Washington. Some of them are major suppliers of oil and cooperate on regional security and the fight against Islamic State militants. Qatar is home to the U.S.\u2019s largest Middle East military base, a hub for aircraft involved in the air campaigns against the militants in Iraq and Syria. Bahrain is home to the Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet.\u201cWe need this part of the world to be stable and this particular conflict between these parties is obviously not helpful,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, a former Exxon Mobil Corp. chief.He said the U.S. backs Kuwait as the main mediator of the conflict, but that the U.S. would suggest ideas for progress. Mr. Tillerson this week circulated documents among the feuding nations he said that laid out \u201csome ways that we might move this forward.\u201dAfter cutting ties, the four-nation Arab bloc later issued a list of 13 demands for\u200bQatar to meet, including closing down state broadcaster Al Jazeera, curbing ties with Iran and ending Turkey\u2019s military presence on its soil. Qatar has rejected those demands and accused the countries of running a smear campaign.U.S. and Western officials dismiss most of the demands as unreasonable, but hope they might be able to negotiate on some of the requests.Mr. Tillerson said he attempted to try to sort out grievances that the four nation bloc had with Qatar, but that some of them are complex, date back years and may take longer to resolve.In Doha on Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson and his Qatari counterpart signed a pact to crack down on terror financing. The next day, he met with officials from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, who deemed the accord insufficient to satisfy their concerns about Qatar\u2019s alleged support for terrorist groups.\u201cThere is a diplomatic solution to this crisis, but any solution is going to ultimately require addressing the core issues of the demands, including security, support for extremists and terrorism, and meddling internal affairs of countries,\u201d one Arab diplomat said.The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about its position in the crisis. When the Saudi-led bloc first moved to cut ties with Qatar in June, President Donald Trump took credit for the move and said it was a result of a successful visit to Riyadh in May. Later, Mr. Tillerson called on the bloc to end a blockade of Qatar and the State Department questioned the motives of the Saudis and others for keeping the conflict going.Mr. Tillerson likened the negotiations to \u201cdealing with dynamic situations in my old CEO role.\u201dWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Tillerson Urges Arab Nations To Talk.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 18:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-calls-on-feuding-arab-nations-to-meet-to-end-dispute-1499985085", "news_title": "U.S. Calls on Feuding Arab Nations to Meet to End Dispute", "keywords": " arab dispute,gulf nations dispute, qatar dispute, saudi arabia qatar dispute,Rex Tillerson,political,general news,international relations,politics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Rep.

The company could file confidentially in the next few weeks, one of the people said.Roku is seeking a valuation of roughly $1 billion, a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans said. It isn\u2019t clear whether Roku can achieve that number, though, and troubles with two high-profile offerings this year\u2014            Blue Apron Holdings Inc.       and             Snap Inc.      \u2014mean determining the right valuation likely will be difficult in the coming months, buyers and sellers of IPOs say.A company\u2019s IPO valuation can change generally up until the night of its pricing.Roku has spent much of the past two years transforming its business from one that generated revenue largely from hardware to one that gets a more significant portion of its top line from ads on its streaming services featuring content from Hulu,             Amazon.com Inc.,Netflix Inc.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       YouTube, as well as from revenue-sharing deals with these companies.Roku and its underwriters will likely seek to pitch it as the future of television and a firm that can capture significant market share\u2014and revenue\u2014as more content moves off traditional networks and more consumers shift away from traditional cable.In 2016, Roku generated nearly $400 million in revenue, and its so-called media and licensing segment accounted for more than a quarter of that, according to the company. As of June 30, Roku said it had 15 million monthly active accounts, which was a 61% rise from the same time a year earlier.Roku originally worked with banks on a possible IPO in 2014, but at the time, it would have gone public as a hardware company and it was moving toward generating more revenue from its streaming-related services.

If confirmed by the Senate, he would replace       James Comey,        who was dismissed by Mr. Trump in May. The president has said the agency\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election was on his mind when he decided to fire Mr. Comey.Democrats on Thursday praised Mr. Wray\u2019s answers during his hearing and said they were confident he would be an independent leader of the bureau at a time of mounting concerns about political pressure on the agency.

He also defended the special counsel\u2019s probe, assuring lawmakers it would get the resources needed.Mr. Wray has previously worked with Mr. Mueller at the Justice Department.

Doing so serves both leaders, as Mr. Macron seeks to cultivate a powerful ally and Mr. Trump seeks a bridge out of his growing isolation abroad.In perhaps the clearest sign of newfound bonhomie between the two leaders, Mr. Trump dangled the prospect of rejoining the Paris Climate Accord in the future after deciding earlier this year to withdraw the U.S. from the international pact.\u201cSomething could happen with respect to the Paris accord, but we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe U.S. remains committed to remaining a leader in environmental protection.\u201dFrench officials interpreted the proclamation as more of an olive branch than an actual policy announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely new, but it\u2019s a bit more balanced than what he said June 1,\u201d a French official said, referring to the date Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal.The two also touched on other issues that have divided them, including trade, but emphasized their joint efforts on counterterrorism and in Syria. The two nations have encountered no trouble finding common ground on combatting terrorism, Mr. Macron said, adding he hoped the countries could in coming months increase their cooperation to fight a \u201cglobal threat.\u201dThe two leaders appeared, at least for now, to have made an effort to move past disagreements, as Mr. Macron said world leaders must do. \u201cDoes that mean we have to stop talking about the other subjects? No, resolutely and in no case,\u201d he said.At one point, Mr. Trump clapped Mr. Macron on the back as he described an \u201cunbreakable\u201d friendship between the two nations\u2014\u201cand ourselves.\u201d Later, the French leader threw a wink at his U.S. counterpart as Mr. Trump praised him for his plans to shrink the French bureaucracy.Mr. Trump\u2019s diplomacy efforts extended to the French first lady, Brigitte Macron, too. \u201cYou\u2019re in such good shape,\u201d he told her after their joint tour of the museum at the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, in comments captured by a video on the French presidential             Facebook                   account. \u201cBeautiful.\u201dMr. Trump said early last month he would begin negotiations to either re-enter the Paris agreement under new terms or craft a new deal that he judges fair to the U.S. and its workers\u2014an assertion viewed skeptically by the nearly 200 countries that signed the pact, many of which have said they aren\u2019t interested in renegotiating.On Thursday, Mr. Trump called for \u201creciprocal and fair\u201d trade deals but stopped short of his typically harsh rhetoric on countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits. \u201cBoth President Macron and I understand the responsibility to prioritize the interests of our country and at the same time be respectful of the world in which we live,\u201d he said.At last week\u2019s G-20 summit, Mr. Macron took swipes at Mr. Trump and others for equating fair trade with avoiding bilateral deficits.\u2018The presence of Mr. Trump here is not just natural, but it\u2019s also a very good thing for the history of our countries.\u2019Mr. Trump\u2019s effusive praise of France marked a reversal from his previous comments. In the fall of 2016, ahead of his election victory, Mr. Trump called the country \u201ca disaster\u201d; on Thursday, he said it was \u201cbeautiful.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump last month announced the U.S. withdrawal from the climate accord, he said he had been elected to \u201crepresent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\u201d Mr Macron retorted provocatively, parodying Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign slogan to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d with a call to \u201cMake the Planet Great Again.\u201d He also set up a website inviting investors and climate academics to emigrate to France.Mr. Trump touched down in Paris early Thursday morning for a whirlwind trip to celebrate Bastille Day and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I. On Friday, Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump will be the guests of honor at a military parade down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es before returning to Washington in the early afternoon.Back in Washington, Mr. Trump has faced a growing furor over his eldest son\u2019s decision last June to accept a meeting to discuss what he was told was a Russian government offer of damaging information about Democrat       Hillary Clinton.       On Thursday, he defended his son but didn\u2019t answer a question on whether he felt he was misled about the existence of the meeting during the campaign.The French president has faced criticism from leftist political rivals for inviting Mr. Trump. On Thursday, Mr. Macron stressed that the shared history of the U.S. and France is greater than either he or Mr. Trump.\u201cThe presence of Mr. Trump here is not just natural, but it\u2019s also a very good thing for the history of our countries,\u201d he said.Before his meetings with Mr. Macron, Mr. Trump was treated to an elaborate military ceremony at the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, built in the 1670s to care for and house injured war veterans. Mr. Macron led his American counterpart on a tour of the building, which holds the tomb of       Napoleon Bonaparte.       They were accompanied by their wives, who split off to tour Notre Dame Cathedral and take a boat ride as their husbands traveled to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for bilateral talks.Messrs. Trump and Macron had a tense start to their relationship following Mr. Macron\u2019s victory in May after a campaign in which Mr. Trump had expressed support for his opponent, far-right politician       Marine Le Pen.In their first meeting, at a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the two leaders\u2019 handshake devolved into a white-knuckled, jaw-clenching contest. Mr. Macron later told a French newspaper the move was intended to show he wouldn\u2019t \u201cmake small concessions, not even symbolic ones.\u201dAt the start of their meeting on Thursday, the two leaders\u2019 handshake was markedly less ferocious. Mr. Trump unclasped his hand first.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Trump and Macron Stress the Positive.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 18:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-and-emmanuel-macron-stress-the-positive-1499975445", "news_title": "Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron Stress the Positive", "keywords": " counterterrorism, paris climate accord,u.s.-france relations,Emmanuel Macron,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Justice Department said that it has recently charged more than 400 people, including 56 doctors, with committing health-care fraud that generated $1.3 billion in false billings.\u201cToo many trusted medical professionals like doctors, nurses and pharmacists have chosen to violate their oaths and put greed ahead of their patients,\u201d Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       said on Thursday at a news conference where he was joined by other top U.S. law-enforcement officials.\u201cThey seem oblivious to the disastrous consequences of their greed,\u201d the attorney general said.Justice Department officials said the charges were filed in the past few weeks, and the initiative was the \u201clargest health-care fraud takedown operation\u201d in U.S. history, Mr. Sessions said.New Hampshire Gov.

Mr. Macron has made Versailles itself an unusually frequent backdrop for his presidency, hosting recent talks there with Russian President Vladimir Putin and summoning lawmakers to the palace for a rare joint session of parliament.Mr. Macron\u2019s penchant for pomp and monarchical authority has surprised many supporters who hailed him upon his election in May as a champion of Western liberal democracy for defeating       Marine Le Pen       of the far-right National Front.Since then, however, the president has eschewed the consensus-seeking approach of his former boss and immediate predecessor,       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        who memorably described himself as a \u201cnormal\u201d president.Normalcy isn\u2019t Mr. Macron\u2019s style.\u201cHe has a lot of authority. He\u2019s perhaps authoritarian,\u201d said       Jean-Herv\u00e9 Lorenzi,        an adviser to previous governments who worked alongside Mr. Macron on the 2012 Hollande campaign.Mr. Macron has adopted what he once described as a \u201cJupiterian\u201d posture: remaining above the fray and unleashing an occasional thunderbolt to impose order.In an interview with business magazine Challenges in October, Mr. Macron said the presidency needed to embody \u201ca new form of democratic authority.\u201d\u201cFran\u00e7ois Hollande didn\u2019t believe in the Jupiterian president. He thought the president had become a figure like any other in the political and media firmament,\u201d Mr. Macron said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the \u2018normal\u2019 president.\u201dThe regal bearing isn\u2019t merely a question of style. In tackling what has long been the third rail of French politics, labor reform, Mr. Macron intends to make rare use of powers granted to his office under the French constitution.\u2018He believes that the country has had 30 years of debates, deliberations, discussions on what needs to be done and that the missing part is action.\u2019Instead of using the traditional route\u2014passing legislation through parliament\u2014Mr. Macron is seeking a mandate from the lower house to create new labor laws by presidential decree.\u201cHe believes that the country has had 30 years of debates, deliberations, discussions on what needs to be done and that the missing part is action,\u201d said       St\u00e9phane Boujnah,        CEO of the Euronext stock exchange.Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,        the far-left firebrand who leads an opposition group in parliament, accused Mr. Macron of \u201cPharaonic drift\u201d as he refused to attend his joint session of parliament in Versailles.\u201cWe are rebelling. We won\u2019t submit,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said.Still Mr. Macron is likely to get his way, officials say, because he commands a large majority of freshman parliamentarians whom he handpicked in founding his fledgling political party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche.On Thursday, the president warned an audience of military officers not to publicly cross him after a high-profile general reportedly told a parliament committee he would oppose the government\u2019s line on military spending.\u201cFor me it\u2019s undignified to wash dirty linen in public,\u201d Mr. Macron said, adding: \u201cI am your boss.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s approval ratings remain high, and some analysts think his authoritarian streak is effective in a country that has a long history of monarchs and strongmen, from Clovis, the first king of the Franks who ruled in the sixth century, to Gen.       Charles de Gaulle.\u201cHe\u2019s perfectly understood from the start that the French like quasi-royal power,\u201d Mr. Lorenzi said.Write to Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.com and Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 17:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmanuel-macron-takes-regal-approach-to-french-presidency-1499960731", "news_title": "Emmanuel Macron Takes Regal Approach to French Presidency", "keywords": " france labor laws,france politics, versailles,Emmanuel Macron,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump,        who is struggling to win congressional approval for his promised border wall with Mexico, now says that the project doesn\u2019t have to stretch along the entire southern border.\u201cIt\u2019s a 2,000 mile border, but you don\u2019t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday on Air Force One en route to Paris. \u201cYou have mountains.\u00a0You have some rivers that are violent and vicious.\u00a0You have some areas that are so far away that you don\u2019t really have people crossing.\u201dMr. Trump, who had previously suggested he wanted a wall that would run along the entire border, said the wall could be more modest. \u201cYou\u2019ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles,\u201d he said.It wasn\u2019t clear whether that estimate included the 654 miles of border that already have some sort of fencing on it. A White House spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request seeking clarification.The Customs and Border Protection Agency has said that about 130 miles of the border aren\u2019t appropriate for a wall due to lakes, mountains and other natural barriers.Mr. Trump also sought to take credit for the repairs and replacements already under way to existing fencing, which is far less controversial than building new barriers.\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve already started the wall because we\u2019re fixing large portions of wall right now,\u201d he said.The White House has requested\u00a0$1.6 billion for next fiscal year to pay for about 74 miles of new or replacement barriers. House Republicans included the funding in their Homeland Security spending bill, but the proposal faces a tough road in the Senate, where Democratic support is needed.Mr. Trump repeated his preference for a wall with solar panels attached, which is one of several proposals submitted for consideration by the Department of Homeland Security.He also acknowledged that a solid wall is a bad idea for border agents who want to see through to the other side. Existing barriers are fences, in part for this reason.\u201dYou have to be able to see through it,\u201d he said. He offered a scenario where someone surprises an agent by throwing a heavy sack of drugs over the wall and hits his head. \u201cAs crazy as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump campaigned on a vision of a towering, end-to-end wall and has insisted he will get it built. In modifying his preferences for the scope and the nature of the barrier, Mr. Trump brought his aims closer to the views expressed by experts at Homeland Security.Still, winning funding for even a portion of the more modest project will be challenging.On another controversial immigration issue, Mr. Trump said he was responsible for deciding the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which gives a reprieve from deportation to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.This week, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly met with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and at least one lawmaker reported that he said the so-called Dreamers program\u2019s fate would be decided by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. That worried them because Mr. Sessions opposes the program. Several states have threatened to sue the administration if it doesn\u2019t kill the program.Asked about this, Mr. Trump said the decision on the program\u2019s future was his.\u201cIt\u2019s a decision that I make, and it\u2019s a decision that\u2019s very, very hard to make,\u201d he said. \u201cI really understand the situation now.\u201dHe added that he would like a \u201ccomprehensive immigration plan,\u201d a phrase that generally refers to a combination of border security, changes to visa programs and legalization for undocumented residents. \u201cBut our country and political forces are not ready yet.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-13 17:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-his-mexico-border-wall-wont-need-to-cover-entire-distance-1499980551", "news_title": "Trump Says His Mexico Border Wall Won\u2019t Need to Cover Entire Distance ", "keywords": "donald trump,mexico border wall,us-mexico border wall,Department of Homeland Security,Customs and Border Protection Agency,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch"}, {"content": "Brooklyn isn\u2019t exactly synonymous with Monaco or even Daytona in the minds of car racing fans, but this weekend the borough will play host to a fleet of speedsters zipping around at up to 150 miles an hour.Except when these vehicles pull in for a pit stop, they won\u2019t be out of gas\u2014they\u2019ll be out of juice.The             Qualcomm                   New York City ePrix, running Saturday and Sunday at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook, will feature all electric cars that otherwise look almost exactly like the open-wheel variety that run in Formula One races.It will be the first race sanctioned by F1\u2019s governing body in New York City in modern history, and organizers say it will be a highlight of the three-year-old Formula E circuit. Formula E didn\u2019t discuss expenditures nor expected revenues from the event, but said they invested at least $20 million in staging the race.\u201cOur biggest dream when we started Formula E was to race in New York City,\u201d said       Alejandro Agag,        CEO of Formula E, which was started in 2014.The race aims to minimize its environmental footprint, and cars competing produce zero emissions, according to Formula E.

Mr. Draghi is expected to give further signs of the ECB\u2019s growing confidence in the eurozone economy and its reduced need for monetary stimulus, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.The latest bond-market gyration underscores investors\u2019 sensitivity to the global outlook for monetary policy. Large bond-buying programs from the ECB and Bank of Japan have helped drive global yields to historically low levels over the past few years. The risk for investors is that the value of their bonds could fall as central banks pivot toward reducing monetary stimulus.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.348%, compared with 2.325% Wednesday.

He expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise close to 2.75% at the end of this year.Worries about a pivot toward reduced monetary stimulus led to relatively tepid demand for a $12 billion sale of 30-year Treasury bonds on Thursday afternoon, some investors said. The bonds were sold at a yield of 2.936%, higher than 2.925% before the auction and a sign demand was weaker than dealers had anticipated.The Treasury bond market had stabilized earlier this week following a two-week selloff, rallying on Wednesday after Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen\u2019s       semiannual testimony to Congress bolstered market expectation that the Fed would be very slow in tightening monetary policy.Earlier Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.305%.The swing underlines how ultraloose monetary policy since the financial crisis has increased the linkage among bond markets in the developed world. Analysts say this factor means the Treasury bond market is vulnerable to any selloff in bunds or other bond markets.Mr. Draghi\u2019s hawkish comment on June 27 kicked off the recent global bond market rout. A day before his remark, the 10-year Treasury note settled at this year\u2019s low of 2.135%.\u201cWe think that longer-term interest rates now pivot more off of international rate policy, such as that stemming from the ECB and the BOJ, and not solely on what the Fed is doing,\u201d said       Rick Rieder,        chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.Some money managers say they don\u2019t expect a sustained rise in bond yields without inflation picking up speed.U.S. reports have showed inflation pressure slowed down with some indicators falling below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.

The Paris-based adviser to governments and companies raised its 2017 demand forecast by 100,000 barrels a day, compared with a previous estimate last month.Oil prices initially fell after the report, with investors focused on rising production in June from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which hit its highest level of the year at 32.6 million barrels a day. But there are signs that demand, growing faster than expected, will call for all of that oil and ease oversupply that has lingered for about three years, analysts said.Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled up 59 cents, or 1.3%, at $46.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 68 cents, or 1.4%, to $48.42 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Tuesday lowered its production forecast for 2018 to 9.9 million barrels a day, slightly down from around 10 million before.The IEA on Thursday also called the change in demand \u201ca dramatic acceleration.\u201d Demand accelerated in the second quarter, growing to 97.4 million barrels a day\u20141.5 million barrels a day faster than in the second quarter of 2016. It warned that while real-time data don\u2019t show this causing oil stockpiles to shrink, that may change as new data come in and it may turn out that in fact global inventories are shrinking.\u201cWe are seeing some signs out there that things are cleaning up,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. \u201cWorld oil demand is going to continue to grow.\u201dThe market has already been rising in part from falling stockpiles in the U.S. On Wednesday the EIA reported the 11th decline in U.S. crude stockpiles in just 13 weeks.

Production from those two countries, in particular, has surged in recent months, undermining the attempted cutbacks and helping to derail widespread predictions of a rally.OPEC members have considered new output caps on Nigeria and Libya.

The jump in emerging-market stocks and currencies after her slightly dovish comments on Wednesday means that after almost 10 years, investors who put $1,000 into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at the 2007 peak now have $1,000 again, before fees and taxes, assuming they reinvested their dividends.There are lessons here about central banks, emerging markets and, unexpectedly, technology stocks.The first is that markets are particularly prone to overinterpret central-bank comments, as investors worry that almost a decade of easy money is coming to an end.Comments by Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       and European Central Bank chief       Mario Draghi       in Sintra, Portugal, two weeks ago turned into a Sintra conspiracy theory of coordinated global tightening, helped along by the Bank of Canada and others. The market priced in higher interest rates even as inflation expectations fell.Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress on Wednesday suggested investors had made a mistake. Sure, the Bank of Canada had indeed turned hawkish, raising rates for the first time in seven years, but Ms. Yellen made clear the Fed would change course if recent weak inflation persists. If there is a global conspiracy for tighter money even in the absence of inflation, the Fed isn\u2019t part of it.The second lesson is that this matters for emerging markets. Many investors have been arguing that there will be no repeat of the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d that hit emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies when the Fed signaled it would soon end its stimulus. The thinking is emerging-market countries are better prepared this time. But if their currencies, bond prices and stocks rise when Ms. Yellen is a little bit dovish, that strongly suggests they will fall if she turns hawkish.A fall doesn\u2019t equate to a tantrum, but sensitivity is high. On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments prompted a 0.04 percentage-point drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, and a rise of about 1% in emerging-market local-currency bond prices, in dollar terms. If the link between the two stayed the same, and Treasury yields rose as they did in 2013, emerging-market bonds could repeat the 20%-plus drop of 2013.The third lesson is that the performance of tech stocks depends in part on the Fed, and in turn, is vital to emerging-market investors.Stories justifying tech companies are about disruption\u2014of media, retail, cars, or in the case of artificial intelligence, everything. But the Fed also matters, because tech firms are high-growth companies that ought to be able to increase profits even if the economy does little.Profits far in the future are worth more when interest rates are low, so tech stocks are more sensitive to rates than others. Equally, a weak economy\u2014one cause of low rates\u2014leaves a dearth of fast-growing companies, making tech stocks one of relatively few options for investors who want to chase growth. Bring back growth, and there is less need to pay up to hold expensive tech stocks.Tech stocks have performed wonderfully so far this year, with the sector leading the S&P 500, as hopes for a U.S. stimulus faded. The same was true Wednesday.Tech, in turn, matters to emerging markets, because the vision many have of these countries as poverty-stricken and backward isn\u2019t accurate\u2014at least as far as their main stock-market index goes.Technology is now the biggest sector in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and five tech companies alone make up 17% of its value. Three of those\u2014South Korea\u2019s             Samsung Electronics,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing                   and Taiwan\u2019s Hon Hai Precision Industries\u2014are in countries richer per capita than Italy, adjusted for purchasing-power parity.Four of the five big emerging-market tech companies are up more than 46% in dollar terms this year, with Alibaba, China\u2019s answer to             Amazon.com,       up 70% through Wednesday. Even laggard Taiwan Semi is up 23%. All suffer the same sensitivity to the economy and interest rates as America\u2019s tech giants, as they demonstrated after the U.S. election briefly brought rising bond yields and hopes of economic stimulus.Investors even in such apparently diverse areas as technology and emerging markets have little choice but to be Fed watchers. Emerging-market shareholders can reasonably hope that the next decade is more rewarding than the last, but they shouldn\u2019t rely on the Fed keeping the bears at bay.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Emerging Stocks, Tech and Yellen.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 17:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-stocks-emerging-markets-and-why-everyone-is-watching-janet-yellen-1499972508", "news_title": "Tech Stocks, Emerging Markets and Why Everyone Is Watching Janet Yellen ", "keywords": "10-year treasury yield,bank of canada,bank of england,bonds ,easy money,emerging markets,european central bank ,federal reserve,federal reserve chairman,investing,janet yellen,msci emerging index,stock market,technology stocks,tech stocks,Bank of Canada,S&P 500,European Central Bank,Janet Yellen,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,equity markets,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,commodity,financial market news,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary,banking,central banking,credit,financial services,technology"}, {"content": "New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       on Thursday issued a conditional veto of a bill requiring lawmakers to consider the racial impact of proposed criminal justice measures, saying he also wants them to consider whether such bills would deter crime in minority communities.If lawmakers accept the governor\u2019s recommendations, New Jersey would become the fourth state to require a racial impact statement for criminal justice bills, and the first to require an impact statement on public safety.\u201cI fully support any measure that will combat those disproportionate effects [on minority populations], seeking to ensure that New Jersey laws apply equally to all citizens,\u201d Mr. Christie said.But the former U.S. attorney added an unexpected request for \u201ca complete analysis to assess the broader public safety impact on the affected racial and ethnic communities and the impact of the measures on the victims and potential victims in those communities.\u201dThe novel demand marked a twist, partly because it is not clear how lawmakers would determine a bill\u2019s effect on public safety. Experts, advocates and lawmakers often differ strongly on whether a particular punishment or sentence would deter wrongdoing.African-Americans in New Jersey are incarcerated at 12 times the rate of whites, making the state\u2019s racial disparity the widest in the country, according to a report last year by the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that advocates reducing the prison population. Black communities in New Jersey and around the country have struggled as large numbers of African-Americans serve long mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses.Assemblyman Troy Singleton, a Democrat and sponsor of the bill, said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d by the conditional veto and plans to ask the governor\u2019s office to explain their rationale and proposed changes.\u201cThe only thing I can think of is that he\u2019s trying to say, \u2018We might have a tough law in the books, but has that made the community safer?\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cMy concern is that we\u2019ve seen some of the harsher penalties, like mandatory minimums, put in place that have exacerbated the racial disparity in our penal system but not necessarily curbed the violence in the communities where those victims or potential victims are.\u201dOne leading advocate for the bill,       Roseanne Scotti,        New Jersey state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, said she could support the revised legislation as long as the public safety analysis is not a \u201cknee-jerk response\u201d that assumes all penalties deter crime.\u201cThis is new territory, but we hope it will allow for a more robust conversation by legislators about criminal justice legislation,\u201d she said.The debate over crime and punishment is ramping up as U.S. Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       promotes more aggressive prosecution and sentencing to curb a recent uptick in violent crime. Critics question whether increased penalties improve public safety, and a recent analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts argues that there is no statistically significant link between drug offenders\u2019 imprisonment rates and the rates of illicit drug use, drug overdose deaths and drug arrests.In New Jersey, the racial impact bill received unanimous support in the Senate and drew only three no votes in the Assembly, quietly marking the latest victory for the bipartisan movement in state capitals to revamp criminal justice policies.Still, one opponent of the bill, Republican Assemblyman Parker Space, said racial impact statements could distort the operation of justice.\u201cThere is a reason that \u2018Justice\u2019 is depicted with a blindfold,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone murders or rapes or robs or commits fraud, we should not lessen the prosecution of such because it might, in theory, negatively impact perceptions about some arbitrarily drawn group.\u201dWrite to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com and Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 17:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chris-christie-adds-a-condition-to-bill-on-criminal-justice-and-race-1499979904", "news_title": "Chris Christie Adds a Condition to Bill on Criminal Justice and Race ", "keywords": " drug laws,racial impact,Chris Christie,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,ethnic minorities,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,social issues"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014Former President       Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,        Brazil\u2019s most popular politician, vowed Thursday to overturn his conviction for corruption, declaring his innocence and his intention to return as the leader of Latin America\u2019s biggest country in elections next year.Mr. da Silva was found guilty Wednesday of corruption and money laundering as part of Brazil\u2019s vast Car Wash graft investigation and was sentenced to 9\u00bd years in prison. He is allowed to remain free while he appeals the verdict.Speaking publicly for the first time after his conviction, the charismatic former metalworker turned working-class hero said the verdict against him is part of a plot to prevent him from being re-elected next year.\u201cThey want to take me out of the game,\u201d he said at a raucous press event in S\u00e3o Paulo that was also attended by crowds of chanting supporters. \u201cI\u2019m still in the game,\u201d he said, declaring openly for the first time his intention to run for his leftist Workers\u2019 Party in presidential elections in 2018.\u201cThe poor can no longer stand to be governed by the elite\u2014they need to be governed by someone who knows their soul, who knows what hunger and unemployment are and who knows how hard life is for the poor of this country,\u201d said Lula, as he is universally known. Mr. da Silva\u2019s speech, which ranged from jokes about football to teary-eyed accounts of his hardships, prompted cheers of approval.Sergio Moro,        the crusading judge heading the Car Wash probe, on Wednesday found Mr. da Silva guilty of corruption following charges he received a luxury beachside apartment from construction group OAS in exchange for securing contracts with state-owned oil company             Petrobras.The ruling, the highest-profile sentence yet in the Car Wash case, is the first verdict to emerge from five graft-related indictments against Mr. da Silva, who has long denied wrongdoing. Mr. Moro has said the investigation of Mr. da Silva and other politicians isn\u2019t political, but based on evidence.Left-wing politicians across Brazil and the rest of Latin America took to social media to express support for the 71-year-old former president.Bolivian President Evo Morales called the sentence \u201ca judicial coup against Brother Lula\u201d on Twitter. Former Brazilian President       Dilma Rousseff,        Mr. da Silva\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e who was impeached for budget-related irregularities last year, said her mentor\u2019s conviction was a \u201cflagrant injustice and judicial absurdity\u2026that profoundly damages democracy.\u201dBrazil\u2019s Socialism and Liberty Party and the Brazilian Communist Party joined together to attack Mr. Moro and his verdict.While groups of Brazilians donned the country\u2019s national yellow-and-green colors and gathered across several cities Wednesday night to celebrate the conviction, Mr. da Silva\u2019s backers also staged protests against the move.\u201cLula represents the poor and workers, and they want to prevent him any way they can from being a candidate next year,\u201d said       Mateus Santos,        35 years old, an information-technology worker, at a street demonstration.Mr. da Silva left office in 2011 with approval ratings above 80% and has polled in recent months as a favorite for next year\u2019s elections. Much of Brazil\u2019s political establishment has been tarnished by corruption scandals, and there are few other obvious presidential candidates besides him, especially on the left.The Workers\u2019 Party has long said it has no \u201cPlan B\u201d for winning in 2018 other than with its founder Mr. da Silva as candidate.If Mr. da Silva loses his appeal against the conviction\u2014a process that could take up to a year\u2014he would be expected to go to prison and be barred from public office.Wednesday\u2019s conviction deepened Brazil\u2019s political turmoil as the country\u2019s current president,       Michel Temer,        fights for political survival after he was also charged with corruption in the Car Wash case.A congressional committee on Thursday voted against putting Mr. Temer on trial in the country\u2019s Federal Supreme Court on corruption charges. However, it is still up to the full lower house to make a final decision on whether to authorize a trial. Congress will hold the vote on Aug. 2.If the chamber votes to permit the trial and the Supreme Court agrees to go ahead, the president would be removed from office for up to six months, possibly giving Brazil its third president in less than two years.Write to Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

But however much data the social-media giant is now collecting on its two billion active monthly users, it\u2019s evidently not enough for founder and CEO       Mark Zuckerberg.       So he\u2019s opted for a rather less efficient method of gathering information. The Journal\u2019s Reid Epstein and Deepa Seetharaman report:For his journey, the Facebook CEO has opted for particular privacy settings. The Journal reports that \u201cthere are rules to abide by if you are an ordinary person about to meet an extraordinary entrepreneur\u201d and notes that these rules include:Veteran political staffers do advance work and manage Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s visits to average Americans. His travels are chronicled on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own Facebook page, which features selected lessons from the people he meets, along with Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own leftist political messages. And as Bloomberg reported in January, the creation of a Zuckerberg Facebook post is not a task for amateurs:Consumers might be tempted to say it\u2019s not fair that Mr. Zuckerberg gets to exercise such control over information about himself\u2014and about them too. But it\u2019s important to remember that these are voluntary arrangements. Consumers have freely traded information about themselves in return for use of the remarkable communications tool that Mr. Zuckerberg has built. And nobody is required to read Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s dispatches from the prairie.It\u2019s fair to ask, especially given the manufacturing process that yields his public communications, whether Mr. Zuckerberg is engaged in a sincere attempt to gain a deeper understanding of Middle America or simply wants to be photographed doing so. Here\u2019s an excerpt of a post from earlier this week:Will Mr. Zuckerberg ever adopt a more nuanced view of climate change? It\u2019s hard to say, but at least he seems more willing to visit and listen to the people in flyover states than many leaders of the modern Democratic Party and he\u2019s not even asking for votes\u2014at least not yet. The Journal recounts his visit with Dan Moore of Newton Falls, Ohio:At least according to his Facebook page, Mr. Zuckerberg seems to be one coastal elitist who respects people who don\u2019t share his views. Now he can prove it by demonstrating that Facebook\u2019s burgeoning effort to combat fake news is not devolving into censorship of opinions that don\u2019t match his own.***Bottom Stories of the DayDon\u2019t Blame Zuck  \u201cThe Myth of Technological Unemployment,\u201d Reason, July 11Who\u2019s Colludin\u2019 With Who?  \u201cDOJ let Russian lawyer into US before she met with Trump team,\u201d The Hill, July 12News You Can Use  \u201cHow to work side hustles so you don\u2019t lose your day job,\u201d CNBC, July 12News You Could Have Used  \u201cI moved out of Illinois just in time,\u201d             Chicago Tribune,July 11Longest Books Ever Written  \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With Illinois?,\u201d The Wall Street Journal, July 11Everything Is Seemingly Spinning Out of Control  \u201cIt\u2019s summer, and Washington smells like weed.

And among British businesses, there is growing anxiety over the absence of a clear vision of the government \u2018s desired future trade and economic relationship with the European Union.Britain\u2019s Brexit Secretary       David Davis       was at his most serene this week when he spoke to Parliament. Yes, the U.K. can get a preferential trade deal and customs arrangement concluded before it leaves the EU in March 2019, he said.He acknowledged that there might need to be a transition or implementation phase after Brexit day but that, he said, would be mostly to give the French, Dutch and Belgian customs time to get their procedures in place.Mr. Davis gave no sign that he was taking seriously what his negotiating partners have been saying: Such a trade and customs arrangement is impossible to negotiate in that time frame, even though some broad principles about the future relationship may be agreed.Fabian Zuleeg,        chief executive of the Brussels-based European Policy Center think tank, says agreement on an interim arrangement is possible. But regarding a long-term trade deal, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll agree anything in the two years.\u201dIt isn\u2019t clear either how closely Mr. Davis listened to what businesses were telling him last week when he met them at the government\u2019s country retreat. The Confederation of British Industry, for example, spelled out that it wants a multi-year transition\u2014with the U.K. ideally remaining in the EU\u2019s single market and customs union\u2014to avoid a cliff edge 21 months from now.But while they are sympathetic to an implementation phase of some sort, British ministers are currently ruling out those two options even as an interim step, remaining true to the unyielding vision of Brexit set out by Prime Minister       Theresa May       before the election in June. There have been some signs of a softening of language since last month\u2019s election, but the official government line remains unchanged. If that position holds, trade friction at the U.K.\u2019s borders will rise sharply and quite soon.Britain\u2019s customs and revenue service estimates that it will have to handle as many as 255 million customs declarations annually from March 2019, compared with 55 million now. There is a risk, the U.K.\u2019s National Audit Office said Thursday, that the agency\u2019s computer systems won\u2019t be able to cope.Pulling out of the customs union in March 2019 would increase the urgency of some other unresolved questions, such as how to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland, which will become the site of a new external EU border.Citing their planning horizons, businesses say they need to know the nature of a transitional deal soon; otherwise they will be compelled to make investment choices on a worst-case basis. Settling on the nature of a transition deal late in 2018, they stress, would be too late.The government apparently hasn\u2019t abandoned a hope expressed in its Brexit policy paper in May: that a \u201ccomprehensive, bold and ambitious\u201d post-Brexit free-trade agreement \u201cmay take in elements of current Single Market arrangements in certain areas.\u201dMany EU officials and politicians say the British government is delusional to suggest that the U.K. could preserve its membership in the single market in some business sectors\u2014say automobiles and banking\u2014and abandon it in other areas it considers less appealing. From their standpoint, it is this \u201ccherry- picking\u201d approach that most sticks in their craw.While such arrangements might benefit some in the EU, like the German car industry, they would undermine the bloc, these officials and politicians say. Their greater strategic imperative is the coherence and unity of the EU and its single market.\u201cFrom an EU perspective, there is not going to be any give on this. Politically, economically and legally, there are too many reasons not to do it,\u201d Mr. Zuleeg said.If the U.K. persists with this approach, EU unity will be tested. After all, the U.K. can point to Norway and Switzerland, both with different relationships to the EU, as countries that are inside some but not all parts of the single market.From a negotiating standpoint, it will be a while before the U.K. has to declare its approach. The EU won\u2019t move on to questions of future relations until it is satisfied with progress on citizens\u2019 rights, the financial divorce settlement and Ireland. The next stage of the negotiations on these issues starts on Monday. In the best case, talks about the future will start in November.For the moment, ministers\u2019 statements should probably be interpreted as a mixture of substance, negotiating tactics and playing to the domestic political gallery. However, the longer the U.K. and the EU appear to be on a collision course over their future relations, the more nervous many business leaders will become\u2014and the more investment decisions will be put on hold.", "news_time": "2017-07-13 16:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-apparent-serenity-on-brexit-leaves-brussels-perplexed-1499978475", "news_title": "U.K.\u2019s Apparent Serenity on Brexit Leaves Brussels Perplexed", "keywords": "brexit, brexit talks,u.k.-eu relations,European Union,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "To put it politely, American food television is a freak show. The recipe, generally, calls for equal parts humiliation, morbid fascination and cruelty, as well as a dash of disgust: A Food Network show picked at random off Hulu this week featured the beleaguered contestants making \u201cHawaiian\u201d cupcakes, using suckling pig and kimchi. It\u2019s enough to make you question the meaning of life. Or statehood, if you happen to be Hawaii.Dessert GamesMondays, 8 p.m., Food NetworkTexas Cake House, season 2Mondays, 9 and 9:30 p.m., Food NetworkThe Great British Baking Show, season 4Fridays, 9 p.m., PBSThat show was hardly an aberration in a pan-medium culinary sideshow that features the fulminating       Gordon Ramsay,        the indignities of \u201cChopped,\u201d and the poodle-headed Guy Fieri doing what has now become a years-long gluttony tour of America. Mr. Fieri is, in fact, the power behind \u201cDessert Games,\u201d the latest victual-reality show from Food Network and a spinoff of his own \u201cGuy\u2019s Grocery Games.\u201d The participants on Monday\u2019s debut were assigned to use the inventory of the show\u2019s \u201csupermarket\u201d to make \u201ctricked out\u201d ice-cream sandwiches. The mandatory ingredient: pork rinds. Yes, there are virtues to marrying the salty to the sweet. But not this.Another recent Food Network addition is \u201cTexas Cake House,\u201d which is certainly a genial show, though it appears to have been edited by a 6-year-old who ate too many Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs. Its thesis doesn\u2019t seem very elastic, or even intended for foodies: Hosts Natalie and       Dave Sideserf       of Austin\u2019s Sideserf Cake Studio produce fantastical, hyper-realistic creations that do look like dogs. Or severed heads. Or a T-bone steak in the shape of Texas. (Yum?) For this week\u2019s episode, they were commissioned by an environmental kids group to make a cricket-themed cake using cricket flour. (I\u2019ve had French-fried crickets. They\u2019re nutty.) The results looked like Jiminy Cricket as rendered by Piet Mondrian. Also, they took a gig at a fundraiser for the San Antonio Zoo\u2019s jaguar habitat, with the proviso that no guest would cut into anything resembling a jaguar.Viewers may have expected an ingenious solution to the Jaguar Paradox. But the Sideserfs just made a cat-shaped confection anyway. I was confused, and less than entertained, even as a person devoted to food: \u201cTexas Cake House\u201d isn\u2019t about anything an audience will actually be able to try at home, or even eat. So it\u2019s more about architecture than cooking. And about as appetizing as \u201cThis Old House.\u201dThe Food Network shows seem to be a response to what is really the best of current food TV, \u201cThe Great British Baking Show,\u201d which has achieved its supremacy, and popularity, for some very specific reasons. An obsession in Britain, the show is also, alas, a competition. But a competition provides narrative, and over the 10 weeks of each season a viewer becomes invested in the fate of what\u2019s always a gang of highly accomplished bakers. There\u2019s also a kindness to the program and the people, who can often be spotted helping one another get through whatever dampfnudel crisis they\u2019re in, and enjoying what seems to be genuine camaraderie.\u201cGBBS\u201d is now about halfway through a watershed season: When it concluded in the U.K., the show moved from the BBC to Channel 4 and as a result lost three of its principals, including the elegant       Mary Berry,        who provided the perfect counterpoint to co-host and master baker       Paul Hollywood,        who has more than a hint of Guy Fieri about him. PBS is committed to showing a fifth season of what aired on the BBC (three earlier seasons aired in the U.K. but have not been seen here). While it does seem predictable that a TV critic would prefer a British program and that PBS would run it, there\u2019s nothing plummy about \u201cGBBS,\u201d not even plums. The competitors come from all walks of life, from homemakers to building contractors to aerospace engineers. They represent a diversity of ethnicities, races and cultures, and, perhaps more significantly, ages: Some of the most fiendishly talented bakers have been older Englishwomen who\u2019ve been working these recipes for decades. They don\u2019t need to be told what a Victoria Sandwich is supposed to look like. They might have one in their purse.\u201cGBBS\u201d also gives the term \u201camateur\u201d its due: No contestant is a professional baker, but they love to bake. And while they may not always turn out perfectly constructed Bakewell Tarts or choux buns religieuse, they are out to achieve the culinary sublime, the best that humans have accomplished with wheat, heat, butter and eggs (and sugar). The measurements on \u201cGBBS\u201d are in metric and Celsius.

It also has an almost desperate desire to recycle sophomoric sitcom tropes, as well as an apparent obliviousness to its own racial subtext. Correction: sub-subtext.The subtext involves the compromises of approaching middle age. Ethan (Mr. Key) is a literary star without commercial success who lunges at the suggestion of his agent (Mr. Savage) to write young-adult fiction. Ethan\u2019s wife, Lisa (Ms. Smulders), has just abandoned civil-rights law for a corporate firm where the culture makes \u201cEntourage\u201d seem like a Trappist monastery. Sam (Ms. Parisse) is in a brittle marriage, ameliorated by the fact that she\u2019s been waging a 20-year affair with Ethan, which doesn\u2019t say much for Lisa\u2019s powers of observation. Nick (      Nat Faxon      ) is pointlessly rich and promiscuous. Marianne (Ms. Park) has some stalled-out theatrical dreams.As the de facto center of the show, Mr. Key is giving a weirdly exaggerated, goofy performance that may be intended to reflect Ethan\u2019s inner conflict: The lone black friend in a group of Harvard grads, he seems never to have recovered from the shock of acceptance.

That is partly because some advertisers\u2014concerned over issues in digital advertising such as ad fraud, the viewability of ads, and risks for brands that appear adjacent to objectionable content\u2014moved money back into television, they say.The positive momentum was also fueled by advertisers who have decided to make ad commitments early this year instead of waiting for the \u201cscatter market,\u201d when ad time is bought closer to air date, according to analysts and ad buyers.\u201cThe increase in total dollars is a combination of effectively selling digital and part of the scatter budgets being pulled forward into the upfront,\u201d said John Janedis at Jefferies, who earlier this year had predicted that the overall volume of ad dollars being committed during the upfront this year would be down.Mr. Janedis added that the prime-time volume gains were largely driven by NBC.

Morning news programming benefited from consumer packaged good companies that committed more ad dollars this year and were seeking cheaper inventory.To be sure, the upfront ad-selling season is full of murky math\u2014ad buyers and network executives offer their best spin on negotiations\u2014and success at the upfronts doesn\u2019t necessary translate into long-term financial gains.Moreover, advertisers have the ability to cancel a portion of their upfront commitments during the course of the year. And it\u2019s impossible to tell whether advertisers with bigger upfront commitments are increasing overall spending for the year or simply shifting spending they would have done in the scatter market.\u201cWe caution over-reading into\u201d upfront numbers because \u201cnegotiated volumes in upfronts do not necessarily turn into actual revenues,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cWe can note that last broadcast year\u2019s prime time volumes grew by approximately +6%, and yet it seems likely total revenues for owners of national TV properties are set to be flat or slightly down during the 2016-17 season,\u201d he said in a note to investors.Despite the upbeat outcome, don\u2019t expect too much celebrating. The television business continues to be under enormous pressure, with ratings trending down and consumers increasingly gravitating to ad-free video services offered by the likes of             Netflix                   and Amazon.Despite its many issues, online advertising continues to grow.Digital ad spending reached $71.6 billion in the U.S. last year, overtaking for the first time TV spending, which totaled $71.2 billion (excluding outlays on TV programming that runs online), according to estimates from eMarketer.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/broadcast-tv-enjoys-upfront-lift-but-long-term-gains-uncertain-1499976050", "news_title": "Broadcast TV Enjoys \u2018Upfront\u2019 Lift, but Long-Term Gains Uncertain", "keywords": "Comcast,CMCSA,Jefferies,21st Century Fox,FOX,FOXA,CBS,CBSA,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,television,radio,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,digital marketing,audiovisual production,cinema film production,broadcasting,television broadcasting,cable broadcasting,public relations,business,consumer services,financial services,investing,securities,media"}, {"content": "IZHEVSK, Russia\u2014Russian arms manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern once had America in its sights: The iconic rifle designer\u00a0aimed to open a U.S. production facility to meet demand in the world\u2019s largest civilian gun market.Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against the company in 2014 ended those plans. But after a quick pivot, sales are booming as the company looks to governments in Asia, Africa and elsewhere that want to upgrade their militaries\u2019 equipment\u00a0at an affordable price and seal closer ties with the Kremlin.\u201cThe sanctions turned a civilian-focused company into a military one,\u201d said Alexey Krivoruchko, chief executive of\u00a0Kalashnikov\u00a0Concern.Revenues at Kalashnikov more than doubled last year to the equivalent of $300 million and are forecast to increase a further twofold this year.Kalashnikov no longer produces its renowned AK-47\u2014the rugged assault rifle that became the symbol of the global reach of the Soviet Union\u2019s arms industry\u2014but executives and analysts say its latest assault rifles retain the same selling points: simplicity and reliability even in the most unforgiving environments, and at a cheaper price than competitors.The company, which also offers a variety of hunting and sporting weapons, is expanding: it recently acquired a drone manufacturer and a shipbuilder.The company\u2019s turnaround represents a rare bright spot in Russia\u2019s stagnant economy, which remains dominated by the state a quarter-century after the fall of the Soviet Union. Over a decade and a half in power, Russian President       Vladimir Putin       has promoted a brand of state-led capitalism that has strengthened the Kremlin\u2019s sway over key sectors of the economy.In a first for Russia\u2019s tightly controlled arms industry, Kalashnikov was revived by a partnership of state and private investors that invested around 12 billion rubles over the last three years.Five years ago, the factory in Izhevsk was all but shot. Creditors were circling; orders had dried up; workers toiled on Soviet-era machines under a leaking roof.The investors installed new managers who overhauled equipment and working practices, increasing staff to 7,000 from 4,000 and are hiring hundreds more to keep production going around the clock to meet demand.\u201cProcesses had degraded: There was old technology, old equipment, and poor results,\u201d said Dmitry Tarasov, managing director of Kalashnikov Concern. \u201cNew machines, new processes appeared; structures were simplified; we digitized, we cut down on paper bureaucracy.\u201dThe owners of\u00a0Kalashnikov\u2014Mr. Krivoruchko and two other businessmen, along with state-holding company Rostec\u2014say their partnership gives the company the best of both worlds: private investment and management focused on efficiency and profit combined with the stability of a state interest in a strategic industry.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that they succeeded in turning the company around, given the situation it was in,\u201d said Ruslan Pukhov of Moscow-based defense think tank CAST.The new investors at\u00a0Kalashnikov\u00a0also have benefited from ties to the Kremlin, analysts say.Sergei Chemezov,        the Rostec chief, has known Mr. Putin since he worked for the KGB in Dresden, Germany. Andrei Bokarev, one of Mr. Krivoruchko\u2019s partners, is a personal acquaintance of Defense Minister       Sergei Shoigu,        according to analysts. Mr. Putin in April called Mr. Bokarev a \u201cdiligent Russian entrepreneur.\u201dThose benefits have come in the form of access to loans and acquisitions that have helped\u00a0Kalashnikov\u00a0move into drone production though the purchase of Zala, a Izhevsk-based maker of small unmanned aerial vehicles, analysts said. Mr. Putin has visited the plant twice in the last year and praised the turnaround, saying it was on a \u201ccompletely new level.\u201d He presented Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi with a\u00a0Kalashnikov\u00a0rifle in 2015.The town of Izhevsk, which lies 600 miles east of Moscow, has been at the heart of the country\u2019s weapons industry since it started manufacturing arms for the war against Napoleon at the start of the 19th century. In the Soviet era, it pumped out millions of AK-47s, which became a symbol of revolutionary and insurgent movements around the globe.The AK-47 also became emblematic of the deadly proliferation of small arms. After the Cold War, cheap Kalashnikov variants from Communist bloc countries flooded Third World markets. The easy-to-operate rifle became as popular in the hands of ragtag militias and child soldiers as among regular armies.The breakup of the U.S.S.R. in 1991 also hit the Kalashnikov company hard, as state orders and investment halted. By the start of the 2010s, the company appeared headed toward insolvency; four CEOs had come and gone in as many years.Rostec set about restructuring the business in 2011. A 49% stake in the heavily indebted company was sold to Mr. Krivoruchko and his partner in 2014 for 1.3 billion rubles, or $36 million, along with a pledge to invest millions more to turn the company around.Mr. Krivoruchko, 41 years old, became chief executive and hired a new team of managers to oversee the overhaul of equipment and management.They upgraded the factory, buying new machinery and cutting the length of the assembly line to increase efficiency. Thirty Soviet-era machines used to cut weapons parts were replaced by one laser cutting machine. Internal communications are now all digital: For example, problems with equipment are reported via computer terminals and smartphones rather than paper memos.\u201cIn many companies, it was done decades ago,\u201c said Mr. Krivoruchko. \u201dIt\u2019s a basic thing.\"But within months, the company\u2019s strategy was upended, when the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Kalashnkov in response to Russia\u2019s military interventions in Ukraine.Kalashnikov\u00a0shifted quickly, abandoning plans to open a production facility in the U.S., its main export market, and accelerating efforts to attract new clients in Asia, where governments are looking to arm their militaries with new equipment at prices lower than many Western competitors.Mr. Krivoruchko is tight-lipped about client states, but analysts say\u00a0Kalashnikov\u00a0is looking at the possibility of establishing a production plant in India and the company is pushing its AK-103 for a tender in Pakistan.Simplicity of design is a selling point for some militaries. But Russian arms analyst Mikhail Degtyarev said\u00a0Kalashnikov\u00a0remains a solid second-tier firm in the high-tech world of arms manufacturing.\u201cThe technology works, but it\u2019s not cutting edge,\u201d he said, adding the company it competes in Southeast Asia and Africa with companies such as Poland\u2019s Fabryka Broni Lucznik-Radom, Belgium\u2019s FN Herstal and Germany\u2019s             Heckler & Koch                   GmbH, all of which have offerings at a similar price and level of technology.Write to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com and Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Kalashnikov Finds Success Without U.S..'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 15:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kalashnikov-finds-success-even-after-u-s-sanctions-1499943603", "news_title": "Kalashnikov Finds Success Even After U.S. Sanctions", "keywords": "ak-47,assault rifle,russian arms,weapons,FN Herstal,Heckler & Koch Beteiligungs,MLHK.FR,FR:MLHK,Kalashnikov Concern,Sergei Shoigu,Sergei Chemezov,Andrei Bokarev,Dmitry Tarasov,Mikhail Degtyarev,Ruslan Pukhov,Alexey Krivoruchko,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,economic performance,indicators,industrial production,economic news,ammunition (except small arms),aerospace products,parts,military aircraft,aerospace,defense,ammunition,defense equipment,products,industrial goods,drones"}, {"content": "Nearly half a billion dollars is out the door at       David Einhorn\u2019s       hedge fund.Mr. Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital Inc. hedge fund was forced to pay back more than $400 million in clients\u2019 withdrawals at midyear, as more than 15% of eligible investors chose to cash out, people close to the firm said. Greenlight, a U.S.-stock specialist, was down 2% in the first half of the year, while the S&P 500 gained 9%, including dividends.A fixture at investment conferences, Mr. Einhorn made his name during the financial crisis with an aggressive call against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. just before the bank\u2019s collapse. He is the latest of that era\u2019s hedge-fund stars to be humbled, following struggles for the closely-followed hedge-fund traders       John Paulson       and Kyle Bass, who bet against subprime housing.Hedge-fund managers salivated earlier this year at President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election, hoping for new bouts of unpredictability in the markets. Instead, volatility is holding at longtime lows as investors shrug off political headlines and bid up stocks ever higher. The hedge-fund industry recorded a record six consecutive quarters of investor outflows, according to researcher HFR.Mr. Einhorn, 48 years old, is among the most well-known hedge-fund managers, attracting attention not just for his investment ideas, but for a flamboyant streak in pitching them. His 2011 presentation against Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. was titled \u201cGAAP-uccino.\u201dMr. Einhorn has repeatedly predicted a yet-unrealized swoon for highflying technology companies such as             Tesla Inc.\u201cMost of his successful calls have been on the short side, and it\u2019s been really difficult to make money there in this environment,\u201d said hedge-fund investor Ketu Desai of i-squared Wealth Management.Lately, Greenlight has also found itself the target.             General Motors Co.       fought back furiously against the firm\u2019s push to split its stock, and shareholders sided overwhelmingly with the auto maker. Firmwide, Greenlight manages around $7 billion, down from $10 billion in 2014.Greenlight is just two years removed from its worst year ever, with double-digit losses in 2015 that led Mr. Einhorn to confess at the next annual investor dinner that he had \u201cfailed miserably.\u201dMr. Einhorn isn\u2019t alone, as hedge funds of all stripes are under sustained pressure.Some other high-profile funds, such as\u00a0Eton Park Capital Management, have shut down. Many of those that remain are lowering their legendarily high fees to appease disappointed backers or retooling their strategies to be more similar to mutual funds or private-equity managersMr. Einhorn\u2019s representatives have told investors that the billionaire plans to continue his longstanding practice of seizing on perceived mispricing in stocks.He has declined requests from backers to alter his relatively high fees. Greenlight collects a performance fee even when it hasn\u2019t made back its historical losses, a rare practice in the industry.The fund made back some of its losses last year but slipped again in 2017. Some of the firm\u2019s short positions, or wagers against, in-vogue stocks such as             Netflix Inc.       that Mr. Einhorn labeled a \u201cbubble basket\u201d have backfired as the stocks continued to climb, investors said. Meanwhile Greenlight\u2019s portfolio includes a relatively low proportion of bets on rising stocks overall, making it a laggard as U.S. stocks recorded their strongest first half since 2013.The average stock picking hedge fund was up 6% in the first half, HFR says.Mr. Einhorn is also in the midst of a divorce, traditionally a sore point for hedge-fund investors wary of any distractions for their highly paid managers. Some hedge-fund investors have automatic policies to withdraw from managers undergoing divorce.Greenlight has relatively strict withdrawal rules, protecting it from an outright run on the firm at any given point. Only half its investors are allowed to take out money at midyear, while the remainder are permitted at year-end. The fund also has substantial long-term ballast from Mr. Einhorn\u2019s personal fortune, an arm that farms out money to other hedge-fund managers, and a reinsurance vehicle that feeds permanent capital to the main fund.The fund has been closed to new investment since late 2014, people familiar with the matter said.A prodigious card player who once finished third at the World Series of Poker, Mr. Einhorn was in Las Vegas earlier this week for this year\u2019s tournament. He was knocked out early.\u201cWhen you jam and lose, you go look for dinner and think about the offseason,\u201d he wrote on his Twitter account\u00a0Monday.Write to Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 15:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-einhorns-hedge-fund-sheds-more-than-400-million-in-investor-outflows-1499949302", "news_title": "David Einhorn\u2019s Hedge Fund Sheds More Than $400 Million in Investor Outflows", "keywords": " david einhorn, fund redemptions,greenlight capital, hedge fund, investor outflows,Greenlight Capital,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,Lehman Brothers Holdings,David Einhorn,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,credit,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "YOU CAN TELL a lot about how my life is going from the pie crusts I make.

Just follow the steps below.Go ahead and play with strip width and spacing: Wider strips are sturdier and easier to work with; lattice tops run the gamut from a mere two or three strips in each direction to intricate weaves of 12-15.The venting that the lattice provides allows a moist fruit filling to cook without sogging the crust with steam, so summer\u2014when plums, nectarines, apricots and berries are running riot\u2014is prime season for this sort of pie. The recipe at right makes a filling of nothing more than peaches and a sprinkling of sugar. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature, with vanilla ice cream or a pitcher of heavy cream, and know that life doesn\u2019t get much better.1. Use pastry wheel, pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut rolled-out pie crust into \u00bd- to \u00be-inch-wide-strips.2. One at a time, gently lay dough strips down on top of filled pie crust, weaving them over and under one another.3. Continue weaving strips of dough until you cover pie with an overlapping lattice pattern.4. Trim ends of strips flush with edge of bottom crust. Fold edge of bottom crust over edge of lattice and crimp to secure.Mix \u2153 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar with a large pinch of salt. Line a 10-inch pie pan with 1 rolled-out pie crust about 14 inches in diameter, pressing it gently into sides and bottom of the pan. Trim dough with a small knife or scissors, leaving \u00bd-\u00be inch extending beyond pan\u2019s edge. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar mixture evenly over dough and refrigerate until ready to use. // Preheat oven to 425 degrees with rack set in center position. Slice 10 large peaches (optionally peeled) into 8-10 wedges each and discard pits. Arrange peaches evenly in sugared pie shell. Sprinkle with all but 2 tablespoons of remaining sugar mixture. Follow illustrated steps at left to weave a dough lattice over peaches, trim and crimp. Evenly sprinkle remaining sugar mixture over lattice. // Place pie on a baking sheet and place in oven. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees and bake until crust is deep gold and fruit juices are bubbling, 45-60 minutes. If crust is dark before peaches are tender, lay a piece of aluminum foil lightly over pie for remainder of baking. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.", "news_time": "2017-07-13 15:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-make-a-lattice-top-pie-as-easy-as-you-want-it-to-be-1499974087", "news_title": "How to Make a Lattice-Top Pie: As Easy As You Want It to Be", "keywords": "best pie crust recipe,fruit pie recipe,how to make a lattice pie,illustrated step by step pie crust,lattice pie video,pie crust video,simple peach pie recipe,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,recipes,routine general news"}, {"content": "In the wake of       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       stunning electoral victories, many in Europe believe they have found in France the defensive strategy they need to fight back against the onslaught of nationalist populism sweeping across the Continent. It\u2019s not so simple.The core of this strategy is an enormous concentration of power in a charismatic leader willing to move beyond the traditional Left-Right opposition and incorporate elements from both in an embrace of economic liberalization and European integration. The theory is that voters crave strong leaders who can steamroll opposition; if the mainstream can\u2019t provide this sort of leadership, the fringe movements on the left or right will.On constitutional reforms, Mr. Macron proposes to diminish the influence of Parliament by introducing an element of proportional representation into the National Assembly. This would weaken the institution by fragmenting the opposition without giving it real powers. It\u2019s more a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy than a genuine effort to bolster democracy, and it opens up the country for the president to rule by decree.There are, however, good reasons to believe that the Macron model will be difficult to export and may end up exacerbating the very problems it is meant to solve.First, this strategy is dependent upon the peculiarities of the French electoral system. Mr. Macron and his party only won around 24% of the vote during the first round of presidential elections, and around 30% during the first round of the Parliamentary election. Factoring in the high rate of abstention in both cases, that\u2019s consistently less than 20% of the electorate. Even with that meager level of popular support, Mr. Macron was able to secure complete control over the country\u2019s executive branch and an absolute majority in Parliament.Experience elsewhere shows mainstream parties and candidates require broader support to win power. In Britain, the Labour party won more than 40% of the vote in June\u2019s election and yet fell short of the Conservatives in parliamentary seats. In Spain, a vote percentage similar to Mr. Macron\u2019s for the Socialist party has triggered a profound crisis for the party.By electing Mr. Macron, the French electoral system is doing exactly what it was designed by       Charles de Gaulle       to do: buying strong leadership at the expense of democratic representation and removing conflict from governing institutions in the name of national unity. This strategy of concentration may have been effective when French politics was characterized by strong ideological conflict and resilient political parties. Faced with the inefficiencies and indecisiveness of the Fourth Republic, strong leadership was widely held to be necessary to break the logjams of ideological polarization.Today, however, both ideologies and parties are in crisis. Trust in the old mainstream parties has plummeted. Membership is declining, and both the Socialist and center-right Republican parties appear ideologically confused.That leaves them increasingly dependent on mechanisms such as state funding to hobble along on the strength of the party structures they built in better times. The parties have a structure\u2014officers and offices, bank accounts, funding, and a certain cachet in the media. But they lack a clear ideological point in terms of either a fully formed governing program or supporters on whose behalf to advance that program.As a result, Mr. Macron now faces the prospect of virtually unimpeded government. While this might sound appealing both to him and to other mainstream politicians across Europe, it\u2019s a major risk for both France and its new president.If there is one consistent result across all the recent elections throughout Europe, it\u2019s the increasing volatility and fragmentation of the electorate. In the face of such a landscape, a leadership that aims to unite everyone behind a single, overwhelmingly popular leader such as Mr. Macron means that certain social groups and interests will inevitably be left out. Simmering social conflicts will be exacerbated.Without adequate expression at the institutional level, these tensions are bound to be transferred into opposition against the institutions themselves. Antiestablishment populism thrives when there is a lack of open, institutional and adversarial politics. Democratic representation isn\u2019t just a matter of high-minded principle. It\u2019s an effective way to contain and manage social conflict. As       Friedrich Engels       famously put it, it serves to \u201cconvert stones into paper ballots.\u201dA unilateral or insufficiently representative leadership is often too rigid to adapt to a changing political environment and is therefore bound to foster antidemocratic opposition. Dialogue and conflict with a thriving opposition, in contrast, can benefit majorities by making them more responsive and reactive.Effective government requires a strong opposition. For this, fair, democratic representation and conflict are pragmatically useful. By channeling political opposition into the governmental process, majorities can correct and adjust their positions. The decision-making process may be messier and lengthier as a result, but the outcomes will be more legitimate, credible and widely appealing.Instead of fantasizing about a decisive yet establishment-friendly leadership to stem the tide of nationalist populism, Europe ought to foster fair, democratic representation and vigorous institutionalized opposition.Mr. Invernizzi-Accetti is an assistant professor at the City University of New York.

Williams set out to serve the ball as hard as she could, as many times as she could. Williams repeatedly dared Konta to return her 115 mph bullet.Konta couldn\u2019t, not effectively anyway. Williams will now be favored to win a sixth Wimbledon championship against Garbine Muguruza of Spain, in a year when a few of the game\u2019s most dangerous players (like her kid sister Serena) either weren\u2019t here or arrived out of form.\u201cI\u2019m just trying to compete and produce whatever I can,\u201d Williams said of the power game she has rarely wavered from. \u201cJust trying to compete.\u201dThe key moment of the match against Konta arrived in the ninth game of the first set with the score knotted 4-4 and both players refusing to crack. Facing a second break point, Williams handcuffed Konta with a 106 mph second serve that was three miles per hour faster than the first serve she had just missed. Konta couldn\u2019t return the ball and appeared shaken by what Williams had just sent her way. She lost the next five points, and moments later lost the first set.\u201cHer being able to do that is why she is a five-time champion here,\u201d Konta said of all those triple-digit serves. \u201cShe makes it difficult for you to dictate the play and a lot of the time you are at her mercy.\u201dWilliams never allowed Konta to take a lead, which kept the fans mostly out of the match. For 11 days they had served as a proxy for the country during Konta\u2019s captivating five-match run, which included a trio of three-set triumphs.Not Thursday. With Williams leading 2-1 in the second set, Konta double-faulted, and then two of Williams\u2019 shots ticked the top of the net and dropped in for eventual points, giving her the decisive break. Down in the next game, she cranked a 103 mph second serve that bounced straight at Konta\u2019s face. Konta merely dodged it in self-defense. Over the day, 65% of Williams\u2019s second serves resulted in points for her.This is by design. David Witt, Williams\u2019 coach, said the pair have spent much of their time here and before the tournament focused on the serve in an effort to crank up the pace, especially on the second ball.\u201cHer mindset is she is going to attack,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThat is her game. Her whole mentality is moving forward and attacking.\u201dWilliams attacked and ended points so quickly against Konta, that it turned age and the challenges she has overcome to make her second grand slam final of the year into mere afterthoughts.Williams suffers from Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain. Last month Williams was involved in a two-car accident in Florida. Two weeks later, the passenger in the other car died. The family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Williams. Local police have released evidence showing that Williams was not at fault, but the experience has shaken her psyche, if not her game.Now, this tournament is there for the taking. There will be no asterisks next to Williams\u2019s name if she wins, but her sister Serena, arguably the greatest player ever, is pregnant and absent. Multiple slam winner Victoria Azarenka recently gave birth and had little time to prepare.       Maria Sharapova,        just back after serving a drug suspension, opted not to try to gain a spot through the qualifying tournament.Williams plans to approach the final with the same super-simple tactics she has used all along. She pays little attention to what her opponents bring to the fore. Witt said they will spend 90 minutes on the courts on Friday, mostly working on that serve\u2014as well as some returns. On grass, a surface that feels very friendly to Williams\u2019 37-year-old knees, that serve can seem even a few clicks faster than the radar readings say.As a child, Williams worshiped the way Boris Becker boomed his way to three titles here. \u201cI loved his serve,\u201d she said. \u201cI just loved how big he played.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-13 15:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venus-williamss-smashing-run-at-wimbledon-continues-1499973632", "news_title": "Venus Williams\u2019s Smashing Run at Wimbledon Continues", "keywords": "serena williams,tennis,venus,venus williams,venus wimbledon,wimbledon,Venus Williams,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014A U.S. doctor offering to treat       Charlie Gard,        the terminally ill British baby whose case has generated international attention, told a court Thursday that new evidence suggested an experimental therapy could give the immobile and brain-damaged child as much as a 10% chance of improvement in his muscle strength.The 11-month-old is at the center of a court battle between his parents and the hospital where he is being treated over whether he can be taken abroad for experimental treatment. The case has stirred emotions and spurred offers of intervention from the pope and President       Donald Trump.U.K. law gives judges the final say when there is conflict over end-of-life decisions for very sick children. Charlie\u2019s parents,       Chris Gard       and       Connie Yates,        want to take their son to the U.S. or Italy for an experimental therapy that his doctors at London\u2019s Great Ormond Street Hospital say is futile.The physician in the U.S. offering to treat Charlie can\u2019t be named for legal reasons. The doctor has never met the child and has seen only summaries of his medical notes and brain scan results, the court heard Thursday.The judge on Thursday invited the doctor to visit Charlie in London and to meet with other experts on the baby\u2019s condition as well as those treating him, as part of the hearing.The doctor told the judge via video link that in the past few months new evidence and results from trials of the treatment in cases similar but not identical to Charlie\u2019s indicated that there was now more hope of an experimental therapy working for the baby.\u201cThere is a 10% chance of a clinically important improvement in muscle strength\u201d and a \u201csignificantly above zero\u201d chance of improvement in the child\u2019s brain function, the doctor told the court, but couldn\u2019t venture any further figures without seeing the child or carrying out the treatment.In a sign of the tensions in the case, Ms. Yates at one point objected to Judge       Nicholas Francis      \u2019 characterization of her previous evidence as indicating that she and Charlie\u2019s father didn\u2019t believe their son had any quality of life.\u201cWe say he\u2019s not suffering and he\u2019s not in pain, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be up here,\u201d Ms. Yates called out, putting her head in her hands before she and Mr. Gard quickly walked out of the hearing.The judge last week agreed to a new hearing after a U.S. and an Italian hospital said they have fresh evidence on a possible treatment.The judge said Thursday he had \u201can open mind\u201d but has said he needs to be convinced that any medical intervention would be in Charlie\u2019s best interests and have a chance to reverse what doctors say is structural damage to the baby\u2019s brain. His parents have contested the finding that he has structural brain damage.Under cross-examination by an attorney for Great Ormond Street, the U.S. doctor said an application for emergency new drug approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would be needed to treat Charlie, which can be made only if a patient is deemed to have less than three months to live.The boy has a mitochondrial disorder that depletes his brain function, muscle movement and ability to breathe.The experimental therapy, known as nucleoside therapy, hasn\u2019t been tested on mice or humans with Charlie\u2019s illness, but the doctor told the court that mice bred with the disease weren\u2019t available and it could take as long as one to two years to obtain them.\u201cWe would prefer to have data from animals before trying the therapies in humans but would consider the therapy on a compassionate use basis without that data,\u201d the doctor told the court.In a group of nine patients with a disease similar to Charlie\u2019s, one was able to breathe without a ventilator after being treated with nucleosides to improve muscle function, the doctor said. Five of the patients reduced the time they needed to be on ventilation, according to the physician.\u201cThese are [necessarily] small numbers when dealing with rare diseases,\u201d the doctor said.Great Ormond Street says it investigated last year the possibility of treating Charlie with the therapy but decided it wouldn\u2019t help him after he suffered seizures. It wants to remove his life support, saying it is likely causing him pain. Attorneys for the hospital argue that there was nothing new to help Charlie in evidence put before the court Thursday.The U.K. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the hospital last month.

Both sites were accessible via Tor, a network that takes steps to preserve the anonymity of its users.While the Silk Road\u2019s primary focus was drug sales, AlphaBay was more diverse, selling stolen credit-card numbers, drugs, online-fraud tutorials and guns, according to       Andrei Barysevich,        a director at Recorded Future Inc., which sells data about online threats and the Dark Web.In the first six months of 2017, AlphaBay sold more than $5 million in stolen credit-card numbers, Mr. Barysevich said. \u201cAlphaBay was the biggest marketplace on the Dark Web,\u201d he said.Total sales on the site averaged between $600,000 and $800,000 a day, earning AlphaBay\u2019s operators millions of dollars each year in commissions, according to       Nicolas Christin,        an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies online marketplaces.AlphaBay\u2019s operators had millions of dollars in the digital currency bitcoin, much of it held in escrow for the site\u2019s illicit transactions, based on two bitcoin wallets that have been linked to the website, Mr. Barysevich said.

For just the second time ever, two teams\u2014the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros\u2014are 30 games over .500 at the break. Three teams hold leads of at least 7 \u00bd games in their divisions at this point for just the second time since the start of divisional play in 1969.Welcome to baseball in 2017, the era of the haves and the have-nots. Across the league, smart executives for struggling franchises have recognized that sometimes, the process of getting better starts with getting worse\u2014a lot worse. It\u2019s an approach known as \u201ctanking,\u201d a dirty word in sports that has proven to be a sound strategy.It certainly worked for the Chicago Cubs, who won the World Series last year after team president       Theo Epstein       completely dismantled their roster in the hopes of acquiring a string of high draft picks. Under new general manager Jeff Luhnow, the Astros very publicly endured a total rebuild as well, parting ways with every valuable asset to load up their farm system. Houston averaged 104 losses from 2011-2014.The result, of course, is that the good teams get even better, while the bad ones, like the Philadelphia Phillies (29-58) and San Francisco Giants (34-56) sink into oblivion. This in part has resulted in the talent disparity this season.With a record of 60-29, the Astros lead the American League West by 16.5 games, the second-largest lead for any team at the All-Star break since \u201969. (The 2001 Seattle Mariners, who set an AL record with 116 wins, led the division by 19 games.) Only five teams in the National League are currently over .500.That could soon change, however. On Thursday, the Cubs, perhaps baseball\u2019s most disappointing team at 43-45, swung a blockbuster trade to acquire left-handed pitcher Jose Quintana from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for four prospects. Sitting 5 \u00bd games behind the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central, they hope Quintana can help jumpstart their season.Meanwhile, the White Sox, already in last place in the AL Central at 38-49, took another step backward\u2014for now. They received 20-year-old outfielder Eloy Jimenez, the Cubs\u2019 best prospect. In December, they added top farmhands Yoan Moncada and Michael Kopech from the Boston Red Sox by dealing their ace, Chris Sale.In other words, they\u2019ve gotten a lot worse in the past few months\u2014all in the name of getting a lot better soon.Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-era-of-the-haves-and-have-nots-in-baseball-1499972013", "news_title": "The Era of the Haves and Have-Nots in Baseball", "keywords": "baseball,houston astros,los angeles dodgers,mlb,Los Angeles Dodgers,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said Thursday a strong labor market and rising prices of imported goods supported her expectation that a recent downturn in inflation would prove transitory.In raising interest rates last month and penciling in one more increase later this year, Fed officials have so far looked past recent soft inflation readings by pointing to several idiosyncratic price declines, such as for wireless phone plans.Ms. Yellen cited those factors again in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, but also nodded to inherent uncertainty in near-term inflation figures. \u201cThere may be more going on.

She also pointed to continued declines in labor market slack, which would traditionally point to rising wages. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing very substantial upward pressure on wages, but we may begin to see upward pressure on wages and prices,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen said little about the timing of the Fed\u2019s next moves. Most economists polled recently by The Wall Street Journal expect the central bank to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion holdings of bonds and other assets in September, and next raise short-term interest rates in December. That would allow officials to monitor inflation trends for several months before deciding whether to lift borrowing costs.The central bank leader offered her assessments on a range of other topics Thursday:\u2022 On her future at the Fed: Ms. Yellen implied she hadn\u2019t discussed with the White House whether President       Donald Trump       might want to nominate her to continue as chairwoman after her term ends next February. \u201cIt\u2019s not been something that\u2019s come up,\u201d she said. If Mr. Trump asked her to stay on, that is \u201csomething that I would discuss with the president, obviously.\u201d\u2022 On the likelihood of another financial crisis: Ms. Yellen clarified comments she made in London last month when she said she didn\u2019t believe there would be another financial crisis \u201cin our lifetimes.\u201d On Thursday, she said, \u201cWe can never be confident that there won\u2019t be another financial crisis,\u201d but she pointed to postcrisis changes to bank capital and regulatory standards that had made the financial sector more resilient to economic shocks.\u2022 On the prospects for 3% annual U.S. economic growth: \u201cI\u2019d love to see it,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. The Trump administration has said it believes its policies can boost growth to that level. Ms. Yellen said the goal, which would require a large rebound in productivity, \u201cwould be quite challenging.\u201d\u2022 On the length of the U.S. economic expansion, currently the country\u2019s third longest on record: \u201cThere are shocks that impact the economy, and a negative shock could end the expansion,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see anything inherent in the nature of the expansion that suggests it will come to an end anytime soon.\u201dWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Yellen Expects Inflation Pickup.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-premature-to-conclude-inflation-trend-is-falling-well-short-of-target-1499957768", "news_title": "Yellen: Premature to Conclude Inflation Trend Is Falling Well Short of Target ", "keywords": "bond holdings,federal reserve,inflation,interest rates,senate testimony,u.s. economy,yellen,Janet Yellen,economic performance,indicators,prices,monetary policy,economic news"}, {"content": "From a July 11 article in Foreign Affairs by Nanjing University Professor       Zhu Feng      :Today, many within China believe that Beijing must reevaluate its relationship with both Koreas, which essentially means abandoning Pyongyang. It is both the strategic and the moral choice. Choosing South Korea, a democracy with a strong economy, will place China on the right side of history. China\u2019s lack of clear direction on this issue is beginning to negatively affect its reputation, with Beijing seen by the international community as reluctant to cooperate or behave responsibly. These are not traits that behoove a rising power.Going forward, China has three options: it can work more closely with the United States on getting tougher on North Korea, continue to drag its feet and avoid rocking the boat, or reinforce its alignment with Russia and use North Korea as a piece in a geopolitical chess game against the United States and South Korea. Of these options, only the first choice aligns with China\u2019s long-term interests to integrate with the international community. The question is how to ease Beijing\u2019s hesitations regarding this choice. In other words, how can the hawks in Beijing be brushed aside to make way for a more decisive and progressive policy while continuing to save face for all decision makers?", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-choice-1499971518", "news_title": "China\u2019s Choice", "keywords": "china, missile defense, north korea,political,general news,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Even when shut, windows let in the sun\u2019s light and warmth, which we usually welcome. But sunlight can fade our carpets or wake us up when we\u2019d rather nap; the sun\u2019s heat is sometimes too much in summer; and windows can be peeped into.People have long handled these downsides with curtains, blinds and other window treatments. Some modern windows can block light and heat with the touch of a button, but such \u201csmart windows\u201d usually require electricity, making them expensive and hard to retrofit.Now scientists at Princeton University have invented a technology aimed at smartening up the millions of windows already in place. They coated a piece of glass with a laminate containing transparent solar cells and a network of invisible electronics that will turn the panel dark blue on command, thereby blocking most of the sun. The result could be akin to sunglasses for your house, available whenever you want them. The scientists, who share a patent on the technology with Princeton, hope to make a version of their laminate into a sheet of film to be applied to the inside of existing windows, making them easier to retrofit.A few similar films are already on the market, but they must be hard-wired or plugged into an electrical outlet, which can make installation complicated and leave windows and glass doors hard to open and close. Other scientists have developed transparent solar cells, but those usually produce power from the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which can leave the cells less capable of controlling the entry or exit of heat through the glass. The Princeton team relied on the near-UV portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which means that their window laminate works better as a thermal barrier.The scientists say that such windows could cut our energy bills. They could also improve privacy with a version that would get so dark that people couldn\u2019t see in or out.\u201cThis new technology is actually smart management of the entire spectrum of sunlight,\u201d says Yueh-Lin Loo, a Princeton engineering professor who co-wrote a recent scientific paper on the research. The electrical charge generated by the solar cells darkens or lightens the laminate by causing a reaction in two polymer layers that are sandwiched around a conducting layer. Instead of requiring a continual flow of energy to keep the laminate dark or light, the system needs only an occasional jolt, she says. The invisible solar cells produce 10 times the energy needed to keep the panels dark or light or trigger a change, Dr. Loo says, and a small battery attached to the laminate should handle the job once the sun has set. She notes that the solar cells can still produce power when the laminate is set to dark, as long as they get at least some sun.Windows that change color in response to an electric charge are known as \u201celectrochromic.\u201d Unlike \u201cphotochromic\u201d glass, which makes the lenses in some eyeglasses automatically turn darker in the sun, electrochromic glass gives users the power to control the transparency\u2014in this case, with a smartphone app that communicates with the laminate wirelessly via Bluetooth. That could also let users schedule their windows to shift from light to dark during the day or change them over remotely.\u201cPairing of near-ultraviolet solar cells with electrochromic windows for smart management of the solar spectrum,\u201d Nicholas C.

Cargill has also invested about $4 billion, including buying a salmon-feed maker and building a soybean processing plant in China, to reorient the 152-year-old company toward higher-profit products and services.Mr. Smits said the changes have paid off. Cargill reported Thursday that full-year profits rose 19% to $2.84 billion, the company\u2019s strongest-earning year since 2009. Stronger consumer demand for beef in the U.S. and poultry in Europe helped drive the gain, along with rising exports of meat and grain from North America.Cargill has slowed its portfolio shake-up as agriculture firms contemplate further consolidation.Mining and trading firm             Glencore                   PLC in May confirmed that it approached U.S. grain trader             Bunge Ltd.       about a deal that could reorient the top ranks of global crop traders.Brazil-based             JBS SA,       the world\u2019s largest meatpacker by sales, is selling about $1.8 billion in businesses, including a European poultry processor and the biggest U.S. cattle feedlot group, to shore up cash following a massive corruption settlement reached by JBS\u2019s parent in May.Cargill last month struck a deal to buy a Colombian chicken processor, and is expanding its Asian chicken operations in Indonesia and the Philippines. Mr. Smits said Cargill would also look at potential acquisitions in grain trading, but big deals might be less likely because Cargill already operates an extensive network of grain terminals and ports across North America, South America and Eastern Europe.\u201cWe\u2019ve focused more on improving existing operations,\u201d he said.For its fiscal fourth quarter, Cargill earned $347 million, up from $15 million in the prior-year period.Write to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Cargill Brushes Off Acquisition Playbook.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cargill-mulls-meat-deals-as-portfolio-shifts-1499971035", "news_title": "Cargill Mulls Meat Deals as Portfolio Shifts ", "keywords": "cargill cfo,cargill deals,Cargill Inc.,Marcel Smits,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "FITTINGLY, the new McLaren 720S super-sports car looks like the tip of the thing cardiologists use to unplug arteries: frictionless, streamlined, soft-shouldered and organic, needling its way into your heart.Come to think of it, my time in a midnight-blue 720S\u2014a 24-hour, 500-mile rally from Heathrow to the Welsh seaside village of Fairbourne and back again\u2014was some of the most intense driving of my career, EKG-wise. Nothing focuses the mind like aiming a $354,000 borrowed car down what is essentially half a road, hemmed in stone walls, the ivy snapping fiendishly at the mirrors, in a proper Welsh downpour. Oh, man, does it know how to rain there. The sheep are like, What? Again?Replacing the 650S in McLaren\u2019s Super Series lineup, the 720S marks a turning point for the luxury sports-car manufacturer, based in Woking, Surrey, England. The company\u2019s first design director,       Frank Stephenson,        left the company this spring, replaced by his chief designer,       Rob Melville,        who is credited with the 720S.This changing of the guard is signaled by the 720S\u2019s remarkable reimagining of house aesthetics. Compared to the smooth, cool presentation of past cars, the 720S\u2019s design surfaces are organic, even biomimetic, a tensed moment of muscle, tendon and ligament. It\u2019s pretty fabulous.In the front office, chief executive and F1 mega-boss       Ron Dennis,        CBE, has recently retired, selling his stake in both McLaren road-car and racing operations to his Bahraini financial partners. The 720S is the first of 15 new models coming in the next five years, part of the $1.4 billion \u201cTrack22\u201d investment plan.This entire portfolio\u2014including rumored, all-electric beasts\u2014will rely on the latest version of McLaren\u2019s carbon-fiber main structure, called Monocage II, which debuts on the 720S. This car is very much a preview of coming attractions.Crazy-light and stiffer than steel, the Monocage II structure is the primary enabler of the car\u2019s edge-of-space dynamics. With a dry weight of just 2,829 pounds against the 710-hp V8 amidships, the McLaren has the lowest weight-to-power ratio (3.98 pounds per horsepower) in its class, which includes heavy-hitting flyweights like the Ferrari 488 GTB, Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n and Ford GT.Weather cooperating, the 720S is as quick as the quickest, ever: 0-to-60 mph in 2.8 seconds; 0-to-124 mph in a thoroughly berserk 7.8 seconds. Should you jam on the brakes at that speed\u2014stupid sheep!\u2014the car will cease movement in a mere 400 feet.Under the tapering transparency of the rear deck, bathed in its own red accent lighting like a brothel, is a twin-turbo, dry-sump, 90-degree V8, displacing 4.0 liters and generating a properly indecent 710 hp at 7,250 rpm, backed up by a seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle. This edition of the all-aluminum V8 is equipped with electrically spooling twin-scroll turbochargers, designed to zero out any latency in throttle response. Honey, if the 720S has a latency issue, it isn\u2019t with the throttle.Heading up a relatively dry M4 dual carriageway from London, I threw all of the car\u2019s dynamics switches\u2014powertrain, active aero and chassis\u2014into Track mode. The car\u2019s curvaceous, full-width rear wing stood up on its hydraulic struts. I downshifted into 2nd and gave the milled-aluminum accelerator pedal a good kick. Blimey. The next moment, the Pirelli 305/30 rear tires spun madly, convulsed with horsepower, and the rear-end jumped a foot to the left. Whoa! There apparently is such a thing as too much leg in Track mode.I was a couple tenths of a second late on the upshift, leaving the V8 hung up on the rev limiter, howling like an NFL lineman getting his area waxed. The 3rd gear upshift crumpled like artillery.I would have preferred a bone-dry racetrack in Portugal, followed by a dinner of salt-baked sardines, but that wasn\u2019t to be. Still, this drive allowed me to consider the 720S\u2019s other charms, mostly the robust traction and stability control. This was an especial gift since the Pirelli P Zero Corsa summer tires that work so admirably in sunny Lisbon were cold, hard and hydroplaning luridly in Wales.Given its capacity for summary violence, the 720S is surreally tractable at low speeds, happy to burble around town in 1st and 2nd gear, the powertrain mode-selector on Comfort, its silencers on maximum. You can lift the nose hydraulically if you need to clear a sleeping policeman. To go with the raked windshield and low scuttle, there are great big windshield wipers that go like hell.\u2018The 720S\u2019s design surfaces are organic, even biomimetic, a tensed moment of muscle, tendon and ligament.\u2019McLaren\u2019s hydraulics-based active suspension\u2014which, in extremis around a racetrack, can hold a car almost dead level in +1 g cornering\u2014also serves up a pretty plummy ride on the roads of Penrhyndeudraeth. Of course, the tires are loud and prophylactic-thin, so the ride can be only so smooth.The livability quotient surprised me, starting with the car\u2019s outward visibility. The airy, teardrop-shaped canopy, nearly all transparent, is supported by elegantly thin roof pillars, possible only because they are part of the Monocage II superstructure.I regard the 720S as a landmark automobile in the field of what you may call functional aesthetics. It\u2019s such a fluid and ferocious shape\u2014sculpture, really\u2014so seemingly untroubled by technical demands of extreme speed. The 720S defies you to understand how it cools, breathes or stays on the ground. It seems built to fly in a different wind.Note that there are no obvious air ducts in the upper bodywork. The computer-modeled skin features sinuous grooves around the canopy where air gets inhaled through ducts concealed in the bodywork. It also gathers air in its headlight assemblies.I arrived in Fairbourne, at the mouth of the River Mawddach, feeling triumphant and eager to mingle with the locals. At the corner store I playfully ventured the only Welsh I know: Mae fy hofrenfad yn llawn llyswennod, which means \u201cMy hovercraft is full of eels.\u201d You know, from the old Monty Python skit? Nothing.Unbeknownst to me, the British government had recently declared that the village of Fairbourne would be \u201cdecommissioned\u201d due to rising sea levels caused by climate change.Out there on the Marches, they don\u2019t see too many UFOs so you can imagine the impression this car makes. Bloody \u2019ell, says everyone.Corrections & Amplifications   The McLaren 720S goes from 0 to 124 mph in 7.8 seconds.

The deficit was about $96 billion higher than it was in June 2016, when the government recorded a $6 billion surplus.Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, which began in October, the overall budget gap was about 31% bigger compared with the same period a year earlier.Treasury said receipts totaled $339 billion in June, and were up 2% in the first nine months of the fiscal year, which started Oct. 1. That tracks with a report last week from the Congressional Budget Office, which also said receipts for the fiscal year were up 2%, but are still lower than they projected at the beginning of 2017.Trump administration officials and analysts have flagged lackluster receipts as potentially compressing the period of time the government has before it runs out of cash. The Treasury Department has been employing cash-conservation measures since mid-March when government debt hit the borrowing limit.Analysts estimate those measures will last until early to mid-October. Administration officials have urged lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling before they leave for their summer recess July 28, but Treasury has not said when it expects to run out of room to meet the government\u2019s obligations.More broadly, declining government revenues and long-term costs associated with an aging population, including higher Social Security and Medicare spending, are expected to continue pushing up the deficit.In a report released last month, CBO said it now expects the deficit to rise to $693 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, or 3.6% of gross domestic product. That was higher than estimates released in January, when CBO projected the deficit would decline in 2017 to 2.9% of GDP.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'June Deficit Grew As Spending Rose.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-runs-90-billion-budget-deficit-in-june-1499970529", "news_title": "U.S. Runs $90 Billion Budget Deficit in June", "keywords": " $90 billion deficit, cbo, congressional budget office, debt ceiling,debt limit, june budget deficit,june deficit, treasury department,Congressional Budget Office,Treasury Department,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "Rising labor costs and mass cancellations during a spring storm dragged             Delta Air Lines Inc.\u2019s        DAL -0.32%       profit down 21% in the second quarter, even as revenue rose for the first time in two years.Delta shares fell 2.1% on Thursday to trade at $54.32 after the No. 2 U.S. airline by traffic missed analyst expectations by 3 cents a share, excluding unusual items.Chief Executive       Ed Bastian       said Delta is investing in technology and new programs after a series of April thunderstorms sparked 4,000 flight cancellations and a $125 million pretax loss on the quarter.\u2018\u2019\u2019We can improve our recovery,\u201d Mr. Bastian said.Recent pilot wage increases also pinched Delta in the second quarter. Unit costs excluding fuel rose 7.3% compared with the prior-year period. Delta estimated that unit costs will be up 4% in the third quarter.Still, Mr. Bastian called this the best second quarter in Delta\u2019s history. Unit-revenue growth of 2.5% versus that quarter a year ago marked the first positive result for that key metric since the final quarter of 2014. Unit revenue measures how much an airline makes on each passenger flown a mile.The return to positive unit-revenue growth during what Delta has called a \u201ctransition year\u201d has been helped by stronger demand and new products and fares meant to squeeze more revenue from each flier.Delta President       Glen Hauenstein       outlined efforts to expand that strategy, for instance by allowing elite fliers to buy upgrades their employers wouldn\u2019t subsidize. He said Delta will also open up frequent-flier points as a currency travelers can use to purchase services such as sending an unaccompanied minor or a pet.\u201cThis helps us monetize our premium products,\u201d he said.Mr. Hauenstein said cargo sales in the second quarter rose for the first time in 10 quarters. Business-fare revenue rose and revenue from the company\u2019s co-branded credit card issued by             American Express Co.       also was higher. Fuel prices also fell 16% in the quarter, Delta said.Atlanta-based Delta said its operating margin could be 18% to 20% for all of 2017, compared with 18.4% in the June quarter.

In the news conference, Mr. Trump described the attorney with whom his son met, Natalia Veselnitskaya, as a Russian lawyer, saying she wasn\u2019t a Russian government lawyer. Ms. Veselnitskaya is a private attorney, but was described in emails to Mr. Trump\u2019s son as a \u201cgovernment attorney\u201d and has extensive ties to the Kremlin.Mr. Trump sought to downplay the importance of the meeting, saying it went \u201cvery quickly\u201d and that \u201czero happened from the meeting.\u201dThe president didn\u2019t answer a question about whether he felt he was misled about the existence of the meeting during the campaign. In a Reuters interview on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t learn about his son\u2019s meeting with the Russian lawyer until the past week. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t know. Until a couple of days ago, when I heard about this. No I didn\u2019t know about that,\u201d he said.The news conference\u2014Mr. Trump\u2019s first since news emerged of his son\u2019s meeting, as well as the first time the president has spoken publicly since returning from the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg last weekend\u2014followed roughly two hours of meetings between the leaders and their top advisers, which the White House said earlier in the week were expected to focus on Syria and counterterrorism efforts.Mr. Trump touched down in Paris early Thursday morning for a whirlwind trip to celebrate Bastille Day and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I. Later on Thursday, the leaders are set to dine at the lavish restaurant Le Jules Verne on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower. The next morning, Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump will be the guests of honor at a military parade down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es before returning to Washington in the early afternoon.The president departed Washington late Wednesday night amid growing concerns over his son\u2019s actions during the campaign.

Russia has denied interfering, and Mr. Trump has called allegations about any campaign ties to Russia a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dA day earlier, Mr. Trump sought to refute allegations that the Russian government tried to help his presidential campaign and damage that of Mrs. Clinton, arguing that his policies run counter to the Kremlin\u2019s interests.\u201cThere are many things that I do that are the exact opposite\u201d of what Russian President       Vladimir Putin       would want, Mr. Trump said in a television interview. \u201cSo what I keep hearing about, that he [Mr. Putin] would have rather had Trump, I think\u2014probably not.\u201dWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-sons-decision-to-meet-with-russian-lawyer-1499968541", "news_title": "Trump Defends Son\u2019s Decision to Meet With Russian Lawyer", "keywords": " defends, donald trump,donald trump jr.,election, hillary clinton, macron, paris, president trump,russia, russian lawyer,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections"}, {"content": "WE ARE LIVING in a golden age of pool floats.

We also stuck to models you can assemble (and stow for the off-season) effortlessly, or at least easily.After hours of rigorous reclining, drifting, sipping and journalistic dozing, we identified a handful that rose above the rest. Here, four options that go way beyond buoyant.Feels like Being enveloped in a cloud.Ideal for Sweltering days when you want the water to lap over you as you lounge.Practical Concerns  Because the Kai\u2019s foam beads mold around your body as you climb onto it\u2014no inflating required\u2014settling in comfortably calls for some strategic maneuvering. But once you find your sweet spot, the experience is serene. The Sunbrella fabric surface is fade- and mildew-resistant. Store flat or fold it in half to take up less space. This pretty and eminently Instagrammable striped version is exclusive to Frontgate. A matching throw-pillow-size floating drink caddie ($80) is also available. $199, frontgate.comFeels like An amphibious Eames lounge chair.Ideal for Hydrophilous bookworms. While the other floats encourage a horizontal lazing position, the Oasis\u2019s straight-back design sits you fully upright. Opt for this if you want to plow through several chapters of \u201cA Room With a View\u201d rather than snoozing.Practical Concerns Because you sit with your legs in the water, you can, with a few kicks, propel yourself to the side of the pool where the canap\u00e9s are. You can also transport this lightweight, bead-filled float easily, thanks to a sturdy handle on top. The Sunbrella upholstery is similar to that of the Kai Float but a bit softer. $149, frontgate.comFeels like A gently bobbing Aerobed. Just add a beach towel (or fine linens) to slumber soundly.Ideal for Those who love being in pools but not in water. This expansive floating daybed manages to keep you completely buoyed so you won\u2019t get wet if you don\u2019t want to. Bonus: So stable is the Modul\u2019Air, you could play a tense round of Jenga on it.Practical Concerns Despite being mostly air, the lounger is surprisingly heavy. Thankfully, its various sections inflate quickly using the optional electric pump ($19). Also available: a silicon cup ($18) that attaches securely via magnets hidden in the float to ensure your fros\u00e9 doesn\u2019t go for a swim. $449, pigrofelice.comFeels like Everything water-bed makers aspired to achieve but never did.Ideal for Anyone who\u2019s dreamed of owning an adjustable bed.

Lawmakers would need to publicly disclose the spending on their campaign finance reports.A gunman opened fire in June on a practice session of the Republican congressional baseball team on a field in Virginia outside Washington, D.C. Rep.       Steve Scalise       (R., La.), the House majority whip, was wounded, along with a congressional aide, a U.S. Capitol Police officer and a lobbyist. All four survived the attack and are recuperating. The suspect in the shooting,       James Hodgkinson,        was killed by police at the scene.In a letter to the commission seeking guidance on the matter, the House sergeant at arms\u2014the chief law enforcement officer of the U.S. House of Representatives\u2014wrote that physical threats against lawmakers have increased dramatically in recent months. Between January and late June, the Capitol Police investigated nearly 1,000 threatening communications aimed at members of Congress\u2014up from about 900 threats in the entire previous year, he wrote.In addition to seeking the FEC decision, the House in June voted to increase lawmakers\u2019 office expense budgets by $25,000. Under guidance issued by the House, members may spend taxpayer funds typically allocated to pay for staff and other official expenses on security, training and equipment. Members will need permission from the sergeant at arms for some purchases.Some members of Congress have proposed that lawmakers be allowed to carry firearms in Washington, D.C., where the right to carry weapons is strictly limited.The FEC has previously granted individual lawmakers the right to use campaign funds on security on a case-by-case basis in response to specific threats, but the new advisory opinion now makes clear that any lawmaker is permitted to use campaign funds for such purposes in the wake of increasing threats to lawmaker security.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 14:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-lawmakers-can-spend-campaign-cash-on-home-security-election-agency-rules-1499969030", "news_title": "U.S. Lawmakers Can Spend Campaign Cash on Home Security, Election Agency Rules", "keywords": "campaign funds,congress,federal election commission,gunman,home security,house of representatives,physical threats against lawmakers,politics,residential security ,senate,steve scalise,u.s.,virginia shooting,Federal Election Commission,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections"}, {"content": "The German government on Wednesday called on             Siemens AG        SIEGY -1.24%      , one of the country\u2019s biggest corporations, to explain how gas turbines it sold for use at a Russian power plant got diverted to Crimea, possibly violating European Union sanctions tied to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine.Siemens filed a lawsuit in Moscow this week against Technopromexport, a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s state-owned Rostec State Corp., after learning that two turbines it had sold to Technopromexport for a power plant to be built in Taman, southern Russia, ended up in Russian-occupied Crimea.The German government, which under EU law is responsible for determining whether the shipment violated sanctions, said it was monitoring efforts to determine what happened and said it expected quick answers from the company.\u201cIt is above all now up to Siemens,\u201d government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters on Wednesday. He said the government was discussing how to respond to the \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d actions.\u201cThe transaction itself is not in violation of any sanctions,\u201d a Siemens spokesman said, adding that the terms of the contract with Technopromexport included clauses prohibiting delivery of the turbines to any third parties without the express permission of Siemens, a standard provision to prevent circumventing sanctions. Siemens declined to comment on Mr. Seibert\u2019s remarks.The EU imposed sanctions on Russia after its annexation of Crimea in March 2014. An EU spokeswoman said individual member states are responsible for enforcing sanctions, though EU officials were in touch with German authorities about the Siemens case.The company said it received the contract for four turbines in March 2015 for use in a power station to be built in Taman. The turbines were delivered as agreed with the buyer to a warehouse in St. Petersburg in August 2016, the company said.Weeks later, Siemens began to doubt that Technopromexport was abiding by the contract, a spokesman said. By September, Siemens had indications that the turbines had not arrived in Taman. Evidence cited by the company included a lack of activity at the site where the power plant was supposedly under construction. Siemens says it believes the turbines were delivered instead to the port of Sebastopol.Media reports first raised suspicions two years ago that the Russian buyer, a contractor with close ties to the Kremlin, might have other plans for the turbines. But at the time Siemens said: \u201cWe have no reason to believe that the gas turbines mentioned in the news articles are destined for Crimea.\u201dSiemens said it had repeatedly sought assurances from Technopromexport that the turbines would be installed as agreed. On Monday, Siemens said it believed that the equipment had been diverted. \u201cSiemens has received information from reliable sources that at least two of the four gas turbine sets\u2026 have been moved to Crimea against our will,\u201d it said in a statement.Technopromexport didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.After Siemen\u2019s statement on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, saying, \u201cWe do not deal with turbines in the presidential administration,\u201d the news agency TASS reported.German companies have long opposed economic sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea. Siemens, which has done business in Russia since 1853, maintained close ties with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       even after the annexation sparked a political conflict with the West.Stephen Szabo, executive director of the trans-Atlantic Academy think tank, said the apparent end-run around the EU\u2019s sanctions to provide power for Russia-occupied Crimea was a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        a staunch opponent of Russia\u2019s expansionist policies in Eastern Europe. \u201cFor Putin, it\u2019s another sign the West is tolerating the annexation of Crimea.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Siemens AG said it delivered gas turbines to a Russian customer in August 2016. Because of erroneous information from Siemens, an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the turbines were delivered in June 2016.

And once he gets the jersey, awarded to the Tour\u2019s overall leader, Froome tends to keep it. In 2015 and 2016, he took over the Tour\u2019s overall lead in the first 10 stages and wore yellow all the way to Paris.Which made Thursday\u2019s stage in the Pyrenees a cycling rarity. Froome not only faltered, he faltered badly enough to cough up his yellow jersey.On the day\u2019s last climb to the finish in Peyragudes, Frenchman Romain Bardet and Italy\u2019s Fabio Aru managed to run away from him and put 21 seconds of daylight behind them. Bardet won the stage and Aru took the overall lead. Froome now trails Aru by six seconds in the general classification and has Bardet on his heels, only 19 seconds back.\u201cI don\u2019t have any excuses,\u201d Froome said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have the legs.\u201dThe Tour de France has often been criticized in recent years\u2014the Team Sky era\u2014for how few mano a mano battles it has delivered between the protagonists. Much of that is down to Team Sky\u2019s crushing dominance. The British outfit is so stacked with talent that even its third and fourth strongest riders can suffocate offensives from other team leaders and shepherd Froome to Paris.But on Thursday, even with two teammates protecting him, he found himself with nothing in the tank as his closest rivals Bardet and Aru thrashed away.\u201cI turned around and saw that Chris Froome was late, so I quickly did the math quickly realized I was going to take the yellow jersey,\u201d Aru said in Italian.How long Aru can keep it remains to be seen. His Astana team is somewhat depleted and doesn\u2019t run nearly as deep as Froome\u2019s corps of lieutenants. But in the unlikely event that Froome doesn\u2019t bounce back, it has left the door ajar in this race with nine stages left. Now, even Bardet is in contention to become the first Frenchman to win the Tour since Bernard Hinault in 1985.\u201cThere are four riders within a minute of each other, so I think it\u2019s going to be a beautiful fight,\u201d Bardet said in French. \u201cThere are still some huge climbs ahead.\u201dAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Aru Seizes Tour Lead.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fabio-aru-takes-the-tours-yellow-jersey-1499968486", "news_title": "Fabio Aru Takes the Tour\u2019s Yellow Jersey", "keywords": "chris froome,cycling,fabio aru,le tour,tour,tour de france,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "One of China\u2019s most prolific overseas acquirers, the airlines-and-hotels conglomerate HNA Group Co., is drastically slowing its deal making, suggesting that a government crackdown on debt might be crimping its global ambitions.HNA has recently told people involved in its deals that it is putting mergers-and-acquisitions activity on hold for now, said some people familiar with the discussions. The group is looking at fewer targets and engaging in fewer discussions about potential acquisitions, another person familiar with HNA\u2019s plans said.The people said, however, that HNA is still discussing investments in asset-management firms and financial institutions\u2014a high priority for the group\u2014and that there are a range of deals in the pipeline that could be ready to go when HNA wants to execute them. The deals HNA has already announced are likely to go through, some of the people said.The conglomerate didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.HNA\u2019s deals hiatus sidelines one of the last big Chinese companies that was still aggressively pursuing deals overseas this year, after a push by the country\u2019s regulators to curb a massive flow of money abroad in 2016. Outbound investments by Chinese companies, which hit a record last year, had already fallen sharply this year after mainland officials tightened scrutiny of big purchases abroad.Then in June, China\u2019s banking regulator began examining leverage at several highflying Chinese conglomerates, including HNA\u2014in an extension of a wide-ranging regulatory campaign to rein in ballooning debt levels.One of those conglomerates, Anbang Insurance Group Co.\u2014which caught global attention with the purchase of New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria for nearly $2 billion\u2014had already reined in the pace of its deal making. Another, Dalian Wanda Group\u2014which bought Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion\u2014said earlier this week that it was selling most of its domestic theme parks and hotels, in a deal that would slash its debt levels.HNA has announced $5.66 billion worth of overseas deals so far this year. Among recent investments, it spent $6.5 billion to acquire a stake in             Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.       and $446 million to buy a stake in             OM Asset Management                   PLC, the U.S. money-management arm of British insurer             Old Mutual                   PLC.

Previously, students had to wait until their families\u2019 prior-year tax returns were completed. Beginning with the latest cycle, they could use what is known as prior-prior-year income information.It also let students submit their aid forms as early as\u00a0Oct. 1\u00a0for aid they hoped to receive in the 2017-2018 academic year, rather than the prior\u00a0Jan. 1\u00a0opening date.That longer window for submission is particularly valuable for high school seniors, said       Nicholas Hillman,        associate professor of educational leadership and policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Many of them need to compare aid offers before committing to a college.Mr. Hillman noted that the changes didn\u2019t require a significant financial investment from the government but yielded positive returns.There was a 9% increase this year in the number of high school seniors who submitted Fafsa forms\u2014far outpacing the 1% increase in the population of seniors.The National College Access Network offered grants of up to $55,000 each to 22 cities this year, funded by the Kresge Foundation, to boost Fafsa filings.       Carrie Warick,        director of policy and advocacy, said the group set a goal of 5% increases in participating cities, so a 9% gain among high school seniors nationwide is particularly satisfying.The uptick in aid requests should eliminate fears by higher education officials that applications would fall after a tool that allows easy transfer of IRS data to the Fafsa form was disabled. That data retrieval tool was taken down due to criminal activity,\u00a0 with data on up to 100,000 taxpayers compromised.The tool is expected to be back up and running for the next application cycle in the fall.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/number-of-students-applying-for-federal-aid-rises-6-after-several-years-of-decline-1499967343", "news_title": "Number of Students Applying for Federal Aid Rises 6%, After Several Years of Decline ", "keywords": "college applications,college education,education department,fafsa,financial aid,free application for federal student aid,grants,loans,students,political,general news,higher education costs,education,personal finance,university,college"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Ambassadors to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization squared off with Russian diplomats in Brussels on Thursday over Moscow\u2019s planned military exercises near the Western bloc\u2019s borders.At NATO headquarters in the Belgian capital, Russian representatives outlined the troops, ships, aircraft and weaponry that will participate in the joint Russian-Belarusian regional exercises scheduled for September, partly on Belarus\u2019s border with Lithuania and Poland.Alexander Grushko,        Russia\u2019s permanent representative to the Western military alliance, afterward refused to specify how many soldiers would take part in the so-called Zapad war games. But according to a European official, Russian officials during the meeting put the number of participating Russian and Belarusian troops at 12,700.Deploying more than 9,000 troops for the exercises would require Moscow to notify international authorities. Any more than 13,000 would require it to allow international observers to attend the drills. Mr. Grushko told reporters Moscow would, if necessary, comply with the requirement.\u201cWe were asked to brief on Zapad exercises, we briefed,\u201d Mr. Grushko said. \u201cI hope this would help stop the demonization of this exercise.\u201dNATO Secretary-General       Jens Stoltenberg       said he was heartened that the Russians were willing to discuss their military exercises. But the exchange, he said, is no substitute for Moscow adhering to international rules requiring notification of such drills.The 12,700 figure cited by Russian representatives is far below estimates by U.S. and NATO officials, who have said that up to 100,000 troops would participate in the exercises.\u201cFrom previous experiences related to previous exercises, we have every reason to believe there may be substantially more troops participating than the official quoted numbers,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said.NATO officials have said they are worried about the exercises in a region where there has been a buildup of military forces on both sides. An accident or miscalculation, officials said, could trigger a crisis.NATO allies on Russia\u2019s borders have also said they worry that the drills could serve a pretext for Moscow to upgrade its weaponry along the frontier.State media in Russia have carried reports in recent days that Moscow is considering downgrading its diplomatic representation to NATO to protest against what Russian officials see as nonproductive dialogue with Brussels.Mr. Grushko declined to answer whether his successor as permanent representative to NATO would no longer carry ambassadorial rank. A NATO official said the alliance wouldn\u2019t focus on protocol and would attempt to continue discussions with whoever represents Moscow in Brussels.Thursday\u2019s meeting also included discussion on Ukraine, Russia and air safety.

Other networks have cause to celebrate, too. NBC\u2019s tear-jerker \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is the first series from one of the big four broadcast networks to be nominated in the category since 2011. And the nomination for \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a dystopian drama, helps Hulu demonstrate that it is on the level of fellow streamers Netflix and Amazon as a conduit for premium TV.By contrast, Outstanding Comedy Series saw an almost exact repeat of last year\u2019s nominees, with only Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent\u201d missing this year.

As usual, HBO took the most nominations by network (110), followed by Netflix (91) and NBC (60).The loudness of American politics seemed to play a role in the nominations for late-night talk shows. \u201cFull Frontal With Samantha Bee\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show with       Stephen Colbert,       \u201d two of President Trump\u2019s most aggressive comedy antagonists, were first-time nominees, joining last year\u2019s winner, \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver,\u201d \u201c      Jimmy Kimmel       Live,\u201d \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden\u201d and \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d Missing from the race: Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show,\u201d which took a softer approach to presidential politics and saw its ratings dominance eroded by Mr. Colbert.In recent years Outstanding Limited Series has turned into a battleground for HBO and FX, specialists in short-burst shows with high-caliber casting and production.

What\u2019s the easiest way to back them up so I can safely delete them from my phone?A: The best backup system is one you don\u2019t have to think about, which is why I use apps that automatically upload my media to the cloud. After you set these up, photos and videos appear in the cloud without your having to do a thing.If you\u2019re an iPhone owner and don\u2019t mind paying a monthly fee, Apple\u2019s iPhoto app coupled with an iCloud subscription is handy. The service automatically puts every photo in the cloud and manages space on your device in the background, no deleting necessary. Plans start at $1 per month for 50 GB; a 2 TB plan, costs $10 per month. To enable this, go to the \u201cPhotos & Camera\u201d setting, toggle on \u201ciCloud Photo Library\u201d and make sure \u201cOptimize Phone Storage\u201d is checked.Google Photos, available for iOS and Android, lets you store an unlimited number of photos and videos for free, but photos need to be under 16 megapixels, and video resolution is limited to 1080p (which shouldn\u2019t be a problem for smartphone users). Flickr, meanwhile, offers a free plan with 1 TB of storage, and places no restrictions on resolution.To set up these two apps, open their settings, then select \u201cBack up & sync\u201d in Google Photos or \u201cAuto-Uploadr\u201d in Flickr and toggle it on. Once you do, the apps will upload files whenever your phone is connected to Wi-Fi. You can safely delete the files from your phone after that.At some point, you\u2019ll probably want to download your backed up photos to a hard drive. For iCloud, open the Photos app on a computer, choose \u201cPhotos\u201d then \u201cPreferences.\u201d Then click \u201cDownload Originals to this Mac.\u201d For Flickr, log in to the site from a desktop browser, select \u201cAlbums\u201d under the \u201cYou\u201d menu, hover over the album called \u201cAuto Upload,\u201d then Google Photos allows you to batch download, too, but the process isn\u2019t quite as easy because you can only grab 500 items at a time.

Once the protests were crushed, an ensuing political vacuum was filled by foot soldiers of Islamic State who moved in, declared a caliphate and made the city an Islamic State stronghold. Soon afterward, a small group of young, middle-class residents began to document the atrocities that Islamic State was visiting on their defenseless hometown. They weren\u2019t trained as reporters\u2014among them were university students, a teacher and a self-described hermit who loved photography\u2014but they had cellphone cameras, and used them to shoot on the fly and send stories to the outside world, whether the world was interested or not.They were grass-roots journalists where there wasn\u2019t any grass, only the daily danger of being caught by murderous Islamic State zealots and tortured or killed, as several of the RBSS people were. Using their guerrilla footage, Mr. Heineman\u2019s film gives us a stunning picture of life in a city gone mad: casual sidewalk executions; bodies left as cautionary displays in Raqqa\u2019s centrally located and surreally named Paradise Square; signal-detection vans on the move in a constant campaign to shut down the town\u2019s communication networks; Islamic State thugs throwing satellite dishes on trash trucks; Islamic State recruiters rounding up kids for indoctrination in day camps. (\u201cChildren are ISIS\u2019s firewood,\u201d a journalist says.)As city life grows intolerably dangerous, some RBSS stalwarts flee to the supposed safety of a Turkish town across the border, or to the guilt-producing comfort of Germany. They\u2019re connected by a network, after all; they can relay stories sent by colleagues who stayed behind. At this point, though, \u201cCity of Ghosts\u201d takes a sinister turn. What began as a celebration of amateur journalists becomes a more familiar story of refugees. Islamic State retaliates against one RBSS refugee by killing his father and brother, both of whom remained in Raqqa. Another activist is killed on a Turkish street by an Islamic State operative who crossed the border to track him down.No one feels safe, yet the reports keep coming and the RBSS efforts bear fruit.The word gets out. The images get out. Shaky cellphone videos shot on Raqqa\u2019s streets show up on CNN world news broadcasts. Whether the truth sets anyone free is unknowable at this point, but the city that was being slaughtered silently has been heard, and its suffering has been seen.Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/city-of-ghosts-review-journalism-in-the-face-of-terror-1499966542", "news_title": "\u2018City of Ghosts\u2019 Review: Journalism in the Face of Terror", "keywords": "arts in review,city of ghosts, documentary, film review, islamic state, matthew heineman, raqqa is being slaughtered silently, syria,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,movies,terrorism,reviews"}, {"content": "If you listened to \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes\u201d with your eyes closed, the music alone would let you know you were in the presence of a grand adventure. This improbably magnificent film and       Michael Giacchino\u2019s       majestic score are a perfect match. The apes are the good guys here, but the humans who made the movie do our species proud. (      Matt Reeves,        who directed the previous episode, returns for this one; he also wrote the screenplay with Mark Bomback.)It\u2019s been almost half a century since the first \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d hit the big screen. After eight iterations we\u2019ve come to accept the conventions of the series\u2014apes on horseback, apes with weapons, clever apes, talented apes and, more recently, in the first two parts of a rebooted trilogy, genetically enhanced apes with startling intellects and evolving powers of speech. This ninth feature, which completes the trilogy, asks us to accept some of the apes speaking more eloquently than the human creatures who want to kill them (though others still use sign language), and makes that easy to do by giving the animals vibrant souls. \u201cThey will see we are not savages,\u201d says the apes\u2019 leader, Caesar, whose intelligence is exceeded only by his naivet\u00e9.Caesar is played, as he was twice before, by the medium\u2019s pre-eminent practitioner of motion capture,       Andy Serkis.       Volumes have been written about Mr. Serkis since he appeared as Gollum in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d films. I\u2019ve written my share too, but this time around his performance, enhanced and transformed by ever more elegant technology, is so subtle, complex and convincing that I caught myself wondering at one point where they\u2019d found an ape capable of conveying such an extraordinary range of emotions.The whole production is complex, both emotionally and thematically, and sometimes moves at a deliberate pace, but the narrative line is luminously clear. Coexistence between man and ape has failed. Humanity has been decimated by a simian virus and may not survive. Unless Caesar and his fellow apes can escape from a forest that once served as their refuge, they face extermination in their turn at the hands of an American special forces unit and its commander, a mad renegade and self-styled godhead known only as the Colonel. Woody Harrelson makes the Colonel a commanding figure in more ways than one, with seething ferocity that functions as a grand-opera homage to       Marlon Brando\u2019s       Colonel Kurtz in \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201dThat\u2019s not the only resemblance to the Francis Coppola classic. The \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d series has always had overtones of racial conflict, but this film uses imagery straight out of the Vietnam War to summon up a vision of cultural dominance, and there\u2019s no mistaking the culture in question. The Colonel is obsessed by building a wall with slave labor. The stars and stripes wave over a vast concentration camp that houses ape slaves in subsimian, never mind subhuman, conditions. (In addition to filming a succession of shattering combat scenes, Mr. Reeves and his colleagues, including the cinematographer,       Michael Seresin,        and the production designer,       James Chinlund,        have staged a huge prison break in classic style.)The apes are consistently affecting\u2014as sharply drawn individuals, not just an endangered species\u2014yet they\u2019re never sentimentalized. One of their number, Koba, has already turned on Caesar, started a war with the humans and paid the price for his betrayal; other defections loom. And the apes\u2019 leader must confront not only the crazed Colonel, but his own rageful need to avenge the loss of his loved ones; showdowns don\u2019t get much more suspenseful than the one in which Caesar finally comes upon his nemesis and closes in for the kill.The dominant tone of the film is dark, though with plenty of dramatic and visual relief. Some of it comes in comic form\u2014tragicomic, really\u2014courtesy of Bad Ape, a desperate little chimp, voiced to plaintive perfection by       Steve Zahn,        who\u2019s been living as a hermit when he\u2019s discovered by Caesar\u2019s tribe. (Bad Ape picked up his name and his fractured English in a zoo where he lived until the simian flu outbreak.) Other sequences carry religious connotations, some of them lyrical\u2014the tribe\u2019s arduous journey to a promised land\u2014and some needlessly literal. (Caesar\u2019s quasi-crucifixion in the concentration camp may have seemed a good idea on paper. On screen it\u2019s an off-putting clich\u00e9.)The most human of the humans, a girl called Nova, is a mute war orphan played by Amiah Miller. In the first two installments of the original series a character with the same name was played by       Linda Harrison.       This child, though, befriended by the apes and given a name they\u2019ve borrowed from an old Chevy Nova nameplate, is a touchingly new creation in a film that feels newly minted, and daringly conceived on an epic scale. It\u2019s as if no one bothered to tell the filmmakers that Hollywood doesn\u2019t do grandeur anymore.Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as '\u2018Apes\u2019 Evolves to Deep Feelings, High Drama.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-evolving-deep-feelings-and-high-drama-1499966577", "news_title": "\u2018War for the Planet of the Apes\u2019 Review: Evolving Deep Feelings and High Drama", "keywords": " andy serkis,arts in review, cesar, mark bomback, matt reves,war for the planet of the apes, woody harrelson,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Communications Commission opened a new inquiry into ways to curb unwanted robocalls Thursday, with the aim of deterring use of fake phone numbers\u2014a tactic known as spoofing that has been a major factor in the current epidemic.Robocalls recently have run at a rate of more than 2.5 billion a month, according to some estimates, despite multiple efforts by the FCC and Congress to prevent them.A big part of the problem is that technology advances have made robocalls cheap and easy to place, increasing their appeal to some marketers as well as scam artists. New technology enabling spoofing, in which callers use falsified phone numbers, boosts the odds a consumer will answer, often by making it appear the call is from nearby. Many of the calls actually come from overseas.FCC Chairman       Ajit Pai       is trying to put more muscle into the agency\u2019s efforts to combat illegal and fraudulent robocalls. Last month, the FCC proposed a record $120 million fine against a Miami man who the agency said was responsible for making almost 100 million falsified robocalls in late 2016.On Thursday the FCC voted to open a new proceeding that is expected to eventually lead to a system allowing telecommunications carriers to authenticate a call\u2019s origins before completing it, with the aim of deterring spoofing. The authentication system could give consumers the option of blocking calls that aren\u2019t authenticated.The commission already is considering possible rules allowing telecommunications firms to block robocalls from unassigned or invalid numbers.But cracking down on robocalls and spoofing remains tricky, because phone companies generally are obligated to complete calls. The constant reassignment of phone numbers creates further problems in determining which calls are legitimate and which aren\u2019t. And there are even legitimate uses of spoofing-type technology in some circumstances.That has made some carriers nervous about the planned FCC crackdown, particularly smaller ones.USTelecom, a trade association, cheered the FCC action.\u201cThere are few things more annoying for consumers these days than the seemingly endless stream of robocalls they receive on their home or wireless phones,\u201d USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter said. \u201cThere\u2019s no single solution, but the FCC\u2019s inquiry could be an important element to finding an additional way to stop some of these illegal calls and help restore confidence in the caller ID system.\u201dThe robocalling problem has reached a size that makes it difficult to ignore. Robocalling generates the largest number of consumer complaints to both the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission.The FTC received about 5.3 million complaints about telemarketing calls during 2016, compared with 3.6 million the year before. The FCC gets about 200,000 complaints each year concerning unwanted calls.The number of robocalls has fluctuated but generally runs above 2 billion a month in the U.S., according to data from YouMail, a call management firm that helps consumers avoid them.Write to John D.

Yet dry Rieslings are widely produced, all over the world. Why don\u2019t more people realize that?The Germans must shoulder a large share of the blame, thanks to the enormous incursion into the U.S. of cheap, sweet wines from that country a few decades ago. Some were Riesling and some were not, but collectively they left a lasting scar. And while those bad old days are long gone, the unfortunate stereotype lives on.The many types and styles of Riesling range from extremely dry to extremely sweet; there\u2019s sparkling Riesling too. And yet the grape\u2019s great versatility may be its biggest downfall. As Ernst Loosen, owner of Dr. Loosen winery in Mosel, Germany, noted in an email, \u201cIt seems that the average consumer can only handle one definition of a grape variety. It\u2019s too difficult to keep things straight when it can be made in so many different styles.\u201dMr. Loosen produces both dry and sweet Riesling in Germany and coproduces the Eroica Riesling in Washington State with       Bob Bertheau,        head winemaker of Chateau Ste. Michelle. Mr. Bertheau\u2019s winery claims to be the largest single producer of Riesling in the world, and its offerings are accordingly diverse. Mr. Bertheau, who makes 10 different Rieslings, spends a great deal of time trying to persuade drinkers that Riesling is sweet not by definition \u201cbut by the winemaker\u2019s choice.\u201dMany Rieslings come labeled with ostensibly helpful designations such as \u201cdry\u201d or \u201coff-dry\u201d or \u201csemi-dry\u201d\u2014or, in German, \u201ctrocken\u201d or \u201chalbtrocken\u201d (dry or half-dry). But these terms can cause even greater confusion. Is an off-dry Riesling sweeter than semi-dry Riesling, or is it the reverse? And is semi-dry Riesling really a different way of saying semi-sweet? (Yes, it is.)Riesling producers in Alsace often indicate the relative dryness of their wines by means of a scale that ranges from 1 to 5 with wines rated \u201c1\u201d as the driest. Not all producers, however, choose to rate wines according to this scale on their labels.The Germans have two official classification systems for quality Rieslings. The VDP was specifically created for dry wines. In this system, the single-vineyard Grosses Gew\u00e4chs Rieslings (known as GGs) rate as the best-quality wines. The long-established Pr\u00e4dikat system classifies Rieslings in ascending order of ripeness\u2014from Kabinett (fully ripened light wines) to Sp\u00e4tlese (later picked grapes, riper wines) to Auslese (select grapes, even later harvest), and so on. The riper the grape, the higher the sugar and, generally speaking, the sweeter the wine.In the EU a dry wine must meet a set of criteria regarding the levels of both acidity and residual sugar; there is no such rule in the U.S. The winemaker alone decides what is considered dry. Some American winemakers adopt a belt-and-suspenders approach: labeling their wines dry on the front label and adding a notation on the back as to where their wine falls on the International Riesling Foundation scale (IRF). This scale, created by an international consortium of Riesling producers, is a different one than the one used by the winemakers of Alsace. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, said Mr. Bertheau, \u201cbut it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dOskar Bynke       of Hermann J. Wiemer Vineyard in the Finger Lakes region of New York uses no such scale on his bottles. He thinks wine drinkers take it too literally. \u201cThey only wanted to drink wines on a certain end of the scale without even tasting the wines,\u201d he said. Mr. Bynke is more interested in making a well balanced Riesling with a \u201cperception\u201d of dryness than one that is totally dry.Many Riesling labels offer no information at all regarding relative sweetness or dryness. A tip: Check the alcohol level. If it\u2019s below 11% there\u2019s a good chance the wine will taste somewhat sweet.The good news: There are more excellent dry Rieslings on the market now than ever before. According to       Terry Theise,        a Boston-based importer of German and Austrian Riesling, he\u2019s selling more dry Riesling.       Evan Spingarn,        German portfolio manager of New York-based wine importer David Bowler Wine, estimated his sales of dry German Riesling rose 75% between 2013 and 2016.Almost all the friends with whom I recently tasted 20 or so Rieslings came to the tasting thinking Rieslings were strictly sweet. I bought bottles from Australia, Austria, Alsace and Germany, as well as a few from Washington State and New York. The cheapest was the 2015 Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling ($9), a simple but attractive wine, and the most expensive was the 2014 Weiser-K\u00fcnstler Steffensberg Riesling ($34), an impressively full-bodied, very dry wine\u2014though most were in the $18-$25 range. They ranged from bone dry to the fruity side of dry, though all were denoted as dry in some fashion.\u2018While those bad old days are long gone, the sweet stereotype lives on.\u2019A few of the wines were both very dry and very high in acidity\u2014almost shrill\u2014proving the point many winemakers have made, that a bit of sugar is often needed to balance out the high-acid Riesling grape. Some of the fruitier favorites included the 2014       Bott-Geyl Riesling       \u201cLes \u00c9l\u00e9ments\u201d ($19), a big, rich Riesling from Alsace, as well as the 2016 Hermann J. Wiemer Dry Riesling ($18) and the soft, full-bodied 2016 Boundary Breaks 239 Riesling ($17), both from New York\u2019s Finger Lakes.The dry-wine diehards among the tasters were particularly keen on the two wines from Kamptal, Austria: the citrusy 2015 Hiedler Urgestein ($26) and the delicious 2015 Schloss Gobelsburg, which was deemed a terrific buy at $15. (2015 was an outstanding vintage in Germany.) The sprightly 2015 Clemens Busch Vom Roten Schiefer Riesling Trocken ($29) from the Mosel region of Germany was a big hit thanks to a penetratingly minerally finish and the 2015 Jochen Beurer Riesling Kieselsandstein ($28) from the little known Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg region in Germany also stood out as a favorite among the very dry Rieslings.The world of dry Riesling is large and often confusing. But enormous enjoyment, even excitement, awaits those willing to risk buying a few bottles and pulling some corks.2014 Bott-Geyl Les \u00c9l\u00e9ments Riesling Alsace France ($19) Alsace Rieslings tend to be bigger and richer than their German counterparts. Case in point: this lush wine with beguiling floral aromas from a top producer and vintage.2015 Clemens Busch Vom Roten Schiefer Riesling Trocken Mosel-Saar-Ruwer ($29) From Clemens Busch, an acknowledged master of dry German Riesling, this is a thrillingly mineral, very dry wine with a bracing, almost electric acidity.2015 Schloss Gobelsburg Riesling Kamptal Austria ($15) Schloss Gobelsburg produces a wide range of well-made wines. This one is a well-priced introduction to Austrian Riesling\u2014crisp and dry with a pleasant citrus note.2015 Jochen Beurer Riesling Kieselsandstein ($28) Produced in the little-known Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg region from 35-year-old Riesling vines, this full-bodied wine is a bit fruity, with aromas of peach and a long mineral finish.2016 Boundary Breaks Dry Riesling 239 Finger Lakes New York ($17) Boundary Breaks owner       Bruce Murray       aims to produce Rieslings to match those from Alsace and Germany. This is a lovely, well-balanced wine on the fruitier side of dry.Email Lettie at wine@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reconsider-riesling-its-not-all-sweet-1499966029", "news_title": "Reconsider Riesling: It\u2019s Not All Sweet", "keywords": "best dry riesling,best rieslings,dry summer white wine,lettie teague,Terry Theise,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,reviews,beverages,tobacco,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"}, {"content": "There\u2019s no grocery store, hospital or police station on Daufuskie, a small island off the coast of South Carolina where the total full-time population is about 400.

He was 61 years old.Mr. Liu, who was serving an 11-year prison sentence for inciting subversion, had been granted medical parole in early June and was receiving treatment under police guard at a hospital in northeastern China.Mr. Liu had been in custody since late 2008 for his role in drafting and promoting a manifesto calling for peaceful political change. Censors have scrubbed any mention of him from China\u2019s media and internet since, and while his 2010 Nobel brought Mr. Liu international acclaim, he was virtually unknown in his own country. China\u2019s government described Mr. Liu as a criminal, and said international calls for his release amounted to interference in the country\u2019s judicial affairs.A brash writer and literary critic, Mr. Liu was an influential figure at Tiananmen Square. He wrote prolifically about the value of individual freedom and nonviolent resistance, despite being banned from publishing inside China. He was an effective organizer and a serial hatcher of petitions and open letters. He spent most of his last 28 years in prison or another form of detention.Over time, many in Chinese pro-democracy circles came to see Mr. Liu as a potentially transformative leader, likening him to South Africa\u2019s       Nelson Mandela       and Czech dissident-turned-president V\u00e1clav Havel. Mr. Havel supported Mr. Liu\u2019s Nobel Prize nomination.At the award ceremony in Oslo, Mr. Liu was represented by an empty chair. Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann read the final statement he gave in court, in which he proclaimed, \u201cI have no enemies and no hatred.\u201dThe award infuriated Chinese authorities. Although the Norwegian Nobel Committee is independent, Beijing blasted Norway\u2019s government and curtailed imports of Norwegian salmon. It also placed Mr. Liu\u2019s wife, the poet Liu Xia, under de facto house arrest.Until the revelation in June that Mr. Liu was diagnosed with late-stage cancer, there had been little news of the dissident. He was the first Nobel Peace laureate to die in custody since       Carl von Ossietzky,        a journalist and critic of Adolf Hitler, succumbed to tuberculosis in a prison hospital in Nazi Germany in 1938.Mr. Liu\u2019s death was announced in a statement posted to the website of the judicial bureau in the city of Shenyang, where he was being treated. It said he died of multiple organ failure.Born in northeastern China\u2019s Jilin province in 1955, Mr. Liu was part of the first generation of intellectuals to emerge after the Cultural Revolution. He received a Ph.D. in literature at Beijing Normal University, and earned a measure of fame with sharp, sometimes savage, attacks on the writing of the time, saying it was too slavishly rooted in Chinese tradition.He was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York in 1989 when students filled Tiananmen Square calling for democratic reforms. He soon boarded a flight to join the protests. Years later, he told filmmaker Carma Hinton that he hesitated while changing planes in Japan, concerned by reports the Communist Party was preparing to crack down on the movement, until he heard the boarding announcement for his flight to Beijing.\u201cI figured, what the heck, live or die, I\u2019ll just go,\u201d he said.Once on the square, the scholar helped organize a pivotal student hunger strike and, near the end, participated in one of his own. With tanks and soldiers closing in on June 4, he helped persuade the remaining students to leave the square to avoid more bloodshed.Rather than follow many other protest leaders into exile, Mr. Liu stayed in Beijing. On June 6, plainclothes police knocked him off his bike and bundled him into a white minivan. Official media labeled him a \u201ckey organizer of the counterrevolutionary insurrection\u201d and he was shipped off to maximum-security Qincheng Prison on the outskirts of the capital.He was released with other Tiananmen prisoners two years later as Beijing sought to repair its international reputation. He soon returned to pushing for democratic reforms\u2014driven, friends said, by anger and guilt over the students who had been killed.\u201cBefore, he was a literature guy. He was always courageous, but he didn\u2019t really care about politics,\u201d said Liu Suli, the founder of an independent bookstore and a Tiananmen participant who occupied the Qincheng cell next to Liu Xiaobo\u2019s and communicated with him frequently through a water pipe.Mr. Liu was unusually direct for a Chinese intellectual, a trait that won him both friends and enemies. Chinese philosophy scholar Xu Youyu described a dinner at which Mr. Liu excoriated       Kuai Dafu,        a prominent leftist and former Red Guard leader, for passing around photos of himself posing with Mao Zedong and other top leaders.\u201cKuai Dafu, this is shameful behavior! So you had a glorious past. What about your present?\u201d Mr. Xu recalls Mr. Liu saying to a speechless Mr. Kuai. Efforts to reach Mr. Kuai For comment about the exchange weren\u2019t successful.Mr. Liu wrote voluminously on political topics for overseas Chinese-language websites, sometimes using expatriate friends\u2019 computers to email essays to editors when authorities cut off his home internet access. He claimed to have read the complete works of Karl Marx, and criticized Mao Zedong as an aspiring emperor only faintly acquainted with Marxism.In 1996, after he openly attacked the government\u2019s policies on Taiwan and Tibet, he was sentenced to three years in a labor camp.Veteran Chinese activists said it was primarily his skill as an organizer that worried authorities. He assisted parents whose children were killed in the June 4 crackdown in setting up a group, the Tiananmen Mothers, to press the government to own up to the killings. Later, he helped establish and run the Chinese branch of free-speech group PEN International.In 2008, Mr. Liu worked with a small group of activist writers and scholars to draft and promote Charter 08, which advocated free elections and separation of powers. The document was signed by more than 300 human-rights activists, journalists, lawyers, scholars and former Communist Party officials.\u201cIt was the first time since 1989 that you had so many intellectuals united together and organized behind one initiative. That\u2019s what scared the government,\u201d said Yu Jie, an activist writer who helped draft the text.Some participants in the Chinese democracy movement took exception to Mr. Liu\u2019s insistence on nonviolence. But Mr. Yu described Mr. Liu as being uniquely able to command respect from both younger and older generations of activists. \u201cA lot of people signed it without really looking at it, just because Liu Xiaobo asked them to.\u201dMr. Liu was detained by police on Dec. 8, 2008, two days before the release of the charter. On Christmas Day the following year, he was declared guilty of inciting subversion.When he heard the news of his Nobel Prize, his wife said, Mr. Liu wept, dedicating it to \u201call the lost souls\u201d of the Tiananmen protests. The award inspired some supporters to gather financial and organizational resources around the hope that Mr. Liu might emerge from prison to lead a re-energized democracy movement.\u201cThere\u2019s no opposition party, no civil society, no independent religion,\u201d said Wang Lixiong, a novelist and friend of Mr. Liu\u2019s. \u201cLiu Xiaobo was the only really concrete hope they had.\u201dMr. Liu is survived by his wife. The two married in 1996, in a ceremony at the labor camp attended by half a dozen friends. He has a son, Liu Tao, from a previous marriage.Some friends said they urged Mr. Liu to take Ms. Liu to live abroad, but were rebuffed. Addressing Ms. Liu in his final court statement in 2009, he said his love for her was \u201cso full of remorse and regret that it at times makes me stagger under its weight.\u201d\u201cThat was a central thing about him: He didn\u2019t think about consequences. He couldn\u2019t. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t have done anything,\u201d said Liu Suli, the bookstore owner.In recent years, Chinese President       Xi Jinping       has moved aggressively to quash dissent, saying the country faces a grave threat from hostile forces that want to undermine its rise. Veteran activists say the opposition movement Mr. Liu helped build is now scattered and weakened.\u201cIn the last seven years, he\u2019s been forgotten,\u201d said Mr. Yu, the dissident writer. \u201cI think we were overly optimistic.\u201dWrite to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Activist Won Peace Prize From Prison.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nobel-laureate-liu-xiaobo-who-fought-for-democracy-in-china-dies-at-61-1499953234", "news_title": "Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, Who Fought for Democracy in China, Dies in Police Custody", "keywords": "chinese dissidents,chinese protest,dissidents in china,human rights,nobel peace prize,peace laureates, Liu Xiaobo,Liu Xiaobo,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,obituaries,routine general news"}, {"content": "Now that Senate Republican leaders have released the latest version of their health bill, here\u2019s a closer look at how it diverges from the House-passed version and from the 2010 Affordable Care Act.What the ACA does: People who don\u2019t get insurance on the job can get tax credits to offset their premiums, and in some cases to lower their out-of-pocket costs, for plans purchased on the insurance exchanges. The credits take into account income, age and the local cost of insurance.What the House bill would do: People without employer-sponsored coverage can get tax credits, but they would vary largely based on age. For many people, the credits would be smaller than under the ACA. Individuals can use the credits for plans sold anywhere, not just on the exchanges.What the Senate bill would do: The Senate\u2019s approach is closer to the ACA\u2019s. The tax credits would be larger for people with low incomes, those who live in areas with high medical costs, or older Americans. As in the House bill, many people would get smaller tax credits than under the ACA. People could also use the tax credits to buy catastrophic health plans with lower premiums and higher deductibles that mainly pay for three primary-care visits a year. They could also for the first time use health savings accounts to pay for premiums.In addition, the bill allows insurers to sell cheaper health plans that don\u2019t comply with any ACA requirements if they also separate plans on ACA marketplaces that do comply. The bill sends funding to insurance companies that would help keep prices on the marketplaces down.What the ACA does: The law provides enhanced federal funding to states that expand Medicaid eligibility for residents up to 133% of the poverty level. About 14 million new enrollees have been added as 31 states and the District of Columbia expanded that eligibility, with states picking up very little of the cost.What the House bill would do: The Medicaid expansion would freeze in 2020, becoming limited to current enrollees. States would have to make up the difference in cost if they wanted to maintain the expansion for new enrollees.Funding for the broader Medicaid program would change from a guaranteed matching-fund system to either a block grant or a per capita cap. The result would be 14 million fewer Medicaid beneficiaries through 2026, compared with the ACA, according to the Congressional Budget Office.What the Senate bill would do: Enhanced federal funding for the expansion would roll back over three years, beginning in 2021. States could choose between block grants or per capita caps, but both options would curb their overall federal Medicaid funding. States could add a requirement that some people must work to get Medicaid. States could also get exemptions from the spending limits during certain public health emergencies. A separate $45 billion fund will also be created specifically to fund opioid treatment programs.What the ACA does: Obamacare, as it is known, imposed a number of taxes to help fund health-insurance subsidies. These include a tax on health insurers, a so-called Cadillac tax on generous employer health plans (which has been delayed), a medical-device tax and a tax on individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year.What the House bill would do: The majority of the ACA\u2019s taxes would be repealed, amounting to more than $590 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. The bill does retain the much-debated Cadillac tax, but delays its implementation until 2026.What the Senate bill would do: The bill retains several of the ACA\u2019s taxes, including a 3.8% tax on investment income and a 0.9% tax on wealthy individuals. The Cadillac tax would be retained but wouldn\u2019t go into effect until 2026. It would knock down the ACA\u2019s other taxes, including taxes on indoor tanning, repeal limits on contributions to flexible-spending accounts and health-insurance premiums. The tax on medical devices would also be repealed.What the ACA does: Most health-insurance plans in the small group and individual market must cover 10 benefit categories that include hospitalization, maternity care and mental health. People with pre-existing health conditions can\u2019t be denied coverage or charged higher premiums. Insures can\u2019t charge older adults more than three times the premium amount charged to younger people.What the House bill would do: States could get waivers allowing them to roll back the 10 required benefits. States could also use waivers to let insurers charge older adults premiums five times higher than younger people. Other waivers would let insurers temporarily charge people with pre-existing health conditions higher premiums if they let their coverage lapse. At the same time, states would get $138 billion over 10 years for policies that help people with expensive conditions afford premiums.What the Senate bill would do: Insurers would still have to cover people with pre-existing conditions without charging them higher premiums, though people who let their coverage lapse would have to wait six months before getting coverage. The bill sets aside money for states that pursue waivers through the Department of Health and Human Services. These waivers would let them roll back ACA regulations, including the 10 required health benefits.Separately, the bill would allow insurers to sell plans that don\u2019t comply with any ACA rules off the law\u2019s exchanges. Those plans wouldn\u2019t be eligible for tax credits.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-senate-health-bill-compares-to-house-bill-obamacare-1499965411", "news_title": "How the Senate Health Bill Compares to House Bill, Obamacare", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,senate health bill,senate republicans,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014French President       Emmanuel Macron       on Thursday pushed Germany to step up commitments to the eurozone with more investment as he met with Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        saying Berlin has benefited from a dysfunctional currency bloc and the weakness of other economies.The French leader said the eurozone has deepened disparities, loading indebted nations with yet more debt and making competitive countries even more competitive.France\u2019s public debt stands at more than 96% of economic output, compared with 68.3% in Germany at the end of last year. Unemployment is above 9% in France but closer to 4% in Germany.Mr. Macron is calling for a shared eurozone budget that could be used to for a variety of reasons, including helping currency members in economic distress, believing that would help address flaws revealed by the 2010 debt crisis.\u201cGermany has benefited from these malfunctions of the eurozone. This situation is not healthy because it is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Macron said in an interview with French regional paper Ouest France and the German Funke Media Group.For the eurozone to have a future, the French leader said, it must have \u201cpowerful solidarity mechanisms.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s leaning on Germany is his latest salvo in an attempt to strike a new deal for the eurozone.As part of France\u2019s side of the bargain, the 39-year-old has set in motion a fast-track parliamentary procedure to loosen France\u2019s rigid labor laws and is taking austerity measures to bring the country\u2019s deficit within European rules. Berlin has long called for such policies, but successive French governments have resisted when confronted with street protests and political opposition in France.\u201cGermany has to shift, like France has to shift,\u201d Mr. Macron said in the interview.The French leader said Germany should assist with a stimulus of public and private investment in Europe and work with France to find \u201cthe right macroeconomic plan.\u201dMs. Merkel has signaled Germany is open to Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas on changing how the eurozone works. But she has also expressed caution about Germany underwriting the liabilities of countries she says should accept their responsibilities on a national level.Ms. Merkel instead puts greater emphasis on countries harmonizing their tax regimes and labor laws.\u201cA standstill in Europe is close to being a setback,\u201d Ms. Merkel said at a news conference after meeting Mr. Macron. \u201cIn this respect, we need a dynamic, and part of this is economic convergence of eurozone member states as much as instruments that help make us independent.\u201dAt the news conference, Mr. Macron stepped back from criticism of Germany\u2019s competitive advantage in the eurozone, saying his comments in the French press were reported ambiguously. Instead, he stressed that Germany implemented economic overhauls 15 years ago from which the country is now benefiting.\u201cIn our relationship, we give lessons to nobody,\u201d Mr. Macron said.Ms. Merkel said, \u201cWe have the utmost interest in all countries of the eurozone and the European Union being strong. That\u2019s why we follow French reforms with great interest [...] and with the hope that France will emerge stronger.\u201dThe two leaders were meeting in Paris Thursday as part of an annual Franco-Germany cabinet meeting. Before sitting down with ministers, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron visited a center for promoting exchanges between young French and German people.The two leaders participated in language learning games, introducing themselves in each other\u2019s languages and fielding questions on topics from rules banning headscarves in French schools to teaching languages to refugees.\u201cTensions are always born from misunderstandings.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.1. Flat Earnings ExpectedAnalysts are expecting Wells Fargo to post per-share earnings of $1.01 for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. That would match the figure the company earned a year earlier. Analysts\u2019 forecasts declined in the wake of the bank\u2019s first-quarter earnings report. At the end of March, analysts had forecast Wells Fargo would generate $1.04 a share in the second quarter, according to FactSet.2. Revenue May RiseRevenue of $22.47 billion is forecast, compared with the $22.16 billion reported in the year-earlier quarter.3. Capital ReliefWells Fargo investors sighed in relief after the Federal Reserve passed its capital plan in late June. That gives the bank the ability to boost its stock dividend and share buybacks, pending board approval. Analysts for months have pressed the bank\u2019s management about its so-called capital-plan submission, especially after the regulatory scrutiny Wells Fargo has received from its sales-practices scandal, ensuing federal and state investigations and an initial failure related to its so-called living will.4. Time for GrowthWhile concerns about Wells Fargo\u2019s recent sales-practices scandal have begun to fade, those have been replaced by worries about the bank\u2019s ability to generate growth. In the absence of that, investors have focused on the bank\u2019s ability to cut costs, which have been elevated, in part due to the scandal. In the continued low-interest-rate environment, though, even that might not be enough to meaningfully improve returns on equity.5. Divestiture DownloadIn late June, Wells Fargo said it would sell its commercial insurance businesses to privately held USI Insurance Services. This the bank said would allow it to continue its focus on \u201ccore banking product and services.\u201d The divestiture includes its insurance brokerage and consulting practice, as well as employee benefits and property and casualty practices, among other business divisions but not personal insurance. Finance chief       John Shrewsberry       has said other divestitures are possible.

Earnings Expected to RiseEarnings of $1.58 a share are the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. That would represent about a 3% increase from the $1.55 a share the company earned in the same period a year earlier. Expectations for this quarter have been on a roller-coaster ride in recent months. They were at $1.59 a share just before the presidential election, according to FactSet estimates, and jumped to $1.66 earlier this year. Forecasts fell back as the second quarter progressed.2. Higher Revenue as WellRevenue of $24.96 billion is forecast, compared with the $24.38 billion reported in the year-earlier quarter.3. Deal Door Open?Even though another suitor agreed to buy U.K. payments firm             Worldpay                   Group PLC after J.P. Morgan made a preliminary takeover approach, it signaled the door is open for the bank to pursue other large deals. Those were largely off-limits in the years following the financial crisis as regulators looked to tighten the reins on big banks. Reports of J.P. Morgan\u2019s approach followed its passing grade on the recent industrywide stress tests, which allowed it to return more capital to shareholders.4. Regulatory Respite?The Treasury Department in June released a nearly 150-page report rethinking many of the rules governing the U.S. financial sector. There was a lot of overlap between this and J.P. Morgan chief       James Dimon\u2019s       vocal regulatory suggestions over the past several months. So investors will be more eager than ever to hear what is on Mr. Dimon\u2019s mind when it comes to how regulation may progress. Given even more import to his musings, Mr. Dimon is on President Trump\u2019s business advisory council and is chairman of the Business Roundtable.5. Trading Headwinds LikelyChief Financial Officer       Marianne Lake       said the bank\u2019s second-quarter trading, as of a late May investor presentation, had fallen about 15% compared with a year ago. But at the time she didn\u2019t sound too many alarms since second-quarter trading revenue declines are typically expected after a seasonal first-quarter surge. She then said fixed-income trading had fallen while equities trading was up slightly, particularly corporate derivatives and prime brokerage.Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 12:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-things-to-watch-in-j-p-morgans-results-1499963990", "news_title": "5 Things to Watch in J.P.

MFC 1.77%       is exploring a possible initial public offering or spinoff of its John Hancock Financial Services Inc. unit, according to people familiar with the plans, as life insurers continue to struggle with low interest rates and other challenges to the business.If it proceeds with a breakup of the Toronto-based company, Manulife would be the latest life insurer to hive off a large part of its business. Industry executives have often cited the duress low interest rates put on some of their basic products. A move by Manulife would follow rival insurers             MetLife Inc.        MET 0.35%       and             AXA SA        AXAHY 0.24%       in shedding large U.S. operations built around sales of life insurance, retirement-income annuities and other savings products to American families.Manulife has been under pressure from some of its shareholders to sell John Hancock after years of disappointing returns from the U.S. unit, according to two people familiar with the company.Manulife\u2019s stock has gained 7% on the New York Stock Exchange since its acquisition of John Hancock in April 2004. That compares with a 118% gain in the S&P 500.Manulife entered the U.S. life-insurance market with its roughly $10.3 billion purchase of the Boston-based insurer founded in 1862. The deal was announced with great fanfare as the keystone of the Canadian insurer\u2019s global strategy to expand in the U.S. But after years of disappointing returns from the business, which recently accounted for nearly 60% of Manulife\u2019s assets under management and administration, the Canadian insurer is instead focusing on expanding in Asia.As recently as two years ago, Manulife reviewed plans that included a possible spinoff of the U.S. business. That proposal was dropped at the time.Manulife\u2019s potential IPO or spinoff follows some months of work by investment bank             Morgan Stanley                   to sell pieces or all of the John Hancock unit, one person said.At recent analyst and investor events, Manulife executives have discussed shedding some weak parts of John Hancock. These included at least some blocks of long-term-care insurance and lifetime-income guarantees, according to a company presentation. Those are among the products harmed the most by low interest rates. Long-term-care policies typically pay for in-home aides or nursing homes. John Hancock quit selling stand-alone long-term-care policies to individuals last year.Roy Gori,        who will become Manulife\u2019s chief executive in October after current CEO Don Guloien retires, said during a session with investors in Hong Kong last month that he was \u201cimpatient\u201d to shed the businesses.At issue for most life-insurance firms is simple economics around policies. Many consumers buy long-term-care policies when they are in their 60s but don\u2019t file claims until they are in their 80s. This means insurers are exposed to decades of interest-rate risk.Global interest rates have been near zero for almost an entire decade, and insurers have earned far less in investment income on older versions of the policies than anticipated when sold. Some have taken repeated charges against earnings to reflect the policies\u2019 poor financial results.In addition to a potential move by Manulife, MetLife is nearing the final stages of divesting much of its U.S. retail-life insurance business\u2014the historical core of the company. Analysts estimate that MetLife\u2019s spinoff, named Brighthouse Financial, will have about $11 billion of adjusted book value, which is its assets minus liabilities.Meanwhile, Paris-based insurance conglomerate AXA is planning to take its U.S. life-insurance operations public with a book value of about $14 billion to $15 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Over the past several years, some life insurers have sought to sell blocks of out-of-favor product lines to eliminate the earnings drag. But buyers have been scarce for large deals, and striking a pact can involve booking a large loss for the parent.

The unit also accounted for almost 60% of Manulife\u2019s C$1.004 trillion in assets under management and administration at the end of the first quarter, according to filings.John Hancock\u2019s businesses include selling life insurance, mutual funds and other investment products to individuals and running 401(k) retirement-savings programs for employers. Outside the U.S., Manulife offers investment management, retirement funds, real-estate and wealth-management services in Canada and throughout Asia.Manulife\u2019s U.S. long-term-care policies and certain other contracts with long-term guarantees that it has been seeking to sell have a combined book value of C$12.5 billion, according to an estimate by RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic.Divesting John Hancock would allow Manulife to free up regulatory capital and could add $5 a share to Manulife\u2019s stock price of roughly C$24 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, said Mr. Mihelic in a research report.Manulife\u2019s shares rose 2% to $19.83 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.Write to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com, Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com and Jacquie McNish at Jacquie.McNish@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 12:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/manulife-exploring-ipo-or-spinoff-for-john-hancock-unit-1499963316", "news_title": "Manulife Exploring IPO or Spinoff for John Hancock Unit", "keywords": "insurer earning,insurer earnings,john hancock ipo,life insurance market,manulife john hancock spinoff,John Hancock Financial Services,Manulife Financial,MFC,MetLife,MET,AXA,AXAHY,CS.FR,corporate changes,plans,strategy,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,divestments,new companies creation,demergers,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,insurance,life insurance,financial investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Citigroup Inc.        C -0.28%       is among the large banks that report second-quarter results Friday morning. Here\u2019s what to look for:1. Profit DropAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a decline in profit and revenue. They predict earnings of $1.21 a share for the quarter, which would be down from $1.24 in the same period a year earlier. Revenue is expected to shrink by 1% to $17.367 billion, from $17.548 billion a year earlier.2. Trading PlacesThe big reason analysts have cited for a drop in Citigroup results is tepid activity in its core Wall Street trading business, a switch from strong growth last year. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. forecast 10%-plus declines in trading revenue from a year ago, driven by low volatility and a falloff in new bond issuance. That may be somewhat offset by Citigroup\u2019s gains in market share in investment banking businesses, such as mergers and acquisitions.3. Stock Momentum Continues?Citigroup has been the best-performing stock among the six biggest U.S. banks so far in 2017. A big reason, analysts say, has been anticipation of a jump in dividends and share buybacks. The bank delivered in June, when it said the Federal Reserve cleared Citi to pay out $19 billion over the next year. Investors will now be turning to the core business to look for other catalysts.4. Card ProfitsFollowing a two-year revamp of its rewards credit cards and a new partnership with Cotsco Wholesale Corp., Citigroup has forecast that those investments will start to pay off in the second half of 2017. Success on that front would be a boost for Citigroup, but troubles at retail partners or an unexpected uptick in delinquencies could sting.5. Short-Term ThinkingWhile             Bank of America Corp.       has warned about the impact of falling 10-year Treasury note yields, Citigroup has said that its interest income is more closely tied to the short-term yields determined by Fed policy. That is in part because Citigroup is bigger in short-term credit-card loans than in long-term mortgages. So it may be less affected than peers by the flattening yield curve of rising short-term rates and flat-to-down long-term rates.Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 12:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-things-to-watch-in-citigroups-results-1499963782", "news_title": "5 Things to Watch in Citigroup\u2019s Results", "keywords": " 2q earnings, bank earnings, bank profit,citigroup earnings preview, interest income, lending, second-quarter earnings, trading,Citigroup,C,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "Regarding       James Piereson       and Naomi Schaefer Riley\u2019s \u201cBig Foundations Double Down on Government Mistakes\u201d (op-ed, July 8): Heron invests all its assets to help people and communities help themselves out of poverty.

Both men see advantage in bolstering ties, as Mr. Macron looks to raise his global profile and Mr. Trump finds himself increasingly isolated abroad.The White House said the two leaders could discuss trade and climate change\u2014two areas where they have opposing views. Mr. Macron has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord.In an interview with the French regional paper Ouest France published Thursday morning, Mr. Macron levied strong criticism over the effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency on the global order.\u201cThe Western world has been cracking since the American election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States expresses doubts about multilateralism, the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and the climate. ... In this context, Europe is an absolute necessity.\u201dWhite House officials described the French leader in flattering terms before the trip. But Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship-building efforts abroad this week are unlikely to break through in Washington, which has been rocked by the revelation that Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016 met with a Russian lawyer after being promised damaging information about Mrs. Clinton that he was told had been gathered as part of a Russian government effort to boost Mr. Trump.Congressional investigators have called for the younger Mr. Trump to testify, as a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department this year probes whether the president\u2019s campaign associates colluded with Moscow to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.The two leaders are set to hold a news conference Thursday evening, likely the first time Mr. Trump will face questions in such a forum about his son\u2019s meeting with the Russian lawyer.The president is also set to speak in public for the first time since he returned from the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg on Saturday. On Wednesday morning, he tweeted in defense of his son and his administration, saying: \u201cThe W.H. is functioning perfectly.\u201dMr. Trump held a working lunch with Gen.       Joe Dunford,        the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other U.S. military officials, while Mr. Macron met separately with German Chancellor       Angela Merkel.       First lady Melania Trump visited a children\u2019s hospital shortly after their arrival in Paris.Mr. Trump was treated to an elaborate military ceremony at the Hotel National des Invalides, built in the 1670s to care for injured war veterans, before Mr. Macron led him on a tour of the building, which houses the Tomb of Napoleon. They were accompanied by their wives, who split off to tour the Cathedral Notre Dame as the leaders traveled to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for bilateral talks.Messrs. Trump and Macron will hold a bilateral meeting, currently scheduled to last an hour and 15 minutes, that is expected to focus on Syria and counterterrorism efforts.On Thursday evening, the two leaders and their wives are expected to dine at the luxurious restaurant Le Jules Verne on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower. On Friday, the Trumps will be the guests of honor at the Bastille Day celebrations, which will be led by U.S. forces in commemoration of the centennial. The Trumps are scheduled to depart for Washington shortly afterward.The French President has faced criticism from leftist political rivals for inviting Mr. Trump. Speaking alongside Ms. Merkel earlier Thursday, Mr. Macron said he was surprised at the criticism because the meeting has greater historical than political significance.\u201cWe should never forget that our history is greater than us. There are twists and turns, characters and temperaments, the times we are living in, but that should never make us forget that,\u201d Mr. Macron said, standing alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Elys\u00e9e Palace.Mr. Macron has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord and launched a website to lure researchers and investors in renewable energy to emigrate to France.\u201cWe have confronted each other on this subject at international meetings. He knows it and I know it,\u201d Mr. Macron said. The French leader added he still hopes to convince Mr. Trump to return to the Paris Accord.The two leaders have also clashed on trade. In the interview in Ouest France, Mr. Macron called the \u201crenaissance of a protectionist temptation in the U.S.,\u201d led by Mr. Trump, an \u201cerror\u201d and said it was \u201cthe twin brother of nationalism and that leads to war.\u201dTrump administration officials characterized the two leaders\u2019 relationship as strong. In a White House briefing on Tuesday, a senior official described Mr. Macron as an \u201cinnovative, charismatic guy\u201d who has \u201cbeen a real trailblazer\u201d and said the nations share more similarities than differences.\u201cThere are some issues where we see the world a little bit differently, but many issues where we see the world more or less the same,\u201d the official said. The official also praised France for its commitment to NATO, noting that the country already commits 1.8% of its gross domestic product to military spending. \u201cFrance is far and away one of the strongest military members of the alliance,\u201d the official said.French officials say there is a good working relationship between Messrs. Macron and Trump because they share an approach to diplomacy: being frank and direct.\u201cMy philosophy is that even when we have disagreements we must continue to talk; indeed I\u2019d say above all when we have disagreements,\u201d Mr. Macron said alongside Ms. Merkel, before meeting Mr. Trump in Paris.Messrs. Trump and Macron had a rocky start to their relationship following Mr. Macron\u2019s victory in May after a campaign in which Mr. Trump had expressed support for his opponent, far-right politician       Marine Le Pen.In their first meeting, at a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the two leaders\u2019 handshake devolved into a death grip, in which their knuckles were described as turning white and their jaws as clenching. Mr. Macron later told a French newspaper the move was \u201cnot innocent\u201d and was intended to show that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cmake small concessions, not even symbolic ones.\u201dWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Trump to Meet With Macron in Paris.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 12:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-travel-to-paris-amid-controversy-at-home-1499877336", "news_title": "Trump Meeting Macron in Paris Amid Controversy at Home ", "keywords": "bastille day celebrations,u.s. foreign relations,u.s. french relations,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Danny Heitman\u2019s \u201cA Secondhand Book Is a $3 Time Machine\u201d (op-ed, June 28) brings to mind George Bernard Shaw.

So why does it still seem like prices are going up all around us, whether it\u2019s airfares, concert tickets or health-insurance premiums? Are the numbers lying?In fact, math says that most people can experience prices going up even if the average is going down\u2014especially if we\u2019re talking about the mean, where you add up all the prices and divide that sum by the total number of items. If most prices go up a little but the highest prices fall substantially, the latter decline will dominate in the calculation, pushing the mean downward.Average prices for, say, that flight to San Francisco might go down, but if that\u2019s just because the price tag on first-class tickets has fallen, those of us flying economy will never notice. A few years ago, average ticket prices at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City went down by almost $20\u2014but largely because the $360 tickets had dropped to $330, even as the $20 tickets that I buy went up to $25. Nobody I know felt the benefit.Sometimes, the mean can fall even as almost everyone sees prices going up. Consider a hotel with 100 reasonably priced rooms and one spectacularly lavish, exorbitant penthouse suite going for $50,000 a night. If the price of the standard rooms all go up by $10 but the penthouse rate falls by more than $1,000, the mean will go down, although we ordinary folk won\u2019t feel it.The opposite can happen too. For example, the mean price of health-insurance premiums might rise, but that could still be a boon if coverage for the most vulnerable Americans becomes more affordable.A different anomaly affects averages that encompass several groups of results, such as student grades in different classes. You can actually raise the average grade of two classes simultaneously just by moving one student from one class to the other. The trick is to find a pupil in the better class with a grade that is lower than that class\u2019s average yet still higher than the average of the weaker class. Move that student over to the class with the lower average grade, and both averages will rise.Given these subtleties, some mathematicians consider the median more useful than the mean. The median is the same as the 50th percentile, which tells us something very clear: Half the results are higher than this number, and half of them are lower.The mean tells us something more abstract. If the distribution of numbers isn\u2019t symmetrical, we can get odd results. If the scores in a class of five students are, say, 60, 61, 62, 63 and 100, we find out that more than half of the students in the class are below the mean of 69.2.A similar type of anomaly: If we\u2019re talking about means, almost all of us have an above average number of arms. That\u2019s because most people have two arms, but a few of us have one or none, which makes the mean number of arms a tiny bit less than two. The median is more sensible: The median number of arms is exactly two.But anomalies can happen with medians too. Poverty is sometimes measured as the number of people whose income is less than a certain percentage of the median, perhaps 50%. So if the median income is $50,000 a year, anyone earning less than $25,000 would be counted as living in poverty.The trouble is that the official poverty count could then be reduced in some dubious ways. The obvious way to cut poverty levels is to help everyone earn more than $25,000. But you could also find all of the people earning around $50,000 and give some of their money to the richer people. That could drive the median down to, say, $40,000, at which point all those earning between $20,000 and $25,000 would officially be above the poverty threshold. This isn\u2019t reducing poverty; it\u2019s just fiddling with the numbers.Expressing any set of data as a single number necessarily means losing information, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the statistics are lying. Statistics are precisely defined, and they tell us exactly what they are defined to tell us. If we attribute more meaning to them than that, the error is ours, not theirs.Corrections & Amplifications   The mean of 60, 61, 62, 63 and 100 is 69.2.

When, despite that carnage, the company\u2019s assets double during the same period, even more so.And when 1.68 million of the company\u2019s shares held early last year equal exactly one share today, well, what is going on?The locus of these bizarre doings is             DryShips Inc.,        DRYS -39.84%       a Greek carrier that has been tracing one of the wildest rides in recent stock-market history, causing half a billion dollars of traders\u2019 money to vanish and, it appears, making two wealthy men wealthier.DryShips\u2019 shares occupy a murky world of tiny stocks where information is limited and investors often bet on short-term moves. Worth barely $5 million on the stock market in early November, the company became a hot topic on stock discussion boards when its shares suddenly leapt 1,500% in four trading days.That the company had just disclosed a huge loss and suspended debt payments \u201cto preserve cash liquidity\u201d evidently didn\u2019t matter to buyers who wanted in while the stock was on fire.But even as they were buying, the company was creating vast numbers of new shares. These it was selling at a discount to an obscure British Virgin Islands firm, which was quickly unloading many or all of the new shares.Immediately after the stock\u2019s soaring November flight, it plunged back to earth.Since then, DryShips has repeatedly printed huge numbers of new shares and sold them to the British Virgin Islands firm, on such a scale that virtually every share in existence today has been created since November.In an apparent effort to counter the downward pressure that this new supply of shares put on the price, DryShips used another technique: reverse stock splits.In a typical stock split, a company whose share price has grown high makes the stock more affordable by giving investors two or more shares for each one they hold. The price of each share becomes lower, but an investor\u2019s proportional ownership of the company doesn\u2019t change.In a reverse split, a company with a very low share price forces it higher by making each share represent a larger piece of the company.On Nov. 1, for example, DryShips did a 1-for-15 reverse split. A holder of 15 shares now had just one, but that one share would have a higher price\u2014roughly 15 times the price of one before the split.Behind these maneuvers were two men with seemingly little in common. One is       George Economou,        DryShips\u2019 founder, chairman and chief executive, a resident of Athens who also owns a private fleet of some 100 ships and has gained notice in the art world for his collection of German expressionist paintings.The other is       Marc Bistricer,        a member of Toronto\u2019s tightknit Orthodox Jewish community and a man with almost no public profile. One of the rare media mentions of him was a 2015 report by broadcaster CBC on a rundown Ontario apartment building owned by a company that lists him as an officer and director. Neither man responded to requests for an interview.The DryShips saga began early last year when a British Virgin Islands firm called Kalani Investments Ltd. began approaching companies in the ocean-shipping business with a radical idea to help them raise money.Many companies could use help in that hard-hit industry, including those such as DryShips that operate \u201cdry bulk\u201d ships carrying goods such as coal and ore. A glut of such vessels drove shipping rates to a multi-decade low in February 2016.Kalani\u2019s idea was that it would buy newly issued shares directly from the shipping companies at a discount to the stock-market price, thus injecting cash into the companies. Executives of three Greek shipping companies described such an approach by Kalani. All three said Kalani was controlled by Toronto\u2019s Mr. Bistricer.Among the three executives approached was       Anthony Kandylidis,        DryShips\u2019 chief financial officer. He is a nephew of Mr. Economou, the founder of DryShips, which has offices in Athens but is domiciled in the Marshall Islands. The CFO said he met with Mr. Bistricer in New York a little over a year ago about helping DryShips raise capital.On June 8, 2016, DryShips sold Kalani securities convertible into $5 million worth of new DryShips common shares, which was equivalent to a little under 10% of the shipping company\u2019s market value then. It was a small foretaste of what was to come.Kalani didn\u2019t report a 5% or more stock ownership, as U.S. regulations require, indicating it rapidly sold many of these new DryShips shares. And in succeeding weeks, DryShips\u2019 stock tumbled.By September, DryShips was preparing paperwork to do two things: execute a reverse stock split and issue a far larger batch of securities to Kalani.Issuing so many new shares would normally be unrealistic for a company with a tumbling stock, but on Nov. 9 DryShips\u2019 stock suddenly tripled, ending the day up 133%.             Nasdaq                   temporarily halted trading four sessions later with the stock up 1,500%.What caused the giant rally is unknown; there is no evidence Kalani, DryShips or their principals took any steps to trigger it.When trading resumed two days later, DryShips announced it was selling a second batch of securities to Kalani\u2014securities the offshore firm could convert into $100 million of new DryShips common stock.That was nearly 20 times what the entire company was worth before its stock\u2019s mysterious rally.DryShips gave no information about Kalani in securities filings or public statements when it sold the firm shares, except to say that Mr. Economou wasn\u2019t affiliated with the firm. Details of Kalani\u2019s ownership are protected by secrecy laws in the British Virgin Islands.Despite this extreme common-stock dilution, Mr. Economou was in no danger of losing his control of DryShips. Just two month earlier, he had converted some loans to the company into a new class of preferred shares that carried 100,000 votes apiece. Through other companies he controls, he stood to benefit from the share deluge.DryShips shares by this time were plunging, thanks to the news that many more of them were being created.Even so, investor chat rooms lit up with speculation that another epic rally could be in store, given the sudden inflow of cash to the company\u2019s coffers.

Jerry Brown may have seized the role as a global-warming crusader abroad, but back home he is struggling to unite fellow Democrats and environmentalists around a key piece of his climate-change agenda.Mr. Brown wants the state Legislature to extend California\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which requires businesses here to pay for their carbon-dioxide emissions while also reducing those emissions over time. The extension would be from 2020 through 2030.Facing a key test on his home turf after pledging to defy Republican President       Donald Trump       on climate change, Mr. Brown gave a full-throated endorsement of the program Thursday.Turning to the audience of a packed Sacramento committee room and shouting, the 79-year-old governor warned of a potentially apocalyptic future if climate change continued unabated, with vector-borne diseases, mass migrations, forest fires and a \u201cSouthern California burning up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s real guys\u2014that is what the scientists of the world are saying, so I am not here about some cockamamie legacy that people talk about,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t for me\u2014I am going to be dead! It is for you!\u201dMr. Brown, who typically doesn\u2019t address legislative committee meetings, called the program \u201cthe most efficient, elegant program in the whole world\u201d and warned businesses would face stringent \u201ccommand and control\u201d regulations without it.The program\u2014a key aspect the state hopes to use to reduce CO 2 emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030\u2014has faced\u00a0questions\u00a0as business groups have criticized it as an unconstitutional tax on industry.\u00a0Also contributing to market unease has been uncertainty about whether the program could continue beyond 2020, a benchmark set by the 2006 legislation that led to the program\u2019s creation.The California Chamber of Commerce and the Pacific Legal Foundation sued the state, saying the program was an illegal tax on businesses. A state appeals court rejected their arguments in April, and the California Supreme Court left that decision in place last month.The state\u2019s Chamber of Commerce now supports a cap-and-trade program as an alternative to more direct regulations. The chamber endorsed the governor\u2019s plan on Thursday, saying it \u201cwill provide the least costly path to achieving our climate goals.\u201dMr. Brown wants to insulate the program from future legal challenges by achieving a two-thirds vote of approval in the Legislature\u2014the threshold for all new taxes in the state\u2014as well as extend the program.But the governor is struggling to get Democrats on board, with some more business-friendly members, concerned about the effects on jobs.Environmentalists are also raising objections.Amy Vanderwarker, co-director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance, which advocates for environmental policies aimed at low-income and minority communities, said she opposed the plan.\u201cWe feel like the proposal put forward is actually a step backward for California climate policy, with way too many loopholes for industry that actually make it harder to achieve our 2030 targets,\u201d she said.Money from the quarterly auctions, so far totaling $4.9 billion, has gone toward the state\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction fund, which the state uses to fund various projects. With some of that, the governor is also hoping to fund one of his favored projects: a planned high-speed rail train from Los Angeles to San Francisco.Determining a price for greenhouse gas emissions has been a goal of certain economists for years as a means of curbing those emissions. The argument is that by putting a price on emissions, industry can factor those costs into production and search for greener alternatives. There are various methods for pricing emissions, but the most widely discussed are a carbon tax and cap-and-trade system.Mr. Brown managed to reach a deal with his party\u2019s legislative leaders, but some rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers remain reluctant. He may need to woo Republican support for the plan\u2019s passage by a two-thirds margin.Legislative leaders said they planned a vote early next week.After Mr. Trump said the U.S. would withdraw from the historic Paris climate agreement\u2014which asks developed and developing nations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014Mr. Brown said\u00a0he would join with other\u00a0like-minded jurisdictions nationwide in fulfilling the U.S. obligations without the help of the federal government.Mr. Brown was named a special adviser for states and regions ahead of this year\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference.\u00a0Mr. Brown outlined on Wednesday a joint climate effort with former New York City       Michael Bloomberg       to track climate commitments around the country; he plans to host an international climate conference in San Francisco next year.Proponents of \u00a0California\u2019s\u00a0cap and trade say the program is a model that other countries, including China, have studied, and that it creates a marketplace in which CO 2 emissions can be priced, a goal of some economists for addressing climate change.Business groups and some Republicans have called cap and trade a burdensome regulatory policy that drives employers to competitor states, such as Texas, Nevada or Arizona.John Cox,        a 2018 Republican candidate for California governor, said Mr. Brown\u2019s cap-and-trade plan\u00a0is a tax.\u201cOur goal is not to cooperate with the Democrat leadership\u2019s war on the middle class, but to counter because our ideas about growth, jobs and pocket book issues are better than theirs,\u201d Mr. Cox said.State Assemblyman Rocky Ch\u00e1vez, a Republican, said he met with the governor\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0to discuss Republican concerns. While the proposal has\u00a0some appealing elements, such as a tax break for manufacturers and\u00a0a fee waiver for rural residents, he said, he wants to make sure that the proceeds from cap-and-trade auctions\u00a0will help fund some Republican priorities.Money from the quarterly auctions has gone toward the state\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction fund, which the state uses to fund various projects including high-speed rail, so far totaling $4.9 billion.\u201cIf we can design a cap-and-trade system that could link or align itself with other states, or other countries, to define the price of carbon, then I think that is something that could not just help California, but help the world,\u201d Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said.Some analysts said the legal uncertainty the lawsuit created over the program, and its potential 2020 expiration, roiled quarterly auctions for carbon permits in 2016, causing many businesses to leave these allowances on the table, and causing the price of those permits to plunge on the secondary market.In May 2016, for instance, the state offered about 67.7 million carbon allowances for sale and businesses purchased about 7.3 million.This year, with the state\u2019s success in court, auctions have rebounded and the price for the allowances on the secondary market has risen sharply in recent weeks.In May, at the most recent auction, the state sold all of the roughly 75.3 million credits it put out for bid.\u201cIn the world of large, industrial corporations that need forward planning horizons, certainty is key,\u201d said       Lenny Hochschild,        managing director at\u00a0Evolution\u00a0Markets, an\u00a0institutional\u00a0brokerage service for global energy and environmental markets.Corrections & Amplifications   Michael Bloomberg is a former mayor of New York.

Meanwhile, opposition leaders on Thursday began setting out the price of their support, calling for assurances on issues such as workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection.Lawyers say that failing to pass such legislation before Britain leaves the EU, expected in March 2019, risks exposing businesses and households to legal chaos at the moment of departure.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have something like this, we will end up with a massive hole in our domestic legal system,\u201d said Kieran Laird, head of constitutional affairs at the Brexit unit of law firm Gowling WLG.Brexit Secretary       David Davis       described it as \u201cone of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament\u201d and a milestone on the road to Brexit.The bill isn\u2019t due to be debated in Parliament until the fall but opposition parties were quick to signal they will oppose it becoming law without major changes.One of their shared concerns is that the bill proposes giving government ministers so-called correcting power, or the ability to alter the law where withdrawal from the EU makes an existing law unworkable, for example if it refers to an EU agency that no longer has authority in the U.K.Ministers said the use of these powers will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer described them as \u201cundemocratic, unaccountable and unacceptable.\u201dThe Scottish National Party described the bill as \u201ca power grab.\u201dThe government also looks set for a fight over a decision not to incorporate the EU\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lays down legal, social and economic rights, into U.K. law along with other EU statutes, an omission opposed by both Labour and the smaller, pro-EU Liberal Democrats. The government said existing British law protects human rights.Tim Farron,        leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, said the differences between the parties mean Mrs. May will face \u201ca parliamentary version of guerrilla warfare\u201d when lawmakers debate the bill.Separately Thursday, the U.K. government published three papers setting out its negotiating position on three aspects of the Brexit talks: Ongoing judicial proceedings in European courts, the treatment of nuclear materials, and the post-Brexit privileges of EU officials.The papers highlight the potential for negotiating snags. The EU has said it wants European courts to be able to hear cases against the U.K. covering its time as a member even after Brexit, while the U.K. says only cases that have been brought to court prior to withdrawal should be heard.Appeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Bill Would End EU Law Primacy in U.K..'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 12:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-bill-sets-up-more-brexit-strife-1499962246", "news_title": "British Bill Sets Up More Brexit Strife", "keywords": "brexit,british-eu relations,british politics,uk politics,European Union,U.K. government,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch"}, {"content": "AN HOUR\u2019S drive from Glasgow, on the banks of Scotland\u2019s misty Loch Fyne, the Cairndow Stagecoach Inn makes an unlikely home for poets. At the tartan-carpeted bar, locals gather for themed dances, complete with fog machines and pulsing laser lights. It\u2019s easy to miss a small frame on the wall, which carries a quote from the poet John Keats, who spent a weary night at the roadside stop-off in 1818.In a letter to his younger brother Tom, Keats wrote of the stay: \u201cWe were up at 4 this morning and have walked to breakfast 15 miles through two tremendous Glens.\u201d He described taking a bath in the saltwater lake, opposite the Inn\u2019s windows. \u201cQuite pat and fresh but for the cursed Gad flies,\u201d he wrote.One thing or another had dogged the 22-year-old Keats since leaving London that summer on an epic walking-tour which would stretch over 600 miles. From June through August, he and his friend Charles Brown wound their way through the Lake District up to Scotland, where they trekked the muddy Isle of Mull and climbed the U.K.\u2019s highest peak, Ben Nevis. They began in Lancaster, England, and parted at Scotland\u2019s tip, Inverness, where Keats felt too sick to go on.It was partly a fanboy trip. Scotland in the 1800s\u2014the land of rural poets\u2014was the hottest thing in literary tourism. William Wordsworth and his sister, Dorothy, James Boswell and Samuel Johnson, and the poet Robert Burns had all made well-documented treks through the countryside. Keats, in poor health and poor shoes, wanted to make a pilgrimage of his own. He set out to visit the homes of his poet-heroes, Wordsworth (in England) and Burns (in Scotland).That summer of 1818, Keats was in dire need of a vacation. Already an orphan, he was exhausted from nursing Tom, who was dying of tuberculosis. He had just finished a long poem, \u201cEndymion,\u201d and was steeling himself for harsh reviews (one critic called him an \u201cinfatuated bardling\u201d). \u201cHis world was really breaking up,\u201d Susan Wolfson, a professor of English at Princeton University, later told me. A trip would shake things up, Keats decided. \u201cI purpose within a Month to put my knapsack at my back and make a pedestrian tour through the North of England, and part of Scotland\u2014to make a sort of Prologue to the Life I intend to pursue,\u201d he wrote excitedly in the spring. \u201cI intend to straddle ben Lomond\u2014with my Soul!\u201dKeats lost two brothers and a mother to tuberculosis. He believed himself such a failure at the time of his death (also of tuberculosis), at age 25, that he had engraved on his tombstone the words: \u201cHere lies one whose name was writ in water.\u201d Yet the letters he sent home from Scotland aren\u2019t those of the doomed Romantic he\u2019s come to represent. They\u2019re ironic, self-aware and surprisingly funny about the realities of travel. The weather was bad, the gadflies were annoying and the food consisted almost entirely of oatcakes and eggs. Keats was determined to find on his trip a template for his life going forward.My plans weren\u2019t as grand (nor my circumstances as dire), but I was, like Keats, a keen literary tourist. I, too, wanted to see the birthplace of Robert Burns, and the Scottish landscape that inspired Wordsworth. And I wanted to know what Keats made of it all, at a crossroads in his life, with his best work to come. Plus, there was Scotch to be sampled.Since we couldn\u2019t do the whole tour, my friend and I flew to Glasgow, where we rented a car and drove an hour to Alloway, on Scotland\u2019s western coast. This is Burns territory, where every pub and fish \u2019n\u2019 chips shop, however small, seems to have a portrait of the bard tucked away somewhere. We parked at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, near a sign that read \u201cBirthplace of a Genius.\u201dBy the time Keats made it this far, he had already encountered the first of many roadblocks his trip would offer up. At Wordsworth\u2019s home in England\u2019s Lake District, he arrived to find the poet out, indefinitely. \u201cHe was not at home nor was any Member of his family,\u201d Keats wrote. \u201cI was much disappointed.\u201d He left a note on the poet\u2019s mantle.At Burns\u2019s Cottage, he planned to write a sonnet in honor of the Scottish poet, who had died 22 years earlier. But when he arrived, he found the home converted into a pub, its door guarded by a drunk old man eager to share long-winded anecdotes. \u201cHe is a mahogany faced old Jackass who knew Burns,\u201d Keats complained. \u201cHe ought to be kicked for having spoken to him.\u201d He wrote his tribute anyway, \u201cfor the mere sake of writing some lines under the roof.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cThey are so bad I cannot transcribe them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe flat dog made me write a flat sonnet.\u201dWhen we arrived, the museum\u2019s director at the time, David Hopes, showed me the room where Keats likely stood, fuming. Burns only lived in the house until the age of 7, but the museum possesses the largest collection of Burns manuscripts, and a \u201cBurns Jukebox,\u201d with categories like \u201cPower Ballads\u201d and \u201cTear-jerkers.\u201d We stood on the medieval stone bridge known as Brig o\u2019 Doon where a drunken Tam o\u2019 Shanter, from Burns\u2019s poem, narrowly escapes with his life. We left by way of an oversize granite sculpture of Haggis, the national dish, and the gift shop, where I bought a Burns Cottage snow globe.We drove two hours north to Inveraray Castle, which Keats described as \u201cmodern magnificent.\u201d Just inland from Loch Fyne and open to public tours, the turreted castle is the ancestral home of the Duke of Argyll. The extravagant state dining room featured French tapestry upholstery from the 1780s, a Waterford chandelier and a gaggle of tourists delighted by photos of the 2012 \u201cDownton\u201d Christmas Special, several scenes of which were filmed there.Keats and Brown made good progress, often walking over 20 miles a day. By the time they reached Inveraray, Brown\u2019s feet were blistered, \u201cknock\u2019d up from new shoes,\u201d and Keats ventured into the tiny town (population still under 1,000) on his own to see a play. He found the lake, Loch Fyne, at the edge of town, beautiful, but he disliked the show and the music that came with it. \u201cNothing could stifle the horrors of a solo on the Bag-pipe,\u201d he wrote to Tom. To his sister, Fanny, he sent a goofy poem of simple rhymes with the lines, \u201cThere was a naughty boy / And a naughty boy was he / For nothing would he do / But scribble poetry.\u201dBut by the Isle of Mull, in the Inner Hebrides, the letters betray the first signs of the illness that he never fully shook. He picked up a \u201cslight sore throat\u201d on \u201ca most wretched walk of 37 Miles\u201d across the remote island, where he carried his stockings in his hands and slept in a smoky shepherd\u2019s hut. All the same, he visited and raved about the Isle of Staffa, a rocky formation off Mull. He stopped at Iona, another nearby island, and wandered the Benedictine Abbey and Nunnery founded there before 1200.We skipped the treacherous walk and drove an hour across Mull, which we reached by ferry from the small town of Oban. Keats called this landscape \u201cmost dreary,\u201d but from the windows of our car the desolate rolling hills, punctuated by waterfalls, were breathtaking. Like Keats, we were not prepared for the area\u2019s remoteness. The only passengers on a small ferry to Iona, we arrived tired and hungry, in total darkness, to find the only food available came from a vending machine.\u2018\u2018Nothing could stifle the horrors of a solo on the Bag-pipe,\u2019 wrote Keats.\u2019Keats was willful. His cold didn\u2019t improve\u2014Brown described it as \u201cviolent\u201d\u2014but he was determined to climb Ben Nevis. At 5 a.m., they began their ascent, following a guide in \u201cTartan and Cap.\u201d \u201cAfter much fag and tug and a rest and a glass of whiskey apiece we gained the top of the first rise,\u201d he wrote. They stumbled their way, sometimes on all fours, 4,400 feet above sea level. At the top, he found deep chasms and an all-encompassing mist. \u201cRead me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud / Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!\u201d he wrote at the summit.When we reached the peak, we also found a blanket of white mist, until the clouds cleared suddenly and the valley below revealed itself. In 1819, after his return to London, Keats would have the most productive year of his life, penning his six great odes, including \u201cOde to a Nightingale\u201d and \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn,\u201d and his unfinished epic, \u201cHyperion.\u201d Shoes soaking from the mist, we could see all the way down the mountain to the rolling hills beyond, the land where Keats proposed to \u201cclamber through the clouds and exist.\u201dSTAYING THERE In Alloway, near Burns\u2019s Cottage, the Brig o\u2019 Doon House Hotel features tartan-on-tartan lounge areas and a view of the bridge where Tam o\u2019 Shanter\u2019s mare loses her tail (from about $155 a night; brigodoonhouse.com).

Young people are perfectly happy to share rides with strangers or chip in on a vehicle with friends. Others prefer to pay for access to a car for just a few hours. And there is more and more talk about buying a car and then renting it out, Airbnb fashion.Already, this revolutionary concept is generating tremors in other parts of the economy, as I found in a coast-to-coast, multi-industry survey that gave me an exclusive insight into what seismic changes may afflict, say, men\u2019s haberdashery.\u201cIf you\u2019re self-employed and don\u2019t have to go to an office everyday, you don\u2019t really need to own your own pants,\u201d says Gates Sadderfield, retail visionist at the American Sartorial Institute. \u201cYou might need a pair of pants a few hours a week. So it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a situation where groups of men pool their resources to share pants on a need-to-wear basis. The same goes for quality men\u2019s footwear.\u201dThe fact that men can share the same trousers, sports jackets, dress shirts, ties and even socks is bad news for midmarket haberdashers.\u201cBecause young guys might only need a jacket a couple of times a month, three or four of them could use an app to chip in on a really nice piece of merchandise, instead of the usual drab off-the-rack stuff,\u201d says Iphigenia McNamara, president of Fleeting Fancy, a zeitgeist-monitoring service. \u201cIf I\u2019m Dockers, this stuff has got me quaking in my boots.\u201dBoots are only part of the story. \u201cNobody needs a waffle iron or a pressure cooker on a 24/7 basis,\u201d says Ms. McNamara. \u201cNobody needs a permanent, on-site egg whisk. Sharing infrequently used kitchen equipment by logging onto a reliable website like Communal Cuisine frees up money for more exciting purchases. Like schnapps.\u201dAs the impulse to share replaces the impulse to own, more products will be divided among groups of like-minded consumers. They will drop off jewelry in secure kiosks and prom dresses in gym lockers. Drones will deliver small, rarely used items like cardiac defibrillators.Of course, not everyone is on board with our shared future.

Before you know it, you\u2019re interacting exclusively with people who have the same inseam as you. How does that help make this a more diverse society?\u201dFans of the sharing economy sneer at such criticism. Sure, there will be the occasional glitch.

Signaling the end of the program at the same event would have a certain symmetry, a person familiar with the matter said.ECB officials\u00a0caution that the timeline could yet change if economic data turn out weaker than expected.\u00a0They will gather in Frankfurt on July 19-20\u00a0for the ECB\u2019s next policy meeting, but aren\u2019t expected to announce any major changes yet.The euro rose as much as 0.4 cent against the dollar, to $1.1418, and 10-year German government bond yields jumped to 0.59% from 0.55%. Yields rise as prices fall.Mr. Draghi could use a speech in Jackson Hole to prepare investors for a policy move in September, when ECB officials will have new forecasts of Eurozone growth and inflation, said Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Jefferies in London. The ECB typically waits for a fresh set of forecasts, which are published quarterly, before changing its policy mix.Any move to wind down QE will test the strength of the eurozone economy, with less central-bank support to spur spending and investment by households and businesses.The Jackson Hole symposium, organized by the Kansas City Fed, is an invitation-only event that draws top central bankers and economists from around the world to discuss monetary policy issues behind closed doors. This year\u2019s conference will take place from Aug. 24-26. The list of speakers won\u2019t be published until shortly before the event begins.ECB officials say the most likely scenario is for the bank to reduce QE by \u20ac10 billion a month, starting in January. That would follow the pace of the Federal Reserve, which wound down its own QE program three years ago.ECB officials have been tight-lipped in public about the future of QE after December, as they are wary of triggering an adverse market reaction that could upset the region\u2019s recovery. A hint from Mr. Draghi last month that QE could soon be wound down was enough to roil financial markets and send the euro soaring against the dollar.If the ECB does change course and starts to reduce its stimulus program, it would realign the policies of the world\u2019s two most powerful central banks for the first time in almost four years. The Fed wound down its own QE program in 2014 and has been nudging interest rates higher since December 2015. Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       indicated on Wednesday that that process would continue.The ECB\u2019s bond purchases have helped reinvigorate growth across the 19-nation currency union since it was launched in early 2015. But has been attacked by officials in Northern Europe for subsidizing governments and hurting savers and pensioners.The need for aggressive stimulus has lessened as the eurozone economy has picked up speed. Unemployment in the region has fallen to an eight-year low of 9.3%, growth is accelerating across the 19-nation bloc, and business and consumer confidence indicators are at postcrisis highs.Given that improvement, many analysts expect the ECB to announce the future of QE at its policy meeting in September or October, and start winding down the program early next year.Even so, investors appeared to be taken off-guard when Mr. Draghi indicated in Portugal last month\u2014at the ECB\u2019s own version of Jackson Hole\u2014that the bank would reduce its stimulus as the region\u2019s economy accelerates. Eurozone government bond prices have slumped and the euro has risen 2 cents against the dollar since the speech, as investors prepare for the departure of a giant buyer.The dilemma for the ECB is that, while growth is accelerating, inflation\u2014the bank\u2019s real target\u2014remains too weak. It slid to 1.3% last month, some way from the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%.With that weakness in mind, some top ECB officials have recently called for patience.       Peter Praet,        the bank\u2019s chief economist, said last week that the ECB should maintain \u201ca steady hand\u201d to ensure that inflation picks up. \u201cOur mission is not yet accomplished,\u201d he said.In an interview on Monday, Greek central-bank governor       Yannis Stournaras       said it wasn\u2019t yet time for a policy shift. Still, \u201cthis could change,\u201d Mr. Stournaras said. \u201cWe meet every month.\u201dOne reason to end QE soon is that the ECB is expected to struggle to find enough bonds to buy later next year. Changing the parameters of the QE program, which allow the ECB to purchase only up to 33% of any Eurozone government\u2019s debt, could prove legally and politically tricky. Economists also worry increasingly about a buildup of financial risk after years of ultralow interest rates.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Visit Offers a Chance For the ECB to Signal Shift.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 11:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/draghi-may-address-future-of-ecb-stimulus-at-jackson-hole-1499944342", "news_title": "ECB\u2019s Draghi to Speak at Jackson Hole, Giving Chance to Signal Shift", "keywords": " bond buying,ecb, economic stimulus, jackson hole, qe, quantative easing,European Central Bank,Federal Reserve,Mario Draghi,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "MUCH HAS BEEN made about the duality of Montreal\u2014a major North American city with a staunchly Francophone identity\u2014and its antiquity, too. While Canada marks its 150th birthday this year, Montreal, an early French-colonial fur-trade town, is turning 375. But far from a quaint Gallic relic, the country\u2019s second-most-populous city has a restlessly creative spirit, with homegrown and immigrant influences driving its food, art and music scenes. Locals, who scuttle down frozen streets during infamously harsh winters, treat summertime with euphoric reverence: riding miles along riverside bike paths, insisting on picnics and hopping from one festival to the next. You\u2019ll still see remnants of June\u2019s public mural fest (including a 9-story likeness of native son Leonard Cohen) in July and August, which usher in music performances as varied as the riffs on poutine, Quebec\u2019s peculiar French-fry delicacy. Here, a three-day guide to help you seize summer too.6 p.m. Arrive at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, named for Canada\u2019s four-term prime minister and father of the current prime minister. Cab it to Hotel William Gray, an upscale boutique hotel on the old port of the St. Lawrence River (from about $320 a night in summer, hotelwilliamgray.com) or to Casa Bianca, a stylish B&B in the bohemian Plateau neighborhood (from $130 a night, casabianca.ca).7:30 p.m. Every traveler who arrives in Montreal armed with a list of must-try restaurants invariably seeks out Joe Beef, the inventive restaurant that put the working-class Little Burgundy neighborhood on the map. At the risk of being predictable, hit it up first but order an aperitivo at the bar instead of dinner. Try the plateau de mer with oysters, Quebec snow crab and cold-smoked scallops in maple syrup (You\u2019ll need a reservation, even at the bar; 2491-2501 Notre-Dame St. W., joebeef.ca).9 p.m. Walk a few doors down to Joe Beef\u2019s veggie-focused sister restaurant Le Vin Papillon. Sit in the garden and round out your evening repast with hyper-seasonal tempura-fried ramps with shrimp taramasalata and blackcurrant soft serve (2519 Notre-Dame St. W., vinpapillon.com).9:30 a.m. Start with breakfast at Patrice P\u00e2tissier, back in Little Burgundy, where the kouign amann and other pastries are reliably excellent. Starting at 11 a.m., brunch is served; the savory dishes, such as baked eggs with homemade sausage and juicy cherry tomatoes, are as finely honed as the sweets (2360 Notre-Dame St. W., patricepatissier.ca).11:30 a.m. Browse the other shops and cafes along Rue Notre Dame Ouest. Beige offers tasteful housewares, like bottle-green tumblers (2480 Notre-Dame St. W., beigestyle.com), while StockMarkt (2664 Notre-Dame St. W., boutiquestockmarkt.com) is a discount outlet disguised as a chic boutique (think James Perse and Maison Kitsun\u00e9). At March\u00e9 Atwater, a sprawling art-deco-era market, choose provisions for an al fresco snack (138 Atwater Ave., www.marche-atwater.com). Fromagerie Hamel is a good one-stop shop for bread, fresh cheese curds, and Palette de Bine chocolate made in nearby Mount Tremblant (138 Atwater Ave., fromageriehamel.com).1:30 p.m. Pick up a bike from the Bixi bike-share terminal at Charlevoix and Duvernay Streets, and take Charlevoix into Lachine Canal Park, a rehabilitated industrial canal with a leafy bike path. Ride about 20 minutes to Old Montreal, stopping along the way to refuel with your market spoils.3 p.m. Dock your bike at Place Jacques Cartier and walk five minutes to Scandinave Les Bains, a spa in Old Montreal that promotes relaxation the Scandinavian way\u2014by alternating between hot and cold pools, steam rooms and saunas and with excellent massages (71 de la Commune W., scandinave.com).8:30 p.m. For dinner, go to Moishe\u2019s, a Jewish-Romanian steakhouse that\u2019s been in business since 1938, and was a local haunt of Leonard Cohen\u2019s. Order the chopped liver and the grilled rib steak (3961 St. Laurent Blvd., moishes.ca).11 p.m. Walk five minutes up St. Laurent to Divan Orange, a funky venue for national and local music, with acts ranging from DJs spinning vintage Afro-Caribbean vinyl to quirky Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois folk. The vibe is relaxed (kombucha plus vodka equals a cocktail) and dancing is encouraged (4234 St Laurent Blvd., divanorange.org).10 a.m. Brunch at Hof Kelsten, a casual bakery-cafe opened by a fine-dining veteran in the Plateau neighborhood. Order the merguez sausage shakshuka, or go light with the vegetarian sandwich\u2014labneh, pickled vegetables and cilantro, served open-face on pumpernickel (4524 St Laurent Blvd., hofkelsten.com)11:30 a.m. Walk 10 minutes to the corner of Mont Royal and Parc Avenues and enter Mount Royal Park, a nearly 500-acre urban sanctuary designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Hike uphill to Chalet du Mont Royal (about a 40-minute trek), a 1932 villa with spectacular views of downtown Montreal, the St. Lawrence River and on a clear day, the Quebec countryside (1196 Voie Camillien-Houde).2 p.m. Exit the park and take a cab 10 minutes to Jean Talon Market, located in Petite Italie (7070 Henri-Julien Ave.; marchespublics-mtl.com). Snack your way through roughly six city blocks of seasonal bounty, prepared foods, charcuterie and cheeses, with a stop at the incomparable spice shop \u00c9pices de Cru for a nonperishable memento of Montreal steak seasoning (C-11, 7070 Henri Julien Ave., 514-273-1118).3 p.m. Explore the rest of Little Italy. Caff\u00e8 Italia, a frozen-in-time espresso bar that\u2019s been open since 1956, guarantees prime people watching day and night (6840 St Laurent Blvd.). Nearby is Quincaillerie Dante, a family-run kitchenware and hunting store where you can buy a butter curler or a rifle (6851 St Dominique St., quincailleriedante.com). Since this is Quebec, great poutine\u2014the French Canadian fries, gravy and cheese curd specialty\u2014is just a few minutes away at Chez Tousignant, a retro-style snack bar. Have a late lunch of poutine and a hot dog, whose bun and sausage are made from scratch (6956 Drolet St., cheztousignant.com). After that you\u2019ll welcome the 10-minute walk to Brasserie Harricana, a brewpub for beer obsessives; it boasts the city\u2019s sole Flux Capacitor draft system, which regulates each beer\u2019s gas composition, gas pressure and temperature (95 Jean-Talon St. W., brasserieharricana.com).7 p.m. Though many restaurants in Montreal are closed on Sundays, you still have some desirable dinner options. L\u00e9meac, a destination French bistro on elegant Avenue Laurier in Outremont, is the place to order classics, like an exemplary kir royale and steak tartare with matchstick frites (1045 Avenue Laurier W., restaurantlemeac.com).10 p.m. End the night at La Sala Rossaa performance space in a former Spanish social center\u2014in the heart of a historically Jewish neighborhood. The venue pays homage to the area\u2019s multiculturalism with eclectic programming that, on any given night, could feature folk, spoken word or breakdance. Cover is about $15 (4848 St. Laurent Blvd., lasalarossa.com).10:30 a.m. Check out of the hotel but leave your bags to pick up later. Take a 15-minute taxi to Mile End, a former Jewish enclave, and setting of the 1959 novel, \u201cThe Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,\u201d written by notable Montrealer Mordecai Richler. Now it\u2019s one of the city\u2019s coolest neighborhoods. Eat breakfast at the hip all-day restaurant Larry\u2019s. Order a flaky scone or the breakfast sandwich with house-made sausage and egg (9 Fairmount Ave. E., larrys.website).12 p.m. Indulge in last-minute souvenir shopping in and around Mile End. Grab a bag of Montreal-style bagels (skinny, sweet, covered in sesame seeds) at 98-year-old Fairmount Bagels(74 Avenue Fairmount W., fairmountbagel.com). For a piece of Montreal cool, stop at La Montr\u00e9alaise, a women\u2019s boutique that sells tees and sweatshirts with slogans like \u201cJe Parle Feministe\u201d (65 Rue St. Viateur E., lamontrealaiseatelier.com), or chic high-end apparel at Les \u00c9toffes (5253 St. Laurent Blvd.) For the boys, men\u2019s outfitters Frank + Oak is a block away, with a barber shop on premises for emergency beard trims (160 St. Viateur St. E., frankandoak.com). One avenue up is the singular Librarie Drawn & Quarterly, an indie bookstore devoted entirely to graphic novels (211 Bernard St. W., drawnandquarterly.com).2:30 p.m. On your way back to the hotel, stop at Schwartz\u2019s, purveyor of the Montreal smoked meat sandwich, a cross between pastrami and corned beef. Order two for the flight home, specify lean, medium, or fatty, and don\u2019t forget the pickle (3895 St. Laurent Blvd., schwartzsdeli.com).Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Max Out Montreal.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 11:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-enviably-great-long-weekend-in-montreal-1499959394", "news_title": "An Enviably Great Long Weekend in Montreal ", "keywords": "canada,foodie travel,montreal,three day weekend,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy commentary,routine market,financial news,refined product market commentary"}, {"content": "CHICAGO\u2014An investment group led by a former Chicago alderman along with a coalition of labor unions has acquired the Chicago Sun-Times.The group\u2019s leader Former Alderman Edwin Eisendrath has declined to disclose terms of the deal and also said he doesn\u2019t have permission to reveal all the members of his investment group. \u201cA great group has come together and make sure that a genuine voice with honest and good reporting that connects with working men and women thrives,\u201d he said.One of the investors is the Chicago Federation of Labor, an umbrella group of labor unions.

Spoiler alert: Both fighters say they will win the fight. McGregor claims the 40-year-old Mayweather is well past his prime, which may be true. Mayweather claims the 27-year-old McGregor is inexperienced, which definitely is true. Back and forth the two men have gone at each other, with so much arm-flailing and foul-mouthed shouting, I started to think I was in line at the airport. McGregor even wore a pinstriped suit to L.A. where the stripes were revealed to spell the words: \u201cF--- Y--.\u201d Try ordering that at Brooks Brothers.This whole clambake is a money grab, which mercifully neither man denies. The pay-per-view, via Showtime, will cost $99.95 to watch in HD, which hopefully you can sucker your next-door neighbor to pay. Tickets to see it in the flesh are expected to cost many thousands. The pressers are thunderous rallies for capitalism. In L.A., Mayweather held up a check for $100 million and hailed himself as a \u201cnine-figure fighter,\u201d while demeaning McGregor as, at best, an \u201ceight-figure fighter.\u201d An eight-figure fighter! Now that\u2019s what Ayn Rand would call crossing the line.Mayweather is the pure boxer here, but outside of the ring, he\u2019s far from likable, and at the microphone, he\u2019s easy work for McGregor, a voluble Irishman who has established himself as the most outlandishly profane talker in sports. McGregor\u2019s mouth has been compared to Muhammad Ali\u2019s, but that comparison is a crime\u2014McGregor\u2019s game is taunting and preening, with hardly a trace of Ali\u2019s wit or poeticism. In Toronto, the UFC champ kicked off by puffing out his chest and commanding the crowd to crudely chant \u201cF--- the Mayweathers!\u201d which the crowd merrily did. (Compare that to an Ali bon mot: \u201cI\u2019ve seen George Foreman shadow-boxing\u2014and the shadow won.\u201d) McGregor had lots of fun with Mayweather\u2019s age, attire and alleged tax debts, but he\u2019s also been criticized for calling Mayweather \u201cboy\u201d and commanding him to dance\u2014a dig that, done intentionally or not, carries ugly overtones. I\u2019m guessing McGregor could not care less about offending anyone, but after a while, the shock of his ranting wears off, and he begins to sound like someone yelling on the train.That\u2019s McGregor before the cameras. I spent time with the former plumber\u2019s apprentice a couple of years ago in his home city of Dublin, and in that environment, McGregor was soft-spoken and cerebral as he talked about his origin story, the under-appreciated skills of mixed martial arts\u2014and, I should add, his admiration for the entrepreneurialism of none other than Floyd Mayweather. \u201cHe collects everything,\u201d McGregor told me. \u201cHe knows his numbers. I have respect for his business mind.\u201d In public, McGregor is basically doing a Mayweather homage: taking Floyd\u2019s cash-flaunting/CEO-against-the-world schtick, adding a dose of clever, and turning the volume to 12.Every prizefight asks its participants to play roles, to ratchet up tension\u2014real or perceived\u2014in order to goose public interest. They may get there, but I don\u2019t think Mayweather and McGregor despise each other at all. There have been moments of eye contact between the two that have signaled a shared appreciation of the ruckus they\u2019ve already been able to stir up. After promoting fights with serene talkers like Manny Pacquiao, you can almost see Floyd thinking of McGregor: I can\u2019t believe how good this lunatic is at this.They need to amp up the hype, of course, because from every reasonable standard, what they\u2019re offering is a mismatch. (McGregor\u2019s agreed to conventional boxing rules; there will be no leg kicks or arm bars.) Mayweather vs. McGregor is basically a bar bet come to life: how long can an elite cage fighter last in the ring with a boxing hall-of-famer? The boxing in-crowd has already decided it\u2019s just a one-sided pile of silliness, but there\u2019s probably enough noise to intrigue casual sports fans. Public turnouts at the first two press events were massive, and every sports talk show in America should cut Mayweather and McGregor a check for the easy content they\u2019ll provide over the next six weeks.Is it enough to make you pay for it? That\u2019s the only question that matters in the end. Watching the hype thus far, it\u2019s hard to not be briefly captivated by the absurd theater of it, but I feel there\u2019s something asymmetrical about this match-up, and not merely in terms of the comparative ring experience. Fights are most memorable when there are sharp contrasts between the combatants in style and character. While Mayweather and McGregor are opposites in the ring, on stage they\u2019re selling the same, loud formula. This is a fight without a hero\u2014it\u2019s all heel. But you don\u2019t need a hero to tune in on Aug. 26. You just need $99.95.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Boxing\u2019s F-Bomb Circus.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 11:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mayweather-mcgregors-f-bomb-circus-1499958135", "news_title": "Mayweather & McGregor\u2019s F-Bomb Circus", "keywords": "boxing,conor mcgregor,floyd mayweather jr.,jason gay,mayweather mcgregor,ufc,combat sports,sports,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "Critics of Facebook                   and other social media have warned for years that the platforms are distorting social interactions, hollowing out the meaning of \u201cfriend\u201d and weakening society in many other ways. But maybe it\u2019s not yet time for humanity to throw in the towel. A recent study shows that in these modern incarnations of socialization, some of our deepest evolutionary patterns are still very much asserting themselves, and the networks may even be facilitating this behavior.How could they have this power? Consider the abrupt death of a loved one. From our earliest days, the bereft have sought social support, especially from those who knew the dead. Maybe such people comfort you with recollections or reassurances. Maybe they just sit and hold your hand, so you know you\u2019re not alone.But in modern societies dispersed over thousands of miles, bereaved friends may find it hard to get to a funeral or wake, much less support each other in the lonely months to come\u2014a support that village life, with its daily face-to-face contacts, bolstered in eons past. Could social networks like Facebook restore some of that intimacy? Writing in the journal Nature Human Behaviour,       William Hobbs       of the University of California, San Diego, and data scientist       Moira Burke       of Facebook tried to answer this question.Thanks to Dr. Burke\u2019s position, the authors were able to examine vast records of Facebook and selected some 770,000 anonymous individuals, ages 18 to 64, in 15,129 social networks in which someone had abruptly died during a six-month period in 2011. Each social network consisted of \u201cclose friends\u201d (those who had communicated with the subject on Facebook or appeared with him in tagged photos in the period before he died) and mere acquaintances (those friended but not engaged in recent communication). For comparison, the researchers examined another roughly 30,000 social networks that matched the first set demographically but had not experienced any deaths in that 2011 period.\u201cAs expected,\u201d the authors write, \u201ca substantial amount of social interaction was lost with the death of a friend. However, friends of the decedent immediately increased interactions with each other and maintained these added interactions for years after the loss. Through this, the social networks recovered approximately the same number of active connections that had been lost.\u201dThis persistent and long-lasting rise in communication is particularly interesting. These friends of the deceased were not necessarily all close friends of each other. So the observed activity could represent people being drawn closer together by the shared loss. (In contrast, interactions between close friends of the dead and mere acquaintances rose only temporarily.)Besides text-based interactions on Facebook, photo-tagging\u2014which generally reflects offline, real-life interactions\u2014also rose. The increase in online activity appeared least pronounced after a suicide, the most complicated type of abrupt death. The jump in interactions was most striking among those most typically marinated in social media, namely 18- to 24-year-olds.These are socially strange times. A drone operator can follow a targeted individual on the other side of the planet for days before killing him. A user of an online dating site can fall in love with someone even though\u2014to the horror of our primate cousins\u2014he doesn\u2019t even know what that person\u2019s pheromones smell like.Yet the old patterns persist. Drone operators suffer from the same rates of psychological trauma as do soldiers who kill face-to-face on the battlefield, according to a 2013 report. Research published the same year suggests that marriages arising from online dating last at least as long as those spawned in the \u201creal world.\u201d\u200bOur social networks may provide us with means to lessen loneliness far more varied than those of a few decades ago. Grief-stricken, we can hold the virtual, real-time hand of someone on the other side of the planet.Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Facebook\u2019s Surprising Power to Console Mourners.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 10:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-surprising-role-in-bereavement-1499957730", "news_title": "Facebook\u2019s Surprising Role in Bereavement", "keywords": " bereavement,facebook, friendship, grieving, loss, research, sapolsky, science, social media,Facebook,FB,political,general news,psychology,sciences,humanities,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Jarod Reyes       wanted to reduce his anxiety.

People who listen most, the 21% squeezing in six or more, tend to listen fastest.When ESPN anchor       Rachel Nichols       moved to Los Angeles last year, she discovered she could squeeze two full podcasts into her drive to and from work if she pushed their speed to as fast as 2.3x. Ms. Nichols proselytizes the joys of speed-listening on             Twitter.       \u201cI like pushing the cause,\u201d she says.Ms. Nichols was a guest recently on \u201cThe Lowe Post,\u201d a show hosted by ESPN colleague Zach Lowe, and she made a plea to the audience as soon as she was introduced: \u201cI\u2019m going to ask everyone to now go to their app and speed up the rest of this podcast.\u201dMr. Lowe says: \u201cIt\u2019s insane that anyone listens to podcasts at that speed.\u201dP\u00e1draig \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide,        co-founder of the podcast app Castro, agrees with Mr. Lowe. \u201cWe once got a request for 4x,\u201d he says in an email, \u201cfrom a (presumably) insane person.\u201dCastro still offers playback speeds only up to 3x.A fourfold speedup sounds entirely sane to       Max Deutsch,        24, who says he has speed-listened to 69 audiobooks this year. The faster the speed, he found, the more engaged he was. \u201cThat\u2019s when I asked myself: I wonder how fast I could actually listen?\u201dThe San Francisco tech-product manager, unable to find apps with speeds over 3x, created Rightspeed, a $2.99 app that accelerates podcasts in nearly unnoticeable 0.1x increments every two minutes.

He listens at 3x and follows in print. Mr. Mullan, 32, says his reading consumption has increased and his comprehension has improved.Hundreds of thousands of Audible listeners use higher speeds, according to the audiobook company\u2019s data.

When he began using podcasts on lunchtime runs, he found them so slow they nearly put him to sleep.When he made them faster, \u201cI felt like I was running faster,\u201d he says. \u201cI was more in sync with being sped up. Which is crazy. But I think there\u2019s something to it.\u201dHe did slow down for an interview with Silicon Valley venture capitalist       Marc Andreessen,        who spoke too fast. Mr. Andreessen declined to comment.Andy Bowers       finds speed-listening useful as chief content officer of the podcast network Panoply in Brooklyn, where it is his job to listen to podcasts. (The Wall Street Journal belongs to the Panoply network.) \u201cI have to say very emphatically that I do not think it\u2019s an insult in any way,\u201d says Mr. Bowers, 53. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually a compliment that you want to find ways to continue to fit them into your day.\u201dIt does feel sacrilegious, say several podcast listeners, to rush highly produced shows like \u201cSerial\u201d or \u201cRadiolab.\u201d The sound, pacing and silence are crucial.Same for \u201cSong Exploder,\u201d in which musicians deconstruct their work.

Bob McDonnell, which occurred after Mr. Silver was convicted, had clarified what counts as official acts of government power. In that ruling, the court said the jury instructions could criminalize ordinary behavior such as setting up meetings or hosting events for constituents.The ruling in the case of Mr. Silver, once one of the most powerful politicians in New York, was a significant test of the McDonnell decision\u2019s impact on the corruption convictions of other public officials. It gives Manhattan federal prosecutors the option to retry the case. On Thursday, prosecutors said they would do so in front of a new jury.It also raises the possibility of a new trial for ex-state Republican Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, who was convicted in 2015 of public-corruption charges and sentenced to five years in prison. He is awaiting a ruling on his appeal from the same appellate court. Lawyers for Mr. Skelos, a Nassau County Republican, argued that the jury instructions in his trial were erroneous under McDonnell.Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and once one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians, was convicted in 2015 of extortion, honest-services fraud and money laundering. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison but has remained free during his appeal.Manhattan prosecutors argued Mr. Silver, 73 years old, engaged in quid-pro-quo schemes in which he used his government power in exchange for kickbacks and bribes.One scheme involved steering state grants to an oncologist, in exchange for patient referrals that earned Mr. Silver fees from a law firm. The other included negotiating tax breaks for a developer, which then steered business to another firm that paid fees to Mr. Silver.Mr. Silver earned a total of about $4 million in referral fees, prosecutors said.Seven months after his conviction, the Supreme Court vacated the conviction in the McDonnell case, in which the former governor and his wife accepted $175,000 in loans and gifts from a businessman who sought state university research on nutritional supplements. Prosecutors had argued Mr. McDonnell performed official acts including arranging meetings and contacting government officials.The Supreme Court offered new tests for determining official action, including that it involve \u201ca formal exercise of government power,\u201d such as a hearing before a committee or determination before an agency. Last year, prosecutors said they wouldn\u2019t retry Mr. McDonnell or his wife.In their appeal, lawyers for Mr. Silver argued that the jury instructions were too broad, in light of the new standard established in the McDonnell case.Writing for the three-judge panel, Judge Jose Cabranes agreed. \u201cLike the improper instruction in McDonnell, the plain language of the instruction at Silver\u2019s trial captured lawful conduct, such as arranging meetings or hosting events with constituents,\u201d he wrote.In the appeal, lawyers for Mr. Silver had argued that not only were the jury instructions wrong, but there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence for a conviction. The appeals court agreed that the jury instructions were in error, but rejected the arguments about sufficient evidence.The court also said it didn\u2019t fault the judge or the government because the instructions given to the Silver jury during the 2015 trial were consistent with precedent at that time.For former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who oversaw the prosecutions in both the Silver and Skelos cases, the convictions of the powerful politicians were considered significant victories in pursuing public corruption in New York.On Thursday, Mr. Bharara said on Twitter: \u201cThe evidence was strong. The Supreme Court changed the law. I expect Sheldon Silver to be retried and re-convicted.\u201dOn Thursday, acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon Kim said he looked forward to retrying the case, noting that \u201cthe Second Circuit also held that the evidence presented at the trial was sufficient to prove all the crimes charged against Silver, even under the new legal standard.\u201d\u201cAlthough it will be delayed, we do not expect justice to be denied,\u201d he added.In a statement on Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Silver said: \u201cWe are grateful the court saw it our way and reversed the conviction on all counts.\u201dWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'N.Y.

Most Americans now want homes that express their individual style and are loaded with modern, high-end finishes, such as solid-surface countertops, spa-like bathrooms and chic industrial fixtures.To understand what \u201cdream home\u201d means to today\u2019s homeowners, Mansion asked the editors of three home-centric websites\u2014Houzz, BHG.com and HGTV.com\u2014to identify their most popular images from the first half of 2017. These are the photos with the most online clicks, likes and saves.Defining a dream home can be \u201can addictive experience, because people can find so many examples that speak to them personally,\u201d says Sheila Schmitz, editor at home-design website Houzz. In many cases, \u201cthere\u2019s a sense of nostalgia at work,\u201d she adds.Right now, the most popular photos on Houzz show transitional interiors, those that mix traditional and contemporary design elements, with daring use of prints, metals and other textures. Glamorous kitchens feature statement lighting, master bathrooms are awash in custom stonework and exteriors show farmhouse-style accented with industrial-inspired fixtures.Houzz users are also drawn to \u201chigh contrast\u201d powder rooms and kitchens, says Ms. Schmitz. The most popular images so far this year feature daring wallpaper patterns or colorful tiles to create kitchens or powder rooms with a unique feel for entertaining. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where the homeowner feels they can make a statement with the design,\u201d she says.VIEW InteractiveBigger isn\u2019t always better when it comes to dream spaces. When viewing home-renovation projects, consumers often click on photos of small, well-appointed areas that feel somewhat attainable, says Mariel Clark, vice president of home and travel digital for             Scripps Networks Interactive,       which includes the HGTV network. A clever bunk-bed setup in the shape of a small house inside a child\u2019s room was one of the top images this year.\u201cOur audience does gravitate toward homes and spaces that they can identify with,\u201d says Ms. Clark. An image of a bathroom with shiplap on the walls, an oversize plant and free-standing bathtub drew in consumers who are eager to add similar details to their own spaces, she explains.In a home\u2019s private areas\u2014master baths and bedrooms\u2014serene d\u00e9cor is still in demand, says Amy Panos, home editor at Better Homes & Gardens, a             Meredith Corp.       magazine and website. Lighter bathroom tiles, shiplap walls and minimal bedroom d\u00e9cor can create a Zen-like atmosphere that\u2019s a draw for consumers. \u201cCalm is what people want in terms of their bedrooms,\u201d Ms. Panos says.Still, some are eager to wow guests with dramatic entrances. Photos of oversize planters, fire pits and colorful front doors are the most-clicked images this year, Ms. Panos says, because consumers see renovating outdoor entryways as an easy fix. \u201cPeople are getting fearless about their front door.\u201dBuyers want a dream home that feels one-of-a-kind and sets the home apart from other homes in a similar price range, says Chad Carroll, an agent with Douglas Elliman in Miami who focuses on homes listed for $5 million and above. In the past few years, he has seen homeowners who have invested in a custom-built wood-burning pizza oven off the kitchen, a private spa in the pool house, first-floor wine rooms and a basketball court. When building out kitchens and baths, he sees increased interest for butler\u2019s pantries, additional ovens and refrigeration, and his-and-hers master baths. \u201cThere\u2019s an increase in demand for double of everything,\u201d Mr. Carroll says.Browsing pictures \u201cadds a realistic element to your aspirations,\u201d says Alyssa Croft, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Arizona in Tucson who focuses on gender stereotyping and the home.Psychologically, people building or buying their dream home are eager to have a so-called optimal distinctiveness, which means that the home is different enough to be considered special by outsiders, while allowing the homeowner to fit in socially with their vision, says Prof. Croft. \u201cWe like to fit in and make sure that we have these status symbols\u2014but what we really value is individuality,\u201d she says.Write to Alina Dizik at alina.dizik@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Picture the American Dream Home.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 10:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-does-todays-dream-home-look-like-1499956253", "news_title": "What Does Today\u2019s \u2018Dream Home\u2019 Look Like?", "keywords": " better homes and gardens,dream home,hgtv,home design, home styles, houzz, luxury homes,Houzz,political,general news,real estate,property,construction,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Shoppers\u2019 retreat from department stores and mall chains is prompting stock traders to stalk the retail sector with a fervor unseen in years.Sales and profits at major retailers have come under immense pressure this year, punishing the shares of             Macy\u2019s Inc.,        M 1.37%Nordstrom Inc.        JWN 1.45%       and             Kohl\u2019s Corp.        KSS 0.05%       The SPDR S&P 500 Retail exchange-traded fund has fallen 11% this year, through Wednesday, lagging far behind a 9.1% rise in the S&P 500. Macy\u2019s is down 41% for 2017 and             Target Corp.        TGT 0.69%       is down 30%. Wall Street is abuzz with talk that the rise of e-commerce giant             Amazon.com Inc.        AMZN 0.24%       spells the eventual end of traditional retail, a notion that many in the industry vigorously dispute.Retail\u2019s retreat and the accompanying debate have created fertile ground for investors who buy unloved stocks, whether for a brief bounce and quick sale or in some cases a bet that the doomsday talk is overdone. This onslaught of bargain-seeking value investors, trend-playing hedge-fund portfolio managers and quick-turnaround day traders is fueling a surge in trading volume and sharp price swings in an industry that for years was a backwater to hotter industries such as technology and financial services.Trading has been frenetic. Macy\u2019s, the largest U.S. department store chain, had its highest trading volume of any month since 2011 in May, with June not far behind. Shares fell 17% on May 11, their worst performance since 2008, after a quarterly decline in same-store sales. May and June were also two of the five busiest months in the past five years for Kohl\u2019s and Target.\u201cWith this recent huge slump, a lot of large retail companies went on the radar for us,\u201d said       Eric Mancini,        director of investment research at Traphagen Financial Group in Oradell, N.J., which has $530 million in assets.After Amazon announced a deal to buy             Whole Foods Market Inc.       for $13.7 billion on June 16, shares of             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       sank 4.7%. Mr. Mancini jumped into the fray soon after.He bought shares of Wal-Mart for his clients with larger portfolios, reasoning that valuations looked attractive after the share-price drop. He picked up shares at a price of around $75 apiece and plans to hold them until the stock price climbs to the $80 to $90 range, he said. The shares closed Wednesday at $73.94.He isn\u2019t alone in betting the selling on major retailers is overdone. SunAmerica Asset Management and BNY Mellon Asset Management, are among the investors that increased their stakes in Macy\u2019s between the end of last year and March, according to S&P Capital IQ. UBS Asset Management and             Northern Trust Global Investments                   increased their stakes in             Nordstrom Inc.       during that period.Amazon\u2019s rise threatens traditional retailers because it means they must fight harder for every dollar of already scarce sales growth, at a time more U.S. retail sales are being conducted online. A recent 2,000-person U.S. shopper survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets found that 93% selected Amazon as the online shopping website they use most often, compared with 89% last year.Stock traders have become particularly attuned to the notion that Amazon\u2019s gains are other retailers\u2019 losses, potentially fueling a buy-Amazon, sell-retail trade that could exacerbate the traditional retailers\u2019 woes. On Amazon\u2019s 10 best-performing days this year, Macy\u2019s has fallen 2.7% on average and Kohl\u2019s has dropped 3.1%. The retail ETF was down 0.9% on average those days.Investors are betting retail stocks will keep falling, and in many cases it has paid off. Those who went short on food and staples retailers, for example, made $116.3 million in paper profits on the day after Amazon announced its Whole Foods acquisition, according to IHS Markit.ETF provider ProShare Advisors filed plans with securities regulators last week for new double- and triple-levered ETFs designed to rise on days that retail stocks fall, adding firepower to bets on their decline. Also coming is an ETF that goes \u201clong\u201d on online retailers while \u201cshorting\u201d traditional ones.Because so many investors are betting that retail shares will fall, the slightest bit of better-than-expected news is apt to cause the shares to surge, a condition that lays the groundwork for much-larger price swings as short sellers buy back borrowed shares to return them to the owner.On Thursday, Target raised its quarterly guidance for same-store sales and earnings, pushing shares up 3.1% in recent trading. Other large retailers also gained on the news, with Macy\u2019s shares climbing 3.9%, and             Gap Inc.       shares advancing 3.2%. The three companies were among the six best performers in the S&P 500 by percentage gain.The 30-day implied volatility of the retail ETF was over 19 this week, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is well above 14.7 on a comparable technology ETF and nearly as high as an ETF of biotechnology stocks known to have particularly large swings, which was at just over 20.That volatility has been a boon to day traders, who often jump in and out of stocks in the span of a few hours to ride small moves in their prices. On StockTwits, a social-media platform that is popular with day traders, average message volume about Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Kohl\u2019s,             J.C. Penney Co.      , and             Sears Holdings Corp.       has collectively more than tripled since the end of last year.\u201cPeople day trade on volatility,\u201d said       Vlad Karpel,        a day trader in Chicago who also runs Tradespoon, a firm that uses models to offer buy and sell signals on stocks. \u201cTraditionally, it\u2019s been biotech stocks, penny stocks or leveraged ETFs. Recently, it\u2019s been retail stocks.\u201dOn June 27, after the market closed, Mr. Karpel\u2019s models generated a buy signal on             Best Buy Co.      , suggesting the stock was oversold. He said he put in an order to buy 1000 shares the next day if the stock hit a price of $56.80. It did so in the first half-hour of trading, and he held on to the shares until they climbed to $57.10 within an hour. He then sold, netting about $300.Friday could be another big day for retailer stocks. The Commerce Department will report retail sales for June.

The month-over-month increase was slightly higher than economists expected, but overall, price pressures continued to remain soft in June.The index for core prices, which excludes the often-volatile prices for food and energy, rose 0.1% in June. From a year earlier, core prices were up 1.9%, below the pace seen in previous years and suggesting little momentum for price pressures.\u201cIn short, fairly tame and fairly close to expectations, although the core measures still show a pickup in the past year, in contrast to the pattern in the (consumer-price index and personal-consumption expenditures) data,\u201d said       Jim O\u2019Sullivan,        chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.Producer prices don\u2019t necessarily directly translate into what consumers pay, but in general, PPI readings follow the same trends as other major inflation gauges.The personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose 1.4% in May from a year earlier, the Commerce Department previously reported. That was a slowdown from a 2.1% annual increase in February, the first time in five years the index\u2019s annual increase poked above the Fed\u2019s 2% annual inflation target.Inflation remaining persistently below the Fed\u2019s target could present a challenge to policy makers considering when next to raise the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate. Fed officials have raised the rate twice this year, and have penciled in one more increase, though no move is expected at a meeting later this month.The unemployment rate, 4.4% last month and near a 16-year-low, has only resulted in modest wage inflation.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said in congressional testimony Wednesday it would be premature to judge that the economy was not on the path to 2% inflation over the next couple of years, reiterating her view that an increasingly tight labor market would put upward pressure on wages and prices. Still, she noted the Fed would change course if inflation continued to illustrate weakness.\u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears that the inflation undershoot will be persistent,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The Labor Department\u2019s producer-price index report can be accessed at: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htmWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 10:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-producer-prices-rose-slightly-in-june-1499949314", "news_title": "U.S. Producer Prices Rose Slightly in June", "keywords": " business prices, core ppi, inflation, ppi, producer price index, u.s. economic expansion,u.s. producer prices, wholesale inflation,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,producer price index,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,labor department"}, {"content": "The U.K. securities regulator is considering a plan that would make it easier for state-owned companies to list on Britain\u2019s             London Stock Exchange,       a move that could give the LSE an edge in its continuing battle with the New York Stock Exchange to woo the listing of oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co.The Financial Conduct Authority proposes a new listing category that addresses the desire of sovereign-owned companies to access public markets without necessarily adopting key rules that are meant to protect public minority investors. Typically, public companies are answerable to their shareholders. But state-owned firms are also answerable to the sometimes conflicting needs of their governments.\u201cSovereign owners are different from private sector individuals or companies\u2014both in their motivations and in their nature,\u201d\u00a0      Andrew Bailey,        FCA\u2019s chief executive said in a statement announcing the proposals.The FCA doesn\u2019t mention Saudi Aramco\u2019s expected IPO and listing as part of the reasoning behind its proposals. But the proposals come amid recent concerns from some U.K. institutional investors that adoption of any concessions to attract the listing could undermine the integrity of the country\u2019s equity market.At the same time, the LSE and NYSE are considered front-runners for the international listing of Saudi Aramco\u2019s shares as part of a planned initial public offering in 2018. For the winning venue, the listing, which could value Saudi Aramco at as much as $2 trillion, promises healthy fees and an influx of international investors looking for a share of the oil company.Saudi Aramco\u00a0declined to comment on the FCA proposals. The NYSE declined to comment.The proposed rule changes for sovereign-owned companies include a waiver to the requirement that prevents an LSE-listed company from conducting related party transactions with the controlling shareholder, its directors or associates without first gaining approval from independent shareholders. It also proposes to waive controlling shareholder rules that are meant to protect the rights of minority shareholders in companies where one group owns 30% or more of the voting shares.Saudi Aramco is expect to float no more than 5% of its shares in the IPO.\u201cWe are\u2026skeptical about the usefulness of the controlling shareholder rules when applied to a situation whereby the controlling shareholder is a sovereign country,\u201d the FCA said. \u201cCapital market participants collectively are capable of assessing directly the influence of a shareholder on a company\u2019s risks and prospects.\u201dThe FCA plans to complete the rules by the end of the year after consulting with market participants.The LSE said it supported the effort. \u201cProviding discretionary access for investors to a broad range of U.K. and global companies is fundamental to the effectiveness and competitiveness of U.K. primary markets,\u201d the exchange said in a statement.Some shareholders, however, aren\u2019t convinced.\u201cIf the proposals\u2026are implemented, it will be bad news for London and will reverse the progress we have made in recent years to uphold strong governance and protect minority shareholders,\u201d       Ashley Hamilton Claxton,        corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management said.\u2014Summer Said and       Alexander Osipovich       contributed to this articleWrite to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Weighs IPO Rules Ahead of Aramco.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 10:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-aramco-listing-looms-u-k-regulator-mulls-rule-change-1499955197", "news_title": "As Aramco Listing Looms, U.K. Regulator Mulls Rule Change", "keywords": "Saudi Arabian Oil,Financial Conduct Authority,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Wimbledon was briefly gripped by a major problem Thursday when an 18-year-old boys singles player failed his pre-match undergarment check.Just ahead of warmups for a third-round match, Austria\u2019s Jurij Rodionov was flagged by officials for violating the All England Club\u2019s strict rule against even taking the chance that some color might show on the court.The club\u2019s rule states: \u201cAny undergarments that either are or can be visible during play (including due to perspiration) must also be completely white except for a single trim of colour no wider than one centimetre (10mm)\u201d.The underwear police have been active this year, cracking down on infractions during a doubles match earlier in the week.

As told to Alex Coppola.My firm, like many, has seen the benefits and drawbacks of imposing asset minimums on our clients. On the one hand, it\u2019s helped clearly define the client base and deliver better service to the relationships in our book. On the other, it\u2019s also caused the firm to miss out on clients who didn\u2019t fit into the model.So my firm devised a solution: Offer a comprehensive financial-planning service for a flat fee of $5,000. With this financial-life inspection, my firm acts as an independent third party evaluating every facet of a client\u2019s financial situation. The system is based on a 100-point checklist, not unlike a home inspection, that covers everything from asset protection and liability to Social Security and tax planning.The first step is a goals meeting to gather information and then involve my firm\u2019s professional contacts\u2014certified public accountants, estate-planning attorneys, asset-protection agencies and mortgage specialists\u2014to help us analyze that data. These professionals know that there\u2019s a good potential for a referral through this process, so they offer their services free. Once the inspection is complete, my firm goes through that data with clients and offers suggestions based on the goals they\u2019ve shared with us.A critical distinction reiterated throughout the process is that clients are under no obligation whatsoever to work with my firm to implement any of the suggestions. My firm is acting in a fiduciary capacity\u2014the goal is to provide feedback and recommendations, not to ask clients to transfer investments or buy products.Even for clients who don\u2019t have the ability to meet our asset minimum, the inspection can be a great starting point to begin their financial-planning process\u2014a touchstone they can reference as their assets grow and circumstances evolve. If the prospect already has an adviser, the inspection can serve as a useful second opinion\u2014a way for them to get another set of eyes on their entire financial situation before they make important decisions.For firms struggling with challenges surrounding asset minimums, this kind of flat-fee-based service may be a good option. What\u2019s more, the willingness of someone to invest in a deep-planning process speaks volumes about them as a prospect should they decide to work with my firm. It shows a commitment on their part that helps determine whether they would be a good fit.

Norwegian\u2019s long-haul capacity will increase by 60% this year and double next year, notes brokerage Davy.But rapid expansion has come at a cost. Even stripping out fuel, second-quarter unit costs rose 7% year over year, management announced Thursday. Unit staffing costs ballooned 12% as the company prepared to ramp up intercontinental operations. Second-quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, have now been rising for four years.This looks like a big problem. You can\u2019t build a low-cost airline without low costs.Trans-Atlantic flying is currently dominated by three full-service alliances:             American Airlines                   and             British Airways                   parent IAG, Delta and             Air France-KLM,       and United Airlines and             Lufthansa.       Having seen their short-haul business upended by low-cost challenger             Ryanair,       the European players are paying very close attention to Norwegian\u2019s ambitions. All three have launched no-frills long-haul subsidiaries to compete. Norwegian can\u2019t count on the complacency that opened a gap for Ryanair.The other problem with Norwegian\u2019s mounting costs is that they weigh on cash flows and hence its debt-encumbered balance sheet. Shareholders\u2019 equity accounted for just 8% of total liabilities at the quarter-end. This leverage explains why the stock, which is heavily shorted, plunged 11% in morning trading. Year-to-date it is down more than a third, even as other European airline stocks have soared.The company\u2019s long-term finance director quit last week.

Within the gates, there\u2019s a rare combination of warm camaraderie and privacy, says Rick Wagoner, former chairman and CEO of General Motors, who has a second home there.Haig Point residents, about half of whom live there full time, pay a $20,000 initiation fee and an annual fee of $23,000 for golf and tennis, a stately clubhouse with a wood-paneled bar and formal dining area, a beach club with a heated swimming pool and restaurant, a fitness center with a lap pool and a sprawling equestrian center with more than a dozen horses.A fleet of six private boats ferries residents every hour to an embarkation center on the mainland, where they keep their cars. A water taxi can be reserved at any time to go to nearby Hilton Head.When the real-estate bubble burst in 2008, growth within Haig Point essentially came to a standstill. Since then, management decisions, investments in infrastructure and the steep initiation fees have helped it rebound.About two years ago, Haig Point hired a chief executive, Doug Egly, whose mission is to expand the current 360-member roster to 500 and add about 35 homes by 2020. (Currently there are 265 houses.) To that end, Mr. Egly brought in more builders, including Osprey Construction, a local company that has built three spec houses that start at about $600,000 each.The average home listing price in Haig Point is now $763,000, nearly double what it was in 2015, according to Haig Point\u2019s marketing director Adam Martin. Lots start at around $50,000 and homes on the market range from a quaint, three-bedroom cottage listed for $297,500 to a commanding 5,842-square-foot waterfront mansion listed for $2.85 million.Next door to Haig Point is a decaying former luxury resort called Melrose, with abandoned beach cottages, a shuttered inn and a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course covered in weeds. Its owner, Utah-based developer Pelorus Group, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, saying it owed creditors about $35 million. It is currently seeking an investor willing to put up at least $19 million in cash.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this bad,\u201d says Elizabeth Noonan, 47, a consultant from Lexington, Ky. She and her family spend a week at a time vacationing at a home that her husband and his brothers built on the beach in 2006. Despite the dismal surroundings, the beach remains stunning, and about 17 families live in Melrose full time. Homes can still be pricey, like the 1,500-square-foot beach cottage that is listed for $925,000 and described in the real-estate agent\u2019s ad as offering \u201clots of privacy.\u201dAlso facing an uncertain fate is the Bloody Point Golf Club and Beach Resort, located on the southern tip of the island that includes a golf course, swimming pool, tennis courts, clubhouse and a bed-and-breakfast. After going bankrupt in 2008, the resort was won in an auction in 2011 by floral-business magnate Brian McCarthy, who restored the golf course and put in a dock and a boat service with six round-trips to Savannah, Ga., a day. Since then Mr. McCarthy has been trying to sell the resort because it is losing money. A group of investors expressed interest, which had islanders hopeful, but the deal fell through in June.Despite its financial woes, Bloody Point Club and its facilities are still up and running. Day trippers from Savannah pay to play golf, have lunch and use the swimming pool. Of the 112 buildable lots in Bloody Point, 21 homes have been constructed to date, only five of which are occupied by full-time residents, including a 7,700-square-foot white mansion owned by John Mellencamp, who uses it as a retreat. A five-bedroom house just a couple doors down from Mr. Mellencamp\u2019s home is on the market for $1.75 million.Rich and Gayle Silver built a $3.4 million, 5,500-square-foot shingle-style home on the ocean in Bloody Point in 2005, attracted to the area\u2019s white-sandy beach and tranquility. Mr. Silver, a 70-year-old retired mutual-fund executive, and Mrs. Silver, an interior designer, moved to Daufuskie from Boston and now live there full time.The Silvers own two other lots in Bloody Point and want to build a smaller house. But when they put their current home\u2014fully furnished\u2014on the market for $3.99 million last year, it didn\u2019t sell. Mr. Silver says prices in the area have remained stagnant. Recently, they took it off the market and will wait awhile before relisting.There is some tension over the economic disparity between Haig Point and the rest of the island, residents say. While Haig Point\u2019s private ferries run every hour, the public ferry runs only four times a day. Current flood-zone maps mean that Haig Point homeowners qualify for federal flood insurance, whereas residents on most of the rest of the island don\u2019t. South Carolina legislators are working on changes to flood-zone maps that would expand the availability of insurance coverage.Still, things are looking healthier in the historic district along the island\u2019s western side. About 65 families live here full time, and new businesses are springing up. There\u2019s now a restaurant called Lucy Bell\u2019s that serves salads and sandwiches. The island got its first coffee shop, and another outfit combines a small wine shop with a wood shop where a group of Haig Point residents is building small \u201ccocktail racer\u201d boats. Daufuskie Island Rum Co. just came out with its seventh flavor, infused with Kona coffee beans, that owner Tony Chase serves mixed with hazelnut coffee creamer after distillery tours.Chase Allen, a metal artist who owns a workshop called the Iron Fish Gallery, lives in one of the few remaining homes on the island built by a Gullah, the African-American descendants of former slaves who had once worked on cotton planations and farmed oysters on the island.Mr. Allen also owns a company called Tour Daufuskie that specializes in the island\u2019s ecology and Gullah history. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive untapped ecotourism opportunity here,\u201d he says.Tourism on Daufuskie has picked up in the past year, says Chris Haupt, who charges $45 a head for a 45-minute boat ride to the island from Savannah, Ga. Most of his business is from vacation-home renters and day trippers.Living on an island with no bridge can make for some desperate situations, Mr. Haupt says. Recently he received a call in the middle of the night from someone craving a pizza\u2014badly enough to pay the $300 after-hours delivery fee.Write to Nancy Keates at nancy.keates@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'An Idyllic Island\u2019s Stormy History.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 10:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daufuskie-island-an-idyllic-spot-with-a-stormy-history-1499954865", "news_title": "Daufuskie Island: An Idyllic Spot With a Stormy History", "keywords": " bloody point golf club and beach resort,daufuskie island,golf communities, golf resorts, haig point, luxury homes, luxury real estate,melrose, south carolina,political,general news,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,real estate,property,building construction,residential building construction,construction"}, {"content": "THE PLAZA IN FRONT of San Francisco\u2019s City Hall is thronged with people on a warm, bright afternoon in June, the air sweet with the smell of food-stand barbecue and marijuana. Cheers and pumping fists erupt from the crowd as Vince Staples, the 24-year-old rapper\u2014one of the fastest-rising stars in today\u2019s hip-hop firmament\u2014strides up to the microphone. The hook of his hit song \u201cPrima Donna\u201d bursts from the speakers at rib-cage-rattling volume: \u201cIs it real? Is it real?\u201dIt\u2019s a question Staples must often ask himself these days. This Comedy Central\u2013sponsored festival, with its $11 beers, wine-tasting tent and headliners that include Sarah Silverman, Kevin Hart and Jerry Seinfeld, is a world away from the hard-bitten streets of North Long Beach, where Staples grew up.In the past three years, Staples has gone from underground mixtape prodigy to burgeoning celebrity\u2014headlining a national tour, appearing on The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, signing endorsement deals with Sprite and Converse and cutting tracks with major artists such as Common, Ghostface Killah and Gorillaz, with whom Staples is currently touring.Moving across the stage in a plain black hoodie, black jeans and bright-orange Chuck Taylors, holding the microphone to his mouth in his left hand while slicing and stabbing the air with his right, Staples unspools his songs about racial conflict, gang violence, depression and heartbreak over bold, massive beats. Like his music, his performance is direct, devoid of theatrics. It\u2019s just him up there\u2014no backup singers, no dancers. He holds the stage by sheer force of personality. Toward the end of his set he calls out to the crowd: \u201cHey, anybody wanna hear a joke?\u201d Once the yells of encouragement have subsided, he responds with a single syllable: \u201cNo.\u201dThat Staples refuses to tell a joke at a comedy festival is not surprising, as he has become known for defying expectations. He\u2019s a critic of the prison system but he says he\u2019s not an activist; he bewildered some of his fans by defending a mother who posted a YouTube video criticizing the lyrics of his song \u201cNorf Norf\u201d (\u201cNo person needs to be attacked for their opinion.... They have a right to it,\u201d he said on Twitter); he doesn\u2019t drink or do drugs. Staples simply refuses to be reduced to someone else\u2019s idea of what it means, or should mean, to be a celebrity, a rapper or a black man today.His lyrics don\u2019t romanticize the violence of the streets or the pleasures of fame and fortune, but he also keeps from passing judgment on either. Instead, his style is straightforward, almost reportorial, offering deadpan, pin-sharp observations about his experiences and environment. His suite of artfully produced videos, two EPs and two albums\u2014including his newest, Big Fish Theory, which dropped in June and features artists such as Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon and Kendrick Lamar\u2014has won him critical acclaim and a swelling fan base.\u201cTo be honest, most people don\u2019t care about my music,\u201d he says in a Hollywood cafe a few days after the concert. Though he presents himself as stoic onstage and on record, he is chatty and charismatic, possessed of a gaptoothed smile and bright, oversize eyes. \u201cPeople like the idea of my music, probably. Or the idea of me as a person. I don\u2019t necessarily care what they want, or think, so it kind of works out for me,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re selling lifestyles. It\u2019s all reality TV. That\u2019s all music is nowadays, at least in my spectrum. They just want to look at you.\u201dThe disorientation and occasional discomfort of being looked at so much\u2014the pressure of being a celebrity\u2014is one of the recurring themes of his music. The trippy video for his song \u201cPrima Donna,\u201d from his 2016 EP of the same name, opens with an unhappy-looking Staples surrounded by scantily clad dancers, until, offstage, a director yells \u201ccut\u201d and the entire scene is revealed to be the making of a music video. \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d a disenchanted Staples seems to ask the viewer. The recent music video accompanying \u201cBig Fish\u201d shows Staples on a slowly sinking sailboat, menaced by circling sharks. \u201cSwimmin\u2019 upstream while I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to keep my bread / From the sharks, make me wanna put the hammer to my head,\u201d he raps, eyeing a flare gun in his hand.Musically, his new record is an elaboration of the inventive, electronic-heavy style featured on his critically acclaimed debut album, Summertime \u201906\u2014sparse arrangements anchored by bludgeoning beats shot through with jagged squalls of machine-generated sounds\u2014although it leans even more heavily in that direction, engaging with Detroit techno and house music. \u201cThe sonics that he chooses are very eclectic,\u201d says A$AP Rocky, who is featured on the track \u201cSAMO.\u201d \u201cFor our generation, I\u2019ve never met such an intellectual and thorough artist. I think he raises the bar for being self-aware and lyrical.\u201dBig Fish is also concerned with how an individual is perceived and how he in turn perceives himself\u2014or fails to. \u201cIt\u2019s about being oblivious,\u201d Staples says. \u201cGoing through life being kind of oblivious of your surroundings, of your perceptions, of reality, as a coping mechanism and just a state of being.\u201dThat degree of disengagement wasn\u2019t an easy option in Long Beach, the southernmost slice of Los Angeles County and the birthplace of illustrious rappers like       Snoop Dogg.       Staples lived with his mother there (his father was in and out of jail) but he also spent time at his grandparents\u2019 place in Compton. His mother, who worked at a car factory, tried to create a stable environment for him at home despite the occasional grim realities of growing up in the area\u2014gangs were an established fact of life. \u201cWhere I come from, everybody goes to jail,\u201d he says. \u201cYour dad does something stupid and goes to jail; he comes back. If your dad\u2019s only gone for like six months, two years, five years, that\u2019s a win where I come from. If you don\u2019t get life, you won!\u201d\u2018\u2018We sell trauma from black people to the world. They love it.\u2019\u2019I had the unmistakable impression at times that Staples was toying with me, as he has other earnest interviewers\u2014playing dumb in response to over-asked questions, undermining his own words with a knowing smile. What does he think about being called a \u201cconscious gangster rapper\u201d? \u201cI don\u2019t know what either of those things are.\u201d Where does he want his career to go? \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And when it comes to more personal issues, there are topics he expresses plainly and intensely in his music that he won\u2019t discuss, or even acknowledge, with a stranger.His childhood, for instance. Though in conversation Staples breezily insists everything was fine, his songs suggest a more complicated story. In more than one early track, especially the haunting \u201cNate,\u201d Staples describes a young boy watching his father taking drugs, abusing his mother or dodging the police: \u201cLights flashing now he running from the Winslows / Hear him screaming for my momma at the back door / Sometimes she wouldn\u2019t open it, sitting on the couch / Face emotionless, I don\u2019t think they ever noticed that I noticed it.\u201dAs Staples tells it, it was almost inevitable that as a teenager he wound up running with a local gang. He bounced around to different high schools for a period but eventually lost interest despite remaining a good student, and he never got around to graduating (although he later earned a California High School Equivalency Certificate).The path to becoming a writer and performer opened up when an old friend introduced him to Syd tha Kid, a member of Odd Future, a fast-rising rap collective founded by Tyler, The Creator whose members have included Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt. Staples quickly started noodling around on songs with Odd Future before moving on to produce his own mixtapes. These recordings, and his guest spots in Odd Future videos, eventually brought him to the attention of the legendary hip-hop label Def Jam Recordings, which released his first EP, Hell Can Wait, in 2014.Plenty of rappers have made their careers boasting about their gangster exploits, using their criminal histories to burnish their claims to being \u201creal.\u201d But it\u2019s a struggle to get Staples to talk about what he did and saw with his crew. \u201cI just laugh when people bring it up,\u201d he tells me. The cafe had grown too noisy, so now we\u2019re sitting in a Mercedes he recently bought for his mother. \u201cIt\u2019s such a small part of what actually is important to anyone who deals with that, who is successful as an artist. You\u2019re not getting into these publications if that\u2019s your main focus.\u201dDoes he mean that you can\u2019t succeed as an artist if you\u2019re still involved in gang life? \u201cNot even that, but if that\u2019s the basis of your art, not enough people are gonna want to listen to it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve never understood the need to overindulge it. Perfect example is you have an artist like YG. Time after time after time, they label him \u2018the gangster rapper.\u2019 But his most successful songs all have to do with partying, having fun and women. You have a Jay Z. Every time his name is mentioned, he\u2019s the drug dealer, blah blah blah. But that\u2019s such a small part of his 20-something-year career.\u201dStaples is wary of the ways inner-city life is marketed to suburban audiences. His video for \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d shows a group of young black and brown people marching through a ravaged urban landscape, guns trained on them from looming towers, falling one by one; the ending reveals a white family comfortably seated on a bench watching it all from behind glass. \u201cWe sell trauma from black people to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThey love it. You watch TV. You go to the movies. You listen to music. You know it. Trauma. As long as I remember. We got fuckin\u2019 Baby Boy, Boyz n the Hood, Waist Deep, 12 Years a Slave\u2026. I don\u2019t remember the last time I seen a movie about black people where it was like, \u2018Man, they\u2019re having a great day.\u2019 \u201dIn \u201cBagBak,\u201d a track from the new album, Staples declares, \u201cWe need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office / Obama ain\u2019t enough for me, we only getting started / The next       Bill Gates       can be on Section 8 up in the projects / So \u2019til they love my dark skin, bitch I\u2019m goin\u2019 all in.\u201d Nonetheless, Staples insists he is without an agenda. \u201cOf course they want me to be that guy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, the politically driven, yada yada yada.\u2026 It\u2019s not my thing\u2026. What I stand for, what I believe in, is more substantial. I don\u2019t believe in your rhetoric. And I said that before we had this president\u2026. My music\u2019s not really in the moment like that. It\u2019s meant to last for a long fucking time.\u201dStaples expresses similar ambivalence about his growing celebrity. He says he doesn\u2019t avail himself of all the hedonistic perks that wealth and fame can confer, especially in the music business. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a strip club. I don\u2019t go to parties. Never been to an actual club,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I do.\u201d He\u2019s only ever seriously dated two women and he has never tried alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. There were plenty of all those things around in his neighborhood but he was never tempted. The opposite, in fact. \u201cI\u2019ve seen high people,\u201d he says. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like fun. Being drunk doesn\u2019t look like fun. So I had no urge to do it.\u201dStaples has relocated to a tonier part of Los Angeles now that, for the first time in his life, he has financial security. Even so, he insists that the extent of his material ambition is to live in a nice middle-class suburb and have a couple of kids. \u201cI like that kind of stuff,\u201d he says. Additionally, he has used this money to give back to his hometown\u2014last year he helped city officials launch the YMCA program Youth Institute, which provides young people with the support necessary to explore creative fields like filmmaking, graphic design and 3-D printing.Now that he\u2019s got the resources and professional clout to do what he wants, Staples just wants to continue creating. He doesn\u2019t want to be pegged as a gangster or a spokesperson for his generation or for his race. So why does he do it? Who is he trying to reach? \u201cNobody,\u201d he says. \u201cI just make it. I honestly don\u2019t think about it. You can try to make commercialized music, or you can try to make, you know, art, for lack of a better term. I\u2019m here to make the art. Not make the news.\u201dHe is not here to give us the show we expect.", "news_time": "2017-07-13 10:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vince-staples-returns-with-a-new-album-1499954795", "news_title": "Vince Staples Returns With a New Album", "keywords": "album release,musician,rapper,vince staples,assault,political,general news,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,festivals,music"}, {"content": "In New York\u2019s Hamptons, a roughly 14-acre beachfront property with multiple houses and two putting greens is asking $150 million.On Meadow Lane in Southampton, the property is an assemblage of four parcels and includes several houses, according to listing agent Harald Grant of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. He declined to name the sellers or specify why they are selling, but said they purchased the parcels over the past few years with the intention of demolishing the existing homes to build a new family compound.The combined properties offer about 700 feet of direct frontage on the ocean, Mr. Grant said. One of them, on 3.5 acres, includes a roughly 12,000-square-foot house, built in the 1990s, with eight bedrooms and an indoor pool.Another parcel, on 3 acres, has two shingle-style houses: one measuring about 2,000 square feet with an outdoor swimming pool, and a roughly 3,000-square-foot home with a tennis court.A third, 5-acre parcel has two putting greens built by a prior owner for practicing golf, plus two \u201cgolf cottages\u201d overlooking the ocean.A fourth parcel is a roughly 2.5-acre vacant lot with frontage on Shinnecock Bay, ensuring the property has views of both the ocean and the bay, Mr. Grant said.A buyer will almost certainly demolish the homes and start over, he said.\u201cAs we find in most instances at this price point, people want to hire their own architects and designers and build their dream home,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to spend this kind of money and live in someone else\u2019s house.\u201dAccording to public records, the current sellers bought the properties from entertainment mogul Robert F.X.

Mr. Sillerman\u2019s dance-festival conglomerate, formerly known as SFX Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy in 2016.Beachfront property in the Hamptons is among the most expensive real estate in the country.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell postponed the Senate\u2019s usual August recess by two weeks, to give senators more time to hash out agreements on health, government funding and other issues.This wasn\u2019t the outcome many forecasters had expected after the election. The prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress led many to conclude that fiscal policy could provide a swift boost to the growth outlook, if a substantial tax overhaul and Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure package were quickly implemented.\u201cWe expect this Congress will ultimately pass a far more modest fiscal policy, one that will disappoint business leaders, investors, and consumers,\u201d said Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group.Forecasters assess whether they think the economy is more likely to outperform or underperform their forecasts. The number of economists seeing those risks to the downside climbed to 57% in this month\u2019s survey, the highest since before the election. That\u2019s up from 51% last month and 37% just two months ago.The survey of 63 business, financial and academic economists was conducted from July 7 to July 11. Not every economist answered every question.Growth forecasts for the last three quarters of 2017 are all down from May. Forecasts for growth in 2018 were unchanged at 2.4%, but the average forecast for 2019 dropped to 1.9%, the first time the year\u2019s outlook has dipped under 2%. Economists also slightly downgraded their forecasts for housing starts over the next year.To be clear, most are lowering their expectations, but think a major mishap is likely to be avoided. They assigned 1-in-5 odds the U.S. government might shut down due to Congress\u2019s failure to reach a funding agreement. The odds of a recession were pegged at just 15%, little changed from last month and down 22% from a year ago.Another difficult vote looming before Congress is the U.S. debt ceiling. The nation hit its borrowing limit in March and has been relying on temporary budget maneuvers to fund the government.

That is essentially what London is handing out to win over Saudi Aramco, the Arab oil giant planning a potential $100 billion initial public offering.The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority Thursday announced proposed rule changes that will allow a sovereign-controlled group, such as Aramco, to qualify for a \u201cpremium listing,\u201d meant to denote quality and investor protection. But it is not a real premium listing, the kind which all U.K. blue-chip stocks have.London, New York and other markets are in a battle to win what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest IPO, even if the group doesn\u2019t get near the $2 trillion that the Saudi royal family thinks it is worth.Crown Prince       Mohammed bin Salman       favors a listing in New York, but the company and its lawyers worry about greater legal risks in the U.S. and prefer London. But London\u2019s premium status requires things that Aramco likely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with. The U.K.\u2019s play is to give Aramco something better than the lower quality \u201cstandard listing\u201d reserved for startups and small-caps.Premium listings add certain investor protections. A company must have an audited three-year revenue record, major transactions must be approved by shareholders and it must have full strategic control over its business.The new sovereign category would create key exceptions. The sovereign owner won\u2019t be considered a related party, which means it can do transactions with the listed company without the approval of other shareholders. This will be particularly important for Aramco because it performs so much work for the Saudi state, including building arenas for camel beauty-pageants.And sovereign owners will escape restrictions designed to ensure controlling shareholders don\u2019t abuse their voting power. For instance, independent directors won\u2019t need to be approved by minority shareholders.The FCA\u2019s justification is that investors are capable of assessing the risks of state influence in a company, in part because its motivations may be more transparent and political than those of private owners. In truth, this may mean that investors should simply expect such companies to be riskier, so: buyer beware.Some might worry that creating a bespoke listing category pollutes London\u2019s reputation as a global financial market that aspires to high governance standards. But these changes won\u2019t push Aramco shares into mom-and-pop portfolios. The company still won\u2019t make it into the FTSE 100 because non-U.K.-incorporated members must have more than 50% of their shares available to trade and the oil giant will sell perhaps one-tenth of that.These changes could help bring a small number of very large state-backed companies to London, though it is hard to see where these companies are or what the commercial benefit will really be. Mostly this looks like an exercise in mutual brand building: for London\u2019s place in finance after Brexit and for a stamp of slightly qualified quality on Aramco\u2019s stock.Write to Paul J.

South Korean car exports to the U.S. were far higher, coming in at $16 billion last year.Some U.S. industry and labor critics have said South Korea has kept its currency artificially weak against the dollar in the past to gain a trade advantage.

Mattel shares, which closed Wednesday at $20.88, have lost about third of their value since the holiday shortfall was announced.In her early diagnosis of Mattel, Ms. Georgiadis has focused on some management missteps, including an excessive focus on short-term financial metrics and cost cuts that still left Mattel bloated and overly complicated.Ms. Georgiadis also reduced Mattel\u2019s annual dividend by 60%, a payout that Mr. Farr\u2019s team helped to preserve during recent turmoil.Ms. Georgiadis\u2019s plan for Mattel includes developing more digital options for children to interact with its brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, expanding further into emerging markets and shortening development cycles for new products.Mr. Farr\u2019s long service in the top finance role is an exception among the largest companies.

They also beat the 16% gain of India\u2019s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index and 14% gain of the MSCI India index.Globally, hedge funds are facing criticism for failing to justify the high fees they charge. They have gained an average 3.7% this year, well behind the S&P 500\u2019s total return of 9.3%, including dividends, Hedge Fund Research data show.India-oriented hedge funds, which are mostly stock-focused, have outperformed mainly by trading in small-cap and midcap stocks, which have been on a tear this year. The benchmarks they are beating are dominated by large-cap companies like             Infosys Ltd.        INFY -1.09%       and             Tata Motors Ltd.

The fund has a mandate to use leverage to fuel its market bets, and to short-sell stocks, though like most India-focused hedge funds it has mostly pursued a \u201clong-only\u201d strategy.\u201cWe think the country is going to transform over the next decade or two,\u201d said       Rahul Khanna,        the fund\u2019s London-based portfolio manager.India\u2019s stock market has been among the world\u2019s fastest-rising this year, despite a bumpy ride for some measures Prime Minister       Narendra Modi       has introduced in recent months\u2014notably withdrawing most of the country\u2019s currency from circulation last November.A series of interest-rate cuts since 2015 has helped push India\u2019s growth rate past China\u2019s. The pace could hit 7.2% this year, the International Monetary Fund forecasts.The optimistic outlook has drawn in foreign institutional investors, who plowed a net $8.4 billion into Indian stocks in the 12 months through July, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, as domestic Indian mutual funds funneled in a net $12.1 billion.\u201cLiquidity is just gushing in,\u201d said Andrew Holland, chief executive of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP, one of a handful of India\u2019s onshore-based hedge funds. \u201cInterest rates have fallen and traditional real estate and gold as an option isn\u2019t really there, so you\u2019re getting more money in equities than before.\u201d\u2018Interest rates have fallen and traditional real estate and gold as an option isn\u2019t really there, so you\u2019re getting more money in equities than before.\u2019Mr. Holland said large-cap information-technology and pharmaceutical stocks that have outperformed over the past decade might struggle to maintain their pace and justify their valuations. Others say small and midsize companies are better placed to capture changes in the types of products that consumers demand as India becomes richer.India\u2019s domestic hedge-fund industry owes its existence to regulations issued in 2012. Before that, several funds set up offshore in places like Singapore and Mauritius, where they enjoyed favorable tax treatment, although the loopholes have recently been closed.The universe of India-oriented hedge funds remains relatively small. Those with a mandate to invest in India alone total just 42 and manage $4.58 billion in assets, according to data from EurekaHedge. Contrast that with 156 funds and $26.94 billion for funds that invest in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.Some say Indian hedge funds\u2019 performance is still unconvincing. Their returns seem less exceptional set against those of the small-cap stocks they invest in, said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, which collects data on the asset management industry.

The Wall Street Journal reports on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s strictly controlled U.S. tour as he embarks on his yearlong journey to better understand American people. If Mr. Zuckerberg plans to pop by your cafe, farm or garage, you will tend to get a visit from his \u201cadvance team,\u201d who will scope out the area but only hint at who is about to arrive. Once gets there, you\u2019re not allowed to tell anyone, nor parrot back what Mr. Zuckerberg actually said at the meeting. But we did get this great kicker of a quote: \u201cHe said, \u2018If there are any news reporters that call you, just make sure you tell them I\u2019m not running for president.\u2019\u201d Earlier this year, as Business Insider reported, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s spokeswoman asked someone who had hosted the Facebook CEO for a surprise dinner to \u201chammer home\u201d to anyone who asked that he is not making a presidential bid. Got that, everyone?For years, some publishers have been increasingly stuffing their websites with ads, desperate to squeeze every last drop of revenue from their pages. But now, as CMO Today\u2019s Jack Marshall reports, publishers including LittleThings and Dotdash have discovered lowering the number of ads forced on their users has resulted in larger ad revenue gains. There are certain websites I can think of that make you feel as if you\u2019ve been punched in the face by the amount of advertising front-loaded onto their pages. Most of the time, it\u2019s so bad I don\u2019t bother reading the article I came for and close the tab on my browser, scolding myself for visiting in the first place. LittleThings Chief Digital Officer Justin Festa said that while his site now generates less revenue from each individual page, overall ad revenue has increased. Users are viewing more pages and are more likely to see and click on the ads that remain because there\u2019s less clutter.Ratings for NFL games were down last season, and now we\u2019re getting signs football ad sales are tumbling downward, too. Executives told Bloomberg the ratings decline, a \u201csaturated market\u201d for college games, plus spending cuts from pharmaceutical companies and auto makers, have amounted to a perfect storm that could even drag down sales growth for sports beyond football. That\u2019s despite networks raising the ad rates for NFL games next season. TV executives often sell their sports packages as the best example of when watching \u201clive\u201d on a TV set still really matters, but the latest trends may mean they have to change their long-rehearsed sales patter. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. The report points out \u201cpro football is still the most watched programming in the U.S. and secures the largest ad deals\u201d\u2014but signs suggest there could be a ceiling to its commercial growth.\u201cThe ad industry feels like Silicon Valley is killing creativity,\u201d Business Insider reports. Creative executives are concerned digital platforms\u2019 tendency to favor shorter ads, like the six-second video format, doesn\u2019t allow enough time for brands to tell their story, compared with the favored 30-second TV spot. Perhaps it\u2019s worth spinning this around and taking a different perspective. The best creatives are problem-solvers. The best ideas often come when you\u2019re given barely any resources and an impossible-looking deadline. As Nils Leonard, the former executive creative chairman at Grey London and now co-founder at Halo Coffee, said in a speech earlier this year, \u201cWe are at our most creative when we are in the shit.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t a time constraint be seen as a barrier to tear down with an attention-grabbing piece of work, rather than a wall to bash your head against in defeat?NBCUniversal said it secured a \u201chigh single digit\u201d percentage increase in volume across cable and broadcast in this year\u2019s upfront, which brought in an estimated total of just under $6.5 billion in commitments.

Shares in AstraZeneca were down 4.6% at \u00a349.53 ($63.8) Thursday midmorning in London. Teva shares were up 5.7% at 116.40 shekels ($32.9).Dr. Soriot has led the company since 2012. He played a leading role fighting off an unsolicited takeover approach by U.S. giant             Pfizer Inc.       two years later. As part of that defense, Dr. Soriot, who trained as a veterinarian and came over from rival             Roche Holding AG      , pledged AstraZeneca\u2019s reinvigorated research and development pipeline would super charge revenue over the next 10 years.Three years into that commitment, Dr. Soriot is facing a crucial milestone this year. He had said 2017 would be the year sales would bottom out and start to grow strongly. Early results for a closely followed lung-cancer treatment are also expected within weeks. Those results could either bolster investor confidence in that turnaround, or sow further worry.Investors this year have given Dr. Soriot a big vote of confidence. Shares have risen more than 20% year-to-date, as of Wednesday\u2019s closing price. He has presided over a series of high-level executive departures during his tenure. His own departure to Teva could be another big disruption.Late Wednesday, Israel\u2019s Calcalist business news website reported Dr. Soriot had agreed to lead Teva. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said it wouldn\u2019t comment on \u201cmarket rumors and speculation.\u201d A Teva spokesman also said it doesn\u2019t comment on \u201cmarket rumors.\u201dWithin weeks, AstraZeneca is expected to announce the outcome of a key clinical trial, dubbed Mystic, that will signal whether one of its biggest bets\u2014on a new class of cancer drugs\u2014is likely to pan out. Given that timing, \u201cthe most positive interpretation would be that he thinks he has effected a major corporate transformation during five years at AstraZeneca,\u201d said UBS analyst       Jack Scannell       in a note to clients. \u201cA bearish interpretation could be that he has less confidence in the path that Astra has transformed itself to pursue.\u201dFor Teva, appointing Dr. Soriot would be the latest effort to bring about its own overhaul. Like other generic-drug makers, it faces a tough pricing environment and intensifying competition for copycat medicines that is squeezing the industry\u2019s margins. The company must also deal with $32 billion in debt and a sprawling supply chain accumulated through acquisitions.The Israeli company has been searching for a new chief executive since February, when former boss       Erez Vigodman       departed the company for undisclosed reasons. Teva\u2019s longtime Chief Financial Officer       Eyal Desheh       exited last month.Investors expressed surprise at the idea that Dr. Soriot, a veteran of the branded prescription drug industry, would consider moving into generics.Andrew Baum,        analyst at Citi, said he had \u201csignificant trouble reconciling the timing of the potential departure pre-Mystic and Dr. Soriot\u2019s skill set match with Teva.\u201dWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 07:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mystery-at-astrazeneca-is-ceo-pascal-soriot-staying-or-going-1499945355", "news_title": "Mystery at AstraZeneca: Is CEO Pascal Soriot Staying or Going?

Democrats, meanwhile, appeared less willing Wednesday to offer unconditional support for the Fed\u2019s stance toward gradually providing less support to the economy, though many extolled Ms. Yellen\u2019s leadership of the bank.The appearances in front of both panels could be her last before her term expires in February. The White House is beginning the process of considering who should be the next Fed leader. While Ms. Yellen isn\u2019t expected to be reappointed, President       Donald Trump       hasn\u2019t ruled it out.Asked repeatedly whether she wants to serve a second term, Ms. Yellen initially demurred on Wednesday and implied she hadn\u2019t discussed the matter with the White House.

Here\u2019s some basics on what\u2019s involved.Who Is Running?More than 6,000 Venezuelans are running for the assembly\u2019s 545 seats. Most are faithful government supporters. Each candidate had to collect the signatures of 3% of registered voters in their town or industry to run. The electoral council didn\u2019t publish any information about who signed or how the signatures were gathered.Who is Being Elected?Each of the country\u2019s 340 municipalities will elect one assembly member, apart from state capitals, which will elect two. In addition, 181 members will be elected as representatives of eight different sectors, such as fishermen, retirees and students. But the country\u2019s main unions, professional associations as well as opposition and ruling coalition dissidents are boycotting the vote. That has raised questions about the candidates\u2019 credentials.What Is the Assembly\u2019s Role?The assembly, which is scheduled to take office on Aug. 2, will become the country\u2019s supreme political institution. It has the power to dissolve the National Assembly, to rewrite the constitution and to pass laws. It will be seated in the country\u2019s Legislative Palace, where the National Assembly now is.Who Will Win?Mr. Maduro is practically assured control of the assembly because the opposition is boycotting the vote and due to the election\u2019s design. The government has decided who is running and who can vote. Moreover, the election allocates a disproportional amount of seats to rural areas, where the government is strongest, at the expense of urban opposition strongholds.Why Did Mr. Maduro Call the Vote?Mr. Maduro says the new assembly will forestall social strife by bringing together all of the country\u2019s regions and social groups. Some opposition leaders say the assembly will do away with free elections and political parties. Others believe Mr. Maduro won\u2019t radically undermine the current political structure but will instead use a newly allied assembly as a bargaining chip in negotiating a political transition next year when elections are scheduled to be held.\u200bWrite to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-constitutional-assembly-an-explainer-1499943602", "news_title": "Venezuela\u2019s Constitutional Assembly: An Explainer", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.A critical lock on Pennsylvania\u2019s Monongahela River has been shut down this week as it undergoes the latest step in a $2.7 billion makeover. The overhaul at the site south of Pittsburgh is one of several major projects across the U.S. aimed at improving the nation\u2019s waterways network, the WSJ\u2019s Kris Maher reports, projects that show both the scale of the country\u2019s infrastructure needs and the tough questions around the investments. The Lower Monongahela River Project is aimed at upgrading a system that includes pieces that date back more than a century and help move more than a million tons of commodities annually. But the Army Corps of Engineers has scaled back improvements that were first targeted in 1994, and regional backers are still fighting to ensure the work gets funding. President       Donald Trump       has promised to put $1 trillion toward infrastructure, but his proposed 2018 budget didn\u2019t include funding for the Monongahela River project. Some of that commodities traffic is falling, meanwhile, making the fight for federal dollars still tougher.The choices over U.S. infrastructure needs may be most acute at the country\u2019s airports. The small and dilapidated Yeager Airport at Charleston, W.Va., provides a stark example of the gap between the goals of regional economic planners and the infrastructure o put plans into motion. Airport officials have a wish list totaling $395 million, the WSJ\u2019s Kris Maher reports, an enormous amount given that the Airport Improvement Program run by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration handed out some $3.2 billion in grants last year. The FAA sent $2.7 million to the Charleston airport this week in new grants totaling $185 million to 40 airports. Those sites include the country\u2019s biggest airports along with smaller, rural facilities that have a tough time making their case to federal planners. With passenger traffic falling and little local business to generate cargo, Yeager Airport is among the sites trying not to get lost in the divide between small-town airports and big-city hubs.PepsiCo Inc.       thinks a new logistics strategy for its beverages and snack foods could help the company solve a sales problem. Pepsi Chief Executive       Indra Nooyi       says the company is looking at new packaging that would help its drinks and snacks travel better, the WSJ\u2019s Imani Moise and Jennifer Maloney report, and make the products better suited for online sales. The attention to e-commerce comes as sales at PepsiCo and other traditional brands have been stagnating amid changing consumer tastes. PepsiCo\u2019s sales and earnings rose last quarter because it was able to command higher prices, a strategy that analysts believe won\u2019t last in the tough retail market. Shipping its goods in small lots for online consumers carries big challenges, however. Drinks are costly to ship because they are dense and demand tight packaging to protect containers, a combination at odds with the low value of soda.A looming global diamond shortage is driving extreme changes in the world\u2019s supply chain for precious gems. A small band of adventurous miners is braving bone-chilling winds at the world\u2019s highest mines to extract stones worth as much as 20 times the global average, the WSJ\u2019s Alexandra Wexler reports, highlighting how the high value of diamonds can push producers to overcome the most challenging conditions. The Maluti mountains in the southern African nation of Lesotho have for years been largely untouched by mining companies, due to the difficulty and cost involved in extracting the stones. But active mines there are on the rise as strong demand for high-end diamonds encourages nimbler miners to brave the craggy area known as the Roof of Africa. The attraction: the mine produces diamonds that sell for roughly $2,000 a carat, far surpassing the global average of just over $100 a carat. That\u2019s the sort of yield that can overcome just about any physical and logistics challenge.\u2018The infrastructure has reached the end of its useful life.\u2019Increase from April to May in the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics Freight Transportation Services Index, the largest one-month increase since December 2011.Online transportation management startup Transfix raised $42 million in a Series C Funding round that sharply raises the company\u2019s valuation.

Agents hope Christopher Wray can help protect the FBI from political crosswinds that show no signs of abating. Mr. Trump rebutted allegations that the Russian government tried to help his campaign, arguing that his policies run counter to the Kremlin\u2019s interests. He raised the defense a day after his eldest son released documents showing he had accepted a meeting to discuss an alleged Russian government offer of information damaging to Hillary Clinton. Those revelations prompted investigators to re-examine conversations captured by U.S. intelligence agencies in spring 2015 in which Russian government officials discussed associates of Mr. Trump, according to current and former U.S. officials.Novartis recently discovered that a drug it sells at $16,000 a dose for very rare inflammatory disorders could have a much broader market: A clinical trial suggested it reduces the risk of serious complications in patients recovering from a heart attack\u2014around 615,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the American Heart Association. But if the drug, now sold as Ilaris, were approved for that use, Novartis would have to drastically cut its price. Rare-disease drugs can command sky-high prices because they are typically the only treatment available, while drugs for common ailments face competition. It leaves Novartis with a choice: Stick with a small, but reliable, revenue stream\u2014or abandon it for an uncertain bet the drug could become a top seller.The more China tries to rein in its roaring housing market, the more buyers pile in.

Another article of faith is that the Communist Party won\u2019t allow housing prices to collapse.

Demand accelerated in the second quarter, growing to 97.4 million barrels a day\u20141.5 million barrels a day faster than in second quarter of 2016.Oil prices settled higher on Thursday after the IEA report was released, though they initially declined as investors stayed focused on rising production in June from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC crude output hit its highest level in 2017 at 32.6 million barrels a day, driven by Libya, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, the IEA said, complicating the cartel\u2019s efforts to curb production.Brent, the international crude-price benchmark, gained 1.4% to $48.42 a barrel Thursday, while West Texas Intermediate\u2014used to price oil in the U.S.\u2014gained 1.3% to $46.08 a barrel.The more robust demand outlook has yet to help OPEC\u2014with members that control roughly 40% of global crude output\u2014in its efforts to manage a global oil glut that has weighed heavily on the market. Large amounts of oil in storage have kept prices between $45 and $55 a barrel for much of the past year.In addition to unexpected demand in Germany and the U.S., a recovery in demand growth in India continued into May and Chinese apparent demand \u201crebounded strongly\u201d during that month, the IEA said. China\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of crude\u2014had seen demand slow earlier in the year amid weakening economic conditions, holding back global growth.The IEA said the initial demand data could suggest the market is moving toward equilibrium in supply and demand. But the agency cautioned: \u201cWe need to wait a little longer to confirm if the process of rebalancing has actually started in [the second quarter] and if the waning confidence shown by investors is justified or not.\u201dOPEC last year teamed up with 10 other big producers outside the cartel\u2014including Russia\u2014to cut production through March by roughly 1.8 million barrels a day from the record high levels reached last October.But overall, the IEA said Thursday, global oil supply in June rose by 720,000 barrels a day to 97.46 million a day, boosted by increased output from OPEC and non-OPEC producers such as the U.S.\u201cEach month something seems to come along to raise doubts about the pace of the rebalancing process,\u201d the IEA report noted. The \u201ctwo hitches\u201d this month include the recovery of production in Libya and Nigeria\u2014two OPEC members that have faced no restrictions on production\u2014and a lower rate of compliance with the deal by other OPEC members.Oil inventories in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell in May, but at over 3 billion barrels still remained 266 million barrels above OPEC\u2019s target of the last five year average.Write to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 06:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-demand-is-accelerating-iea-says-1499932807", "news_title": "Oil Demand Is Accelerating, IEA Says ", "keywords": " iea forecast, oil demand,oil glut, oil output, oil production,International Energy Agency,output,production,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "As 401(k) fee lawsuits have proliferated over the past year, a wider array of retirement industry practices have come under fire. Now the results are starting to come in\u2014with some big settlements and some big losses for plaintiffs.Many of the recent cases target firms that stock their 401(k) plans with their own investments or allegedly profit off their retirement-plan arrangements. Several recently filed suits have been launched by plaintiffs\u2019 firms relatively new to 401(k) litigation.\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 bar has definitely gotten more aggressive,\u201d says       Susan Mangiero,        an economist and managing director of Fiduciary Leadership LLC in Trumbull, Conn., who serves as an expert witness in 401(k) cases. \u201cNew competitors see it as a very big business. The allegations have expanded in scope.\u201dFueling the litigation boom, experts say, is a handful of recent multimillion-dollar settlements by companies including             American Airlines Group Inc.        AAL -1.02%      \u2014which disclosed a $22 million settlement earlier this month\u2014as well as a 2015 Supreme Court victory for plaintiffs in Tibble v. Edison, which put retirement plans on notice that they have a duty to monitor plan investments, including fees.Since 2006, plaintiffs\u2019 firms have filed more than 90 lawsuits against employers and other parties alleging excessive fees in 401(k)-style retirement plans, according to Groom Law Group in Washington. Last year alone, firms representing 401(k) participants filed more than 25 such cases\u2014a record annual number.Many of the latest suits target companies\u2014including a number of financial-services firms\u2014for using their own investments in their retirement plans. The suits allege that by selecting proprietary mutual funds, the companies acted in their own interests, rather than exclusively in the interests of the employees in their 401(k) plans.In the latest case, American Airlines settled allegations that it had breached its fiduciary duties by offering high-cost mutual funds from an affiliated investment company called American Beacon Advisors Inc.\u2014an arrangement that plaintiffs say allowed American to profit at the expense of its 401(k) participants. American has since removed the American Beacon funds from its 401(k) plan. The airline admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement.In recent months, companies including TIAA and New York Life Insurance Co. have settled such suits without admitting wrongdoing.In other decisions, the defendants have prevailed. Last month, Judge       William G. Young       of the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts dismissed a suit against Putnam Investments following a trial.While Putnam\u2019s \u201creview of the Plan lineup was no paragon of diligence,\u201d the judge wrote, the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to point to specific circumstances in which\u201d Putnam put its own interests ahead of those its 401(k) participants.Stephen Rosenberg,        a partner at the Wagner Law Group, which specializes in retirement plans, said the \u201cplaintiffs may have been thinking that it was enough to show that using Putnam funds was good for Putnam. But the judge said, \u2018You have to prove Putnam deliberately put itself ahead of its 401(k) participants.\u2019\u201d\u201cThis is just one District Court judge\u2019s interpretation,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. But \u201cit\u2019s going to create a standard that everybody is going to have to deal with.\u201dPlaintiffs\u2019 attorney       Carl Engstrom,        at       Nichols Kaster       in Minneapolis, said the plaintiffs plan to appeal.The decision follows the dismissal of a similar case against             Wells Fargo                   in May. In that case, the plaintiffs alleged that Wells Fargo breached its fiduciary duty by using its own target-date funds, rather than cheaper alternatives from Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group.Minnesota District Court Judge       David S. Doty       called into question the widespread practice among plaintiffs\u2019 firms of comparing the fees and performance of proprietary funds, such as the ones at issue in the Wells Fargo case, to Vanguard funds.The judge ruled that doing so \u201cis like comparing apples to oranges,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. The plaintiff recently filed an appeal. Wells Fargo said it expects the ruling to be upheld on appeal.The first generation of 401(k) fee cases\u2014many filed in 2006 and 2007\u2014typically allege that billion-dollar 401(k) plans using retail mutual funds have a duty to use their size to bargain for cheaper institutional-share classes.Fred Reish,        a lawyer who specializes in employee benefits and compensation, said that after the courts dismissed some of those cases, fee litigation pioneer Schlichter Bogard & Denton LLP refined its arguments and \u201cbecame more targeted and sophisticated and very successful.\u201dWrite to Anne Tergesen at anne.tergesen@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Plaintiffs Ramp Up 401(k) Lawsuits.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 06:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/latest-wave-of-401-k-suits-yields-big-wins-and-big-losses-for-plaintiffs-1499941801", "news_title": "Latest Wave of 401(k) Suits Yields Big Wins, and Big Losses, for Plaintiffs ", "keywords": "401k lawsuits,conflicts of interest,fiduciary act,retirement conflicts,American Airlines Group,AAL,Schlichter Bogard & Denton,TIAA,Groom Law Group,Carl Engstrom,Stephen Rosenberg,corporate crime,legal action,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,personal finance,retirement planning,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,unit trusts,mutual funds,air transport,financial services,investing,securities,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Losing isn\u2019t really an option for             Intel Corp.        INTC 0.09%       But winning may also be hard to come by, at least for a while.Intel remains the world\u2019s largest chip maker by revenue, with more than $60 billion in sales expected for this year. And it maintains near total dominance in two key markets\u2014personal computers and servers. But Intel\u2019s stock also has been among the worst performing among semiconductor peers over the past year, even to the point of ceding its crown as the largest chip company by market value to             Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.        TSM 1.51%Why? Because when you\u2019re on top, there is nowhere to go but down. Intel is facing fresh challenges in its core markets on multiple fronts. New chips this year from longtime rival             Advanced Micro Devices        AMD 0.52%       are targeting the sweet spots of high-end PCs and servers. And in the data center, Intel is also facing threats from the development of ARM-based processors that use a different computing standard, as well as the growing use of graphics chips from             Nvidia                   that are better-suited to many artificial intelligence applications. Not coincidentally, Nvidia and AMD have been the best performing chip stocks of late, having gained 207% and 179% over the last 12 months respectively.Intel relies on its data center business to fuel growth as PC sales continue to slip so it isn\u2019t taking the matter lying down. The company rolled out its newest line of Xeon server chips this week. That came just a few weeks after AMD launched a new line of server chips called Epyc. Neither are likely to factor much into earnings results for the June quarter to be reported in the next few weeks, but Intel noted that it has already sold more than 500,000 units of the new Xeon family since November under an \u201cearly-ship\u201d program.AMD, with annual revenue that equates to about one-third of just Intel\u2019s R&D budget, simply doesn\u2019t have the scale to overtake its much larger rival. It can put a wrinkle in its growth prospects at an inopportune time, though. AMD is expected to grow its computing and graphics segment revenue by 34% this year. Intel\u2019s far larger data center business is expected to grow by 7%\u2014its slowest year on record. And while Intel\u2019s stock is cheap at 12 times forward earnings\u201412% below its 3-year average\u2014any disappointment in data center sales over the next few quarters will likely pressure the shares further.AMD, meanwhile, has the advantage of starting from zero in servers. That means the sales it does get will likely be at Intel\u2019s expense. In fairness, AMD will have to keep delivering strong sales into next year to show its gains have true staying power. That is far from certain now, but investors haven\u2019t been giving Intel the benefit of the doubt.This column is part of a series on what is next for the booming semiconductor industry.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 06:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-lonely-at-the-top-1499938201", "news_title": "Intel: Lonely At The Top", "keywords": "chip,data center,pc,processor,server,Advanced Micro Devices,AMD,Intel,INTC,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing,2330.TW,TSM,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,semiconductors,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "For online publishers, more advertising typically means more revenue. It\u2019s why websites are often crammed full of flashing banners, auto-playing videos, content-blocking overlays and widgets recommending sponsored story links.But some publishers say they\u2019re now taking a \u201cless is more\u201d approach when it comes to placing ads across their sites. Stripping out irritating ad formats and limiting the number of ads forced on visitors can actually result in more engaged consumers and ultimately increased ad revenue, they say.In early 2016, for example, female-focused publisher LittleThings set a challenge for itself: to remove at least one form of advertising from its site every quarter, but without sacrificing revenue.Over the course of the next year, it proceeded to remove from its site clickbait-heavy content recommendation ads, interstitial ads that pop up and cover users\u2019 screens, and autoplay video ads. Now the site mostly relies on just display ads, user-initiated video ads and sponsored content.The result: There are now fewer ads on each page, and the website generates less revenue from each individual page that users view. But overall ad revenue has increased.\u201cUsers view more pages, share more content and are generally more engaged,\u201d said Justin Festa, chief digital officer at LittleThings. He said revenue generated from each user\u2019s session grew 38% in June, compared with a year earlier.What\u2019s more, having fewer ads on each page actually helped boost the performance and value of the advertising that remained, said Mr. Festa. The ads were more likely to be seen and clicked on because there was less clutter, he explained.Publishers\u2019 moves to cut out annoying ads could also be driven by more than just improving the user experience.Aggressive and spammy ad tactics have helped drive an increase in consumer adoption of ad-blocking technologies in recent years, some industry observers say. Publishers may also be trying to get ahead of Google\u2019s plans to introduce an ad \u201cfilter\u201d to its popular Chrome web browser early next year, which could block interstitials, autoplay video ads and other formats from loading by default.Online publisher Dotdash said it\u2019s taking an approach similar to LittleThings across its portfolio of six niche-focused sites, like Verywell and Lifewire, which were carved out from what was once About.com.Squeezing as many ads as possible onto every page is a shortsighted strategy, according to Dotdash Chief Executive Neil Vogel. The company has therefore stripped out content recommendation ads from its pages and autoplay video ads from within its articles, with the belief that a better user experience will help drive greater revenue in the long run.\u201cWe are leaving money on the table on an individual visit basis but, overall, being thoughtful about things like this we think is a material driver of the growth of our brands,\u201d Mr. Vogel said.Mr. Vogel said the company stopped using content recommendation ads from third-party companies primarily because of concerns about the types of content they placed on its properties. \u201cUsers need to trust us with health, finance, travel advice. We didn\u2019t think it was a good fit,\u201d he said. Mr. Vogel didn\u2019t say which company Dotdash had previously worked with for content recommendation ads.Adam Singolda, CEO of content recommendation network Taboola, said he agrees that webpages have become more cluttered in recent years, describing them as \u201cat times as chaotic and disorienting\u201d as \u201cTimes Square signage.\u201dThat\u2019s largely why his company has been working on new tools such as its \u201cFeed\u201d product, he said, which is designed to help web publishers offer a more \u201cstreamlined\u201d user experience similar to the ones they\u2019ve come to expect from social networking apps.Yaron Galai, CEO of rival content recommendation service Outbrain, said publishers aren\u2019t stripping its widgets from their pages. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any serious publisher we work with at Outbrain who\u2019s considering removing content recommendations. Discovery is fundamental to their sites and business, just like a search box is,\u201d he said.Still, content recommendation ads and autoplay video ads have a reputation for surfacing ad experiences of questionable quality. Then, why do publishers continue to use them?The answer is simple: Providers of those ads pay publishers millions of dollars a month in some instances, and often on a guaranteed basis. It\u2019s a reliable source of revenue at a time when the online advertising market is increasingly unpredictable.But according to Mr. Festa, publishers should think about the long-term impact those services can have on their sites, and not just the extra revenue.Ultimately, LittleThings decided to remove content recommendation networks from its site entirely, he said, spurred in part by their use of increasingly \u201cshocking and disturbing images,\u201d which it felt weren\u2019t suitable alongside its content and drove some users to abandon its site.It made a similar decision with so-called \u201coutstream\u201d video ads, which automatically expand and play in between paragraphs of articles.\u201cOur initial belief, like most publishers, was that outstream provided relatively easy incremental revenue,\u201d Mr. Festa said. But the company determined that the ads were confusing users and having a detrimental effect on engagement and sharing rates across the site.LittleThings believes its experience shows that publishers don\u2019t need to rely on aggressive ad tactics to make ends meet, and that they might even be shooting themselves in the foot by including them on their pages.\u201cWe have proven that publishers can get the most impact out of every session while maximizing user experience and value to advertisers,\u201d Mr. Festa said.Write to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 06:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-publishers-try-reducing-ads-to-boost-revenue-1499940061", "news_title": "Online Publishers Try Reducing Ads to Boost Revenue", "keywords": "marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,digital marketing,public relations,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "China is creating roadblocks for U.S. auto makers and tech companies to bringing self-driving cars to the world\u2019s largest auto market.Citing national security concerns, China is limiting the amount of mapping that can be done by foreign companies, as             General Motors Co.      ,             Ford Motor                   Co.,         Alphabet Inc.       and             Apple Inc.       rush to develop self-driving cars or the software behind them. High-definition maps are crucial for autonomous cars to help them discern their exact location, navigate tricky intersections and avoid fixed objects such as buildings.Global car makers already need to form a partnership with a local company to open factories in China, but some are skeptical they will be able to find a way to operate their autonomous-car software in China because of the mapping restrictions.Brian McClendon,        an industry pioneer who helped created Google Maps and later led Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s self-driving effort, said he doubted U.S. software would ever be adopted for self-driving cars in China.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a bifurcated market for self-driving\u2014China will do China and the U.S. will do U.S. and the rest of the world will quickly choose and do one or the other,\u201d said Mr. McClendon, now a research professor at the University of Kansas.To secure turn-by-turn navigation maps, foreign car makers currently work with Chinese mapping companies. But auto makers and tech companies might have reasons to hesitate before working with a third-party map provider in China on the high-definition maps needed by autonomous cars.James Wu,        co-founder of U.S. mapping startup DeepMap Inc., who formerly worked at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Apple and China\u2019s             Baidu Inc.,        BIDU 0.74%       said ownership of mapping data is crucial in self-driving cars.\u201cIf a non-Chinese company works with a Chinese local map company with a license, then who owns the data? Who would be responsible for safety issues, privacy issues, security issues associated with the map data? It is a pretty messy problem to sort out,\u201d Mr. Wu said.GM,        GM 0.11%       Apple and Ford declined to comment on the issue of mapping data in China. Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-driving unit, Waymo, didn\u2019t reply to an email seeking comment.Earlier this year,       Li Shufu,        founder of Geely, the Chinese auto maker that owns Volvo, urged the National Committee of the People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference to relax the mapping barriers, which he cautioned could hurt the country\u2019s development of self-driving vehicles.Unless his call is heeded, foreign tech and car companies will need to work with one of 13 Chinese companies licensed by the government for surveying and mapping. The three largest are Baidu, the AutoNavi unit of             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -0.39%      , and             NavInfo Co.      , which is backed by             Tencent Holdings Ltd.        TCEHY 3.69%German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, for example, announced a partnership this spring with Chinese mapping firms including Baidu and AutoNavi to cooperate on high-definition maps there. \u201cThe market with regards to maps in China is quite strongly regulated, which is different from other countries,\u201d said       Renaud Bonhomme,        director of advanced innovation and system engineering with a Robert Bosch unit in China.Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea also said recently that it would use Baidu\u2019s maps in its vehicles sold in China, and said it is exploring joint efforts in autonomous driving technologies with the Beijing-based company. Baidu says its high-definition maps have collected data from 300,000 kilometers of highway in China.The Chinese companies are considered to be far behind Waymo, which was launched in 2009 and has already chalked up more than 3 million miles of autonomous driving on public roads in the U.S. Baidu started its autonomous-driving research in 2014 and claims its high-definition maps have collected data from just 300,000 kilometers of China\u2019s nearly 5 million kilometers of roads.German mapping provider HERE, owned by auto makers             Audi,BMW AG             and         Daimler AG      , will bring its maps to China after receiving investment and forming a 50-50 joint venture with Navinfo last December.Meanwhile,         GM,       Volvo and Daimler are in talks about possibly using high-definition mapping technology in China from Autonavi, said a person familiar with the situation.Mapping restrictions play out in a small scale today with Google\u2019s connected car platform Android Auto. Despite a rollout in 31 markets world-wide, Google\u2019s platform, which connects smartphone applications to a car\u2019s dashboard, isn\u2019t available in China.Google\u2019s services, including Google Maps, are restricted by China regulators, resulting in a bad user experience for Chinese consumers, said       Colin Bird,        a senior analyst at IHS Automotive.The California-based technology giant currently has only a local partnership to provide maps for desktop computers in China, and gaining permission to expand that to smartphones, cars and other uses could be problematic given the company\u2019s stormy departure in 2010 over government censorship of its search engine.Further hurdles await foreign software and car companies beyond maps. They are likely to face difficulty gaining approval to conduct test drives in the country, as the government will seek to support its domestic enterprises, said       Li Zhishan,        an auto technology analyst at Analysys in Beijing.Industry watchers say the situation is another reminder of the dilemma facing Western countries: China is too big to ignore, but there is always a price for a seat at the table.\u201cOnce again, China uses leverage to lock in a competitive advantage, and can do so because they know everyone wants market access,\u201d said       Michael Dunne,        president of Hong Kong-based investment advisory firm Dunne Automotive.\u2014Mike Colias in Detroit and       Wang Fanfan       in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com and Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Roadblock: China\u2019s Grip on Maps.'", "news_time": "2017-07-13 05:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/off-the-map-the-rough-road-ahead-for-self-driving-cars-in-china-1499938205", "news_title": "Off the Map: The Rough Road Ahead for Self-Driving Cars in China", "keywords": "apple,autonomous vehicles,china,digital maps,ford,general motors,google,google maps,self-driving cars,tesla,uber,vc industry news,Alphabet Cl C,GOOG,Waymo,Google,GOOGL,Volvo,VOLV-B.SK,Alibaba Group,BABA,Audi,NSU.XE,Apple,AAPL,AutoNavi,Baidu,BIDU,BMW,BMW.XE,Robert Bosch,Geely Automobile Holdings,0175.HK,Ford Motor,F,General Motors,GM,Hyundai Motor,005380.SE,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Daimler,XE:DAI,Brian McClendon,information technology,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,computers,consumer electronics,automobile electronics,motor vehicles,passenger cars,motor vehicle parts,wholesalers,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,automotive telematics,automobile,automobile part wholesale,e-commerce,electronic navigation,tracking systems,industrial electronics,industrial goods,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "It\u2019s been more than five months since President       Donald Trump       declared that he was putting Iran \u201con notice.\u201dFor the Iranian regime, that is turning out to be a rather comfortable place.While the Trump administration is still formulating its Iran and Syria policies, a series of international events have combined to bolster Iran\u2019s influence, at least for now.Top among them is the crisis over Qatar, which erupted days after Mr. Trump\u2019s high-profile trip to a summit in Riyadh in May. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have shut their embassies in Qatar, closed borders and banned travel and trade with the emirate.The conflict has already turned what used to be a two-way confrontation between the Saudi-led Sunni axis and the Iran-led Shiite camp into a three-way regional fracture that offers fresh strategic opportunities for Tehran.\u201cThe Saudi effort to build a consensus against Iran in the region has hit the rocks with Qatar. This split is something that Iran is enjoying,\u201d said       Hassan Ahmadian,        a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Research think tank in Tehran. \u201cIran\u2019s ruling elite likes it and believes that the future stability of the region is better served by having more than two axes confronting one another.\u201dIn fact, the measures the Saudis and their allies have adopted against Qatar are sometimes harsher than their policies toward Iran. The U.A.E. and Iran, for example, maintain diplomatic and trade relations, and extensive air links.With regional heavyweight Turkey taking Qatar\u2019s side, the collapse of the Sunni alliance isn\u2019t the only good news for Tehran. The growing alienation between the Trump administration and European nations, particularly Germany and France, is also making any new concerted international effort to pressure Iran increasingly unlikely.Some Iranian leaders appreciate this trans-Atlantic discord \u201cas giving Iran some short-term advantages and breathing space,\u201d said       Brian Katulis,        a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank close to the Democrats, who recently participated in informal discussions with Iranian representatives. \u201cAmerica looks distracted and unfocused\u2014and besides the rhetoric of putting Iran \u2018on notice\u2019 and a few tactical policy shifts, Iran right now seems to see the gap between Trump\u2019s bluster and actions.\u201dThis month, France\u2019s             Total SA       said it would push ahead with a $1 billion investment into Iran\u2019s South Pars gas field, the first major injection of Western money since international sanctions against Iran were lifted as part of a nuclear agreement last year. Iran and Qatar share ownership of this gas field, the world\u2019s largest.Iran\u2019s position has strengthened, too, in the Middle East\u2019s actual battlefields. In Iraq and Syria, advances by Iran\u2019s Shiite proxies against Islamic State and moderate Sunni rebels are making possible the establishment of an overland \u201cresistance highway\u201d that would link, through friendly territory, Tehran to Damascus and Beirut for the first time since the Syrian war began in 2011\u2014a major geopolitical gain.The war in Yemen remains at a stalemate, at great cost to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.\u00a0The Iranian-backed Hezbollah Shiite militia keeps consolidating its influence over the Lebanese state. Even the low-grade Shiite insurgency in parts of eastern Saudi Arabia has flared up of late.The Saudi-led campaign against Qatar, meanwhile, has allowed Tehran to improve its relationship with the embattled emirate\u2014and with Qatar\u2019s main ally, Turkey. Both nations have long backed Sunni rebels fighting against Iranian allies in Syria, a support that could diminish as a result of the current Gulf crisis.\u201cIn the recent past, each time Saudi Arabia has downsized or frozen its relations with an Arab country, such as Lebanon and Iraq, this has presented Iran an opportunity to strengthen its relations to the local actors at a detriment to Saudi Arabia,\u201d said       Ellie Geranmayeh,        senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.While Iran and the Qatar-Turkey camp agree on some key regional issues, such as support for the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, their rapprochement can go only so far, of course. Turkey and Qatar remain military allies of the U.S., and Turkey in particular views itself as Iran\u2019s geopolitical rival and equal. The Sunni Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Pan-Islamic group that is backed by Turkey and Qatar alike, is also fundamentally at odds with Iran\u2019s Shiite theocratic doctrine.This means that Iran\u2019s overriding interest is for both sides of the Qatar crisis to get bruised by the dispute.\u201cIn the long term, both the Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabism, which is the basis of Saudi Arabia\u2019s kingdom, don\u2019t accept Shiites as Muslims,\u201d said       Mohammad Eslami,        an Iranian commentator and a fellow at Mofid University in Iran. \u201cAnd both believe that they should control the power of Iran in the region.\u201dWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-stature-grows-as-rivals-quarrel-1499938203", "news_title": "Iran\u2019s Stature Grows as Rivals Quarrel ", "keywords": " hamas, hezbollah,iran, isil, isis, islamic state, middle east, qatar, qatar crisis, saudi arabia, tehran, turkey"}, {"content": "One of the best times to buy stocks is when interest rates are falling and profit growth is accelerating. As earnings season kicks off, interest rates and earnings are doing the opposite, and that tends to be a bad time to own shares.Analysts estimate that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 will rise 7.9% from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Exclude the substantial boost from the recovery in the energy sector, and earnings will still be up an estimated 4.8%So, not bad. But not as good as the first quarter, when overall earnings were up 15.3% from a year earlier, and earnings excluding the energy sector were up 11%. Or the fourth quarter, when overall earnings were up 8%, and earnings excluding energy were up 8.1%.For profits, it is the growth that matters, and when profit growth slips, stocks can struggle.\u00a0Things could get tougher from here. Companies are cycling past the easy comparisons from the first half of 2016, and are facing rising labor costs, both of which weigh on earnings growth.S&P 500 earnings growth last peaked in the third quarter of 2014 at 10.3% on the year, and by the first quarter last year contracted by 5%. Over that period, the index advanced just 4.4%. It might have fared worst if not for falling interest rates.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell from 2.52% at the end of the third quarter of 2014 to 1.78% in the first quarter last year as faltering global growth and low inflation led the Fed to rethink its rate-increase plans. So even though earnings were flagging, stocks looked like a better value than bonds.While earnings growth is likely to be softer in the quarters ahead, it doesn\u2019t seem likely to weaken as much as it did through early 2016. The global economy is on better footing and the oil bust is unlikely to repeat itself. But those factors have cleared the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Stock market data from the past 50 years show that shares tend to do poorly when rates are rising and earnings growth is slowing. Add high valuations to the mix and the environment gets more challenging. Stocks can always go higher, of course, but history says any gains will be modest and hard-fought.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-13 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-one-two-combination-for-stocks-1499938200", "news_title": "A One-Two Combination for Stocks ", "keywords": " earnings growth,interest rates,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "A consortium fronted by two Chinese investment funds has been tapped as the preferred bidder to buy Singapore\u2019s             Global Logistic Properties Ltd.        GBTZY 0.94%      , in a closely watched contest for control of one of the world\u2019s largest warehousing companies.The group\u2014which beat out a competing bid from U.S. private-equity giants Warburg Pincus LLC and Blackstone Group LP\u2014is led by China\u2019s Hillhouse Capital Group, known for its early and savvy bets on Chinese internet champions like             Tencent Holdings Ltd.        TCEHY 3.69%      , and Hopu Investment Management Co., which helped lead a $2.5 billion investment in GLP\u2019s China assets in 2014, according to people familiar with the deal. Hopu founder Fang Fenglei sits on GLP\u2019s board.The group is offering around 3 Singapore dollars (US$2.18) a share, one of the people familiar with the deal said. That is slightly above the S$2.70 price that GLP shares last traded at on Wednesday, prior to a trading halt Thursday morning. The offer would value the company at around S$14 billion (US$10.2 billion), based on the number of shares outstanding.The Hillhouse-Hopu group also includes GLP Chief Executive       Ming Mei,        as well as developer             China Vanke Co.       and             Bank of China Ltd.      , the people said.GLP has said Messrs. Fang and Mei have recused themselves from all board decisions relating to the bids.The consortium is likely to get a pledge from GLP\u2019s largest shareholder, Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd., to sell its shares to the group, the people familiar with the deal said, which would effectively clinch the deal. GLP is likely to make an announcement on the deal by the end of the week, the people said.GLP, which has a current market capitalization of around US$9 billion, is a major player in the booming business of storing and moving goods from suppliers to consumers. It manages nearly US$40 billion in logistics assets\u2014a bit more than half the amount of No. 1 warehouse owner             Prologis Inc.       of the U.S. But GLP says it is the biggest owner of warehouses in many of the world\u2019s most important markets, including China, Japan and Brazil, and the second largest in the U.S. after Prologis.It has grown rapidly through acquisitions, including the US$8.1 billion purchase, with GIC, of U.S. industrial property owner IndCor from Blackstone.Earlier this year, GIC, which owns 37% of GLP, asked for a strategic review of the company\u2019s options, kicking off the process that led to the potential sale.Write to P.R.

South Korea\u2019s Kospi index jumped more than 1% Thursday after the Bank of Korea kept interest rates unchanged and raised its growth forecast. The Kospi has surged 19% this year to all-time highs despite the accelerating nuclear threat from North Korea.And overall, the MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan index has risen steadily, up 23% this year. The index\u2019s worst pullback this year has been just 2%, the smallest intra-year decline in at least 30 years and far below the average pullback of 20% in a given year, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\u201cI\u2019ve been asking this same question since March about when we\u2019re going to get consolidation or a market correction [in Asia],\u201d said Tai Hui, chief market strategist Asia at J.P.

Tencent and HSBC have helped the index surge about 4% this week, on pace for its best weekly performance in a year.Roughly half of the rise in banking giant HSBC\u2019s shares this year have come since the end of June. Major global banks with operations in the U.S. have performed strongly since then, after the Fed\u2019s annual stress tests gave most a clean bill of health, paving the way for more buybacks and dividends.While the Fed doesn\u2019t have a say over HSBC\u2019s dividend policy, analysts say the bank might follow its U.S. peers by stepping up its shareholder-friendly payouts this year, on top of an already attractive 5.3% dividend yield. An expected rise in borrowing costs world-wide has also helped global banks including HSBC, as it should improve their profit margins.HSBC was already one of the Hang Seng\u2019s biggest companies 20 years ago when China regained control of Hong Kong. Despite its British heritage, it is the only company that remains among the Hang Seng\u2019s top 10 largest stocks by market cap in the same form as it was in back then.HSBC is today the largest company among Hong Kong-listed financials, which as an industry makes up 47% of the Hang Seng Index.Meanwhile Tencent, which was founded in 1998, is now the world\u2019s largest videogame publisher by revenue. It also owns China\u2019s largest social network, WeChat, where people use it for everything from communicating with friends and family to ordering and paying for meals to booking vacations.In nearly two decades, Tencent has already catapulted to become one of China\u2019s most valuable companies by market capitalization, flip-flopping with fellow tech giant, New York Stock Exchange-listed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., for the top spot.And Tencent\u2019s rally this year has made it the Hang Seng\u2019s biggest constituent, with about a 12% index weighting.Tencent has ridden the global surge in tech stocks this year, which has helped the likes of             Apple Inc.       and             Facebook Inc.       also record strong gains. Its shares suffered a rare blip last week, when the company imposed a curfew and daily playing-time limits on children who play its top-grossing mobile game, Honor of Kings.Analysts worry the new policies, which were implemented as a way to prevent gaming addiction, could hurt Tencent\u2019s overall revenue, of which 30% comes from mobile gaming.

Answer: Blame the foreigners.That is where China\u2019s latest trade data could come in. Chinese exports to the U.S. surged 19.8% in June, the fastest pace since 2015, while its overall exports only rose 11.3%. That has driven a 23% on-year rise in the U.S.-China trade deficit to its widest level since late 2015.All this is a bullish signal for U.S. growth. But an embattled President       Donald Trump       may now refocus on the rebounding deficit given lack of progress on other areas in the Sino-U.S. relationship, particularly North Korea. Investors should prepare themselves for trade tensions to re-emerge as a major risk to global growth.For a while, it looked like things didn\u2019t have to be that way. After a rocky start, U.S.-China relations warmed noticeably after the Mar-a-Lago summit between Mr. Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping in April. A 100-day plan on trade promised big results on the deficit, with Mr. Trump indicating he was willing to soften his rhetoric in exchange for help with North Korea.China has since waived restrictions on U.S. beef imports and curbed coal purchases from North Korea, but other progress has been sparse. And with North Korea having now successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile, pressure on Mr. Trump to get tough with China on trade is resurfacing.There are some hopeful signs\u2014China has begun importing significant volumes of U.S. crude, taking advantage of the end of the U.S. oil-export ban two years ago. On current trends, China could buy $1 billion of U.S. oil this year.Still, the overall trade deficit is once again marching higher.

The increase came in higher that the 8.7% growth in May and a forecast for a 9.0% rise by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.Imports in June also came in stronger than expected, expanding 17.2% from a year earlier, after a 14.8% increase in May. Economists had forecast a 12.4% gain.China\u2019s trade surplus widened in June to $42.77 billion from $40.81 billion in May, falling short of a median forecast for a $44.2 billion surplus.\u200bContinued global economic recovery and improving external demand boosted Chinese exports while imports were buoyed by steady domestic growth and higher commodity prices, China\u2019s customs officials said in a briefing on Thursday.China\u2019s trade data is closely watched as a barometer of strength in global trade though exports have become a less important factor in China\u2019s own growth in recent years.As the world\u2019s biggest exporter, China\u2019s economy once depended heavily on outbound shipments. After the global financial crisis crippled external demand, Beijing moved to make the economy more reliant on domestic consumption.Thanks to strong demand from Europe and the U.S., exports contributed to overall economic growth in the first quarter after export declines in the past two years had dragged overall growth down.\u201cExport contribution to China\u2019s GDP growth is expected to continue in the second quarter, which could also help offset the slowdown from infrastructure and property investment,\u201d said       Liu Xuezhi,        a             Bank of Communications                   economist.China\u2019s statistics bureau is set to release GDP and other economic data on Monday.After securing strong growth in the first quarter, Beijing has made it a priority to rein in crippling debt levels and property speculation. Government measures to restrict home purchases in many cities are dampening investment in the real-estate sector while the regulatory crackdown on financial leverage in recent months has pushed up borrowers\u2019 lending costs.
