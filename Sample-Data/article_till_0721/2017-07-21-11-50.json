Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, expecting to repurchase them at lower prices and collect the difference as profit.Bearish investors say they are scaling back on these bets not because their view of the market has fundamentally changed, but because it is difficult to stick to a money-losing strategy when it seems stocks can only go up.They believe the market moves are at odds with an economy that remains lukewarm as it enters its ninth year of growth, stock valuations that are historically high and a delay of business-friendly policies in Washington like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\u201cThere seems to be an overall view that people are invincible, that things will always go up, that there are no risks and no matter what goes on, no matter what foolishness is in play, people don\u2019t care,\u201d said Marc Cohodes, whose hedge fund focused on shorting stocks closed in 2008.Mr. Cohodes is now a chicken farmer based in California who is looking to get into goat herding in Canada. He shorts a handful of individual stocks personally, but isn\u2019t focused on the broader market.The practice of shorting companies is also going by the wayside as stocks continue to notch new records. Short-biased hedge funds had $4.3 billion in assets at the end of March, down from $7.1 billion at the end of 2013, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.The difficulty for stock-market bears stems from a Goldilocks-like market environment, where the economy is growing fast enough to support corporate earnings, but slow enough for the Federal Reserve to keep rates relatively low. Years of low rates and easy-money policies have boosted stocks, defying forecasts for a steep, prolonged downturn.\u201cThe shorts have been frustrated now for quite a while,\u201d said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, which has $260 billion in assets under management. The scenarios that might lead to a payout for market bears\u2014an economic recession or a sharp rise in interest rates\u2014don\u2019t seem imminent, either, Mr. Minerd added.In one sign of capitulation among the bears, stock pullbacks have been getting shorter. This year, there have been two times when the S&P 500 has closed down 1% or more. After these two selloffs, it has taken stocks an average of 14.5 days to recoup losses. That is well below the 25.5 days it took on average to bounce back from stretches of 1%-plus selloffs in 2016 and the 80 days it took to rebound in 2015, according to an analysis by WSJ Market Data Group.The share of individual investors who are either bullish or bearish has also fallen in recent months, according to a weekly survey by the American Association of Individual Investors, while the share of those who are neutral has risen. As of the end of June, 43% of investors said they were neutral\u2014the most since last August.\u201cThe danger is that you\u2019re too early getting out,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management, which has $246 billion under management.The issue for investors, Mr. Ramos said, is that there remain few compelling alternatives to stocks.Bond yields have remained stubbornly low this year, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Thursday at 2.266%, down from 2.446% at the end of 2016.Central banks around the world in recent weeks have signaled they will move toward normalizing monetary policy, nudging bond yields higher. But few investors believe inflation will pick up so much that the Fed will be pressured into lifting rates faster than it has forecast\u2014a scenario that could lead to sharp market losses.At the same time, many who are invested in stocks are wary of signs that the bull market\u2019s days are numbered.Valuations have risen to levels many investors say are stretched, with the S&P 500 trading this week at 17.82 times the next 12 months of expected earnings, according to FactSet, above its 10-year average of 14.08 times forward earnings.Still, some who believe excesses are growing in the financial system say it is hard to convey those concerns to average investors. While signs of a housing bubble in the mid-2000s were abundant, indications that borrowing by companies will lead to a wave of defaults are more nuanced, according to Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Mr. Edwards has been bearish for most of the bull market and believes a corporate-debt binge will ultimately lead to a deeper bear market than in the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s much harder this time to see the corporate-debt excesses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a headline catcher. You have to be a bit geeky to pull apart the data and analyze it.\u201dDespite persistent concerns that investment-grade corporate bonds and junk debt are pricey, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of credit investors found that none of the respondents were significantly underweight either sector.In the week ended July 12, investors piled more than $3 billion into global equity funds, marking the seventh straight week of inflows for such funds, according to EPFR data.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of worry out there, but the market just keeps going up,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cWhen everyone agrees that it\u2019s time for this bull market to keep going, that\u2019s exactly the right time for the market rally to stop.\u201d\u2014Peter Levin contributed to this article.Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00"}, {"keywords": "north korea, north korea travel ban, tourism, travel ban, u.s.,U.S. government,Otto Warmbier,political,general news,politics,international relations", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-ban-tourist-visits-to-north-korea-travel-agencies-say-1500627560", "news_title": "U.S. to Ban Tourist Visits to North Korea, Tour Operators Say ", "content": "SEOUL\u2014Two of the biggest travel companies that bring Western tourists to North Korea say the U.S. government will ban its citizens from traveling to the isolated country starting next month.The travel ban would come just weeks after U.S. college student       Otto Warmbier,        who was detained while on a tour in Pyongyang last year, died after he returned home in June with a severe brain injury.The two tour operators, China-based Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, said Friday the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which handles U.S. diplomatic affairs in North Korea, had contacted them separately by phone to inform them of the U.S. decision.Officers at both companies said the Swedish Embassy told them the U.S. would make the announcement on Thursday next week, with the ban to take effect 30 days later, in late August. Violating the ban would lead to the U.S. government invalidating the traveler\u2019s passport, Young Pioneer said it was told.It is unclear whether the travel ban would also apply to humanitarian and educational work in North Korea.The U.S. Embassy in Seoul declined to comment. Calls and emails to the Swedish embassies in Pyongyang and Seoul weren\u2019t immediately answered.Young Pioneer stopped bringing U.S. tourists to North Korea last month following the death of Mr. Warmbier, who went to North Korea in late 2015 on a tour organized by the company.At least three Americans are being held in North Korea, though none was a tourist. Two are tied to a Christian university in Pyongyang.U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       told lawmakers last month that the U.S. was considering a ban on travel to North Korea but hadn\u2019t reached a decision.A bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in May would ban tourism to North Korea and require any U.S. citizen going there for humanitarian and educational work to seek a license from the Treasury Department.About 5,000 Western tourists visit North Korea each year, with roughly one-fifth of them U.S. citizens, according to Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which has been bringing visitors to North Korea since 1993.Tourists visiting North Korea aren\u2019t typically allowed to travel independently and generally join group tours, where they are closely chaperoned by representatives of official state entities.Tourism companies catering to the demands of tourists with less-conventional tastes have sprung up in recent years in the U.S., Europe, China and Australia. Most tours to North Korea last between three days and two weeks and are focused on Pyongyang, though some have included activities such as train travel, skiing and surfing.Mr. Cockerell said Friday that the travel ban would be \u201ca big blow to us,\u201d and it would likely reduce the willingness of other Western nationals to travel to North Korea.U.K.-incorporated Koryo Tours accounts for about 40% of the overall volume of Western tourists to North Korea, he estimates. Mr. Cockerell criticized the U.S. decision.\u201cAll interactions between North Koreans and Americans, who are very much demonized in the country, will grind to a halt, and the North Koreans will only be left with their own media to portray Americans as they like,\u201d he said.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:54:00"}, {"keywords": "aetna,aig, aig ceo,brian duperreault, catholic,chubb,cigna, faith,hank greenberg, insurance, insurance ceo, jesuit,American International Group,AIG,St. Joseph's University,Brian Duperreault,insurance,financial services", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-fort-knox-clerk-to-insurance-kingpin-the-rise-of-aigs-new-ceo-1500629400", "news_title": "From Fort Knox Clerk to Insurance Kingpin: The Rise of AIG\u2019s New CEO ", "content": "It would be hard to find anyone in insurance with a longer resume than             American International Group Inc.\u2019s        AIG -0.45%       new chief executive       Brian Duperreault.Mr. Duperreault started as an actuarial trainee at AIG in 1973, straight out of a postcollege stint in the U.S. Army. He rose through the company\u2019s ranks to become a senior executive, before leaving in 1994. Over the past 23 years, he has turned one niche offshore insurer into a large and diversified company, become CEO of a big industry brokerage and co-founded his own insurance firm.In returning to AIG, his plan is straightforward: Grow AIG.He thinks the company has shrunk enough after unloading a series of businesses to help repay a nearly $185 billion U.S. government bailout, and then selling more assets to finance share buybacks. Mr. Duperreault wants to expand in part through acquisitions as well as AIG\u2019s life and personal lines insurance businesses, particularly internationally.\u201cI [was] looking at my alma mater having issues,\u201d the 70-year-old said in his first extensive interview since taking the AIG job in May. \u201cMy head was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 because I had a great job. But my heart was telling me otherwise.\u201dOver the past few weeks, Mr. Duperreault has brought in executives from outside the company and plans to increase use of data science and predictive analytics, particularly as a way to expand sales to midsize businesses.Many of AIG\u2019s 56,400 employees are now meeting Mr. Duperreault for the first time through town halls in New York, Boston, Chicago, London and Dublin, so far. Among things they are learning: Their new boss has deep faith. A Roman Catholic who was educated by nuns in Trenton, N.J., he later attended the Jesuit-run St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia, Pa.\u201cFaith and family are the two things I wanted them to understand about me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important element of running a company is doing the right thing, and faith gives one the courage to do that.\u201dMr. Duperreault said he speaks publicly of his religious side \u201cwhen I am being asked about who I am.\u201d He has publicly thanked God for his successes, and keeps a Bible in his office for \u201cwhen I feel that I have to read it.\u201dMr. Duperreault didn\u2019t initially aim for an insurance career. He went to St. Joe\u2019s to study chemistry, but \u201cI just wasn\u2019t any good at lab work.\u201d He majored in math, then after college he enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War and spent three years doing clerical work at Fort Knox, Ky.Upon discharge, job choices were limited with a stalled U.S. economy. Actuaries were in demand.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about actuarial science,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is, I needed a job.\u201dHe was hired at AIG, then a midsize property-casualty insurer, in the early stages of its transformation into one of the world\u2019s largest financial-services firms by its CEO, Maurice R. \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault\u2019s first assignment was to create divorce insurance that would guarantee income should a marriage fail. While that product wasn\u2019t launched, he eventually became a key lieutenant of the legendarily hard-charging Mr. Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault said he left AIG in 1994 to determine if he had \u201cthe wherewithal to stand alone and succeed\u201d without Mr. Greenberg.In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said he is pleased to see Mr. Duperreault back at AIG, calling him \u201ca good choice.\u201d Mr. Greenberg left AIG in 2005 and now runs insurance and investment firm Starr Cos.Mr. Duperreault replaced       Peter Hancock,        who lost his hold on the CEO job earlier this year after delaying profit-improvement deadlines. Mr. Hancock had been narrowing AIG\u2019s focus through divestitures.\u201cI think Brian is wise in getting rid of that liquidation strategy,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg, referring to Mr. Hancock\u2019s divestitures. Turning around AIG \u201cwill take time, and you have to have a strategy to differentiate AIG from other companies. He\u2019s had a lot of training, been in the industry a long time. But time will tell.\u201dMr. Duperreault\u2019s first job outside of AIG was as CEO of             ACE Ltd.      , which back then was a liability-insurance specialist. The job returned him to his birthplace: Bermuda, where he was born to American parents. Over the next decade, he diversified and expanded ACE through acquisitions. In 2004, he stepped down as CEO and became nonexecutive chairman.In 2008, he became CEO of then-struggling brokerage and consulting firm             Marsh & McLennan Co      s. He cut costs, strengthened management and acquired smaller firms to bolster growth. He left in 2012.The following year, while on a dinner cruise in Hamilton, Bermuda, he mentioned still having \u201cgas in the tank\u201d to insurance executive David Brown. Mr. Brown knew that hedge fund Two Sigma Investments, a leader in quantitative analysis, was looking to get into insurance, and he put Mr. Duperreault in contact with them.That led to Mr. Duperreault co-founding Hamilton Insurance Group in 2013 with Two Sigma\u2019s principals. As part of Mr. Duperreault\u2019s new job, a Two Sigma affiliate aims to work with AIG on an insurance platform.AIG today is far different than the one Mr. Duperreault left in 1994. Gone to repay its bailout are Asian life-insurance operations, aircraft leasing and other crown jewels. Also gone are some former rivals such as             Aetna Inc.       and             Cigna Corp.      , which divested property-casualty units. New competition has emerged, including             Chubb Ltd.       That insurer is the former ACE and is run by Hank Greenberg\u2019s son Evan, who succeeded Mr. Duperreault at ACE.\u201cYou need to have great rivalries to make you better,\u201d Mr. Duperreault said. \u201cSo it\u2019s actually a wonderful thing, in a way, that they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re so good because it\u2019s going to make us better.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00"}, {"keywords": "activist shareholder,baker hughes,ge,ge cost cutting,ge earnings,ge earnings outlook,general electric earnings,General Electric,GE,John Flannery,financial performance,earnings,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,industrial electrical equipment,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/general-electric-makes-progress-on-cost-cutting-1500635688", "news_title": "GE Leaves Investors in Limbo", "content": "General Electric Co.

Mr. Immelt will step down at the end of the month and be replaced by health-care unit chief      John Flannery.GE backed its prior guidance of fiscal 2017 earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 a share, and organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, but warned that profit would be on the weak side.\u201cGiven our outlook on oil and gas and power, we are trending to the bottom end of the range,\u201d Chief Financial Officer       Jeffrey Bornstein       said on a conference call Friday.The second-quarter results beat analyst expectations on revenue and earnings, but Wall Street is also looking for deeper signs of prosperity at the company to help turn around the negative sentiment.\u201dWe think 2Q results may not be enough to significantly alleviate negative investor sentiment,\u201d said             Citigroup                   analyst       Andrew Kaplowitz.       \u201cDespite what we view as generally solid results in the quarter.\u201dAnalysts are doubtful that GE will reach a long-term goal of delivering $2 a share in profit in 2018, but the company said an updated view won\u2019t come until Mr. Flannery reports to investors in mid-November after he conducts a review of the company\u2019s business.GE said it will include an assessment of the entire business, a review of cost cuts, capital allocation and update the 2018 outlook. Analysts currently project $1.81 a share in 2018 EPS and Mr. Immelt has already said it would be at the high end of the range and only if additional cost cuts were made.Mr. Flannery is meeting with investors and visiting the business units of the complex company. On the call, one analyst asked if GE will be in \u201climbo\u201d until November. Mr. Flannery reiterated that the framework for 2017 is set and he is \u201cnot worried that we\u2019re going to be, you know, dead in the water in the meantime.\u201dMr. Bornstein defended the timeline, saying it is a \u201cbig, big body of work,\u201d and that Mr. Flannery is \u201cgetting deep on developing his own views about what we\u2019re going to invest against, what we\u2019re not going to invest against.\u201dCash flow in GE\u2019s industrial segment was a positive $1.5 billion after a shocking first-quarter shortfall of $1.6 billion. The company backed its full-year target of $12 billion to $14 billion, and Mr. Immelt said the company expects cash flow to continue to improve throughout the year.GE cut $593 million in industrial costs in the second quarter and said it was on track to meet or beat its $1 billion savings goal by the end of the year. It has cut $670 million so far this year.GE has been under intense pressure to cut expenses and pledged in March to cut $1 billion in annual industrial expenses for each of the next two years, which is twice the level of cuts originally laid out. The increase followed discussions with activist investor Trian Fund Management, which has been frustrated by missed profit goals.In recent years, the company has turned its focus to its industrial businesses, shedding low-margin units like home appliances and recently closed a big oil-and-gas deal. GE combined its own oil and gas operations with             Baker Hughes Inc.,       a provider of oil-field services and equipment, to form a new public company controlled by GE.Industrial orders\u2014which give a glimpse at future demand for equipment like jet engines, power turbines and oil-related equipment\u2014rose 6% in the quarter, driven by strength in its aviation and health-care businesses.Revenue from its power business rose 5%, while health care rose 4% and aviation was flat. Oil and gas continued to struggle with a drop of 3%.In all, GE\u2019s second-quarter earnings fell less than expected. Much of the drop came from a year-ago boost from the sale of its home appliances business. The company reported a profit of $1.19 billion, or 15 cents a share, down from $2.76 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.Adjusted earnings fell to 28 cents from 51 cents a year earlier. Revenue fell 12% to $29.56 billion. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings of 25 cents on $29.02 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2014 Imani Moise contributed to this article.Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 11:30:00"}, {"keywords": "daesh,isis,islamic state,sectarian war,shiite,sunni,al Qaeda in Iraq,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/among-iraqis-freed-from-isis-resentment-festers-1500634800", "news_title": "Among Iraqis Freed From ISIS, Resentment Festers", "content": "RAMADI, Iraq\u2014Latifah Rasheed is the 74-year-old matriarch of a Sunni Arab family that lived, until one year ago, under Islamic State rule. A son and two grandsons fought for Islamic State and were killed by the Iraqi forces who wrested their town from the extremists.Mrs. Rasheed and her surviving sons and grandsons said they were prepared to embrace a new Iraq under the Shiite-led government in Baghdad\u2014but Shiite militias guarding their town said they would arrest the men if they return.\u201cIf we\u2019re unable to return home, we\u2019ll join whatever comes after Islamic State,\u201d said Mrs. Rasheed, who is now living with 13 family members in a one-bedroom home on the outskirts of Baghdad. On the day she spoke, a double suicide attack killed nine pro-government forces in her town, Garma, about 35 miles east of Ramadi.Such is the challenge Iraq faces in rebuilding cities and towns liberated from Islamic State amid a cycle of sectarianism that shows little sign of ending and an insurgency that remains active across much of the country.Iraqis from the Sunni Arab minority have been on the outside of power since the 2003 ouster of       Saddam Hussein\u2019s       regime\u2014an upheaval that ushered in the multiple reincarnations of Sunni insurgency that spawned Islamic State.Three years ago, when Islamic State took over about 40% of Iraqi territory, its gains were restricted to Iraq\u2019s three Sunni-majority provinces.With the recent recapture of the city of Mosul, Sunni lands have now been largely retaken. Yet one-third of the country\u2019s seven million Sunni Arabs have been displaced. Some are blocked from returning at checkpoints manned by Shiite or Kurdish militias screening for militants. Others are prevented from returning because of Islamic State mines.Many more have no homes to return to, after the militants and the battles to remove them destroyed their towns and cities.\u201cIslamic State flourishes in poverty and desperation,\u201d said Ibrahim al-Awsaj, mayor of the Sunni city of Ramadi, which was retaken from the Sunni extremists more than a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a second, third or fourth version of Islamic State.\u201dThe mayor rattled off the problems his city has faced since it was retaken 1\u00bd years ago. Around 80% of infrastructure remains damaged, including 40,000 of the city\u2019s 63,000 residential units. Electricity and running water haven\u2019t been fully restored.In this climate, said Mr. Awsaj, who is Sunni, tens of thousands of war widows are struggling to feed their children, many of them sons and daughters of Islamic State fighters. That leaves families vulnerable to insurgents who have drafted child soldiers and lured the destitute by offering salaries.Government officials say rebuilding has been slow because of a lack of federal funds and international aid. Prime Minister Haider Abadi said this month that the government is working at maximum capacity to return the displaced.U.S. Col. Ryan Dillon, the spokesman for the U.S.-led international campaign to defeat Islamic State, praised what he said were Mr. Abadi\u2019s efforts to involve all ethnicities and religions in reunification and reconstruction.\u201cThe Coalition recognizes that is one of the most important things to future stability in Iraq,\u201d he said.For many Sunnis, Baghdad isn\u2019t doing enough. \u201cThis government is a complete failure. The only thing it\u2019s good for is corruption and sectarianism,\u201d Mrs. Rasheed said.That view has helped fuel multiple incarnations of Sunni insurgency in Iraq. After the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, a group of Iraqi and foreign fighters emerged as al Qaeda in Iraq. The group was soon infused with military officers forced by the U.S. from their posts, with thousands of government officials, because they were members of Saddam\u2019s Baath Party.Disgruntled security officers established the insurgency that haunts Iraq today.VIEW InteractiveThe insurgents killed thousands of American and Iraqi troops before the group was severely weakened by 2007 and melted back into the population.In the years that followed, they pursued a low-level insurgency while maintaining ties to local Sunni communities.Sunni discontent with the government continued to fester, and in 2013, Sunni insurgents took advantage of antigovernment protests in parts of Iraq. They called themselves \u201ctribal revolutionaries\u201d\u2014then, in 2014 unfurled their black banners and morphed into Islamic State.As the group sought to set up a religious empire across Iraq and Syria, it presented itself as the protector of a minority under siege.Three years of war against Islamic State have done little to heal the divides between majority Shiites and the sizable Sunni Arab and Kurdish minorities.The latest Sunni militants once again have gone underground after being dislodged from most of Iraqi territory, though their attacks remain a fixture of everyday life.The Iraqi government is working to regain the population\u2019s trust to fight off future radicalism by employing local residents to help with reconstruction.\u201cWith Islamic State, Iraqis have learned their lesson. Islamic State ended in destruction and Iraqis won\u2019t let themselves be cheated again,\u201d said Dr. Majda Mohamed, spokeswoman for a special task force designed to stabilize post-Islamic State areas.Baghdad still doesn\u2019t have enough money to rebuild war zones. Iraq\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on oil and the global slump in prices left the central government without enough revenue. About $210 million has been put into Iraq\u2019s reconstruction fund since it was created in 2015, far from the $100 billion that the government estimates is needed.In some places where reconstruction has started, residents said corruption is seeping into the process.Saad Hamadi, 33, clears Ramadi\u2019s streets of the postwar detritus. As a city employee, he is supposed to be paid 15,000 Iraqi dinars a day, or about $13. He said he usually gets 10,000 dinars because the municipality charges him to use their tools. That, he says, is illegal.\u201cWe already lack services and then we see that we are victims of corruption,\u201d said Mr. Hamadi. \u201cThe people talk, but no one listens to us.\u201dRamadi\u2019s mayor said there is no corruption in his municipality.In the town of Yathrib in Salahuddin province, Adel Hashmawi\u2019s Sunni tribe of 60,000 people have been blocked from returning home by Shiite tribes and militias who accuse them of supporting Islamic State.Mr. Hashmawi acknowledges that Islamic State had some support among them, but asked why his entire tribe is being punished.He linked this treatment to the grievances that saw Islamic State ride to power in the first place. \u201cWe thought: we are between two evils. But the evil of Islamic State is less than that of the government,\u201d Mr. Hashmawi said.Mr. Abadi, the prime minister, recently responded to charges that Shiite militias and the government are collectively punishing Sunni communities: \u201cWe want to apply the law, we do not want to punish innocent people,\u201d he said.Mr. Hashmawi said his town eventually realized the horrors of Islamic State, and many, including himself, tried to flee.He said his tribe has paid about $3 million in reparations\u2014\u201cblood money\u201d\u2014to neighboring Shiite tribes that lost members to Islamic State attacks. But new grievances emerge daily.Mr. Hashmawi accused one of Iraq\u2019s largest Shiite militias, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, of working with the Shiite tribes to prevent his tribe\u2019s return. An official for the militia, Qassem al-Darraji, blamed Shiite tribes, and said the militia was trying to mediate.What is clear in Yathrib is that the government is absent.\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is social reconciliation,\u201d said Dr. Darraji. \u201cBut in Iraq, that\u2019s difficult.\u201d\u2014Ghassan Adnan contributed to this article.Write to Maria Abi-Habib at maria.habib@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-21 07:00:00"}, {"keywords": "election ,fbi,hacking,intelligence committee,manafort,money laundering,russia,special counsel,trump,Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,The Senate,the Treasury Department,Paul Manafort,Jared Kushner,Donald Trump,Robert Mueller,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-investigating-possible-money-laundering-by-paul-manafort-1500587532", "news_title": "Special Counsel Investigating Possible Money Laundering by Paul Manafort ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating possible money laundering by       Paul Manafort,       Donald Trump\u2019s      \u00a0former campaign manager, as part of his criminal investigation into what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the matter.The inquiry into the issue by Mr. Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his team began several weeks ago, this person said.\u00a0A spokesman for Mr. Manafort,       Jason Maloni,        declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Mueller.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is focusing on Russian meddling as well as whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and described investigations into the issue a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied meddling.The Senate and House intelligence committees also are probing possible money laundering by Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of those investigations.The Senate committee also has received reports from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tracks illicit money flows, to learn if any of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses may have financial ties to Russian interests, these people said. Mr. Trump has said he has no such ties.Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant, spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine. He served as Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager for roughly three months in 2016 before resigning.New York Attorney General       Eric Schneiderman       and Manhattan District Attorney       Cyrus Vance Jr.       also are investigating Mr. Manafort\u2019s real-estate transactions, The Wall Street Journal has reported, with both offices examining his dealings for possible money-laundering and fraud. Messrs. Schneiderman and Vance are Democrats.Mr. Manafort has spent and borrowed tens of millions of dollars in connection with properties in the U.S. over the past decade, including a Brooklyn, N.Y., townhouse and California properties being developed by his son-in-law, the Journal has reported.Through his spokesman, Mr. Manafort has said his \u201cpersonal investments in real estate are all ordinary business transactions.\u201dIn April, before Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel, the Justice Department requested Mr. Manafort\u2019s banking records as part of the Russia probe that is now being led by Mr. Mueller, the Journal reported.And earlier this month, the Journal reported that the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office had subpoenaed records relating to up to $16 million in loans that a bank run by       Steve Calk,        a former campaign economic adviser to Mr. Trump, made to Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort and two other top Trump campaign aides\u2014Donald Trump Jr. and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser,       Jared Kushner      \u2014are expected to speak with Senate committees next week as part of their inquiries.\u2014Shane Harris and Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Mueller Probes Manafort Finances.'", "news_time": "2017-07-20 17:52:00"}, {"keywords": " communications director,the mooch, trump administration, white house press office,Anthony Scaramucci,Donald Trump,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,audiovisual production,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,media,entertainment", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/financier-anthony-scaramucci-to-be-named-white-house-communications-director-1500607948", "news_title": "Financier Anthony Scaramucci Likely to Be Named White House Communications Director", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        a top donor to President       Donald Trump       during the campaign, is expected to be named White House communications director on Friday, two White House officials said.Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, is the founder of hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital and a hedge-fund conference known as SALT. Known as \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci previously hosted a financial TV show on             Fox Business Network                   and has been a frequent guest advocating for Mr. Trump on cable news shows.Mr. Scaramucci didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Separately,       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney who is representing him in Special Counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       probe of the links of the president\u2019s associates to Russia, is expected to take on a lesser role on Mr. Trump\u2019s outside legal team, according to a person familiar with the shift.Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s spokesman, Mark Corallo, resigned from his post this week after less than two months on the job, according to a person familiar with his decision, after privately expressing frustration over the administration\u2019s handling of episodes such as the revelation of a meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged in June 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer.Mr. Corallo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Scaramucci, who worked at             Goldman Sachs                   and graduated from Harvard Law School, would join a communications office that has been a target of criticism from Republicans in Washington and Mr. Trump himself.The White House has been seeking a communications director since       Mike Dubke      resigned from the role at the end of May, \u200bas the president aimed to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Mr. Scaramucci had been a top candidate for the role of director for the Office of Public Liaison before it was given to       George Sifakis.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s new job was first reported by Axios.com.The president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI director       James Comey.       But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, press secretary       Sean Spicer       has been filling in for the role of communications director, while deputy press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Scaramucci was active during the 2016 presidential race. After having originally supported Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker for the Republican presidential nomination, and then former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he threw his support behind Mr. Trump and became one of his most vocal supporters.Mr. Scaramucci is serving as chief strategist at the U.S. Export Import Bank. His appointment to that role followed months of uncertainty about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s prospects of joining the White House, after a promised role in the White House was handed to someone else.The move to shift Mr. Scaramucci to the communications team comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are crafting a strategy that aims to contain Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and ensure it doesn\u2019t veer into Mr. Trump\u2019s private business dealings.\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s investigatory activities are limited by his mandate. And looking at a real-estate deal from 10 years ago would exceed that mandate,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, referencing a Bloomberg story that said Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump business deals dating back years.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also would be looking at potential conflicts of interest in the Mueller legal team, Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cConflict of interest issues, if they arise, will be addressed in due course through the normal legal channels if we get to that stage. Any lawyer would look at potential conflicts,\u201d he said.The recourse for Trump\u2019s legal team would be to first approach Mr. Mueller and then the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein,        Mr. Sekulow said. \u200bMr. Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.Write to Michael C.
