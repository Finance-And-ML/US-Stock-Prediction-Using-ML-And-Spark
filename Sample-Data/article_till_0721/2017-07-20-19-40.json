[{"news_title": "U.S. Fines Exxon $2 Million Over Russia Sanctions Breaches ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Treasury Department imposed a $2 million fine on             Exxon Mobil                   Corp. for what it called a \u201creckless disregard\u201d of U.S. sanctions on Russia while Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       was the oil giant\u2019s chief executive. The company immediately said it would challenge the finding.Exxon, under Mr. Tillerson\u2019s helm, in early 2014 deepened the company\u2019s longstanding partnership with the Kremlin despite Washington levying fresh sanctions against Russia for seizing territory in eastern Ukraine. In May 2014, Treasury said the company signed eight documents relating to oil-and-gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        chief executive of the state oil giant PAO Rosneft. Treasury on Thursday said those deals were violations of U.S. sanctions against Mr. Sechin, a former Russian intelligence officer and top ally to President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Tillerson, who has close ties to Russia and received an \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d award from Moscow, left Exxon last year to become U.S. secretary of state. The $2 million fine, Treasury said, was the maximum amount it could levy against the company.A spokesman for Exxon called the fine \u201coutrageous\u201d and said Treasury\u2019s findings are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration at the time the sanctions were enacted.Exxon doesn\u2019t have any direct deals with Mr. Sechin, but does have business dealings with Rosneft, where Mr. Sechin in his capacity as CEO signed company documents, Exxon said. Under President       Barack Obama,        the White House and Treasury in 2014 said U.S. companies were allowed to participate in business dealings with Mr. Sechin if they were professional, not personal, Exxon said.The Office of Foreign Assets Control \u201cseeks to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order that is inconsistent with the explicit and unambiguous guidance from the White House and Treasury issued before the relevant conduct and still publicly available today,\u201d Exxon said in a filing in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas.When Mr. Tillerson took his position in President Trump\u2019s cabinet he promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year. He hasn\u2019t spoken out expressly against the sanctions since taking office.The company showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements\u201d when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under U.S. sanctions, the U.S. Treasury said in an enforcement notice.The State Department referred questions to Exxon.Rosneft spokesman Michael Leontiev told The Wall Street Journal in an email, \u201cI am sure that while Exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both OFAC and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully.\u201d Mr. Leontiev said that signing an agreement with Mr. Sechin not as an individual, but as a representative of Rosneft management, can\u2019t be the foundation for a sanctions violation.The penalty, issued by Treasury\u2019s sanctions unit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, comes as committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as a Justice Department special prosecutor, investigate what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to interfere in the presidential election, and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. President Donald Trump has denied any collusion. Russia has denied meddling.\u201cExxonMobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\u201d of a sanctioned entity, Treasury said.Exxon and other big energy companies recently joined President Trump in voicing concerns about Congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners. Exxon unsuccessfully sought a sanctions waiver from the administration on at least one Russian deal.Lobbyists for Exxon told lawmakers that several provisions in the sanctions legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill are worrisome, including measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals. Companies have also voiced concern that the bill could force them to disclose information they consider proprietary.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "keywords": "exxon,obama,oil ,putin,rosneft,russia,sanctions,tillerson,Exxon Mobil,XOM,U.S. Treasury,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fines-exxon-2-million-over-russia-sanctions-breaches-1500570876", "news_time": "2017-07-20 15:47:00"}, {"news_title": "Jeff Sessions Says He Plans to Continue as Attorney General", "content": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he has no plans to leave the Justice Department and will \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d pursue the Trump administration\u2019s priorities, a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s comment in a recent interview that he regretted appointing Mr. Sessions.\u201cThe work we are doing today is the kind of work that we intend to continue,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at a previously scheduled press conference at the Justice Department. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d he said.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The comments came after Mr. Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t have appointed Mr. Sessions to his job if he had known he would remove himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In the extensive interview, Mr. Trump also criticized the deputy attorney general who took Mr. Sessions\u2019 place overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein      ; the special counsel appointed to run the probe,       Robert Mueller      ; and former Federal Bureau of Investigation director       James Comey,        whom Mr. Trump has said he fired in part over the Russia investigation.Mr. Sessions, an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, deflected the criticism. He said he was honored to serve as attorney general and the position was \u201cbeyond any thought I would have ever had for myself.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201dMr. Sessions was at the White House as recently as Wednesday, for a National Security Council meeting, according to White House spokesman       Sean Spicer.On Thursday, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Sanders       told reporters that Mr. Trump was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself earlier this year but that he didn\u2019t regret keeping him in the role. The two haven\u2019t spoken in the last 24 hours, she said.\u201cClearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.At the news conference, scheduled to announce a major takedown of the largest online marketplace for illicit goods, AlphaBay, Mr. Sessions was asked only about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, fielding no questions about the case. Aides ended the gathering after they solicited, but didn\u2019t receive, any questions on the AlphaBay operation.Mr. Sessions pointed to the AlphaBay case and a health-care fraud takedown announced last week, as well as a gathering with state and local law-enforcement officials on Wednesday, as evidence the agency was continuing to enforce administration priorities in combating transnational crime and spikes in drug use and violent crime.\u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.In the interview with the Times, Mr. Trump said, \u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\u201dSome prominent Republicans had called on Mr. Sessions to recuse himself, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), as well as many Democrats. Legal ethics experts said that because Mr. Sessions had played a key role in the Trump campaign, it could raise questions if he oversaw an investigation that examined, among other things, whether that campaign coordinated with Russia.On Thursday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who had been a vocal proponent of appointing a special counsel, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time right before our eyes,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.In the Times interview, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest; said Mr. Comey had provided congressional testimony \u201cloaded up with lies\u201d; and questioned Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s neutrality since he was from Baltimore, a city Mr. Trump said had \u201cvery few Republicans.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment, and Mr. Comey declined to comment through an associate. At the news conference, Mr. Rosenstein said he was working to \u201cadvance\u201d the administration\u2019s priorities.\u201cI was proud to be here yesterday, I\u2019m proud to be here today, I\u2019ll be proud to be here tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.Mr. Trump aimed much of his frustration in the interview at Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator who endorsed Mr. Trump early in the campaign, when few Republicans were getting behind their eventual nominee. Mr. Trump described the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as \u201cextremely unfair\u2026to the president.\u201dHe also blamed Mr. Sessions for \u201cbad answers\u201d to Congress that set him down a path that led to his recusal. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he hadn\u2019t had \u201ccommunications with the Russians\u201d even though he had met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.,       Sergey Kislyak.\u201cJeff Sessions gave some bad answers\u2026He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The recusal came one day after reports of those discrepancies emerged. Mr. Sessions said at the time that he was recusing himself from all investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign on the recommendation of senior Justice Department officials.\u2014Byron Tau, Michael C.

John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have been benefiting from Sears\u2019s retreat. Lowe\u2019s Cos. tumbled;         Home Depot Inc.       and         Best Buy Co.       fell 4% apiece.Amazon\u2019s rapid growth has displaced traditional stores and left even powerful brands unable to ignore it.         Nike Inc.,       one of the biggest holdouts, recently decided to start selling directly to Amazon.For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could give it a boost in sales, which have declined every year since 2007. \u201cThis will give the Kenmore brand access to a new set of customers who aren\u2019t necessarily shopping at Sears,\u201d said Dev Mukherjee, a former president of Sears home appliances, who now works at a private-equity firm.But also it gives shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears department store. \u201cWe believe most Amazon sales will simply cannibalize Sears stores,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba, since other major retailers don\u2019t currently sell Kenmore.Sears\u2019s long-battered shares jumped 11% to $9.60, while Amazon, based in Seattle, closed at an all-time high of $1,028.70. Amazon\u2019s market value is closing in on $500 billion, Sears\u2019s hovers near $1 billion.Kenmore is Amazon\u2019s first retail offering in major appliances. Previously, most major appliances available on Amazon were via third-party sellers on its marketplace.\u201cAmazon is a continual improvement machine, and Kenmore is a brand with extraordinary heritage and awareness,\u201d something that could transform it into a major winner in an online category currently lacking a dominant player, said Ken Seiff, a venture capitalist at Beanstalk Ventures and a former retail executive. \u201cThere\u2019s no positive outcome\u201d for brick-and-mortar competitors.While major appliances are a fraction of Home Depot and Best Buy\u2019s sales, Amazon is now increasingly targeting their bread-and-butter business of services, says Forrester Research analyst Brendan Witcher. \u201cFor years we believed the defensible margins were those in services, because it\u2019s not easy to do online,\u201d he said. But as Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant Alexa is installed in more devices\u2014including Kenmore\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s changing,A Home Depot spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our competitive positioning from both a brand and service perspective.\u201d Best Buy declined to comment.Amazon, which started selling books online more than two decades ago, is now gaining ground in a number of categories, from office supplies to home goods. After a serious push into apparel a decade ago, it is now one of the biggest clothing retailers, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, second only to         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.More than half of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, versus 28% on search engines and even fewer at other retail sites. The company\u2019s Prime subscription program, which according to UBS has an estimated 63 million North American members, also offers companies broad access to customers.Amazon has bigger ambitions than selling Kenmore products. The company plans to expand its reach in both furniture and appliances, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also building at least four massive warehouses focused on handling bulky items, the people said.Under the Kenmore deal, Amazon will own the inventory but Sears will ship orders from its warehouses, a Sears spokesman said. Innovel Solutions, a unit of Sears, will deliver the goods to customers\u2019 homes and provide installation services, he said. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal.\u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to expand our selection,\u201d said Matt Furlong, general manager of home improvement and appliances at Amazon.The Kenmore name first appeared in 1913 on a sewing machine. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927 and business boomed after World War II. And for years, the only place Americans could buy a Kenmore stove or washing machine was at their local Sears or Kmart.But there are fewer of those sprawling stores these days\u2014nearly 1,000 have closed since 2009\u2014and people aren\u2019t buying as much from them.The brand is now produced by Whirlpool Corp.,         Electrolux               AB and other manufacturers.Sears\u2019s share of major-appliance sales in the U.S. fell to 22% in the 12 months ended March, down from 30% four years earlier, according to TraQline, a market research firm. In addition to Kenmore, Sears sells other brands. The Kenmore brand\u2019s share of the market fell to 10.3% from 16.7% during that same period.Sears CEO       Eddie Lampert,        a hedge-fund manager who took control of Kmart out of bankruptcy and merged it with Sears in 2005, had been looking at strategic options for the company\u2019s top brands for more than a year, as the parent company\u2019s losses have mounted.Earlier this year, he agreed to sell the Craftsman tool brand to         Stanley Black & Decker Inc.       for $900 million, helping to pay down debt and pension costs. Sears is still exploring options for its DieHard brand, Sears Auto Centers and its Home Services unit.\u201cThe launch of Kenmore on         Amazon.com               will NOT significantly boost Sears\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Bill Dreher, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group in a note to clients. \u201cWe suspect this is a move to beautify the Kenmore brand for divestiture and help alleviate some pressure, temporarily, of Sears as a going concern.\u201dMr. Lampert, who owns more than half of Sears\u2019s shares and is a large creditor, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the Amazon deal \u201cis a testament to our commitment to unlocking value from our various assets.\u201dThe CEO has also been cutting spending and selling real estate to help the company fund its operations. He has also been financing the company, including a $200 million short-term credit line that Sears announced Monday.Although that line was marketed to others, only entities affiliated with Mr. Lampert participated in the financing, according to one investor. The Sears spokesman said the company is in ongoing discussions with various parties with respect to the loan facility.\u2014Andrew Scurria and Imani Morse contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Amazon\u2019s Kenmore Deal Jolts Appliance Retailers.'", "keywords": "amazon appliances,sears amazon sales,sears kenmore amazon,Amazon.com,AMZN,Best Buy,BBY,Home Depot,HD,Sears Holdings,SHLD,Lowe's Cos.,LOW,Whirlpool,WHR,General Electric,GE,Matt McGinley,Howard Riefs,Dev Mukherjee,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,real estate,property,machinery,retail,wholesale,household goods,hardware stores,electronics,appliance stores,decorating,diy,specialty stores,mixed retailing,etailing,e-commerce,industrial goods,online service providers,technology", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-to-sell-kenmore-brand-on-amazon-1500556366", "news_time": "2017-07-20 19:35:00"}, {"news_title": "PepsiCo CEO Picks a No. 2, but No \u2018Heir Apparent\u2019", "content": "PepsiCo Inc.\u2019s        PEP 0.15%       longtime leader,       Indra Nooyi,        is promoting one of her lieutenants into the vacant No. 2 position at the company, in a move that shuffles potential successors to her job.Ramon Laguarta,        head of the company\u2019s Europe and sub-Saharan Africa business, will become PepsiCo\u2019s president, a headquarters role covering global operations, corporate strategy, public policy and government affairs. The spot has been unoccupied for nearly three years.Mr. Laguarta\u2019s current duties will be given to       Laxman Narasimhan,        who will continue to oversee the snack-and-beverage giant\u2019s Latin America division. Both appointments will take effect Sept. 1.In an interview, Ms. Nooyi, 61 years old, said she intends to keep running the Purchase, N.Y.-based company \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The two promotions are the latest in a series of moves over the past few years to \u201cstretch\u201d executives and prepare them to be contenders for the top job, she said. The company\u2019s division heads will continue to report to her.The leading internal candidates to succeed Ms. Nooyi include Mr. Laguarta, Mr. Narasimhan and       Hugh Johnston,        PepsiCo\u2019s chief financial officer, who in 2015 was named vice chairman and put in charge of e-commerce and information technology.PepsiCo, which has a market value of about $165 billion, has been using higher prices, smaller packaging and a broader product portfolio to help boost results amid shifting consumer tastes that are pressuring the packaged-food and beverage industries. Despite falling soda demand and other industry challenges, the company\u2019s profit margins are rising and its shares are trading near all-time highs.During Ms. Nooyi\u2019s 11-year tenure, two potential successors have been promoted to the No. 2 role of president only to leave the company later on. The job has been vacant since the 2014 departure of       Zein Abdalla.Ms. Nooyi, who was chief financial officer and president before she was named chief executive in 2006, said Mr. Laguarta shouldn\u2019t be presumed to be her successor.She took over as chairman in 2007 and led the spinoff of             Yum Brands Inc.       as well as acquisitions of Tropicana and Quaker Oats. She has fended off calls to break up the company and has pushed into healthier snacks and beverages.\u201cThere is no heir apparent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the time comes for succession, whenever it is, I think the wonderful thing is our board is going to have so many people to choose from.\u201dMr. Laguarta, 53, a native of Barcelona, joined the company in 1996 and has spent most of his career rising through the ranks of the European operations. He has an M.B.A. from Spain\u2019s ESADE business school. He speaks English, Spanish, French, German, Greek and Catalan and will relocate to the U.S. from Geneva in his new role.Mr. Narasimhan, 50, was previously a senior partner at McKinsey & Co., where he spent 19 years before joining PepsiCo in 2012. He worked as senior vice president and finance chief at PepsiCo Americas Foods before rising to Latin America chief in 2014.Ms. Nooyi said she wanted Mr. Laguarta, whom she called \u201ca great operating executive,\u201d to gain experience at the corporate headquarters, where his mandate will be to increase sales and productivity to fund investments, she said.Meanwhile, she said she wanted to push Mr. Narasimhan to \u201clift and shift ideas\u201d across Europe, Africa and Latin America to accelerate his divisions\u2019 growth. He has \u201cevolved from brilliant strategist to a very good operating executive,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said.As Mr. Laguarta takes on some of Ms. Nooyi\u2019s responsibilities, she said she would turn her focus to PepsiCo\u2019s future. Letting other executives \u201ccome into their own, but being there as a helping hand, is my job at this point,\u201d she said.Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "keywords": "ceo,executives,management,president,sales,PepsiCo,PEP,Indra Nooyi,Ramon Laguarta,corporate changes,plans,strategy,management moves,corporate,industrial news,headquarters relocation,senior level management,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,soft drinks,drinks,consumer goods,non-alcoholic beverages", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pepsico-ceo-picks-a-president-but-no-heir-apparent-1500552001", "news_time": "2017-07-20 08:03:00"}, {"news_title": "Elon Musk Teases a New York-to-D.C. Hyperloop", "content": "Billionaire entrepreneur       Elon Musk,        known for his teasing tweets and ever-expanding list of high-tech ambitions, set observers abuzz again with a vague claim he received \u201cverbal\u201d approval for a high-speed, tunnel-based travel system along one of the busiest corridors in the U.S.In a message Thursday on his official Twitter account, Mr. Musk said he had \u201cJust received verbal govt approval\u201d to build a \u201cHyperloop\u201d along the East Coast that could deliver people from New York to Washington in 29 minutes. Amtrak\u2019s Acela Express travels between New York and Washington in slightly less than three hours.He didn\u2019t immediately say which government agency or official had given approval, or elaborate on issues such as timing or cost, but later added he aimed to build similar systems in suburban Los Angeles and Texas. Infrastructure projects of large sizes often take years\u2014if not decades\u2014to receive government approvals.\u201cStill a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.A representative for Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnel venture, The Boring Company, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for clarification.The Transportation Department referred questions about the hyperloop to the White House, which confirmed conversations with Mr. Musk and other Boring Company executives. But the White House didn\u2019t say whether it had given any kind of approval for the hyperloop.A White House spokesman said in a statement: \u201cWe have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.\u201dA spokesman for New York\u2019s mayor tweeted the announcement was \u201cnews to City Hall.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s tweets raised more questions than they answered.Depending on the route, such a project could require approvals from five or six state governments, said Lynne Kiesling, associate director of Purdue University\u2019s Research Center in Economics. Ms. Kiesling\u2019s research includes the effect of regulatory institutions on technological change.\u201cStringing together five or six such approvals would be a long, costly and fractious process,\u201d she said.Mr. Musk has long talked about the creation of a so-called hyperloop, a system for high-speed transportation in a near-vacuum state that takes place in miles-long tubes. Since Mr. Musk floated the idea in 2013, others have tried to commercialize the concept. Hyperloop One has raised $180 million but has faced delays in rolling out a prototype.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets convey his wide-ranging interests. He is chief executive of electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.,       which last year merged with energy company SolarCity, another business he backed. He also heads rocket-maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp.In April, Mr. Musk announced plans for a new company called Neuralink Corp., where he also is CEO, aiming to merge computers with brains so humans could one day engage in \u201cconsensual telepathy.\u201dIn his series of tweets Thursday, Mr. Musk said the hyperloop system, a network linking New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, would be accessible from city centers, with up to a dozen access points in each city.Mr. Musk responded to few of the questions posed to him on Twitter. \u201cSupport would be much appreciated!\u201d he said in one tweet.He began teasing the idea of a tunnel project on Twitter in December, with a post saying, \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear, however, if the musing was more than just a man bored with Los Angeles traffic.In January he tweeted: \u201cExciting progress on the tunnel front.\u201d \u201cPlan to start digging in a month or so,\u201d he said.He has been testing his tunneling techniques at SpaceX in Hawthorne, Calif.Just days ago, at a gathering of U.S. governors, Mr. Musk answered a question about whether he feels pressure from people\u2019s expectations about his projects, particularly in light of the Tesla\u2019s stock price, which has soared more than 50% this year.\u201cI find it quite tough when there are very high expectations,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI try to actually tamp down those expectations.\u201d\u2014Eliot Brown contributed to this article.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "keywords": "acela,amtrak,elon musk,high-speed rail,hyperloop,tech news,technology news,tesla,transportation news,Boring,Elon Musk,corporate,industrial news,disruptive innovation,political,general news,transport,heavy construction,tunnel construction,construction,real estate,technology", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/musk-teases-a-new-york-to-d-c-hyperloop-in-a-tweet-1500571308", "news_time": "2017-07-20 15:26:00"}]
