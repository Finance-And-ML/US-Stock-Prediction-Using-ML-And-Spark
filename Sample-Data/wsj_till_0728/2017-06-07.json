It is Mr. Comey\u2019s first public appearance since being abruptly fired by President       Donald Trump       on May 9, a move that has prompted impassioned debate on Mr. Trump\u2019s motives and Mr. Comey\u2019s credibility.The hearing started at 10 a.m. In a rare occurrence, major broadcast television networks\u2014NBC, ABC,             CBS                   and Fox\u2014are carrying the hearing live, joining the cable news networks. The Wall Street Journal will also have a live video feed, along with instant analysis and updates. You can also follow us on Twitter at @wsjpolitics for the latest.Here\u2019s what to watch for in the session:Was the president improperly trying to exert control over the FBI?In his prepared testimony released Wednesday, Mr. Comey outlines several instances when he says he worried the president was trying to create a \u201cpatronage relationship\u201d with him and demand personal loyalty from him and the FBI. Senators will try to flesh out those accounts and clarify whether Mr. Trump was acting improperly or within appropriate bounds.Comey tells Trump he\u2019s not under investigationMr. Comey, in the prepared testimony, confirmed public assertions by Mr. Trump that the then FBI director told him on several occasions the president wasn\u2019t under investigation. Senators of both parties will likely focus on the significance of those assurances, seeking to establish whether Mr. Comey was giving Mr. Trump a broad clean bill of health.The Democrats\u2019 strategyDemocratic senators are likely to press hard on comments by Mr. Trump, as recounted by Mr. Comey, that they see as improperly trying to influence the Russia investigation. Beyond the question of whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Democrats will seek to paint a picture of a president whose reaction to the probe has been improper and unethical, whether or not it was actually illegal.The Republicans\u2019 approachRepublicans are likely to emphasize aspects of Mr. Comey\u2019s account that suggest Mr. Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t inappropriate or unlawful. They may also seek to undermine the former director\u2019s credibility, since Mr. Comey has in the past been criticized by members of both parties. GOP senators also could focus on other subjects, such as whether Obama administration officials engaged in political \u201cunmasking\u201d of Trump associates.The Mueller factorSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller won\u2019t be at Thursday\u2019s hearing, but his presence will hover over it. Look for Mr. Comey to tell senators there are some issues he can\u2019t discuss to avoid interfering with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. That is one reason Mr. Comey is unlikely to provide significant new revelations on the FBI\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.Is bipartisanship alive?Sen.       Richard Burr       (R., N.C.), who chairs the committee, and Mark Warner (D., Va.), the vice chair, have generally shown a united front in pursuing their investigation. Will that comity continue, and will senators on both sides take a more or less partisan tone? The committee\u2019s ability to stay relatively unified may go a long way in determining how widely accepted its final conclusions are.Trump\u2019s reactionThe White House says Mr. Trump has a busy day Thursday, which will likely prevent him from giving his full attention to the hearing. But Mr. Trump has shown a reluctance to let high-profile events pass without comment, so his reaction and that of the White House\u2014in official statements or informal tweets\u2014are worth watching.Write to Naftali Bendavid at naftali.bendavid@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'A Viewer\u2019s Guide to Thursday Hearing.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-business-finance-1496894069", "news_time": "2017-06-07 23:54:00", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: Business & Finance", "keywords": "corporate,industrial news,page-one stories,news digests", "content": "American oil exports are emerging as a disruptive new force in global markets, helping to tamp down crude prices.U.S. oil prices fell   to their second-lowest level of 2017 after data showed an increase in stockpiles.Santander acquired Banco Popular for the nominal amount of 1 euro after the ECB determined the Spanish lender was near collapse.Sessions has ordered prosecutors to stop settling corporate-wrongdoing cases by requiring firms to make third-party donations.Russia\u2019s sale of a stake in state-owned oil firm Rosneft to Qatar and Glencore last year included an unusual buyback provision.Uber has fired a top executive who obtained medical records of a woman raped by her Uber driver in India.The shipping industry is showing signs of recovery, according to industry executives and analysts.A housing study said roughly three million potential first-time buyers have been shut out of the market over the past decade.Another wave of advertisers pulled ads from YouTube in the U.K. after they appeared before extremist videos.U.S. stocks rose on a rebound in financial shares.

Late Wednesday, Mr. Gianforte apologized to the reporter as part of an agreement that settles any potential civil claims. He still faces a misdemeanor assault charge.The school\u00a0said late last week that the incident\u00a0was\u00a0\u201cunfortunate and disappointing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that requires us to be more deliberative,\u201d Mr. Stukane said\u00a0Wednesday, before Mr. Gianforte\u2019s apology, adding that the school wants to hear \u201cfrom all quarters.\u201dMr. Gianforte, who received engineering and computer science degrees at the private college, has given roughly $20 million to Stevens for the project since 2012 through his Gianforte Family Foundation. When the latest installment of $10 million was announced in December, the school said it would name the technology innovation facility the Gianforte Academic Center.The Chronicle of Higher Education first reported on the controversy at Stevens.Mr. Gianforte, a technology entrepreneur, has lobbied in Montana against local housing and employment protections for LGBT individuals, and his family foundation has donated to groups that oppose LGBT rights and abortion and to ones that question evolution and climate change, according to Montana reports.\u201cThe gift does not come with any political agenda,\u201d said       Shane Scanlon,        a spokesman for Mr. Gianforte. \u201cGreg agrees with the values of the Stevens community and has always believed that discrimination is wrong.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about damage to the reputation of Stevens,\u201d said       Michael Steinmann,        chairman of the school\u2019s faculty senate. \u201cWe would really urge them to reconsider naming that building after Mr. Gianforte.\u201dHe said the faculty senate hadn\u2019t taken a formal vote on the matter, and would require \u201cfurther deliberations\u201d before doing so, since rejecting such a large gift has its own ramifications.Stevens is in the midst of a $150 million capital campaign, launched a year ago, and has an endowment of close to $180 million.\u201cThe university is looking to strike a balance between serving the core mission of a great, technology-based university\u201d and respecting a donor\u2019s personal beliefs, Mr. Stukane said.Thomas Daly,        president of the Stevens Student Government Association, said that body was initially hesitant to petition for a name change because of the potential fiscal repercussions and the message it sent about free speech.\u201cAlthough I do not agree with Greg Gianforte\u2019s views\u2014in fact, I adamantly oppose them\u2014I stand firm that it is his right to have those views,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cStevens should not reject donations from a donor just because they are conservative.\u201dThe assault charge changed his view.\u00a0\u201cI believe this has become a matter of right and wrong,\u201d Mr. Daly said. \u201cThe school cannot and should not condone assault.\u201dA few young alumni launched a petition two months ago,\u00a0calling on school administrators to explain their reasoning in honoring Mr. Gianforte, \u201ccondemn the discriminatory rhetoric\u201d of the groups to which he has donated, \u201cand reaffirm their commitment, in actions and not just words, to be an inclusive campus regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.\u201dMr. Daly said the Change.org petition, which had about 520 signatures by\u00a0Wednesday, had been \u201cpolarizing\u201d among Stevens students, though he believes sentiment has shifted further against the naming in recent weeks.Mr. Daly said he met with the school\u2019s president and other top administrators in recent days to discuss the matter.Mr. Stukane said the school doesn\u2019t yet have a firm time frame on when it will make further decisions on the naming. \u201cThe decision to name the building wasn\u2019t made lightly, and it won\u2019t necessarily be changed lightly,\u201d he said.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Spat Over Naming Honor Stirs Campus.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-fires-executive-who-shared-rape-victims-medical-records-1496891613", "news_time": "2017-06-07 23:13:00", "news_title": "Uber Fires Executive Who Shared Rape Victim\u2019s Medical Records ", "keywords": "investigations,uber,uber firings,vc people,Uber Technologies,ANI Technologies Pvt.,Covington & Burling,Perkins Coie,Eric Holder,Travis Kalanick,Eric Alexander,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,crime,legal action,sex crimes,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services", "content": "Uber Technologies Inc. has fired a top executive who obtained medical records of a woman raped by her Uber driver in India, and then shared the documents with Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick,        according to a person briefed on the matter.Eric Alexander,        Uber\u2019s president in Asia, sought the medical report in 2014 in pursuit of a theory that local rival Ola pushed the story to damage Uber\u2019s reputation in India, this person said. Uber fired Mr. Alexander on Tuesday after reporters inquired about the matter, this person said.The firing raises questions about the comprehensiveness of two concurrent investigations into workplace misconduct. On Tuesday, Uber said it fired more than 20 employees over the past few months following one of the investigations. Mr. Alexander wasn\u2019t among those employees, the person said.Mr. Alexander didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u00a0A spokesman for San Francisco-based Uber confirmed Mr. Alexander was fired Tuesday but declined to provide details.\u00a0Representatives of Ola, whose parent is ANI Technologies Pvt.

As a result of the allegations, city officials banned Uber and other app-based ride-hailing firms for several months over what it said were inadequate background checks.Mr. Alexander, based in Hong Kong, obtained the medical records soon after the incident\u00a0and showed it to several high-ranking Uber officials, including\u00a0Mr. Kalanick, this person said.The Uber spokesman said Wednesday\u00a0the company worked with law enforcement and provided witnesses to the prosecution for the crime. Mr. Alexander was among those who testified at the trial.The driver was ultimately convicted in late 2015  and sentenced to life in prison for the rape and related charges.

It is likely to include recommendations for new\u00a0employee training and human resources processes.On Tuesday, Uber said Perkins Coie had investigated 215 claims of harassment, bullying, retaliation and other misconduct. From those claims, 20 people were fired, 31 are in training, seven received \u201cfinal warnings,\u201d and 57 are still under review.The circumstances of the firing were reported earlier by news site Recode.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Uber Fires Executive Over Medical Records.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-looks-to-shake-up-bhp-billitons-board-1496890481", "news_time": "2017-06-07 22:54:00", "news_title": "Hedge Fund Looks to Shake Up BHP Billiton\u2019s Board ", "keywords": "activist investors,bhp board,corporate structures,tribeca investment partners targets,BHP Billiton,AU:BHP,BHP.AU,Elliott Management,Tribeca Investment Partners,Brett Paton,Craig Evans,Paul Singer,Andrew Mackenzie,corporate changes,plans,strategy,ownership changes,capacity,facilities,management,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,natural reserves,resources discovery,new companies creation,demergers,metal ore mining,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,alternative investments,basic materials,resources,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,mining,quarrying", "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia\u2014One of the activist investors targeting             BHP Billiton Ltd.        BHP -0.92%       for a sweeping overhaul is sounding out possible candidates for a shake-up of the resources company\u2019s board.Tribeca Investment Partners is holding private talks with a number of people, believing a majority of BHP\u2019s 11-person board oversaw some of the mining and energy company\u2019s missteps in recent years but haven\u2019t been held responsible, said       Craig Evans,        a portfolio manager at the Sydney-based hedge fund.Angling for an overhaul of BHP\u2019s boardroom is timely given the search under way for a successor to       Jac Nasser,        who plans to retire as BHP\u2019s chairman in 2018 after eight years in the role. It also marks the latest move by a shareholder openly pushing for changes.Tribeca last month joined Elliott Management Corp. in criticizing BHP for destroying shareholder value, and called for BHP to sell its U.S. onshore oil and gas assets and use the about $10 billion it should be able to raise to return capital to investors and invest in growth projects.\u201cThe main thing for us is the board is constantly showing it isn\u2019t aligned with shareholder interests (on) returns and it must be addressed,\u201d Mr. Evans said.He said Tribeca has identified several individuals with long-term experience in the industry at the board level and before that as chief executives in the sector. He said the names of the people wouldn\u2019t be disclosed until Tribeca had the opportunity to discuss changes with the company or it had been rebuffed.\u201cWe would like to see more mining and technical skills on the current board,\u201d Tribeca investment analyst       James Eginton       said.BHP declined to comment.In April, after months of talks with BHP\u2019s management and board, New York hedge fund Elliott went public with calls for BHP to spin off its U.S. petroleum assets and restructure its dual listing around a main listing in London. In May, the investment firm managed by       Paul Singer       refined its attack by calling for an independent review of the global oil and oil gas operations and suggesting the company retain a main listing in Australia. An Elliott spokesman declined to comment on BHP\u2019s board or whether it would push for changes among the directors.BHP has rejected Elliott\u2019s attack, arguing that collapsing its dual structure would be too costly and that there was a good fit between its mining and petroleum operations. Elliott has taken its case directly to other shareholders in Australia and around the world, while BHP\u2019s management has held talks with investors in recent weeks following a presentation in Barcelona by CEO       Andrew Mackenzie.       In that presentation, Mr. Mackenzie said a strategy of cutting costs and unlocking latent production capacity would significantly boost BHP\u2019s value.There has long been concern over BHP\u2019s investment in oil and gas, particularly after it invested billions of dollars in U.S. shale assets at the height of the natural-gas boom. At the conference in Spain, Mr. Mackenzie conceded the company had mistimed the acquisitions and said the company had more recently pivoted its focus toward conventional assets.There may be support for broad changes at BHP, according to a survey of sentiment among Australian shareholders. Asked if they agreed with Elliott\u2019s view that major restructuring was warranted to create greater value, almost half of 1,000 people surveyed said yes, a poll by Global Proxy Solicitation and university-based Melbourne Institute said. Still, about 36% agreed Mr. Mackenzie had effectively handled Elliott\u2019s approach and fewer than 18% disagreed.Brett Paton,        chairman of wealth-management firm Escala Partners, which advises some of Australia\u2019s wealthiest families on their investments, recently waded into the debate by urging clients to question BHP\u2019s strategy and the makeup of its board. In a recent letter to clients, Mr. Paton\u2014who was vice chairman at UBS Group AG in Australia for 23 years\u2014said he sought to address the culture at the resources company, and what he called an oversize balance sheet that for decades has led to a company out of touch with its investors.In an interview, Mr. Paton questioned the credentials of BHP board members and appointments who had overseen the destruction of value at companies they had previously led. However, he said he urged clients to push BHP to consider       Ken MacKenzie       as Mr. Nasser\u2019s successor, if it looks within its ranks, given his success in growing packaging company             Amcor Ltd.       through well-timed acquisitions.Mr. MacKenzie, currently a senior adviser at McKinsey & Co. and formerly CEO and managing director for a decade at Amcor, was appointed as a nonexecutive director at BHP last August.Mr. Nasser was a director at BHP for three years before the former             Ford Motor Co.       boss was appointed chairman. His predecessor, Don Argus, was also on BHP\u2019s board for several years before becoming chairman.Write to Robb M.

It is a lode that operator             Rio Tinto        RIO -1.17%       PLC wouldn\u2019t have touched\u2014until now.Not that long ago, an abundance of high-grade copper could be mined out of shallower open pits. But as those deposits are depleted and high-grade copper becomes tougher to find, firms such as Rio have been compelled to mine deeper underground.Advances in mining technology are making that possible\u2014just as developments in oil and gas drilling heralded the fracking revolution. Now, using everything from sensors and data analytics to autonomous vehicles and climate-control systems, Rio aims to pull ore from more than a mile below ground, where temperatures can reach nearly 175 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201cCopper has just become a lot harder to get, and we\u2019re relying on technology to keep dealing with that decline in grade,\u201d said       Craig Stegman,        Rio\u2019s vice president for operational and technical support for copper and diamonds.The company bets the Resolution Copper Mining project, a joint venture in Superior, Ariz., between Rio and             BHP Billiton Ltd.      , could one day supply a quarter of U.S. demand for the metal each year. It plans to spend $6 billion to $8 billion on the mine, which the company hopes to bring into operation in the mid-2020s, when a lengthy approval process is expected to end. That includes completion of an environmental-impact statement, a process managed by the U.S. Forest Service.Get more top news and business insights for C-suite technology executives, at CIO Journal.Rio, which is majority owner and sole operator of Resolution, expects it will be one of its most advanced projects because the company can design the mine with the latest technology in mind, rather than retrofitting it after the mine begins operating.Most of the world\u2019s copper is extracted from open pits at the Earth\u2019s surface, according to the International Copper Study Group. Some mines are deeper than the Resolution mine, but this is Rio\u2019s deepest underground mining project to date. While a deep underground block-cave mine costs much more to develop, Rio says it can match the operating costs per ton of ore of a surface mine, partly because it is so mechanized.\u201cBecause Resolution is so deep and so hot, it\u2019s really going to push the envelope of technology,\u201d said       Mary Poulton,        professor emerita of mining and geological engineering at the University of Arizona.As with the development of new hydraulic-fracturing and horizontal-drilling techniques to extract oil from shale-rock deposits, locating and extracting the copper successfully requires deployment of new technologies such as cheaper, more powerful sensors and breakthroughs in the use of data.\u201cWhoever gets underground and figures out technology for underground is going to be ahead,\u201d said       Theophile Yameogo,        a partner with Ernst & Young LLP\u2019s mining and metals practice.A 15-minute elevator ride 6,943 feet down Resolution\u2019s No. 10 mine shaft leads to a dimly lighted cavern where warm water falls from the rocks like rain. Electrical gear buzzes constantly, and a network of pipes pumps water out of the shaft at the rate of 600 gallons a minute. A ventilation system cools the area to 77 degrees.Over the next few years, Rio plans to deploy tens of thousands of electronic sensors, as well as autonomous vehicles and complex ventilation systems, to help it bring 1.6 billion tons of ore to the surface over the more than 40-year projected life of the mine.Data coming from those sensors will be fed into analytics engines that will help monitor tasks ranging from underground blasts to the movement of autonomous vehicles.To operate the mine, Rio\u2019s systems will juggle terabytes of data from extra-durable sensors and other sources in the mine. When monitoring safety, for example, it has to track rock movements during the mining process, keep vehicles from running into each other and ensure human employees aren\u2019t overheating or inhaling too much dust.Rio hopes analytics will help to break down organizational silos. Rather than one person viewing data about a specific part of the mining process, information from across the mine can be sent to a single place where experts can obtain a more holistic view of operations.\u201cIt is taking a lot of the decision-making out of the hands of the operator and putting it into a group of specialists who can manage the whole system,\u201d Mr. Stegman said. Rio will test some of these systems at other mines before deploying them at Resolution, but the company doesn\u2019t have another project operating at Resolution\u2019s depth and temperature.Rio is working with manufacturers including             Caterpillar Inc.       and Komatsu Mining Corp. to build battery-powered electric loaders and other equipment than can operate in the mine\u2019s underground tunnels.Sensor data will travel wirelessly to a central database on Rio\u2019s network. That data exists in a number of systems, including CaveCAD, Rio\u2019s proprietary underground-mining information-management system. Equipment information is housed in a system underpinned by             SAP SE,       and third-party software tools manage ventilation and water information.\u201cThe challenge is how we integrate all of this data,\u201d Mr. Stegman said.Write to Steven Norton at STEVEN.NORTON@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Rio Digs Deeper for Copper.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shipping-shows-signs-of-recovery-1496844000", "news_time": "2017-06-07 22:00:00", "news_title": "The State of Global Shipping in Three Charts", "keywords": "shipping,shipping industry,shipping rates,Hanjin Shipping,economic news,marine transport,freight transport,logistics,marine freight,water transport,transportation", "content": "The shipping industry, which has ailed for years, is finally showing signs of recovery.The sector has struggled with overcapacity, price wars and freight rates far below break-even levels. Now, thanks to the improving global economy, industry executives and analysts say the worst may be over, at least for container and dry-bulk ship operators. Early hints of a recovery in the oil-tanker business are starting to emerge.\u201cShipping is more than alive and kicking. There is a spring in the air and there is a spring in the world economy,\u201d said Singapore Minister of Transport Khaw       Boon Wan.Container shipping, which moves 95% of all manufactured goods, was rattled last year by the bankruptcy of South Korea\u2019s Hanjin Shipping Co., which stranded billions of dollars worth of cargo at sea. The top 20 operators by capacity posted combined net losses in 2016 of $5 billion. Since then, the big players have merged or formed alliances and most are expected to swing to a profit this year.Among other signs of life: The cost to transport a container in the benchmark Asia-to-Europe route rose to $965 in May, up 55% from a year earlier. At the port of Singapore, which the industry uses to gauge trade flows, container volume rose 5% in the first quarter from a year earlier. And demand for container capacity cut the percentage of idle ships to 3.5% in the first three months of 2017, compared with 6.5% in the previous quarter.Operators of the biggest dry-bulk cargo ships known as capesize vessels have been hit hard over the past few years by anemic demand in China for the coal, iron ore and other commodities those ships transport. Dozens have suspended operations or gone through painful restructurings. The Baltic Dry Index, which tracks the cost of moving such products, fell to a record low of 290 points in February 2016 from its peak of 11793 in May 2008. It now hovers around 850 points.Industry experts expect the market to turn around this year. Demand is forecast to grow about 3%, compared with a 1% growth in capacity. This has been spurred by Chinese iron-ore imports, which rose 11% year-over-year in March to 95.5 million metric tons, the second-largest monthly amount on record. Imports of the thermal coal used in power plants also are up sharply, and so far this year, capesize daily rates have averaged around $11,000, triple the rate in early 2016.Tankers, which move the world\u2019s crude oil, got off to a rough start this year with too many vessels chasing too little cargo, while inland storage facilities were full. In late May daily charter rates for very large crude carriers, known as VLCCs, moving crude from the Middle East stood at an average $17,000, below the break-even rate of about $22,000.Used tankers have been decreasing in value over the past 12 months, with the price of a five-year VLCC falling to $58 million in May from $68 million a year earlier.However, a combination of low tanker prices and old ones being retired to scrapyards has prompted a buying frenzy, with 69 new and used VLCCs bought in the first five months of this year, compared with only eight last year, a sign that prospective owners expect a recovery.Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Shipping Is Bottoming Out.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/publisher-penguin-random-house-gets-into-the-t-shirt-business-1496852106", "news_time": "2017-06-07 21:38:00", "news_title": "Publisher Penguin Random House Gets Into the T-Shirt Business ", "keywords": " acquisition, bertelsmann, book publishing, books, library, literary merchandise, out of print,penguin random house,publishing, random house,retail,Penguin Random House,Bertelsmann ,Bertelsmann,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,printing,book publishing,broadcasting,television broadcasting,media", "content": "The world\u2019s largest consumer book publisher is jumping into the literary knickknacks and T-shirt business.Penguin Random House, majority owned by Bertelsmann SE, said Wednesday that it has acquired the literary merchandise company Out of Print for an undisclosed sum.Out of Print licenses literary-themed works and illustrations from copyright holders to make hundreds of products, such as apparel, accessories, tote bags, mugs and scarfs, which it then sells at about 1,000 retail outlets here and abroad.The company also sells its products online.

Iran and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia are vying for regional influence.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks through its official Amaq news agency, which published a video purportedly filmed inside the parliament complex during the attack, but the extent of its involvement\u2014if any\u2014couldn\u2019t be immediately verified.The attacks on two of Iran\u2019s most secure sites, if confirmed as the work of Islamic State, would serve as the latest evidence of the group\u2019s ability to direct operations against foreign targets despite mounting military pressure on its home bases in Syria and Iraq.As it loses territory, Islamic State has said recently that it was behind an array of attacks around the world, though it is unclear if it orchestrated the violence, inspired supporters from afar or laid claim to unrelated attacks.President       Donald Trump       linked Wednesday\u2019s attacks to Tehran\u2019s support for terrorism. The U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Iran and has designated Tehran a state sponsor of terrorism.\u201cWe grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.\u201dFor its part, Iran pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s recent visit to Saudi Arabia and what it said was Riyadh\u2019s support for terrorism.The two attacks on Wednesday unfolded miles apart. Three attackers approached the parliament complex in the center of Tehran at 10:15 a.m. and pretended to have a meeting with lawmakers, according to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force.The attackers shot and killed the security guard at the entrance door and opened fire on civilians waiting to see their representatives, the Guard said.2 miles2 kmParliamentTehraniranTEHRAN"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-looks-to-modify-protections-for-sage-grouse-1496882660", "news_time": "2017-06-07 20:44:00", "news_title": "Trump Administration Looks to Modify Protections for Sage Grouse ", "keywords": "conservation,environmental,grouse,interior department,political,general news,natural environment,environmental protection,politics,international relations,domestic politics", "content": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he would order a review of a controversial       Obama      -era plan to protect a Western bird species, in the latest move by the Trump administration to modify environmental policies established by the previous president.In a telephone press briefing, Mr. Zinke said an internal team will report back to him\u00a0in 60 days\u00a0on ways the plan to protect the greater sage grouse, whose numbers have dropped precipitously, might include more conservation measures suggested at the state and local level.Whereas the Obama plan adopted in 2015 relied heavily on setting up habitat zones that in many cases excluded drilling and other land uses, Mr. Zinke said other measures could include better control of grouse predators and West Nile virus that infects the birds. The earlier plans\u2014strongly supported by many environmental groups\u2014have been criticized by ranchers and others as locking up too much land.\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful and optimistic, frankly, that the plans will be shaped by what is in the best interest of the states, the federal government and the sage grouse,\u201d Mr. Zinke said.Business groups were hopeful the review would reduce restrictions on the affected lands,\u00a0located in Nevada, Oregon and several other Western states.\u00a0\u201cWe hope Secretary Zinke will give western states a real chance to implement sage grouse protections tailored to actual conditions on the ground in each state, rather than the existing plans that don\u2019t effectively protect sage grouse but do kill jobs,\u201d Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance, said in a statement.But environmental groups blasted Mr. Zinke\u2019s review, saying it threatens to undermine a plan that was formulated after years of consultation with Western states. Some Western governors on both sides of the aisle had asked him not to make major changes to the Obama plan. \u201cSecretary Zinke\u2019s order is so disruptive because it undermines carefully balanced and negotiated plans against the advice of the stakeholders involved,\u201d       Nada Culver,        senior director for agency policy at the Wilderness Society, said in a statement.Mr. Zinke, like others in President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, has been moving quickly to undo regulations created under President Barack Obama. The former Republican congressman from Montana has taken steps to reopen federal lands to drilling in Alaska, for example, and recently toured the Bears Ears National Monument created by Mr. Obama in Utah as part of a review of its status.At stake in the sage-grouse issue is economic use over a large swath of the West\u2019s vast public lands. Environmental groups had pushed for federal officials to list the greater sage-grouse as protected under the Endangered Species Act. Such a move could have had far-reaching economic consequences, since the grouse\u2019s habitat covers 165 million acres in 11 Western states\u2014mostly on federal land. A similar listing of the northern spotted owl in 1990 led to severe cutbacks in logging in the Pacific Northwest.Instead, Mr. Obama\u2019s Interior Department announced two years ago it would rely on a new land-management plan to protect sage-grouse habitat, as part of collaboration with state and local groups that was intended to stave off a more restrictive listing.But that plan also drew fire from ranchers and other land users because it would cordon off tens of millions of acres as sage-grouse habitat.Now, supporters of the Obama plan worry that not keeping it would lead to lawsuits that could result in a court ordering an endangered species listing, after all. \u201cAn ESA listing for sage grouse would adversely affect land users across the West, creating regulatory uncertainty for ranchers, conservationists, sportsmen, and industry,\u201d Democratic senators       Ron Wyden       of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado warned in a May 16 letter to Mr. Zinke.Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/markets-look-to-u-k-election-ecb-for-direction-1496805273", "news_time": "2017-06-07 20:01:00", "news_title": "Financial Shares Drive U.S. Stocks Higher", "keywords": " asian shares, asian stock markets, asian stocks, asia stock markets,europe markets, europe stocks, nikkei 225,stock markets, u.s. futures,MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings,8725.TO,JP:8725,T&D Holdings,8795.TO,Intercontinental Exchange,ICE,Nasdaq,NDAQ,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,corporate,industrial news,economic news,equity markets,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services", "content": "U.S. stocks rose after two straight sessions of declines, as gains in financial shares boosted major indexes.Moves have been relatively muted in recent weeks, with some analysts and investors saying signs of improvement in the global economy and corporate earnings will likely continue to support markets.\u201cAs long as earnings are strong and the economic backdrop good, I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic,\u201d said Susan Bao, portfolio manager at J.P.

Bush       had \u201cimpeccable credentials\u201d to succeed       James Comey,        the director he fired last month.Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal was followed by the appointment of a special counsel to spearhead an investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election, an inquiry Mr. Trump has called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dThe president\u2019s announcement came a day before Mr. Comey\u2019s highly anticipated testimony before a Senate committee. Mr. Comey is scheduled Thursday to describe publicly for the first time his private interactions with the president.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Comey last month\u2014as the Federal Bureau of Investigation probed whether the president\u2019s associates colluded with Moscow\u2014roiled Washington and the FBI. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion, and Russian officials have denied interfering in the U.S. election.The Justice Department\u2019s recent decision to name Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation in a sense removed pressure from Mr. Trump\u2019s search for a new FBI director because the agency\u2019s new leader won\u2019t oversee the Russia inquiry as Mr. Comey had.The FBI handles a wide range of matters from bank fraud to counterterrorism to kidnappings. With 35,000 employees, including 13,000 agents, the bureau has been buffeted in recent months by criticism of the Russia probe and Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of an injury into former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.Mr. Wray\u2019s selection capped a month-long search that began shortly after Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal. Mr. Trump interviewed a number of candidates, including Acting FBI Director       Andrew McCabe       and former Deputy Director John Pistole.His decision to nominate Mr. Wray marked a shift from the president\u2019s earlier consideration of several political figures, including Sen.       John Cornyn       (R., Texas) and former Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat who became unaffiliated with any party.Mr. Wray, who declined to comment when reached on his cellphone Wednesday, fits the traditional mold of FBI directors. He is a well-known lawyer who is respected in the national-security and legal communities.In a statement, he said he looked forward to serving \u201cwith integrity.\u201dA graduate of Yale Law School, Mr. Wray, 50 years old, was a federal prosecutor in Georgia before becoming a close aide to Deputy Attorney General       Larry Thompson,        whom he served in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.He was nominated in 2003 to be the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, a position he held for two years before leaving the department to become a partner at the law firm of King & Spalding. Friends describe Mr. Wray as a dogged prosecutor who doesn\u2019t seek the limelight but isn\u2019t afraid to stand up for what he believes.\u201cHe is a hard worker and he has a strong personality, but he is a quieter type of leader \u201d than Mr. Comey, said Joe Whitley, a former top Justice Department official. \u201cAnd that might not be bad for the FBI at this time. Chris also follows the facts. He will make his own decisions based on the facts.\u201dNorm Eisen, who served as ethics counsel in the Democratic administration of former President       Barack Obama,        tweeted that Mr. Wray was a \u201cgood choice,\u201d writing he was \u201cvery fair\u201d in his work on the Justice Department\u2019s task force investigating Enron Corp. \u201cI endorse,\u201d Mr. Eisen wrote.One of Mr. Wray\u2019s highest-profile clients in private practice has been New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie,        a Republican and a Trump confidante, whom Mr. Wray represented in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closure controversy.The final choice appeared to come down to Mr. Wray and Mr. Pistole, a longtime FBI agent and former deputy director who is now a university president in Indiana, according to administration officials.Mr. Wray has been a longtime Republican donor. Federal Election Commission records show he gave to GOP presidential nominees       John McCain       and       Mitt Romney       in 2008 and 2012, respectively, though not to Mr. Trump in 2016. He has also backed GOP lawmakers, including Sen.       David Perdue       of Georgia and former Rep.       Tom Price       of Georgia, whom Mr. Trump has since tapped as his secretary of health and human services.Officials at the Justice Department and Republican allies on Capitol Hill appeared to have been caught off guard by Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. Sen.       Bob Corker       (R.,Tenn.), who speaks to Mr. Trump often, initially said he had no reaction to Mr. Wray\u2019s selection. \u201cI don\u2019t know him, I have no frame of reference,\u201d he said.Later in the day, Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) called Mr. Wray \u201can exceptional choice.\u201dSen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the panel will begin considering the nomination in a couple of weeks. \u201cChristopher Wray\u2019s legal credentials and law-enforcement background certainly make him a suitable candidate to lead the FBI,\u201d Mr. Grassley said.Democrats were more muted. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged that President Trump has nominated someone with significant federal law-enforcement experience, rather than a career in partisan politics,\u201d Sen.

Mr. Kelly didn\u2019t say where the additional 71 airports are located.Mr. Kelly said he was behind the decision to install the initial ban, and said intelligence reports indicated that those airports were most at risk and airport security personnel didn\u2019t have sufficient ability to guard against explosives in electronic devices.\u201cIt was a very, very real threat, a very sophisticated threat\u2026and not just one\u201d emanating from the Middle East to take out an airplane in flight, Mr. Kelly said.On Wednesday, Mr. Kelly said a complication in a broader ban is a fire risk from lithium batteries that would have to be stored in the cargo holds of aircraft.

Analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were anticipating a 3.5 million barrel decrease in the amount of oil in U.S. storage tanks.The unexpected buildup of supplies shook an already anxious market. Investors, many of whom have been burned by oil\u2019s bumpy ride to recovery, have been watching the U.S. storage figures each week for signs the glut that has weighed on the market for nearly three years is dissipating.U.S. crude futures fell $2.47, or 5.1%, to $45.72 a barrel. It was the biggest single-day decline since March 8. Brent, the global benchmark, fell $2.06, or 4.1%, to $48.06, the lowest level since before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers struck an agreement to cut output in November.Major selloffs have become a regular feature of the oil market in recent months as traders and investors try to gauge whether OPEC\u2019s efforts are working. Prices have been languishing since OPEC and other major producers, including Russia, in late May said they would extend their pact to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels a day for another nine months but didn\u2019t agree to deeper reductions that many market participants were hoping for. Even the eight consecutive weeks of oil being drained from U.S. storage tanks haven\u2019t been enough to convince skeptical investors that OPEC\u2019s efforts would be enough to bring supplies back into balance with demand.The unexpected increase in stockpiles spooked many market participants, raising doubts both about OPEC\u2019s effectiveness and the strength of U.S. demand for oil and fuel.\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to ratchet up fears that 1.8 million barrels over nine months isn\u2019t enough to rebalance markets,\u201d said       Gene McGillian,        research manager at Tradition Energy.Last week\u2019s rise in oil stockpiles was driven by an uptick in imports, a decrease in exports and a pullback by refiners, which churned less oil into fuel during the week.\u201cIt\u2019s a crummy report,\u201d said       John Saucer,        vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group. \u201cIt\u2019s a divergence from what we\u2019ve been seeing, and it causes people to regroup and rethink.\u201dStill, some investors said the rise may prove to be an anomaly.Greg Sharenow,        portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., said the data \u201cdoes not mean we should dismiss\u201d weeks of falling inventories. \u201cWe could well have to overshoot before we find our footing,\u201d he said.Gasoline stockpiles also grew last week, breaking a four-week streak of declines with a 3.3-million-barrel rise. The increase, which comes in the first full week of the summer driving season, is raising fears that demand will be tepid this summer and that U.S. drivers won\u2019t be of much help bringing down bloated stocks of oil and fuel.\u201cThis is a pseudo disaster this early in the refining season,\u201d said       Bob Yawger,        director of the futures division of Mizuho Securities USA.If more gasoline is going into storage rather than into vehicles, refiners are likely to continue throttling back, buying less crude oil to make into fuel. \u201cThe whole thing is a vicious cycle that is not really leaving a lot of room for upside,\u201d Mr. Yawger said.Gasoline futures fell 6.32 cents, or 4.1%, to $1.4913 a gallon, the largest daily percentage decline since September. Diesel futures fell five cents, or 3.4%, to $1.416 a gallon.\u2014Neanda Salvaterra contributed to this article.Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Oil Sinks 5.1% as Stockpiles Rise.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-trump-govern-1496875130", "news_time": "2017-06-07 19:37:00", "news_title": "Can Trump Govern?", "keywords": "george conway,nomination,state department,trump,twitter,white house,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,commentaries,opinions", "content": "The answer to the question\u2014can President       Trump       govern?\u2014is yes, but the window is closing.In recent days, events outside and inside the White House have combined to produce an environment toxic to governing. The Comey circus, the internal tensions created by Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets on the travel ban and Qatar, and Attorney General       Jeff Sessions\u2019s       reported offer to resign: All this turbulence is pounding a ship of state that needs calmer waters if it\u2019s going to get home in one piece.This column raised the question in February of whether the Russia story was becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s Watergate. Forever Trumpers objected to the analogy, arguing correctly that the legal particulars of the two events were not the same. The point, however, was not about the law or facts but about politics, which respects neither. A president\u2019s blood is in the water, and a feeding frenzy is on.The idea that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat       Hillary Clinton       by now looks like a ghost story. On Sunday, Sen.       Mark Warner,        Democratic vice chairman of the intelligence committee, said, \u201cThere is a lot of smoke,\u201d but there is \u201cno smoking gun at this point.\u201dNone of that diminishes the political threat evident in the appearance of former FBI Director       James Comey       before the Senate Intelligence Committee.It is a familiar spectacle, in which a president is subjected to Washington\u2019s version of the ancient trials by ordeal. It did it to       Richard Nixon      \u2014and       Lyndon Johnson,        who descended into political madness from watching the evening news report his troubles on three televisions in the Oval Office.In the Trump trial, James Comey is playing the role of       John Dean,        the earnest lawyer who presented himself to the Watergate Committee as the last honest man in the Nixon White House. The media\u2019s dramaturges love to fashion political saints, thus the elevation of Jim Comey.The dangers to the viability of the Trump presidency\u2019s agenda at this pivotal moment should not be underestimated. Successful governing means putting multiple players in motion toward a common goal\u2014White House staff, Congress and its staffs, and the administration\u2019s political appointees, whose job is to push presidential policy through the bureaucratic swamps. That effort goes forward on the shoulders of a skeleton crew.We are into the sixth month of the Trump presidency, and of 558 key positions requiring Senate confirmation, 427 have no nominee, according to the tabulation by the Partnership for Public Service. The permanent bureaucracy is running much of State, Defense, Justice and Education.At the State Department, virtually every position below Secretary       Rex Tillerson       and his deputy       John Sullivan       has no nominee, including assistant secretaries for every region of the world.For why this matters, look to Asia, where North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat occupies everyone\u2019s waking hours. Mr. Trump has met with Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe,        and Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       all have visited the region to address North Korea.But if you ask Asian governments about the status of the follow-up, they will tell you they don\u2019t know what\u2019s next because the U.S. has no assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs and therefore no daily liaison executing Mr. Trump\u2019s policy goals. Much of the Trump government is close to becalmed.The appointee holdup at State is due, in part, to the Trump White House\u2019s virtual ban on anyone in the foreign-policy community who publicly opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Presumably this is about loyalty. After this week, though, the White House\u2019s fastidiousness may be irrelevant.Three things happened that bear on the administration\u2019s ability to recruit or retain good people: Attorney General Sessions\u2019s reported offer to resign over the president\u2019s unhappiness with his recusal from the Russia investigation; Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet repudiating his Justice Department lawyers\u2019 handling of the travel-ban case; and his tweet taking personal credit for Saudi Arabia breaking relations with Qatar. That required a stabilizing intervention from Secretary Tillerson because the U.S. has 11,000 troops based in Qatar. Welcome to team Trump.One relevant footnote is       George Conway\u2019s       unexpected decision to withdraw last week as Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, followed by his             Twitter                   statement supporting the department\u2019s handling of the travel-ban litigation. Who needs \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d?One simply cannot duck the corollary question to these events: What top lawyer or professional at this juncture will join an administration whose ability to calm the political storms, execute policy or support its own people is in doubt?On Fox News Tuesday evening Sen.       Lindsey Graham       offered the president some wise counsel: \u201cMr. President: Your words matter now, you\u2019re no longer a candidate for office.

While an increasing number of states, like Colorado, have legalized its production and sale, the federal Controlled Substances Act still considers it illegal.Recent comments made by members of the Trump administration, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have stoked concern throughout the nascent industry that federal officials might step up prosecution of marijuana sales.A Colorado couple, Michael and Phillis Windy Hope Reilly, sued marijuana growers in 2015, claiming the business caused the value of their nearby plot of land to decrease. The marijuana operation could lead potential buyers of the couple\u2019s land\u2014105 acres in southern rural Colorado\u2014to worry about increased crime, they argued, and interfered with their ability to enjoy the land because of the business\u2019s noxious smell.The couple used the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which allows civil recourse if criminal enterprises have directly caused harm to a private individual\u2019s business or property.A federal-district court tossed out the Reillys\u2019 RICO claims, saying that the couple didn\u2019t do enough to prove the property lost value or that they had been harmed by the marijuana odor.But in its ruling Wednesday, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, finding the couple offered enough proof at this stage for the case to move forward.The ruling \u201cwill have a lot of people worried thinking about the future,\u201d said       Robert Mikos,        a professor at Vanderbilt Law School who has followed the litigation.Even so, Mr. Mikos said, the standard for filing such civil RICO suits is high, so it is unlikely to open a floodgate of copycat suits by others annoyed by the presence of recreational marijuana.The court noted that its ruling isn\u2019t meant to be sweeping and is very fact-specific to this case.\u201cWe are not suggesting that every private citizen purportedly aggrieved by another person, a group, or an enterprise that is manufacturing, distributing, selling, or using marijuana may pursue a claim under RICO,\u201d the three-judge panel wrote.\u201cWe are very pleased that the court has made clear that selling marijuana in Colorado remains illegal under federal law and those that sell marijuana do so at their peril,\u201d said David Thompson, a partner at Cooper & Kirk PLLC who represents the Reillys.Matthew Buck, an attorney who represents Alternative Holistic Healing and the other defendants in the case, said his clients intend to continue fighting the couple\u2019s \u201cridiculous and baseless\u201d claims. The land in question, he said, is in an agricultural valley where odors are common, be it horse manure or the smell of growing marijuana.\u201cThis isn\u2019t in your neighborhood, it\u2019s not next to a school,\u201d he said.He also said the presence of his clients\u2019 business has only made the Reillys land more valuable, not less.Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-more-chevys-wont-fix-germanys-imbalance-1496878507", "news_time": "2017-06-07 19:35:00", "news_title": "Buying More Chevys Won\u2019t Fix Germany\u2019s Imbalance", "keywords": "current acount balance,germany,trade,trade deficit,trade surplus,trump,Group of Seven,NATO,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions", "content": "President Trump is right: Germany\u2019s trade balance is out of whack, and this ought to be called out. Although it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to condemn bilateral imbalances in specific industries\u2014such as auto manufacturing\u2014the important truth remains that Germany overall has the world\u2019s largest current-account surplus.Unfortunately, a fix will not be found in the sort of bilateral trade negotiations Mr. Trump\u2019s comments seem intended to provoke. The solution is the sort of global cooperation Mr. Trump disdains: multilateral engagement on the macroeconomic drivers of the German surplus by European countries, the Group of Seven, the Group of 20 and\u2014yes\u2014even the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.First, the facts. Last year Germany\u2019s current-account surplus was $300 billion, or 8% of its gross domestic product. This largely reflected its trade surplus, but also some net investment income. Germany\u2019s surplus was 50% higher even than China\u2019s, though the German economy is only one-third as big. It wasn\u2019t always this way. In 2000 Germany ran a slight current-account deficit.The German surplus does not come at American expense in a simplistic, zero-sum sense. The U.S. currently has an unemployment rate of 4.3%. The Federal Reserve appears not to want that figure to go much lower because it views this as close to full employment. So if the U.S. got a boost from increased exports to Germany, the Fed would offset it by raising interest rates faster and lowering domestic demand.Other European countries could make a more legitimate zero-sum complaint about Germany, even if they rarely do these days. Trade partners inside the eurozone do not have access to independent monetary tools, and with a single currency there are no exchange rates to adjust. Countries like France and Spain cannot fully offset Germany\u2019s surplus absent prolonged and painful declines in relative wages and prices.What has created Germany\u2019s surpluses? Not its trade policies. German tariffs average 1%, slightly below the American average of 1.4%. This should not be a surprise, since lower tariffs generally increase the volume of trade but do not systematically affect the trade balance.Germany\u2019s massive and growing surpluses instead are rooted in macroeconomic forces. The current-account balance, as a simple accounting identity, is the gap between what an economy saves and what it invests. Say Germany\u2019s residents save $100 and invest $90 domestically. The difference, $10, is exported as capital. That money is recycled when other nations purchase German exports.The variable that has changed in recent decades is the rate of German savings. It used to be comparable with that of other advanced economies but has taken off, rising from 22% of GDP in 2000 to 28% in 2015. Germans argue, with some merit, that an aging society like theirs should be saving more to prepare for the future. But at the same time, Germany\u2019s investment has fallen further and faster than other advanced economies\u2014dropping from 24% of GDP in 2000 to 19% in 2015.Germany\u2019s capital outflows, then, are less an emblem of strength than an indication of the weakness of domestic investment opportunities (or the inability to capitalize on them). One particularly worrisome consequence\u2014and possibly a cause of tepid investment\u2014is Germany\u2019s slow productivity growth. Americans have been disappointed to see their productivity growing at only 1.5% a year since 2000. But Germans have had it much worse, posting productivity gains of 1% a year over the same period. That puts Germany in the bottom half of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The solution to this problem, contra Mr. Trump, is not for Germans to buy more Chevys and Fords or to sell Americans fewer Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs (many of which, by the way, were made in places like Alabama and South Carolina). Instead it is to increase Germany\u2019s domestic demand. Faster wage growth leading to stronger consumption would help, but the key is stronger public and private investment.In addition to being a welcome source of demand in the short run, investment would help to expand the supply side of the economy as well. The case is clearest in the public sector, where the relative standing of Germany\u2019s infrastructure has fallen over time along with spending on it. Berlin also could do more to catalyze investment in critical sectors like energy and broadband.Global markets act as a brake on countries with growing current-account deficits. But there is no comparable autocorrect for current-account surpluses. This asymmetry calls for multilateral engagement on the true macroeconomic drivers of Germany\u2019s rapidly expanding surplus.Mr. Trump did make one concrete proposal that would materially help: He called on Germany to fulfill its commitment under NATO to spend 2% of its GDP on defense. Assuming Berlin obliged without cutting spending elsewhere, that would at least make a discernible difference.Mr. Furman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 2013-17.Appeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/made-in-californiabut-not-the-usa-1496878533", "news_time": "2017-06-07 19:35:00", "news_title": "Made in California\u2014but Not the USA?", "keywords": "california,flashlight,made in america,made in us,maglite,regulatory state,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions", "content": "I have been a California manufacturer since 1955, when I opened a one-man machine shop in a rented garage. Sixty-two years later, my shop has grown to a million square feet and now employs hundreds of people. It is here that our famous Maglite machined-aluminum flashlights are designed, engineered and manufactured. From our factory in Ontario, Calif., they are exported around the world.Nowhere but in America could somebody who started with as little as I had come as far as I have. The best way I know to show my gratitude is by keeping alive American manufacturing jobs, ones that involve the same tradecrafts on which my own success was based.That is why my flashlights are made here, and why the great preponderance of parts and components are either made in our own factory or procured domestically\u2014when possible, locally. But given the globalization of trade, there are some items that simply are not available, or are otherwise impractical to secure, from any domestic source. Buying a part or component abroad is something Mag Instrument does only as a last resort, and then reluctantly.Given my commitment to keeping manufacturing in America, it seems only fair that I should be able to stamp my flashlights \u201cMade in USA\u201d\u2014especially when I sell them in the very state where they are produced. But thanks to an old and obscure California statute, I am forbidden to use that label.A state law enacted in the early 1960s forbade marking a product \u201cMade in USA\u201d unless every single part was domestically produced. Over the past few years the requirement for domestic content has been lowered from 100% to 95%, but that still is an impractically high bar for most American manufacturers facing the reality of a global parts-and-components market. So my company cannot sell flashlights in California with a \u201cMade in USA\u201d label\u2014even though our only factory and almost all our workers are in California, and despite our strong policy of building products as American as they can be.Fortunately, none of the other 49 states have followed California\u2019s lead. They all use the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s well-considered and comprehensive standard for \u201cMade in USA\u201d labeling. But absent federal intervention, any other state, at any time, could enact its own varying definition, continuing the process, begun by California, of turning interstate commerce into a Tower of Babel.A bill now pending in the U.S. Senate would prevent that scenario. The Reinforcing American-Made Products Act of 2017 would make federal law and regulation, including the FTC standard, exclusive on the topic of \u201cMade in USA\u201d labeling for products sold in interstate or foreign commerce. That would pre-empt California\u2019s maverick labeling statute and prevent other states from passing laws like it, which only hinder American manufacturing.Mr. Maglica is founder and president of Mag Instrument Inc.Appeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatars-reckoning-1496878393", "news_time": "2017-06-07 19:33:00", "news_title": "Qatar\u2019s Reckoning", "keywords": " donald trump, islamism,qatar, saudi arabia, terrorism,editorials", "content": "The rift between Qatar and four of America\u2019s Sunni-Arab allies led by Saudi Arabia broke into the open this week.

For years the Qataris have maintained a two-faced policy toward the West, their Arab neighbors and the various Islamist movements that threaten Middle East stability.Qatar hosts a U.S. military base that is crucial to American operations against jihadists including Islamic State. The base is also a guarantor of the tiny country\u2019s independence, against the Saudis as well as Iran, with which Doha shares a natural-gas field in the Gulf.At the same time the Qataris have supported the Islamist groups that seek to overthrow established regimes. Al Jazeera, the Qataris\u2019 popular television network, provides a platform to       Yusuf al-Qaradawi,        a leading Islamist ideologue who has praised Hitler for carrying out \u201cdivine punishment\u201d against the Jews.Qatar has also funded and provided a refuge to leaders of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, and it financed Islamist militias in Libya after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.

Students and parents are worried and frustrated, and many point the finger at state legislators, who have cut funds to state schools. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign,       Hillary Clinton       blamed \u201cstate disinvestment\u201d in higher education for soaring tuition and declared her support for \u201cfree college.\u201dWhile the \u201cdisinvestment\u201d narrative is simple and appealing, it collapses under scrutiny. If state funding to public colleges falls by $100 per student, it seems logical to conclude that tuition must go up by $100 to compensate. But that isn\u2019t what happens. When the Great Recession began in 2008, funding at public colleges fell, as declining tax revenue forced states to make budget cuts. Tuition went up. In the mid-2000s, when the economy was strong, state funding to public colleges rose. Tuition went up then, too.Tuition goes up no matter what state legislators do. Public colleges, with state boundaries insulating them from competition, and generous federal student aid programs at their disposal, charge as much as they can get away with. Changes in state funding are largely irrelevant.In a new study, I compare tuition and direct state funding changes at four-year public colleges between 2004 and 2015. This covers both a boom in state funding (2004-08) and a bust (2008-12). Sure enough, the relationship is quite weak. Less than 5% of changes in state funding pass through to higher tuition. In other words, if funding falls by $100 per student, tuition will rise by less than $5.Colleges do tend to cut spending when state funding goes down. But the expenditures they cut are usually in areas unrelated to instruction, such as research and administration. When funding goes up, colleges largely plow that money into higher spending rather than return it to students through lower tuition.State lawmakers looking to bring down tuition by restoring public college funding cut during the recession will be in for an unpleasant surprise. At current spending patterns, funding would have to increase $20 for every $1 reduction in tuition. Bringing tuition at four-year public colleges back to 2004 levels would require a nationwide $473 billion investment, a 1,000% increase.Politicians who campaign on \u201creinvesting\u201d in higher education to lower tuition are basically campaigning to waste taxpayer money. Instead of splashing out funds to colleges in the futile hope that tuition will go down, state governments should give that money directly to students as financial aid. Overall tuition may rise a bit, but after subtracting grants students will end up paying less.By contrast, proposals to reverse \u201cstate disinvestment\u201d could waste billions of taxpayer dollars while doing nothing to help students.

After the GOP took the House and tried to cut spending for liberal interest groups, the Obama Justice Department began to force corporate defendants to allocate a chunk of their financial penalties to those same groups.Banks were made to fund left-wing activists such as NeighborWorks\u2014though these groups were neither victims nor parties to lawsuits.

But far from documenting an abuse of power by President       Trump,        his prepared statement reveals Mr. Comey\u2019s misunderstanding of law enforcement in a democracy.Mr. Comey\u2019s seven-page narrative recounts his nine encounters with the President-elect and then President, including an appearance at Trump Tower, a one-on-one White House dinner and phone calls. He describes how he briefed Mr. Trump on the Russia counterintelligence investigation and what he calls multiple attempts to \u201ccreate some sort of patronage relationship.\u201dBut at worst Mr. Comey\u2019s account of Mr. Trump reveals a willful and naive narcissist who believes he can charm or subtly intimidate the FBI director but has no idea how Washington works. This is not new information.When you\u2019re dining alone in the Green Room with an operator like Mr. Comey\u2014calculating, self-protective, one of the more skilled political knife-fighters of modern times\u2014there are better approaches than asserting \u201cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty.\u201d Of course the righteous director was going to \u201cmemorialize\u201d (his word) these conversations as political insurance.Mr. Trump\u2019s ham-handed demand for loyalty doesn\u2019t seem to extend beyond the events of 2016, however. In Mr. Comey\u2019s telling, the President is preoccupied with getting credit for the election results and resentful that the political class is delegitimizing his victory with \u201cthe cloud\u201d of Russian interference when he believes he did nothing wrong.Mr. Comey also confirms that on at least three occasions he told Mr. Trump that he was not a personal target of the Russia probe. But Mr. Comey wouldn\u2019t make a public statement to the same effect, \u201cmost importantly because it would create a duty to correct\u201d if Mr. Trump were implicated. This is odd because the real obligation is to keep quiet until an investigation is complete.More interesting is that Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration at Mr. Comey\u2019s refusal raises the possibility that the source of Mr. Trump\u2019s self-destructive behavior isn\u2019t a coverup or a bid to obstruct the investigation. The source could simply be Mr. Trump\u2019s wounded pride.The most troubling part of Mr. Comey\u2019s statement is his belief in what he calls \u201cthe FBI\u2019s traditionally independent status in the executive branch,\u201d which he invokes more than once. Independent? This is a false and dangerous view of law enforcement in the American system.Mr. Comey is describing an FBI director who essentially answers to no one. But the police powers of the government are awesome and often abused, and the only way to prevent or correct abuses is to report to elected officials who are accountable to voters. A director must resist intervention to obstruct an investigation, but he and the agency must be politically accountable or risk becoming the FBI of       J. Edgar Hoover.Mr. Comey says Mr. Trump strongly suggested in February that he close the       Michael Flynn       file, but after conferring with his \u201cFBI senior leadership\u201d he decided not to relay the conversation to Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       or any other Justice Department superior. If he thought he was being unduly pressured he had a legal obligation to report, and in our view to resign, but he says he didn\u2019t because \u201cwe expected\u201d that Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from Russia involvement.Well, how did he know? Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t recuse himself until two weeks later. Mr. Comey also didn\u2019t tell the acting Deputy AG, who at the time was a U.S. attorney whom Mr. Comey dismisses as someone \u201cwho would also not be long in the role.\u201dThis remarkable presumptuousness is the Comey mindset that was on display last year. He broke Justice Department protocol to absolve       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       mishandling of classified material, without the involvement of Justice prosecutors or even telling then Attorney General       Loretta Lynch.       Mr. Comey\u2019s disregard for the chain of legal command is why Mr. Trump was right to fire him, whatever his reasons.Also on Wednesday two leaders of the intelligence community told the Senate Wednesday that they had not been pressured to cover up anything. \u201cI have never been pressured\u2014I have never felt pressured\u2014to intervene or interfere in any way with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relation to an ongoing investigation,\u201d said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. National Security Agency Director       Mike Rogers       added that he never been asked \u201cto do anything I believe to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Trump announced that he is nominating respected Justice Department veteran Christopher Wray as the next FBI director. Let\u2019s hope       Mr. Wray       has a better understanding of the FBI\u2019s role under the Constitution than Mr. Comey does.Appeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-department-withdraws-obama-era-guidance-on-joint-employment-1496845164", "news_time": "2017-06-07 19:29:00", "news_title": "Labor Department Turns Back Obama-Era Policies", "keywords": " employee guidelines, employers, independent contractors, joint employment,labor department, labor laws, minimum wage,overtime,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch", "content": "The Labor Department began taking steps Wednesday to roll back high-profile Obama administration policies, days ahead of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       planned visit to the department to outline worker-training initiatives.Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       told members of Congress Wednesday the department would begin rewriting overtime regulations within weeks, while also announcing the withdrawal of guidance that broadened the definition of when multiple employers could be responsible for the same worker.Many businesses were eager to see the moves after Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Mr. Acosta, however, also gave the green light for a retirement-savings rule the prior administration had written and goes into partial effect Friday. Many members of the financial-industry and Republicans in Congress had wanted to see that regulation quashed as well.Mr. Trump plans to visit the department on June 14 to announce steps to expand apprenticeship programs and accreditation for vocational programs and community colleges, Reed Cordish, a senior White House adviser said during a panel discussion Wednesday at the Business Roundtable, a corporate trade group.Mr. Cordish said the Trump administration also would propose ways to expand student aid for vocational training and apprenticeship programs.\u201cThis is our best opportunity to address the skills gap that exists in the country and to address the student debt crisis that exists in the country,\u201d Mr. Cordish said. \u201cFour-year college is wonderful, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only option.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal last month would cut federal funding for work-study programs and eliminate funding for certain teacher-training initiatives as part of a 13.5% decrease next year in funding for the Education Department. It would also reduce funding by nearly 40% for job-training programs administered by the Labor Department.Mr. Cordish said the cuts reflected the need to better organize some 31 workforce-training programs across 14 federal agencies.Mr. Acosta defended those cuts to members of Congress at a budget hearing Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus the department on its core mission by making smart investments in programs that work.\u201dDemocrats at the hearing rejected the notion that the Labor Department can improve outcomes with less funding.\u201cYou can only do less with less,\u201d said Rep.       Rosa DeLauro       (D., Conn.). \u201cThis budget cuts taxes for the wealthy while cutting programs that benefit middle-class families.\u201dMr. Acosta said the administration will begin reviewing overtime regulations in coming weeks.Last year, the Labor Department completed a rule that would have made millions more Americans eligible for overtime. The rule sought to raise the threshold salary under which most workers are required to receive time-and-half pay for working extra hours to $47,476 from $23,660. A federal judge blocked the rule from taking effect last year, after states and businesses sued.The Obama-administration rule needs to be reconsidered because the way it was to be implemented would be a \u201cshock to the system,\u201d Mr. Acosta said. Some businesses said the threshold should be raised in smaller, gradual steps.\u200bThe secretary said he favored raising the $23,660 threshold set more than a decade ago, \u201cbecause life does get more expensive.\u201dOn another issue, the Labor Department in a statement Wednesday morning rolled back informal guidance issued in 2015 and 2016 on joint employment and independent contractors. It expanded the department\u2019s scope to consider when two firms are responsible for the same employee.Some businesses, particularly franchised brands and those employing contractors on a large scale, said the guidance had opened them up to the potential for additional liability.Mike Rotondo,        chief executive of restaurant chain Tropical Smoothie Cafe, applauded the moves on overtime and multiple employers. He said in an interview that the Obama administration\u2019s overtime proposal was too aggressive, adding that he hopes for a \u201cmore palatable approach\u201d from Mr. Acosta.Mr. Rotondo said the joint employer guidance had complicated the running of his business. Franchisers, he said, weren\u2019t sure they could provide franchisees with things like training manuals and employee handbooks, since there was a risk that offering too much support to franchises could lead courts to consider the corporate parent as a joint employer in the event of a lawsuit.Some Democrats say rescinding the guidance could put workers at risk. During the Obama administration, the Labor Department pursued cases against employers that improperly classified certain workers as contractors.David Weil,        the former Labor Department official who issued the guidance, said in an interview that classifying the workers as contractors allowed the firms to avoid paying them overtime wages and could make the workers ineligible for worker compensation or unemployment insurance. The guidance sought to clarify that the department was specifically looking for instances in which two firms could be responsible for labor violations or when employees were improperly classified as contractors.Mr. Weil said the announcement rescinding the guidance was largely symbolic. \u201cBut if it means they\u2019re going to pull back on enforcement, there are going to be fewer workers that get protections under the law,\u201d he said.Mr. Acosta declined to comment on the rationale behind rescinding the guidance when asked by reporters after the hearing.\u2014Lauren Weber contributed to this article.Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com and Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-as-a-democracy-promoter-1496877853", "news_time": "2017-06-07 19:24:00", "news_title": "Trump as a Democracy Promoter", "keywords": "democracy,reagan,tru,trump,venezuela,white house,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,commentaries,opinions", "content": "Much has been made of President       Trump\u2019s       supposed lack of interest in human rights and the promotion of American ideals. Stepping back from his rhetoric and looking at his actions suggests an alternative conclusion.If it were an easy task to set up a flourishing democracy, the entire world would be experiencing peace and prosperity. But it has never been simple. Many people around the world understand that liberty, opportunity and fairness flow from democratic institutions. But establishing such systems takes time, and progress is uneven. The growing pains of warring internal factions and harsh retributions meted out by ruthless authoritarians slow the march toward democracy.President Reagan sought to address the issue in a speech before the British Parliament on June 8, 1982. He affirmed it was a mistake to ignore the rise of tyrants: Britain had paid a terrible price in World War II after allowing dictators to underestimate its resolve. He further maintained that democratic nations needed to resist as a matter of self-expression. Reagan said we must think of ourselves as \u201cfree people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so but to help others gain their freedom as well.\u201dThe 40th president proposed countering totalitarianism and its terrible inhumanity by actively promoting freedom and democratic ideals throughout the world. He envisioned the creation of a bipartisan U.S. political foundation that would assist democratic development by openly providing support to those seeking equality and liberty for their countrymen. Building the infrastructure of democracy\u2014free elections, free markets, free speech and rule of law\u2014would empower people to choose their own way to reconcile their own differences through peaceful means. \u201cDemocracy is not a fragile flower,\u201d Reagan observed. \u201cStill, it needs cultivating.\u201dThe National Endowment for Democracy, launched as a result of that speech, remains faithful to its founding mission: to help others achieve a system that protects the inalienable rights of individuals and guarantees the people\u2019s freedom to determine their own destiny. The endowment provides modest grants to democracy activists around the world, but its greater gift is the imprimatur of moral support from the American people. Brave individuals on the front lines of the struggle for democracy in their own countries draw strength from that connection.The efforts of five endowment grantees battling government corruption were applauded during a Capitol Hill ceremony on Wednesday, with remarks delivered by House Speaker       Paul Ryan       and Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi.       Yet some argue that endorsing the spread of the American idea beyond the U.S. no longer aligns with the preferences of American voters. The most cynical voices claim Mr. Trump neither accepts nor comprehends the profound influence of America\u2019s moral authority in the world.That simplistic narrative is wrong. Consider Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson\u2019s       remarks to his department\u2019s employees last month. He adjured them to \u201cremember that guiding all of our foreign-policy actions are our fundamental values,\u201d which include \u201cfreedom, human dignity, the way people are treated.\u201d As Mr. Tillerson explained, the objectives of the administration\u2019s America First approach\u2014encouraging economic prosperity and maintaining military readiness\u2014are crucial if the U.S. is to promote its values abroad.Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions ultimately make the difference. \u201cI see in the president somebody who said a lot of things in the campaign,\u201d former Secretary of State       Condoleezza Rice       noted in a recent Journal interview. \u201cBut when he was sitting in that chair and watched Syrian babies choking on chemical gas said, \u2018I can\u2019t let that stand.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhat Mr. Trump apparently felt at a gut level is entirely in keeping with that uniquely American quality of being unable to ignore injustice\u2014that inability to stand idly by while the rights of others are cruelly violated by despots. Does he appreciate that America\u2019s own hard-fought path to democracy and equal rights means we never retreat from leadership or abstain from righteousness in a world prone to malevolence?One notable event may provide a telling indication. In February, Mr. Trump met in the Oval Office with       Lilian Tintori,        wife of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader       Leopoldo Lopez.       Afterward the president tweeted a thumbs-up photo of himself, together with Vice President       Mike Pence       and Florida Sen.       Marco Rubio,        standing beside Ms. Tintori. \u201cVenezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori (just met w/@marcorubio) out of prison immediately,\u201d read his accompanying message.\u201cHere in Venezuela, jaws dropped,\u201d wrote       Emiliana Duarte,        managing editor of the English-language blog Caracas Chronicles, in the Atlantic. \u201cFor Venezuelans accustomed to living in fear of their dictatorial government, the sight of the president of the United States siding publicly with the most fearless champion of Venezuelan democracy was powerful.\u201dAs someone who has thought deeply about democracy promotion, I take this as evidence that America\u2019s leader\u2014an admirer of Reagan\u2014has the head and the heart to act with fundamental decency. American decency is born of gratitude for what this nation\u2019s founders had the courage and vision to establish. It is what compels Americans to stand for the rights and liberties of those who can\u2019t stand for those rights and liberties themselves. It is what drives the aspiration to share the American values that have made the U.S. not only successful but honorable.Ms. Shelton is chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy.

The former director will testify that the president urged him to close a Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation of former National Security Adviser       Mike Flynn       for his interactions with Russians during and after the campaign.Mr. Comey will also say that he told the president that he wasn\u2019t personally under investigation. The former director refused Mr. Trump\u2019s request that he state so publicly on the chance that he might have to correct the record later, according to the testimony.The president\u2019s allies seized on that section of the prepared testimony. \u201cThe President is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the President was not under investigation in any Russian probe,\u201d Mr. Kasowitz said in a statement. \u201cThe president feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.\u201dThe RNC issued a similar statement, yet neither denied that Mr. Trump had urged an end to the Flynn probe. Mr. Trump has denied that he asked Mr. Comey to end his probe of Mr. Flynn.Some White House advisers have pushed to hire a pair for former campaign aides,       David Bossie       and       Corey Lewandowski,        to focus on the Russia probe. But internal disagreements over where the unit should be housed\u2014inside or outside the White House, and who would be part of it\u2014stalled that effort, according to people familiar with the matter. Consequently, the White House is seeking at least temporary help from the RNC, where White House chief of staff Reince Priebus is a past chairman, the people said.Mr. Trump may also take charge of his own communications, too. While advisers and attorneys have asked the president to tone down his social media, he has continued to make frequent posts on Twitter.\u201cIt\u2019s not\u00a0like someone who has an addiction that they can\u2019t stop,\u201d said one person who has advised Mr. Trump. \u201cHe believes in his heart of hearts that he\u2019s the best communicator and it\u2019s worked out for him in the past.\u201dThe RNC said it has lined up a host of surrogates to appear on national and local television and radio to support the president, and has a database of research on how Democrats have criticized Mr. Comey in the past.The party committee\u2019s war room includes several young political operatives clipping videos from television and alerting the team to breaking news from a windowless room inside the party\u2019s Washington headquarters,\u201cIt\u2019s the RNC\u2019s top priority to support and defend the White House,\u201d       Ryan Mahoney,        RNC\u2019s communications director, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a robust operation to ensure we\u2019re doing that effectively.\u201dThe party\u2019s operation includes a rapid response team that will aim to use Democrats past statements against them, said a person familiar with the planning. Also on duty will be the RNC\u2019s press and digital teams.Meanwhile, a pro-Trump nonprofit group, Great America Alliance, was set to start airing a TV spot on\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that criticizes Mr. Comey as a \u201cshowboat.\u201d The ad, scheduled to run on CNN and Fox, accuses Mr. Comey of putting \u201cpolitics over protecting America\u201d and \u201cconsumed with election meddling\u201d ... \u201cas terror attacks were on the rise.\u201dAri Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for       George W. Bush,        said there should be two goals for crisis control for the nation\u2019s chief executive: don\u2019t make it worse, and refocus the nation on a different topic.\u201cOn point one, the president\u2019s actions have, in many ways, made this worse,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said in an interview. \u201cOn point two, this White House\u2014in fits and starts\u2014is starting to figure out how to create genuine, other news.\u201dMr. Trump is scheduled to give a lunchtime speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d conference\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0in Washington shortly after Mr. Comey\u2019s hearing begins. The social conservatives\u2019 advocacy group has backed the president and thrown its weight behind his legislative agenda, including during the push to get health-care legislation through the House.But, as the Comey testimony looms, some people close to the White House say they have lost control of the message.Aides had hoped the week would be devoted to Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans. Instead, television networks are planning to break into regular programming to air the Comey hearing\u00a0on Thursday, ensuring that the director\u2019s accounts of his dealings with the president dominate the news.One option Mr. Trump might consider is surprising people with tweets that are counterintuitive, breaking with past practice, said Lanny Davis, who helped navigate various controversies as an attorney in       Bill Clinton\u2019s       White House.\u201cI would fool everybody by being gracious,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cI would fool everyone by not being mean spirited or doing any of the things that he does when he\u2019s in that mood on Twitter.\u201dWrite to Michael C.

Mr. Comey released his prepared remarks ahead of the hearing, which answered questions for some observers\u2014but they also raised some more. Here are five key questions:Did the president\u2019s actions amount to obstruction of justice?Mr. Comey said he thought Mr. Trump was trying to create \u201csome sort of patronage relationship\u201d with him, suggesting some discussions made him feel Mr. Trump may have been seeking to exert improper influence. He described their conversation regarding former national security adviser       Michael Flynn       as \u201cvery concerning.\u201d But Mr. Comey didn\u2019t say he believed obstruction of justice occurred.Why did Mr. Comey take notes after his meetings with President Trump, but not President       Barack Obama      ?Mr. Comey made it clear in his testimony that he didn\u2019t have a practice of memorializing his private meetings with Mr. Obama as he did with Mr. Trump. He said he had so few one-on-one meetings with the former president and felt no need to write memos about them.Why did Mr. Comey have so few private meetings with President Obama, and so many with President Trump?In Mr. Comey\u2019s account, he met twice with Mr. Obama one-on-one, including a brief farewell meeting in late 2016. In contrast, he had nine one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump in four months, three in person and six on the phone. Mr. Comey describes Mr. Trump as going out of his way to speak to Mr. Comey without others present, ensuring that people like Attorney General Jeff Sessions leave the room.If Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were objectionable to Mr. Comey, why didn\u2019t he resign?Mr. Comey didn\u2019t address that issue in his testimony, but he did talk about how much he loved his job. He also said he appealed to Mr. Sessions to ensure that Mr. Comey never be left alone with the president, apparently to create a safeguard and ensure that no improper interactions would take place.Why did top Justice Department officials not respond to Mr. Comey\u2019s contacts?Mr. Comey reported that he asked Mr. Sessions to prevent any further direct contact between the president and himself, but \u201che did not reply.\u201d He also said he contacted then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente for guidance after Mr. Trump asked what could be done to lift the \u201ccloud\u201d of the Russia investigation, but that he didn\u2019t hear back from Mr. Boente.Write to Naftali Bendavid at naftali.bendavid@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-nation-built-by-business-1496875226", "news_time": "2017-06-07 18:40:00", "news_title": "A Nation Built by Business", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews", "content": "Throughout the 2016 campaign       Hillary Clinton       never grasped the contradictions in her own behavior.

Just days ago, she explained her Goldman Sachs speeches bluntly\u2014\u201cthey paid me\u201d\u2014and the left convulsed again.By contrast, there is a clarity, awful to many on the left and invigorating to many on the right, about what drives President       Donald Trump\u2019s       economic team of bankers, investors and industrialists vowing tax cuts and turbo-charged growth. These are unembarrassed rich men promising even greater riches. The distribution may not be equal, the conflicts of interest at times may be rife, but that\u2019s capitalism for you, folks.In \u201cThe Land of Enterprise: A Business History of the United States,\u201d Benjamin Waterhouse, a professor at the University of North Carolina, argues that the history of American business is not a sidebar to the work of political, ideological and cultural leaders but instead a \u201ckey aspect of our national story that helps explain how the United States developed into the land it is today.\u201d Mr. Waterhouse offers a twist on Calvin Coolidge\u2019s aphorism that \u201cthe chief business of the American people is business\u201d; he contends, as he puts it, that \u201cthe chief business of American history is business\u201d and that the \u201cstory of the nation is the story of business history.\u201dBy Benjamin C. WaterhouseSimon & Schuster, 280 pages, $28This thesis leads us down a particular route of historical interpretation, from the earliest colonists to the present. The Constitutional Convention was a debate less about the proper devolution of powers, Mr. Waterhouse suggests, than about basic economic questions. Those who had financed the Revolutionary War wanted to compel the states to pay them back. Article One of the Constitution, he writes, established the role of the federal government in creating a \u201cstable, profitable environment for private enterprise.\u201dThe history of slavery can equally be written as economic history. By the eve of the Civil War, the cash value of the four million slaves in the American South was \u201cworth more than the country\u2019s entire productive capacity from manufacturing, trade and railroads combined.\u201d The trauma of shifting from one economic model to another, rather than ideological disagreements between the states, provoked the brutal war.Mr. Waterhouse notes that American presidents between       Abraham Lincoln       and       Theodore Roosevelt,        between 1865 and 1901, have long since faded into the historical background while business titans have stepped forward. Those late 19th-century decades were dominated by men like       John D. Rockefeller,       Andrew Carnegie       and J.P. Morgan. It was the period when American businesses began to achieve the scope and scale possible in a vast and growing domestic market.The aggressive integration of industries and the rough treatment of workers and unions who stood in their way, Mr. Waterhouse suggests, established a pattern that persists. Every time we hear of jobs being outsourced or sacrificed to technology and automation, we are hearing echoes of the Homestead Strike of 1892, when Andrew Carnegie sent in a private security force to battle union steel workers. His plant manager,       Henry Frick,        is known today for the elegant museum in his former home on Fifth Avenue. But in his lifetime he was known as a brutal enforcer of industrial efficiency.What has mellowed over time is the rhetoric at the highest levels. Neither President Trump nor Sens.       Elizabeth Warren       and       Bernie Sanders       has ever come close to       William Jennings Bryan,        who railed against the \u201chard money\u201d policies of East Coast financiers at the 1896 Democratic National Convention. He compared the sufferings of workers to those of Christ when he said: \u201cYou shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!\u201d Taking a swipe at bankers from the comfort of a Senate committee or pinging Canada for softwood dumping would not have cut it with this thunderer.A cool academic navigating stormy waters, Mr. Waterhouse describes the evolution of a more cooperative approach between business and government after the Depression. Gradually, a balance was struck between legislation intended to provoke healthy competition, innovation and growth, and laws to guarantee social goods, such as clean air, water and food. During World War II, private enterprise was essential to producing the materiel necessary to fight. But even that master of military organization,       Dwight Eisenhower,        grew skeptical, as president, of the rising influence of what he called the \u201cmilitary industrial complex.\u201d The student politics of the 1960s, Mr. Waterhouse contends, were driven by the Vietnam War but consumed by fears about the congealing mass of commercial and political power.In the 1980s, members of the environmental movement were attacked by the then-president of the conservative Heritage Foundation as \u201czero-growth zanies\u201d who \u201ccan go out and till their organic gardens and watch the sun come up from the serenity of their redwood hot tubs\u201d but don\u2019t care about the fortunes of \u201cthose among us who are still trying to make it up the economic ladder.\u201d You can hear the same sentiment today up and down the talk-radio dial. Indeed, the tensions between dynamic economic change and resistance to it keep on being refreshed by financial crises, technological advancement and anxiety over what comes next.In a short compass, \u201cThe Land of Enterprise\u201d provides a way to accept many of today\u2019s most vituperative political disagreements not as unprecedented disruptions but part of a long-running internal debate. Whether we consider business \u201cjust business\u201d or the main business of government determines far more issues than we think.Mr. Delves Broughton is the author of \u201cThe Art of the Sale: Learning From the Masters About the Business of Life.\u201dAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'A Nation Built By Business.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-death-by-1-000-tweets-1496875182", "news_time": "2017-06-07 18:39:00", "news_title": "Political Death by 1,000 Tweets", "keywords": "fbi,paris agreement,travel ban,trump,tweet,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,commentaries,opinions", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s       early-Monday-morning quadruple tweet blitz has damaged the legal case for his executive order temporarily halting travel from six Muslim-majority nations. Justice Department lawyers had avoided using the words \u201ctravel ban\u201d in hope of separating       Candidate Trump\u2019s       rhetoric from President Trump\u2019s action.That strategy lies in tatters after Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201cThe lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201dA few minutes later Mr. Trump added: \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted.\u201d What other president does he think withdrew his original ban and substituted the \u201cwatered down\u201d one? In case he has forgotten, both orders bear Mr. Trump\u2019s signature.He also demanded on             Twitter                   that the Justice Department \u201cask for an expedited hearing\u201d of the immigration order and \u201cseek much tougher version.\u201d But those goals conflict, since changing the terms of the order now would simply restart the long march through the courts.The next message, missed by most commentators, was an even more hazardous IET (improvised explosive tweet). \u201cWe are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S.,\u201d the president wrote.But wait! The second executive order says its rationale for suspending visas for 90 days was that conditions in the six nations \u201cpresent heightened threats.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security was given 20 days to \u201cconduct a worldwide review\u201d and determine what \u201cadditional information will be needed\u201d to vet visitors properly. Those countries would then have 50 days to \u201cbegin providing\u201d the requested information. If any refused, no visas would be issued for their citizens to enter the U.S.That 90-day timeline expired on Monday, and Mr. Trump insists that \u201cextreme vetting\u201d is already taking place. So why is his administration still seeking judicial approval to halt visas temporarily for these six countries? If what Mr. Trump tweeted is true, government lawyers and federal judges are wasting their time wrangling over a visa pause that\u2019s no longer needed. The president\u2019s new vetting standards are already in place, according to him.On the other hand, it\u2019s possible someone is confused. On May 8, a federal appeals court asked a Justice Department lawyer if the administration was drafting new vetting standards. He responded: \u201cWe\u2019ve put our pens down.\u201d Mr. Trump seems to think the pens are down because the new vetting standards are written. Meantime, his lawyers say the government hasn\u2019t started working on them.Mr. Trump has figured out how to tweet his way around the mainstream media. Yet by disregarding basic fact checking, he is deepening the already considerable doubts Americans have about his competence and trustworthiness.That was not the president\u2019s only messaging failure over the past week. Last Thursday Mr. Trump wisely withdrew America from the Paris Agreement on climate change. But his announcement was meandering, thin and dour.The president led off by saying the agreement \u201cdisadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\u201d The goal of other countries, he added, was to saddle America with a \u201cvery, very big economic disadvantage.\u201d Why question the motives of international partners? The U.S. needs their cooperation on other issues, such as the fight against Islamic State. Mr. Trump instead should have heralded America\u2019s success in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.Between 2000 and 2014, the U.S. reduced emissions by nearly 6%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. All this while America\u2019s per capita gross domestic product increased by nearly 13%, after adjusting for inflation. The president should have made the case for following the U.S. example\u2014an argument worth presenting far beyond a single weekday afternoon speech.Increasingly it appears Mr. Trump lacks the focus or self-discipline to do the basic work required of a president. His chronic impulsiveness is apparently unstoppable and clearly self-defeating.

It might even limit the ability of big-spending politicians in high-tax states from further soaking their constituents, which the deduction encourages. However, it is far from generally true that taxpayers in states with relatively low state and local taxes are underwriting the tax windfall in states with high state and local taxes. At the extreme, ultra-high-tax New Jersey received 72 cents in federal spending per dollar paid in federal taxes while Alaska, highlighted as a low-tax state, received $2.36.

The only thing that will be reduced if my property taxes are taxed is the value of my house. The real solution is for government to reduce spending and live within its means.Rob KleinDeerfield, Ill.Repealing the state and local tax deduction isn\u2019t only unfair, it\u2019s fundamentally stupid policy. It penalizes the very regions that try to account for social costs and benefits on the state and local level instead of ignoring them or foisting them off on somebody else or expecting the federal government to take care of everything.If there were true states\u2019 rights in this country, California wouldn\u2019t have to shell out for farm subsidies to Iowa, welfare to Kentucky or security expenses for the Trump family chaebol.

Djokovic won just eight points in the third set, which lasted a mere 20 minutes. He hadn\u2019t been thumped 6-0 in a set at a Grand Slam since the U.S. Open in 2005, when he was 18 years old. Djokovic, who recently teamed up with former champion Andre Agassi for advice, admitted his tennis was nothing like it used to be.\u201cI obviously always expect a lot from myself, but it\u2019s a fact that I\u2019m not playing close to my best, and I know that,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cObviously more or less all the parts of my game are kind of going up and down.\u201dSince becoming the most dominant player in the world in 2011, Djokovic has never been easy to beat. The last time he lost in straight sets at a major was in 2013, when Andy Murray defeated him in the Wimbledon final. From 2010 to the 2016 French Open, Djokovic lost just one match before the semifinals. Since last year\u2019s U.S. Open, he\u2019s a mere 5-5 against Top 10 players. Before that, he had been 18-1 last year against such opponents. His ranking will fall out of the top two for first time since 2011.Djokovic had won all five of his matches against Thiem and lost just one set. He crushed Thiem 6-1, 6-0 in Rome last month, a match that seemed likely to give him confidence in the quarterfinals. Instead, Djokovic lost all his hope early in the second set\u2014an unusual and disturbing collapse for a once relentless champion. He said his current downfall became more apparent at last year\u2019s U.S. Open, where he lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka.\u201cAt the U.S. Open, I just was emotionally very flat and found myself in a situation that I hadn\u2019t faced before in the professional tennis career,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s obviously tough to get out of it and figure out the way how to move ahead. At least I\u2019m trying.\u201dThiem\u2019s victory puts him in the French Open semifinals for the second straight year. He lost in straight sets against Djokovic last year. To reach this final, he\u2019ll have to beat someone even more difficult: nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal. Nadal, 31 years old, advanced to the semifinals after his opponent, Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta, withdrew when trailing 6-2, 2-0. Thiem is the only player to beat Nadal on clay this season, though he has not been consistent after strong victories like his beating of Djokovic.\u201cSo far I have always played way worse match the following day if I beat a top guy. So I hope I can improve that,\u201d Thiem said. \u201cI like the conditions. It\u2019s a fast clay court which fits my game very well.\u201dNadal, who also lost to Thiem on clay last year, said he expects a difficult match, but has more confidence than he\u2019s had since he last won the French Open in 2014.\u201cI am in semifinals and with very positive feelings,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cOnly way to try to be in that final is play my best, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for.\u201dAndy Murray, the top seed in the tournament, isn\u2019t playing anything like Nadal. But somehow, he\u2019s still around. The 30-year-old Murray beat Kei Nishikori 2-6, 6-1, 7-6(0), 6-1 to advance to the semifinals. Murray, who lost to Djokovic in last year\u2019s French Open final, said winning is all that matters, despite his struggles.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I played great tennis today,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone can win matches when they are playing well. It\u2019s winning when you\u2019re not playing your best is more impressive. So I\u2019m happy about that.\u201dChances are Murray won\u2019t remain happy for long unless he lifts his level quite a lot. In Friday\u2019s semifinals he\u2019ll face Wawrinka, the 32-year-old from Switzerland who won the title at Roland Garros in 2015.Wawrinka is mysterious. He can lose to almost anyone, and earlier in the clay court season he stumbled. But he won a tournament just before the French Open began and so far has not lost a set. He swept Marin Cilic, seeded No. 7, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 on Wednesday. Wawrinka has played Murray 17 times and lost 10, including last year\u2019s French Open semifinal. This year looks different.\u201cI was confident with what I was doing since the beginning of the tournament,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cI\u2019m playing better than last year.\u201dThe comeback among all French Open comebacks this tournament happened earlier in the day, when Simona Halep, the third seed, defeated hard-hitting Elina Svitolina 3-6, 7-6(6), 6-0. Halep trailed 5-1 in the second set and saved a match point. She said she figured she was doomed\u2014and then started to play loose.\u201cI started to feel more relaxed maybe because I thought it\u2019s finished,\u201d she said. \u201cI change the rhythm.

During the Obama administration, the division wrote rules seeking to address concerns from banking regulators that mutual funds holding less liquid bonds could be susceptible to investor runs, triggering a downward spiral in asset prices.The hire would add another senior SEC official who may need to navigate significant conflicts of interest in the job.Ms. Blass\u2019s       husband,       David Blass,        is the general counsel of the Investment Company Institute, a mutual-fund lobbying and research group that opposed many details of the SEC\u2019s postcrisis rules. In recent months, the group\u2019s leaders have said the SEC should give the industry a respite from new regulations.Mr. Blass plans to leave the ICI this week. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a law firm with many Wall Street clients, said in May that Mr. Blass would join the firm as a partner. His job switch would remove a significant ethical hurdle to       Ms. Blass\u2019s       ability to run the SEC\u2019s investment management division.Ms. Blass would still have to recuse herself from any decisions that specifically affect firms that were counseled by Simpson Thacher, whose clients include             Blackstone Group                   LP,             Legg Mason Inc.,       and             KKR                   & Co.She also would have to step aside for one year from matters that directly affect her own former clients at Ropes & Gray LLP, the law firm where she has worked since September 2016.Her clients there have included Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Nuveen Investments, OppenheimerFunds and Pacific Investment Management Co., according to her biography on the firm\u2019s website.An SEC spokesman declined to comment.SEC Chairman       Jay Clayton       has picked several other directors with career ties to Wall Street, including       William Hinman,        a former Simpson Thacher partner who took over the division that regulates public companies. Mr. Clayton has also decided to hire one of his former law partners,       Steven Peikin,        as co-director of enforcement. Messrs. Clayton and Peikin worked together at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.The appointments underscore the ingrained nature of the revolving door at the SEC, whose chairmen often recruit top directors from Wall Street law firms. SEC officials defend the revolving door, saying it allows the government to hire talented regulators who would otherwise stay in the private sector.Critics say it creates the opportunity for regulators to become overly influenced by businesses they oversee. \u201cOn first blush, this seems like a team that will follow Wall Street\u2019s lead and not stand up for investor interests,\u201d said       Jeff Connaughton,        who was chief of staff to former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D., Del.).Ms. Blass has spent most of her career at the SEC, having worked there for 11 years since she graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1999. In her last role, she oversaw applications for new exchange-traded funds, an offshoot of mutual funds with $3 trillion in assets, according to research provider XTF. As director, she would replace       David Grim,        who is still in the job and hasn\u2019t announced plans to leave his role.Mr. Grim didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Her appointment could signal Mr. Clayton\u2019s interest in loosening the reins on ETF providers, which want to introduce a new type of actively managed ETF that keeps its investments secret.The concept, designed by Precidian Investments, was rejected by the SEC in 2014 when Ms. Blass and others reviewed it. The SEC said at the time that, because Precidian\u2019s new fund wouldn\u2019t disclose its holdings, investors might trade at prices that diverged from the fair value of the fund\u2019s assets. The company has filed a new application with the SEC, dubbed nontransparent active ETFs.\u201cDalia has extensive knowledge about the Division of Investment Management\u2019s work, particularly with respect to exchange-traded funds,\u201d said Norm Champ, a former director of the division who is now a partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. \u201cShe is widely recognized as a true expert in this area.\u201dPrecidian and other asset managers, including             BlackRock Inc.       and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., have continued discussing the concept of the nontransparent ETFs with the SEC. Approval of Precidian\u2019s new request would pave the way for those other fund companies to repackage mutual-fund strategies as lower-cost ETFs.Ms. Blass told The Wall Street Journal in March that regulators should focus on \u201cmore esoteric\u201d ETF proposals such as Precidian\u2019s plan, while finding ways to make the approval process more efficient for ETFs that don\u2019t present new trading or pricing issues. As director, she would have the opportunity to influence the SEC\u2019s decision on nontransparent ETFs, although Mr. Clayton and the agency\u2019s other two commissioners would probably make the ultimate call to approve the new products.\u2014Sarah Krouse contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Jeff Connaughton was chief of staff to former Sen.

The company has 84 employees.The roughly 18,275 square-foot CookFox office has filtered air and water, lighting systems that emphasize daylight, and potted plants at every workstation, as well as an art installation with terrariums that set a placid tone for the lobby. Three apiaries grace its urban garden.The WELL certification is similar to the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s LEED certifications, which primarily target environmentally sound building design and construction.The WELL standard focuses on air, light, nourishment (eliminating junk food), water, fitness, mind and comfort, said Rick Fedrizzi, chairman of the International WELL Building Institute.The urban farm, on one of three outdoor terraces, has vertical aquaponic towers where kale, chard, arugula, cucumbers, and plantings of corn, beans and squash are grown, qualifies for the new standard because it promotes good nutrition among employees, said Rick Cook, a CookFox founder.The company brought in two apiaries that produced about 50 pounds of honey a year from their former office, and have since added a third, he said.\u201cThere are quantifiable results when people connect with nature,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThere are positive medical outcomes and stress reduction.\u201dCookFox makes use of its terraces at the building owned by Empire State Realty Trust, including outdoor spaces for meetings and meals. Employees are encouraged not to wolf down food at their desk, and to be \u201cmindful about the practice of eating,\u201d Mr. Cook said.As for fitness, the firm has a shower, meant to encourage employees to bike, jog or walk to work.The cost of incorporating the green-design elements is difficult to quantify, the firm said, adding that it wouldn\u2019t total more than 5% of the entire construction cost.Write to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-considers-expanding-its-global-military-presence-pentagon-report-says-1496800406", "news_time": "2017-06-07 17:47:00", "news_title": "China\u2019s Military Ambitions Likely Extend Beyond Asia, Pentagon Says", "keywords": "asia,bases,djibouti,infrastructure,military,pentagon,spratlys,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,politics,weapons programs", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014China\u2019s construction of a military base in Djibouti, closely watched by the U.S., may be a precursor to other projects outside of its neighborhood, such as in Pakistan, according to a new Pentagon report on China\u2019s military.The annual report, required by Congress, has focused in past years on China\u2019s military operations in the South China Sea, where it has been building artificial islands and developing other land features in an island chain known as the Spratlys. There, China is more focused on enhancing infrastructure, developing an airfield and other facilities, according to the report.Last year, Beijing began building a military base in the East African nation of Djibouti, which is also host to a U.S. base, Camp Lemonnier.\u201cChina likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has longstanding, friendly relationships,\u201d the report said. The Chinese military\u2019s \u201cevolving focus\u201d, the report said, reflects its \u201cexpanding interest in a wider operational reach,\u201d according to the report.Pakistan was the most likely country where China would establish a base, the report said.Chinese officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Pentagon released the annual report on China\u2019s military power just days after Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       and Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       appeared together in Sydney, where Mr. Tillerson said Beijing hasn\u2019t done enough for stability in the region. The U.S. has increasingly pushed China to lean on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\u201cChina is a significant economic and trading power, and we desire a productive relationship, but we cannot allow China to use its economic power to buy its way out of other problems, whether it is militarizing islands in the South China Sea or its failure to put appropriate failure on North Korea,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said Monday in Sydney.The Pentagon report expressed continued U.S. concern over China\u2019s role in the South China Sea, where smaller neighbors\u2014including the Philippines, a U.S. ally\u2014have competing resource claims.\u201cIn 2016, China focused its main effort on infrastructure construction at its outposts on the Spratly Islands,\u201d the report said. That activity gives China \u201cpersistent civil-military bases to enhance its presence in the South China Sea and improve China\u2019s ability to control the features and nearby maritime space,\u201d according to the report.The report also noted with unease that China\u2019s military has modernized at a fast pace. \u201cChina\u2019s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,\u201d the report said.China has been investing in hardware such as hypersonic missiles, directed energy weapons and space-based weapons systems, according to U.S. officials. That concerns Adm. Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, who testified in April that such developments should be seen as alarming. The U.S. is unable to match the development of China\u2019s hypersonic missiles because such missiles are banned under the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.The treaty was signed in 1987 between the U.S. and Soviet Union, binding no other countries, and prohibits the land-based deployment of missiles of intermediate range.\u201cHypersonics that can match the Chinese weapons would be precluded by the INF,\u201d Adm. Harris told a House panel in April. \u201cSo we\u2019re precluded from developing land-based weapons that can match the Chinese land-based weapons by treaty.\u201dThe report said China, to support its modernization, \u201cuses a variety of methods to acquire foreign military and dual-use technologies, including cybertheft, targeted foreign direct investment and exploitation of the access of private Chinese nationals to such technologies.The U.S. relationship with China has long been complex, but has grown more complicated in recent months with the increased belligerence from North Korea.The country\u2019s missile launches, now somewhat more routine, have added to the region\u2019s strategic complexity. As recently as last year, the U.S. was focused on encouraging China to halt its militarization of the islands in the South China Sea.But Washington now emphasizes its efforts to persuade Beijing to pressure North Korea to stop its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, while also working to counter China\u2019s claims in the Spratlys.The Pentagon conducted its first freedom of navigation operation under the Trump administration in the South China Sea late last month.Write to Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   A Pentagon report on China\u2019s military said China would likely build a base in Pakistan or other countries with which it has a longstanding relationship.

Stoops said his health wasn\u2019t a factor.\u201cI feel the timing is perfect to hand over the reins. The program is in tremendous shape,\u201d the 56-year-old Stoops said in a statement. \u201cThe coaching life is like a relay race, and I\u2019m thankful for my turn and am confident as I pass the baton.\u201dThe move comes as a shock with Stoops still at the top of his game and the Sooners expected to be ranked in the preseason top-10. What makes the decision so seismic is that for most Stoops\u2019s tenure, which began in 1999, only one school has been an annual lock to the in the national title conversation. That team was Oklahoma.During a span when every other powerhouse in the country, even Alabama, experienced down spells and coaching turnover\u2014Stoops was tied for the longest-tenured coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision\u2014the Sooners lorded over a simple pecking order in the Big 12. There was Oklahoma, then everybody else.The results were staggering. He went 190-48, highlighted by an undefeated 2000 season that ended with a national championship in just his second year. A defensive mastermind who had served as a coordinator under Steve Spurrier at Florida, Stoops won that Orange Bowl with one of the most smothering displays in national championship history, a 13-2 win over Florida State. Leading the Sooners to several wins against ranked opponents early in his coaching tenure earned him the nickname \u201cBig Game Bob.\u201dFrom there, Oklahoma went through a stretch of unyielding dominance that entrenched Stoops as one of the best ever. In each of his last 17 seasons, the team ranked in the top-10 nationally at some point. He led them to 10 Big 12 titles, including two in the past two seasons. During his time, the Sooners\u2019 style changed as much as any in the country, evolving from a defensive behemoth to one of the highest-scoring teams in the sport.Stoops arrived to Norman in 1999 without any head coaching experience and to a starved fan base that had gone more than a decade without the consistent success they demanded. In the 10 seasons between the resignation of Barry Switzer, who made the team a mainstay atop the rankings, and Stoops\u2019 hiring, Oklahoma cycled through three coaches. In the five years prior to Stoops, the team didn\u2019t break .500 in a single season.Stoops leaves even as Oklahoma figured to be right in the thick of things once again next season. The Sooners went 11-2 in 2016, finishing No. 5 in the country and with a Sugar Bowl victory over Auburn. The team also returns quarterback Baker Mayfield, a Heisman Trophy finalist from a year ago."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligence-officials-wont-say-if-trump-asked-about-russia-probe-1496853118", "news_time": "2017-06-07 17:43:00", "news_title": "Intelligence Officials Won\u2019t Say If Trump Asked About Russia", "keywords": "political,general news,national,public security", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Four senior U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials rebuffed bipartisan questions about allegations that President Donald Trump tried to influence an investigation of his associates\u2019 contacts with Russia, citing the need to keep presidential conversations private and to avoid public comment about what could be an active probe.Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers both said they had never felt pressured by Mr. Trump. But at the same time, they refused to rebut reports that the president had asked them to intervene to end the investigation.Speaking before the Senate Intelligence Committee, both repeatedly declined otherwise to answer specific questions about their conversations with Mr. Trump.At the same hearing, two top Justice Department officials\u2014acting FBI Director       Andrew McCabe      \u00a0and Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein      \u2014refused to testify about Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, saying that they didn\u2019t want to speak on a matter that could be part of a federal probe.The contentious hearing was scheduled to discuss the renewal of a key part of a foreign surveillance law that is set to expire at year-end, but the session focused largely on the Russia probe. All four officials drew a rebuke from both Republican and Democratic members of the panel, who demanded to know the legal basis for their refusal to answer questions and insisted that they address these issues in a future classified meeting.\u201cAt no time should you be in a position to come to Congress without an answer,\u201d said Sen.       Richard Burr       (R., N.C.), chairman of the committee, at the end of the three-hour hearing.Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Coats to help stop a probe into his former national security adviser,       Mike Flynn,        and has asked Mr. Coats and Adm. Rogers to issue statement exonerating Mr. Trump and his associates from any collusion with Russia, said current and former officials familiar with the matter. The requests by Mr. Trump were first reported by the Washington Post.Senators of both parties pushed repeatedly, and without success, to get all four officials to answer questions, citing their right to conduct oversight over the intelligence community as well as the public\u2019s right to know.\u201cIf what is being said to the media is untrue, then it is unfair to the president of the United States,\u201d Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.) said. \u201cAnd if it is true, then it\u2019s something the American people need to know, and we as an oversight committee need to know, in order to do our job.\u201d\u201cIn the three-plus years that I have been the director of the National Security Agency, to the best of my recollection, I have never been directed to do anything I believe to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate,\u201d Adm. Rogers said in front of the panel. \u201cAnd to the best of my recollection, during that same period of service, I do not recall ever feeling pressured.\u201dMr. Coats said similarly that he hadn\u2019t felt pressured \u201cto intervene or interfere in any way in shaping intelligence in a political way or in relationship to an ongoing investigation.\u201dCapitol Hill Democrats vowed to get answers. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Twitter that whether the two directors felt pressure wasn\u2019t the issue\u2014whether Mr. Trump tried to intervene was.Mr. Comey was dismissed last month as the FBI was investigating associates of Mr. Trump. His dismissal sparked the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the probe and give it independence from the political leadership of the Justice Department.It was Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s first public appearance before Congress after playing a role in Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, though he appeared in closed-door sessions last month.The hearing came a day before Mr. Comey himself was set to appear before the same panel in widely anticipated testimony detailing his conversations with Mr. Trump, frustrating members of Congress of both parties who repeatedly asked why intelligence officials couldn\u2019t answer their questions.Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who often votes with the Democrats, also pressed Mr. Coats and Adm. Rogers on why they were refusing to fully answer questions about what exactly Mr. Trump asked them to do with regard to the Russia probe.When Mr. King asked whether the White House was invoking executive privilege over the conversations they had with the president, the intelligence officials said, no. Mr. King then asked why they were refusing to answer. Adm. Rogers said he felt it was inappropriate.\u201cWhat you feel isn\u2019t relevant, admiral,\u201d Mr. King said. The senator said the witnesses had no legal basis\u2014in the absence of executive privilege being invoked by the White House\u2014to refuse to answer the questions.Mr. Coats said he wasn\u2019t sure he had a legal basis for declining to discuss his conversations with Mr. Trump on the matter. He suggested he might be more forthcoming with committee members in a private setting.In response to a question from Sen. Jack Reed (D., R.I.), the FBI\u2019s Mr. McCabe confirmed that he believes the conversations between Messrs. Trump and Comey regarding the probe into Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign associates are or are likely to become part of a criminal investigation, and therefore he believed it was inappropriate to comment on them.Mr. McCabe confirmed he had conversations with Mr. Mueller, who is overseeing investigations in relation to the matter.There are at least five investigations that directly affect Mr. Trump and his associates. Most are delving into questions about whether there was any coordination with Russia to help him win the 2016 election, while others are investigating controversies that have stemmed from Mr. Trump\u2019s actions in office concerning the Russia probes\u2014including his firing of Mr. Comey.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/christopher-wray-the-low-key-nominee-for-the-fbis-top-post-1496871748", "news_time": "2017-06-07 17:42:00", "news_title": "Christopher Wray, the Low-Key Nominee for the FBI\u2019s Top Post", "keywords": "fbi director,fbi nominee,FBI,Donald Trump,Christopher Wray,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,retail,wholesale,household goods,hardware stores,specialty stores", "content": "FBI Director nominee       Christopher Wray       and former Director James Comey both went to elite law schools, served as federal prosecutors, and worked at top Southern law firms before taking senior posts in the Bush Justice Department. But that might be where their similarities end.While Mr. Comey is known as a gregarious figure\u2014President       Donald Trump       has called him a \u201cshowboat\u201d\u2014Mr. Wray, 50 years old, is known for an under-the-radar approach.In 2003, when Messrs. Comey and Wray, then top Justice Department officials, held a joint press conference to announce a special counsel to investigate the leak of a CIA employee\u2019s identity, Mr. Comey answered all of the 32 questions asked while Mr. Wray stood silently by his side, according to a transcript of the briefing.That tendency to avoid the limelight may have impressed Mr. Trump. The president is now engaged in a back-and-forth with Mr. Comey over whether Mr. Trump improperly sought to influence the FBI, as Mr. Comey suggests in prepared testimony for a much-anticipated Senate hearing Thursday. Mr. Trump has denied this.Mr. Trump said in an early Wednesday tweet he would nominate Mr. Wray to the Federal Bureau of Investigation post, calling him a \u201cman of impeccable credentials.\u201d The choice came one month after Mr. Trump abruptly fired Mr. Comey amid an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any potential ties between Russia with the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign, and Russia has said it didn\u2019t meddle in the U.S. election.Mr. Wray, an Atlanta lawyer, has spent the past decade in private practice, representing high-profile clients including New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       and Credit Suisse AG. But he earned his reputation as a hard worker and straight-shooter early on in his career at the Justice Department. Mr. Wray declined to comment for this article.Hailing from a liberal Manhattan family of lawyers, Mr. Wray went to Andover, Yale College and Yale Law School before moving to Atlanta and becoming a federal prosecutor there. He spent four years at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Northern District of Georgia, prosecuting crimes from church arson to public corruption.His connections to the Atlanta legal world led him to sign a letter supporting former Atlanta U.S. Attorney       Sally Yates       in her nomination for deputy attorney general. That letter, signed in 2015, described Ms. Yates as \u201ca powerful force for justice\u201d with an \u201cextraordinary\u201d record of service. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates in his first weeks on the job after she instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the president\u2019s executive order on travel.Mr. Wray moved to Washington to spend two years in the deputy attorney general\u2019s office in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, where he became closely involved in the Justice Department\u2019s counterterrorism efforts. In 2003, he was tapped to run the department\u2019s criminal division.\u201cThis is a young man who is wise and mature beyond his 36 years,\u201d his then-home state senator, Zell Miller, said in introducing Mr. Wray at his confirmation \u00a0hearing. Mr. Miller was a Democrat, though he later endorsed George W. Bush for re-election.At the time, the criminal division was responsible for both national security and criminal matters, giving Mr. Wray a wide window into both terrorist threats and corporate fraud prosecutions, the twin hallmarks of his tenure there. National security investigations were later split into a separate national security division at the Justice Department.In announcing the special counsel appointment for the CIA leak case in 2003, Mr. Comey, who was then deputy attorney general, said he first considered having Mr. Wray oversee the investigation, but ultimately decided to keep it outside the department\u2019s normal chain of command.\u201cI also have complete confidence in Chris Wray\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial,\u201d Mr. Comey said at the time. \u201cHe is a total pro and one of the people who makes this department great.\u201dThe two appeared at multiple news conferences over the next year, including with then-FBI Director Robert Mueller\u2014now the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election\u2014to provide updates on national security matters and the investigation into Enron Corp., one of the largest accounting fraud scandals to date. Mr. Wray generally stood on stage but said little, leaving the limelight to Mr. Comey and others, according to transcripts of the news conferences.Since leaving government, Mr. Wray has led a high-profile white-collar criminal defense group at the law firm King & Spalding, where he represented Gov. Christie, a top Trump ally, in the George Washington Bridge lane-closure controversy, and Credit Suisse in its $2.6 billion plea deal in 2014 to resolve charges that it helped Americans evade taxes through offshore accounts.He also represented             Johnson & Johnson                   in a $2.2 billion agreement in 2013 to resolve criminal and civil charges that it marketed drugs for uses not approved by regulators.Still, Mr. Wray\u2019s confirmation hearing, which hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled, is likely to focus less on his legal background and more on how he might handle his relationship with Mr. Trump, according to lawmakers.In vivid testimony released Wednesday, Mr. Comey described efforts by Mr. Trump to secure his loyalty. How Mr. Wray would react to such requests is likely to be a central topic during his confirmation.\u201cChris is straight as an arrow,\u201d said Andrew Hruska, one of his colleagues at King & Spalding and the Justice Department, who also went to grade school, college and law school with him. \u201cHe will do everything in an absolutely professional way.\u201dWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Del Quentin Wilber at del.wilber@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-emissions-suit-against-fiat-chrysler-sent-to-california-unit-1496871229", "news_time": "2017-06-07 17:37:00", "news_title": "U.S. Emissions Suit Against Fiat Chrysler Sent to California Court", "keywords": " defeat devices, defeat device software,diesel emissions lawsuits, doj, doj sues fiat chrysler, epa,fiat chrysler, fiat chrysler emissions suit, jeep grand cherokee, justice department, multidistrict litigation, ram,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,FCA.MI,FCAU,U.S. Justice Department,Edward Chen,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,motor vehicles,passenger cars", "content": "The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit accusing             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU -2.01%       NV of using illegal software to cheat on emissions tests with diesel-powered vehicles is headed to a California court to join other widespread litigation against the auto maker, according to an order from a group of federal judges.The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation on Wednesday ordered the Justice Department\u2019s civil suit be transferred to a federal court in San Francisco to join ongoing proceedings stemming from similar allegations against the Italian-U. S. auto maker. The conditional transfer order doesn\u2019t become effective until filed with the clerk\u2019s office in the U.S. district court in San Francisco.The Justice Department in May accused Fiat Chrysler of using defeat-device software that allowed nearly 104,000 2014-2016 model-year Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles and Ram pickup trucks with diesel engines to pass government emissions tests and then pollute far beyond legal limits on the road.Fiat Chrysler declined to comment. The auto maker has denied using defeat devices and expressed disappointment with the Justice Department\u2019s decision to sue. In response to the suit in May, Fiat Chrysler said it planned to \u201cdefend itself vigorously, particularly against any claims that the company engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.\u201d The company has said a software fix would address the government\u2019s concerns.The Justice Department originally sued Fiat Chrysler in a Detroit federal court, much like it did with a civil suit accusing             Volkswagen AG       of diesel-emissions cheating. The suit against Volkswagen was also consolidated with similar litigation in the same San Francisco federal court, eventually leading to an unprecedented settlement with consumers, the U.S. and California that cost the German auto giant billions of dollars.The Justice Department\u2019s suit against Fiat Chrysler will now join so-called multidistrict litigation proceedings before U.S. District Judge       Edward Chen       in San Francisco.

She could limp back into government much diminished. Or the Conservatives could lose enough seats to give other parties the chance to club together and govern instead.The reason for the variation in the polls: Faulty predictions ahead of the previous election in 2015 prodded the polling industry in the U.K. to overhaul the arcane methods they employ to divine public opinion. A similar postmortem happened in the U.S. after nationwide polls pointed to victory for       Hillary Clinton       in 2016\u2019s presidential election.In the U.K., it is these adjustments that are generating the mixed signals clouding the election result, pollsters say.\u201cThis is an experimental election in many ways for pollsters,\u201d said       Jon Cohen,        chief research officer for SurveyMonkey, which conducts online polls in the U.S. and U.K.Mrs. May called a snap election April 18 at a time when opinion polls gave her center-right Conservatives an advantage of around 20 percentage points on average over the main opposition Labour Party, led by veteran left winger       Jeremy Corbyn       .Her lead has narrowed sharply since the race began, with the average Conservative lead shrinking to around 8 points on Tuesday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, an advantage that could lift Mrs. May\u2019s working majority in Parliament to around 30 seats or more, from 17 currently. A lead in excess of 20 points could have added 100 to 150 seats to her tally.Pollsters say the slip reflects a lackluster Conservative campaign and a better-than-expected reception for Labour, which has been more successful than the government at picking up wavering voters.Terror attacks in Manchester and London shocked the country and colored the parties\u2019 campaigns, though they don\u2019t appear to have significantly altered voting intentions.No poll has yet given Labour an outright lead.That polling average conceals a wide variation among different pollsters\u2019 estimates of Mrs. May\u2019s advantage.Even small differences in party vote shares in the U.K. can have hard-to-predict effects when it comes to forming a new Parliament, thanks to an electoral system that tends to reward big parties at the expense of smaller ones and those with concentrated geographical support at the expense of those with more diffuse backing.Driving the discrepancy, pollsters say, are differences in how firms predict voter turnout, a response in part to an earlier error exposed by the 2015 election.Pollsters had been quizzing too many younger political nerds, many of who lean toward Labour, and too few older and less\u2014engaged voters, who tend to favor the Conservatives, said       Patrick Sturgis,        a statistics expert at the University of Southampton who led the industry-sponsored review into the 2015 polling fiasco.The result was that polls in 2015 understated Conservative support. To fix the problem, firms broadly have taken two approaches.Some made an extra effort to make their panels more representative of the wider population, while others have worked harder to weight their findings to reflect voting patterns among different groups of people.Polling firm YouGov has tended to show Labour closing the gap on the Conservatives, with a poll June 2 giving a 3-point lead to the government. Since 2015, it has focused primarily on broadening the sample of voters it questions, said       Anthony Wells,        YouGov director of political and social research. \u201cWe have thrown everything at trying to recruit people who are less interested in politics,\u201d he said.Martin Boon,        director at ICM, has focused more on gauging turnout, and said he believes rival firms\u2019 polls are overstating the likelihood that younger and poorer voters, who lean toward Labour, will turn up to vote. His polls have tended to show a larger Conservative lead, with the latest putting the Conservatives 11 points ahead of Labour.\u201cWe will see on Friday morning if we are right,\u201d Mr. Boon said.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Vote Puts Pollsters to Latest Test.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-election-sows-more-doubt-than-hope-1496870622", "news_time": "2017-06-07 17:23:00", "news_title": "U.K. Election Sows More Doubt Than Hope ", "keywords": " brexit, british economy, u.k. economy,u.k. elections 2017, u.k.-eu relations,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections", "content": "It seems strange to recall now, but when       Theresa May       announced her plan in April for a snap general election in June, the markets reacted with relief. The pound rallied and stocks rose. The expectation was that the British prime minister would secure a landslide victory over Labour, giving her a mandate to face down hard-line Brexiters prepared to risk the U.K. crashing out of the European Union if no deal is reached in the next two years.The market\u2019s optimism was shared in Brussels and other European capitals, where there were concerns that Mrs. May lacked the political capital to make the concessions they believed necessary to reach the \u201cdeep and special partnership\u201d she has said she seeks with the EU.Seven weeks later, it is hard to be so optimistic about Britain\u2019s outlook. Though the polls have tightened dramatically over the course of the campaign, Mrs. May is still widely expected to win with an increased majority and the pound remains above its level when the election was called. But the campaign has altered the political landscape in unexpected ways that could have profound consequences for the economy.The first concerns Brexit itself, billed as the point of the election but barely featured in the campaign. That absence was surprising because the nature of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU is the single most important question determining the British economy\u2019s long-term fortunes.Whoever wins the election will soon face an essential choice. They will have to decide to what extent Britain is willing to continue abiding by EU rules as the price of securing favorable access to EU markets, by far the most important ones for the British economy.The U.K. could minimize the economic disruption of Brexit by striking a trade deal underpinned by a dispute-resolution mechanism that effectively requires it to accept EU rules and judgments, as Norway and Switzerland do. The price, however, would be the U.K. becoming a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker, restricting the scope of any trade deals it might strike other countries.If the U.K. insists instead on absolute legal sovereignty, it can expect significant new barriers\u2014in the form of tariffs and regulations\u2014to trade with the EU, but would also have greater freedom to strike new trade deals with the rest of the world.The optimistic assumption at the start of the campaign was that despite Mrs. May\u2019s insistence that Brexit should mean an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the U.K., she would find a legal formula to allow the U.K. to take the first option, overriding those in her party who want a complete break with the EU. But that assumption looks less safe following a dismal election campaign that even close colleagues acknowledge has left her damaged.Her U-turn on a flagship policy on social care just four days after it appeared in her manifesto has undermined her claims to offer \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership, instead raising doubts about her ability to withstand pressure. Meanwhile, her fondness for secrecy and banal sound bites\u2014hailed just a few weeks ago as brilliant statecraft\u2014now looks like cover for indecisiveness, inflexibility and an inability to answer legitimate questions.Far from enhancing her political capital, the election has raised doubts about whether Mrs. May has the political skills to deliver a deal with the EU. And that, in turn, raises the prospect of not only a hard Brexit, but a chaotic one.The election has also shifted perceptions of what a post-Brexit U.K. will look like. To succeed in a globalized world, an economy needs to make itself as attractive as possible to global capital and talent. This is particularly important for a country that has just opted to undermine its competitiveness by embarking on a path that will inevitably result in new barriers to trade with its closest partners.Yet the election appears set to result instead in a leftward lurch by both main parties that risks making the U.K. less attractive to investment.For her part, Mrs. May has committed to reduce net migration to below 100,000 over the next five years, raising concerns that businesses won\u2019t be able to recruit the workers they need. She is also proposing new red tape on businesses, including new powers for the government to intervene in corporate takeovers, block share buybacks, give workers a bigger role on company boards and cap domestic energy prices.Labour\u2019s manifesto goes much further, with plans to nationalize energy, water, rail and postal services, funded by substantial increases in taxes on corporations and high earners. Worse, neither party \u201chas set out an honest set of choices\u201d over their tax and spending plans, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, raising questions about what will happen if gloomier Brexit forecasts materialize.Optimism about the Britain\u2019s prospects now rests on a bet that Mrs. May will win the election and face down hard-line Brexiters in her party while at the same time yielding to free marketeers opposed to her interventionist policies.The risk is that this election has left the U.K. facing the worst of all worlds: a more hostile trading environment and an economy less equipped to cope with it."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-trump-could-use-more-economists-1496852326", "news_time": "2017-06-07 17:23:00", "news_title": "Why Trump Could Use More Economists ", "keywords": "capital account, cbo, congressional budget office, economics, economists,greg ip, trump,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news", "content": "Economists once aspired to be like dentists: dull technocrats the public trusted.The last decade has been unkind to those hopes. Economists didn\u2019t predict the financial crisis or miserable growth that followed. Britons ignored their entreaties to stay in the European Union. And in Donald Trump, the U.S. has a president who routinely says things economists consider flat out wrong: trade deficits are bad, unemployment statistics can\u2019t be trusted, the U.S. is the world\u2019s highest taxed country.The low point came last week when Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director said the Congressional Budget Office, whose economists provide nonpartisan advice on legislation, had outlived its usefulness. Better,       Mick Mulvaney       said, for opponents of legislation to supply their studies and advocates to supply their own. \u201cAnd if it works, they would get re-elected and if it doesn\u2019t, they don\u2019t.\u201dMr. Mulvaney\u2019s critique would be more convincing if the administration had in fact put forth its own estimates of the economic effects of its proposals. It hasn\u2019t.\u00a0Its failure to account for the trade-offs of tax cuts (bigger deficits) or reduced subsidies for health care (more uninsured) are one reason Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda is moving so slowly.The bigger problem with his criticism is that it miscasts the role of economists. It isn\u2019t to provide pinpoint forecasts. That would be nice but impossible. Forecasts will be wrong more often than right. But they provide a benchmark against which to test proposals based on theory and evidence rather than instinct or unproven ideological priors.\u201cInformed analysis will sometimes be wrong, but I\u2019d rather bet on informed analysis than ignorant guesses,\u201d says Douglas Elmendorf, who ran the CBO from 2009 to 2015 and oversaw its original estimates of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.Economic analysis exposes the trade-offs inherent in all policy choices. Import tariffs protect some workers but hurt consumers; a higher minimum wage helps low-skilled workers who have jobs but makes it harder for others to find jobs; eliminating minimum required benefits for health insurance makes coverage cheaper for some consumers but more expensive for others. Identifying these effects \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean everyone will agree. But at least people can make decisions with their eyes open,\u201d says Mr. Elmendorf.Unbiased analysis doesn\u2019t guarantee good decisions, but it makes really bad ones less likely.No good business leader would undertake a major investment having listened only to internal advocates. For similar reasons Congress decided in the 1970s it was too dependent on the president to evaluate legislation. Wanting an independent arbiter, it created the CBO.Critics often point to times its forecasts went wrong. Yet if this were evidence of systematic bias, the CBO would tend to err in the same direction and more than other analysts, and it doesn\u2019t. When       George W. Bush       cut tax rates in 2003, his administration predicted economic growth would average 3.3% through 2008 while the CBO and the private sector both predicted 3.2%. In fact, it averaged only 2.3%. Its estimates that year of future federal tax revenue were initially high then low, as were the White House\u2019s. While the CBO in 2010 did overestimate how many people would join Obamacare\u2019s health insurance exchanges by 2014, the White House and two prominent private outfits overestimated by even more, according to a 2015 study commissioned by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that promotes health care access.Yuval Levin, a scholar at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, says the CBO overestimated how many people would be motivated by penalties for lacking health insurance to buy it. It also underestimated the benefits of competition. But these misses, he notes, stemmed from its chosen conceptual approach, not political bias.The White House\u2019s usual response to an analysis it doesn\u2019t agree with is to provide its own, prepared by its own economists, typically on the Council of Economic Advisers. As presidential appointees they will naturally gravitate toward evidence favorable to the White House, but professional scruples limit how far that can sway findings.That discipline has been lacking in Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. When Mr. Trump announced last week he was pulling out of the Paris climate accord, he cited not internal research on the economic harms of the deal, but a private study commissioned by two groups critical of greenhouse gas regulation. His budget two weeks ago was noteworthy for both forecasting 3% growth, much faster than what independent analysts think plausible, and the absence of any detailed analysis of how it will be achieved. Administration officials then contradicted each other on whether tax cuts would be financed with other tax increases.This may reflect the absence of economists in its hallways, a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent early disdain for experts in general. That may be changing. The president nominated       Kevin Hassett,        an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, to chair his CEA. The prospect has heartened economists from both parties, some of whom wrote a glowing letter Monday endorsing his nomination.Mr. Hassett told Congress on Tuesday that he would keep the CEA a center of \u201cunbiased, scientific analysis.\u201dHis good reputation is no guarantee Mr. Trump will listen to his findings, any more than he would necessarily heed Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis,        who enjoys similar bipartisan support, on national security. But, says Mr. Elmendorf: \u201cI sleep better knowing James Mattis is defense secretary and I will sleep better if Kevin Hassett is confirmed as CEA chair.\u201dWrite to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimates in 2003 of federal tax revenue through 2008 were initially high, then low, as were the White House\u2019s.

In recent years, that fact has led to exhibitions at       George Washington\u2019s       Mount Vernon and       Thomas Jefferson\u2019s       Monticello. Now Madison\u2019s Montpelier (mont-PEEL-yer) offers an exhibition that begins in the home\u2019s basement and extends into the imagined interiors of these out-buildings: \u201cThe Mere Distinction of Colour.\u201dMadison (1751-1836), who became the nation\u2019s fourth president, was aware that something was awry. In the early 1780s, we learn, Madison believed one of his slaves was \u201cthoroughly tainted\u201d by exposure to free blacks in Philadelphia, but Madison affirmed that he would not punish him for \u201ccoveting that liberty for which we have paid the price of so much blood, and have proclaimed so often to be the right, & worthy the pursuit, of every human being.\u201d That tension would not lessen over time; nor would Madison\u2019s irresolute hope to wash away this \u201coriginal sin.\u201dIn this, Madison was, unfortunately, a man of his time. This 5,300-square-foot exhibition\u2014created under the oversight of Christian Cotz , Montepelier\u2019s director of education, with designs by Proun Design and Northern Light Productions\u2014begins with reminders of slavery\u2019s centrality. In a panel showing American presidents we are asked to push a button to see which presidents owned slaves. Thirteen of the first 18 light up. George Washington, we are told, owned 318 slaves.       Zachary Taylor       was \u201cthe last president to enslave people while in office.\u201d       Ulysses S. Grant,        who freed his only slave in 1859, was the last president to have ever owned any.Such elemental facts are wrenching. But the exhibition goes further. The Montpelier Foundation was created in 2000; working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, it restored the home, eliminating additions made by the duPonts, the last private owners. It also began identifying 300 slaves and locating descendants of five who became the core of a \u201cdescendant community\u201d that later expanded. In 2005, the \u201cGilmore cabin\u201d built by a freed slave across the road was restored, providing a glimpse of slavery\u2019s extended shadow.A $10 million gift from       David M. Rubenstein       led to the current exhibition. By consulting documents and discovering artifacts\u2014a shackle fragment, a shattered wine bottle\u2014Montpelier gives us a sense of enslaved individuals alongside the historical survey. \u201cDear Mistress,\u201d reads an 1843 letter from the enslaved       Sarah Stewart       to Dolley (Madison\u2019s wife and, by then, his widow), \u201cmy foote is No better than ite Was when you Lefte heare there has one Bone came oute of ite as Large as a Small Childes finger.\u201d The effect is powerful throughout despite overly insistent reiterations of political and therapeutic relevance by descendants and scholars.A more serious issue is this. At Mount Vernon and Monticello, extraordinary resources are devoted to illuminating Washington and Jefferson. Here, we are given only a summary sense of Madison and it comes only in varied house tours. An exhibition at the visitor center is devoted solely to       Dolley Madison\u2019s       appearances in popular culture: songs, dolls, ice cream.Moreover, Montpelier was deeded by the duPonts with conditions that verged on frivolous vanity, requesting display of family artifacts; an \u201cart deco\u201d room of equestrian trophies is plopped into the visitor center. Judging from exhibitions, the site\u2019s 125,000 annual visitors might well assume Madison\u2019s distinction was as a slaveholder.The effect is a bit like dismissing the Magna Carta because it catered to distasteful 13th-century English barons. But Madison is, in many ways, the least understood founder. In his work in the Continental Congress and on the Constitution, he served as philosopher, negotiator, deal-maker. After being thoroughly upset by how his ideas were altered, he remained a passionate advocate of the Constitution. He wrote much of it, along with the Bill of Rights. He nudged and argued and lobbied. He gave in, rebelled, waged war, celebrated democracy and abhorred it. He was, in short, this nation\u2019s first brilliant politician.And he is remembered, surely, not because of the slaves he owned but because of the mechanisms he helped establish that ultimately led to their slow and pained liberation. But we, like Madison, are creatures of our time, so that idea might have to wait.\u2014Mr. Rothstein is the Journal\u2019s Critic at Large."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/attacks-pose-challenge-to-iranian-regime-1496869148", "news_time": "2017-06-07 16:59:00", "news_title": "Attacks Pose Challenge to Iranian Regime", "keywords": "iran, iran attacks, isil, isis, islamic state, middle east, saudi arabia, tehran, tehran attacks,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,military action", "content": "Iranians reacted with horror and defiance after Wednesday\u2019s attacks, as the country\u2019s leaders confronted new security and political challenges in the wake of the unprecedented violence.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the twin attacks, which targeted the parliament complex in Tehran and the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s founding figure, killing 13 people and wounding dozens.Supreme Leader Ayatollah       Ali Khamenei       dismissed the attacks as \u201cfireworks,\u201d and said they left Iranians more determined than ever to fight terrorism. \u201cThe terrorists are too small to affect the will of the Iranian people and the authorities,\u201d he said, according to his official website.President       Hassan Rouhani,        a pragmatist who was elected to a second four-year term last month, said Iran was still the safest country in a chaotic region.Yet the attacks, which included shootings and bombings, sent shock waves of worry through Tehran.\u201cEveryone is worried, we don\u2019t know if this means it\u2019s a start of terrorist attacks in Iran,\u201d said Mina, a 52-year-old engineer in Tehran. \u201cWe always thought we were shielded here and safe.\u201dAfter the attacks, security forces were out in force in public squares and metro stations. Tehran residents said military checkpoints were set up across the capital and at entry and exit roads to the city.Iranians said there was a sense of anxiety and rumors swirling about the possibility of more attacks, as people sent each other messages to avoid the subway or high-traffic areas.Iranian forces have long fought Islamic State extremists on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, but the Sunni extremist group hadn\u2019t successfully carried out any operations within predominantly Shiite Iran until Wednesday.The attacks raise questions about Iran\u2019s justification for its military involvement in Syria and Iraq\u2014a presence that has cost billions of dollars to sustain.

The new facility won\u2019t have a hotel or other resort amenities.State lawmakers who support a third casino say they are worried a planned MGM casino in Springfield, Mass. could lead to less money for Connecticut\u2019s coffers.Connecticut\u2019s Office of Fiscal Analysis has said competition from the Massachusetts casino could cost the state $68 million in annual gambling revenue, and the tribes have said MGM\u2019s casino could result in thousands of job losses at Foxwoods Resorts Casino and Mohegan Sun if they can\u2019t build a third facility.\u201cThere are families across the state breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said       Kevin Brown,        chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Council, which operates the Mohegan Sun. The Mohegan Tribe teamed up with the Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribal Nation which runs Foxwoods, to build a new facility about 15 miles from Springfield to compete with the Massachusetts development.The legislation passed Wednesday requires the tribes to pay a 25% tax to the state on their slot machines and table games. The state\u2019s Office of Fiscal Analysis didn\u2019t give an estimate of how much revenue a new casino would provide to the state. The office said it would depend on when the casino is up and running and the specific number and types of games offered.\u201cThis new casino will provide an opportunity for the Connecticut tribes as well as the state to be able to keep some more of the dollars in Connecticut, rather than leaving to go across the border,\u201d said       Alan Meister,        principal economist at Nathan Associates, who monitors the casino industry.The legislation now heads to Democratic Gov.       Dannel Malloy       for approval.\u201cI have been very clear that I will not sign a bill that puts these jobs at risk, and I look forward to reviewing this proposal,\u201d Mr. Malloy said Wednesday.Opponents of expanding Connecticut\u2019s casinos say the state risks placing a bet on industry that has struggled in parts of the northeast.\u201cNobody in the legislature wants to talk about the current state of Atlantic City,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang, who voted against the bill. \u201cAre we chasing after an industry that is an oversaturated marketplace?\u201dMGM in 2015 sued Connecticut in U.S. District Court over a the state law passed that year allowing the two tribes to negotiate with towns about a potential casino. MGM argued Connecticut discriminated against other competitors by not allowing them to seek similar casino licenses. The lawsuit was dismissed last year, but MGM is appealing.MGM supported legislation this year that would have created a competitive process to solicit proposals for a new casino. But that proposal failed.\u201cConnecticut missed an enormous opportunity to put in place an open, transparent, and competitive casino process,\u201d Uri Clinton, senior vice president and legal counsel with MGM. \u201cWe will continue to vigorously advocate in the courts as we seek to protect the constitutional rights of any company hoping to do business in Connecticut.\u201dWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-jbs-says-it-wont-sell-core-assets-1496868191", "news_time": "2017-06-07 16:43:00", "news_title": "Brazil\u2019s JBS Says It Won\u2019t Sell Core Assets ", "keywords": " jbs, jbs asset sale,jbs stake, pilgrim's pride,JBS SA ,JBSS3.BR,J&F Investimentos,Pilgrim's Pride,PPC,JBS USA,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,poultry processing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,consumer goods,food products", "content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014Brazilian meatpacker             JBS SA        JBSAY -1.20%       said Wednesday it won\u2019t sell core assets in the U.S. or elsewhere, including its majority stake in U.S. chicken processor             Pilgrim\u2019s Pride.

The move will likely leave at least 18 Ohio counties with no plans to buy under the health law.The remarks occurred directly ahead of a planned speech on infrastructure, in which Mr. Trump repeated some of his health-care themes.Supporters of the 2010 health law say insurance markets are struggling not because of \u201cObamacare\u201d but because Mr. Trump has sabotaged them by creating a state of uncertainty over their future. \u201cIf President Trump wants to know who created these victims, he should look in the mirror,\u201d said Protect Our Care Campaign Director       Leslie Dach,        a former official in President       Barack Obama\u2019s       administration.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments came on the heels of lawmakers\u2019 return to Washington\u00a0Monday, and a White House visit with GOP congressional leaders\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0in which the president said he was confident Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) could \u201cget a bill across the finish line this summer\u201d that would overturn much of the 2010 health law and enact Republican measures in its place.Mr. McConnell took the first procedural step toward bringing health-care legislation to a vote\u00a0on Wednesday. However, a lunch of Republican senators\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0yielded no immediate consensus on the major sticking point, the future of the Medicaid federal-state health program for the poor that is a particularly divisive issue for Republican-dominated states.Still, some strategists said they remained optimistic as long as GOP senators hadn\u2019t declared an impasse. And lawmakers and lobbyists said they were starting to see signs of consensus among Republicans on other difficult issues, such as whether insurers should be required to sell coverage to everyone at the same price regardless of their medical history.GOP senators said Wednesday they were coalescing around some key components of their health-care plan. Wary of the backlash House Republicans faced over the implications their bill carried for people with pre-existing conditions, Senate Republicans said they plan to require insurers to cover that population.\u201cPeople are demanding that now, even though that\u2019s added a tremendous cost to the bill,\u201d said Senate Finance Committee Chairman       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah). \u201cOn the other hand, who wouldn\u2019t want to do that if they can?\u201dBut GOP senators said they have embraced part of the House bill that would allow states to give insurers flexibility to opt out of covering some specific benefit categories, known as essential health benefits.\u201cThere is support for the House approach on that, which had that flexibility in it\u201d for states, said Sen.       John Thune       of South Dakota, a member of Senate GOP leadership.The party can afford no more than two defections among its 52 senators to pass a health-care bill along party lines. To get a health-care bill without Democrats, Republicans are using a budget process that spares them from having to get 60 votes but that also carries with it particular parliamentary limitations and a deadline to complete the work if the party wants to move on to a tax overhaul.In the bruising battle to pass a GOP health bill in the House, which Mr. Trump referred to\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0as \u201ca very, very long and difficult negotiation,\u201d the president reserved much of his aggressive sales tactics toward the end of the fight to lock in votes.At the same time, he also appeared in battleground states to exhort wavering lawmakers to support the bill, the vice president taped a series of radio interviews in specific local markets with the same purpose, and the administration has also pledged to give its backing to GOP lawmakers who help the bill pass.Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Ohio takes him to the state of GOP Sen.       Rob Portman,        a key figure in the Senate working group on health-care legislation, and one of two men tasked in particular with resolving the Medicaid issue.But the Ohio trip became more relevant after the Anthem news, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal\u00a0Tuesday. The White House has planned for weeks to harness particular states\u2019 insurance-market woes to help lift the GOP\u2019s health-care measure over hurdles in the Senate, arguing that they have no choice but to act.The speech followed a private meeting between the president and \u201cvictims of Obamacare,\u201d small-business owners       Dan Withrow       and       Raya Whalen,        who stood behind him.Mr. Withrow, president of CSS Distribution Group Inc. that sells pallets and other packaging in Louisville, Ky., has long been an advocate for conservative health policy. He testified in Congress in 2012 about objections to the health law\u2019s requirements on employers.In a Wednesday interview, he said he had been in recent contact with a former aide to Mr. McConnell about his health-care concerns that included increased premium costs for people buying coverage on their own.The ex-aide had told him he was exactly the sort of person the White House was interested in hosting at a future event, potentially at the White House, and he jumped at the chance to attend, he said.He learned\u00a0on Monday\u00a0from a White House aide that they wanted him to come to Cincinnati, and he made the 1\u00bd hour drive\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0morning with his wife and four children.Mrs. Whalen, described by the White House as the co-owner of PlayCare, LLC in Troy, Ohio, also cited higher premiums and deductibles combined with problems getting to see the doctors of her choice after core provisions of the 2010 health law kicked in. The White House also said that she had founded the Young Republican Women of Cincinnati.In Texas\u00a0Wednesday, Vice President       Mike Pence       met with       Traci Lewis       of Houston and her children, a family billed as a victim of the health law, and invited them to tour Air Force Two. Ms. Lewis, the vice president\u2019s office said, was a breast cancer survivor who couldn\u2019t find an individual plan that included her physicians at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com, Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Stumps to Kill ACA.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kansas-legislators-repudiate-governor-by-overriding-tax-veto-1496841464", "news_time": "2017-06-07 16:31:00", "news_title": "Kansas Legislators Repudiate Governor, Override Tax Veto", "keywords": "kansas budget,kansas debt,kansas finances,kansas schools,kansas shortfall,kansas taxes,politics,sam brownback,state government ,taxes,Sam Brownback,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,income tax,political,general news,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch", "content": "State legislators in Kansas called a halt to Gov.       Sam Brownback\u2019s       experiment to create a red-state model of tax cuts to spur economic growth.In a vote Tuesday night, legislators overrode his veto of a bill to raise taxes and close a nearly $900 million budget gap over the next two years. Though both chambers are controlled by Republicans, the House voted 88 to 31 and the state Senate voted 27 to 13 in a harsh rebuke for the governor.The bill is expected to raise $1.2 billion over two years and close a projected shortfall of $889 million over the same period. It will also bring in more money for a court-ordered increase in public-school funding.The bill ends an exemption on taxation championed by the governor that affects farmers and small-business owners.They will now pay a rate of up to 5.7%. The bill also reinstates a top tax bracket and lifts the rates on the two lower brackets.In a brief appearance before reporters on Wednesday, Gov. Brownback cited progress in attracting people and businesses from surrounding states during the years of the tax cuts, but blamed global forces for holding back the state\u2019s growth.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad way to go,\u201d he said of the new tax increases. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have long-term negative consequences for the economy and the people of this state.\u201dTuesday night\u2019s vote ends a yearslong tax policy debate that has been closely watched at the national level as a proxy for supply-side Republican economic philosophy. Mr. Brownback and his allies were trying to show that cutting tax rates could spur economic growth and attract investment.But rapid growth never came to Kansas, and the policy of removing the income tax on so-called pass-through businesses\u2014partnerships, limited liability companies and others that pay business taxes on their owners\u2019 individual tax returns\u2014proved to have significant loopholes.Mr. Brownback\u2019s defeat is already echoing in the national tax-policy conversation. President       Donald Trump       and Republicans in Congress are attempting a similar\u2014though not identical\u2014idea. They want to give pass-throughs a lower top tax rate than wages as part of a broader remake of the federal tax system. They have promised to include rules that would prevent business owners from gaming the system, though they haven\u2019t offered details yet.National Democrats pointed to Kansas on Wednesday as a cautionary tale about relying on tax cuts to spur growth.\u201cI\u2019m pretty elated by the Kansas outcome and really relieved the legislature did what they had to do. I\u2019m much less confident that D.C. conservatives will learn from Kansas conservatives,\u201d said       Jared Bernstein,        who was an economic adviser to former Vice President       Joe Biden.       \u201cIf substantive evidence could kill the trickle-down mythology, it would have died a long time ago.\u201dArthur Laffer, a tax-cut advocate and Brownback ally, said the state will be hurt by Tuesday\u2019s vote and that neighboring states such as Missouri will gain an advantage.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a state being taxed into prosperity,\u201d said Mr. Laffer, who added that Mr. Brownback\u2019s original plan was hampered by budget-forecasting errors, the court-ordered school-funding increase and changes made by the legislature that removed revenue-raising provisions. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad story, because I don\u2019t think Kansas is going to come out smelling like a rose with the reversal of all the tax cuts.\u201dMr. Brownback is a former U.S. senator who was elected to lead the state in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.\u201cThe legislators who voted for this obscene tax increase have failed in their obligation to represent their constituents,\u201d said Kansas Secretary of State       Kris Kobach       in a tweet on Wednesday.But some Democrats in the state celebrated the override after years of failing to get enough Republicans to join them to counter the governor. \u201cAll factions of the #ksleg\u2014cons, mods and progs\u2014voted to unwind Sam\u2019s march to zero madness. Your voices were heard tonight, Kansans!\u201d tweeted Democratic Sen.       Tom Holland.In 2013, Mr. Brownback set out to create a lean, business-friendly government in his state that other Republicans could replicate. He instead faced a growing budget deficit, a flat economy and an increasingly fractured party.Still, Mr. Brownback viewed his signature idea\u2014eliminating the 4.6% state individual income tax on pass-through businesses\u2014as a national model.\u201cMy critics, which are many, they only want to look at the budget,\u201d Mr. Brownback said in an interview in December. \u201cThey won\u2019t look with any depth or detail at the impact on small-business growth or private-sector job growth. That\u2019s the target, that\u2019s what we\u2019re after.\u201dThe rates approved Tuesday will still be lower than they were before Mr. Brownback\u2019s tax cuts, said       Joe Henchman,        vice president at the Tax Foundation, a Washington group that favors lower rates and a simpler system.\u201cThere will be people out there who will try to use this as evidence that all tax cuts are terrible and it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Henchman said, pointing to contrary examples of tax rate reductions in Indiana, North Carolina and the District of Columbia. \u201cThere are tradeoffs. And if you just want to cut taxes without any hard decisions on eliminating deductions or credits, you\u2019re likely to get a big deficit.

Horrific, headline-grabbing attacks still have the power to stir sympathizers, they said, and project an image of power to seduce new recruits.\u201cFor supporters, they need the organization itself to demonstrate its power so they are inspired to act themselves,\u201d said a senior U.S. official monitoring Islamic State.It is unclear if the carnage has been orchestrated and directed by Islamic State, if the group\u2019s propaganda has inspired far-flung supporters to action, or if the group is laying claim to mayhem sown by others.The spurt of violence over the past few weeks, however, has coincided with Islamic State losing its grip on its main power centers in Syria and Iraq, and a call for action by the group in late May.\u201cAs the organization is put under more pressure in Raqqa and Mosul, they\u2019ll launch more attacks in the West,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cThe question is: Do they have the ability and the networks available to them?\u201d the senior U.S. official said. The official said that security forces have made progress unraveling terror networks in Europe.Western officials have long warned that Islamic State would increase attacks abroad to offset the damage inflicted to its image as it loses territory. The European Union police agency said last year that as Islamic State is weakened in Syria and Iraq, foreign fighters might try to enter the EU at a higher rate, and increasingly strike soft targets such as cafes, echoing past statements by European officials.Wednesday\u2019s attack in Iran came a day after U.S.-backed forces began an assault to retake Raqqa\u2014the de facto capital of a self-proclaimed caliphate that spanned Syria and Iraq and was once the size of Belgium.The Pentagon estimates there are fewer than 1,000 Islamic State militants still in Raqqa, which was once the group\u2019s main population center and inhabited by Syrian, Iraqi and foreign fighters. At its peak, ISIS commanded some 25,000 fighters in both countries.The iron grip with which Islamic State once ruled the city and its residents has loosened as the group\u2019s fighters struggle to hold on to territory. Current and former Raqqa residents have described a leadership in chaos, meting out fewer brutal punishments as residents break more of the group\u2019s strict rules.A U.S.-backed Iraqi offensive, meanwhile, has been painstakingly routing the militants from Mosul over the past eight months. The militants are now cornered in a narrow strip of the city.Islamic State has responded to offensives by calling for attacks wherever and however possible, no matter how rudimentary. Former spokesman Abu Mohammed Al Adnani, before his death in a U.S. airstrike in August, was known to encourage followers to strike in the West with methods including running people over or hitting them with a rock.In London on Saturday, the attackers used a vehicle to mow down victims\u2014a tactic also used in London in March, in Berlin in December and in the French city of Nice in July 2016. Vehicular attacks allow plotters to move under the radar of security forces. Bombings require more planning but often inflict higher casualties.At the start of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan in late May, Islamic State called on supporters to launch more attacks. Members and sympathizers posted messages on social media vowing a month of jihad.Since then, the group has claimed responsibility for attacks by gunmen on a bus carrying Egyptian Christians, a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande pop concert in Manchester and a deadly fire started by a gunman at a Manila casino that Philippine police said was a botched robbery attempt.Islamic State has also deployed explosive devices, such as the one that ripped through Brussels Airport last year.But senior American officials say that so far, Islamic State seems unable to build the kind of complicated explosives that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is known to produce.Also known by its acronym AQAP, the al Qaeda branch based in Yemen has become the parent group\u2019s nerve center for global plots. Those include the so-called underwear bomber who tried to take down a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas 2009.\u201cSo far, another Islamic State group hasn\u2019t emerged that is as competent\u201d as AQAP, the senior American official said. \u201cThe technology issue is going to be a challenge, but give it time and it could develop.\u201dThe commander of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, Lt. Gen.       Steve Townsend,        said Tuesday that capturing Raqqa would deliver a decisive blow to the idea of Islamic State as a physical caliphate and make it harder for the terrorist group to gain new recruits.But he said that seizing Raqqa wouldn\u2019t destroy the group. \u201cWe all saw the heinous attack in Manchester, England,\u201d Gen. Townsend said. \u201cISIS threatens all of our nations, not just Iraq and Syria, but in our own homelands as well.\u201dInside Raqqa, residents have noted the absence of foreign fighters feared as brutal, hardened warriors. Instead, younger local fighters are now manning Raqqa\u2019s front lines, one resident said. He described this as a sign of Islamic State\u2019s hollowed-out ranks and desperation\u2014teenagers as young as 15 who are recent graduates of what the group calls its Caliphate Cubs or child soldier training camps.The few checkpoints left inside Raqqa city are mostly military police looking for Islamic State militants who don\u2019t have permission to be away from the front lines and inside the city, the resident said.\u201cThe rest have been all thrown on the front lines,\u201d he added.\u2014Nour Alakraa contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Islamic State claimed two attacks in Europe in March.

The conversations took place while Mr. Comey was leading the FBI investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials, collusion Mr. Trump has denied.Here are key moments from the conversations, according to Mr. Comey.\u201cI [earlier] discussed with the FBI\u2019s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure [then] President-elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counterintelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-elect Trump\u2019s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.\u201dMr. Trump took office on Jan. 20.\u201cMy instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my [FBI] position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship.

We simply looked at each other in silence.\u2026\u201cNear the end of our dinner, the president returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay\u2026He then said, \u2018I need loyalty.\u2019 I replied, \u2018You will always get honesty from me.\u2019 He paused and then said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want, honest loyalty.\u2019 I paused, and then said, \u2018You will get that from me.\u2019 As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase \u2018honest loyalty\u2019 differently, but I decided it wouldn\u2019t be productive to push it further. The term\u2014honest loyalty\u2014had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.\u201d\u201cWhen the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, \u2018I want to talk about Mike Flynn.\u2019 [National security adviser] Flynn had resigned the previous day. The president began by saying Flynn hadn\u2019t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the vice president. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.\u2026\u201cThe president then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, \u2018He is a good guy and has been through a lot.\u2019 He repeated that Flynn hadn\u2019t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the vice president. He then said, \u2018I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u2019 I replied only that \u2019he is a good guy.\u2019\u2026I did not say I would \u2018let this go.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump has denied he pressured Mr. Comey to drop the Flynn probe.On the morning of March 30, the president called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as \u2018a cloud\u2019 that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to \u2018lift the cloud.\u2019\u2026I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, \u2018We need to get that fact out.\u2019\u201cHe finished by stressing \u2018the cloud\u2019 that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country, and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn\u2019t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.\u201d\u201cThe president called me and asked what I had done about his request that I \u2018get out\u2019 that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the acting deputy attorney general, but I had not heard back. He replied that \u2018the cloud\u2019 was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the acting deputy attorney general.\u2026I said the White House counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.\u201cHe said he would do that and added, \u2018Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.\u2019 I did not reply or ask him what he meant by \u2019that thing.\u2019\u2026That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.\u201dMr. Comey was fired on May 9.Write to Tim Hanrahan at tim.hanrahan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Comey: I Did Not Say I Would \u2018Let This Go\u2019.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/auction-in-hong-kong-will-try-to-sell-battery-park-city-penthouse-1496867046", "news_time": "2017-06-07 16:24:00", "news_title": "Auction in Hong Kong Will Try to Sell Battery Park City Penthouse", "keywords": "battery park city,hong kong,penthouse,property auction,real estate,ritz carlton,statue of liberty,views fo new york harbor,political,general news,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,property", "content": "How much is a penthouse perched at the top of the Ritz Carlton New York in Battery Park, with vast harbor views, really worth?After lingering on the market for years, the property has been scheduled for auction by Concierge Auctions later this month.The owners, who paid just over $4.78 million for it in 2005, have tapped four different New York brokers who have listed it at eight different prices since 2014, ranging from $23 million down to the current $14.495 million, to no avail, said Herbert Chou, an agent at Warburg Realty who has the latest listing.The 4,293 square foot duplex condo with a 50-foot terrace and a glass-walled living room jutting out toward the Statue of Liberty was the best apartment in the building, but because the asking price was higher than other listings it was hard to close a deal, Mr. Chou said.\u201cThis will accelerate the sales process and condense it to a 30 day period, with much wider exposure across the globe,\u201d Mr. Chou said.In an unusual shift, the online auction will be launched at an event in Hong Kong on June 28, designed to encourage Asian investments in high end New York Real EstateThe auction, with no minimum and no reserve price, is set to begin in Hong Kong on June 28, with non-Chinese buyers able to participate via a mobile bidding app. An open house is scheduled for June 14.

Roger Wicker of Mississippi said \u201cthis is a tough sell\u201d for rural lawmakers. Sen Bill Nelson of Florida, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said reviving the debate over traffic control privatization \u201cdistracts from legitimate matters that must be addressed,\u201d including additional consumer protections for passengers.But passage of an air-traffic control revamp would require a dramatic pullback by political forces arrayed against it, according to lawmakers, congressional staffers and industry officials.The proposal\u2019s prospects are further clouded by Congress\u2019s present focus on health-care reform\u2014and lawmakers\u2019 uncertainty about why President       Donald Trump       opted to put air-traffic control atop his infrastructure agenda.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the theory was in this becoming such a significant component of the infrastructure plan,\u201d Sen.       Jerry Moran       (R., Kansas) said. A member of the Commerce Committee, which oversees the Federal Aviation Administration, Mr. Moran said that except for the largest urban areas, stripping traffic control from the FAA would \u201csignificantly diminish the opportunity for air service to most communities across the country.\u201dMany Republican lawmakers dismissed the privatization issue as premature, since there isn\u2019t any specific White House plan on the table.       Cory Gardner       (R., Colo.), another member of the Commerce Committee, said \u201cwe\u2019ve got a long ways to go in this process\u201d before he can take a position.Similar legislation was approved on a partisan vote by the House Transportation Committee last year, though it died before reaching the House floor and was never seriously considered by the Senate. Sen.       John Thune,        the South Dakota Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, intends again this year to move an FAA reauthorization bill without an air-traffic revamp, according to one person familiar with the details.Unlike in 2016, this year there is an administration putting its political capital behind the idea. Proponents argue that shifting traffic-control responsibilities to a private, nonprofit corporation run by a board representing a broad variety of stakeholders would lead to faster and more efficient modernization. The proposed entity would be funded by user fees and could raise capital in the bond market\u2014rather than relying on the political vagaries of Capitol Hill.Rising impatience with the FAA\u2019s uncertain finances and the slow, troubled modernization has prompted most major U.S. carriers and the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives, to support the White House proposal. Also on board are several unions representing airline pilots and a traveler-advocacy group. The union representing some 10,500 controllers, stung by a staffing crisis due in part to erratic FAA appropriations, said it shares the administration\u2019s commitment to modernization and will review the legislation to see whether it protects its members.By contrast, groups representing operators of business aircraft, along with associations representing private pilots and manufacturers of small planes, have come out strongly against the concept, concerned that the plan would give commercial airlines too much power, unduly raise user fees and isolate small and rural communities, whose airports could get less funding for improvements under a private system.Lawmakers from the left have signaled an eagerness to work with President Trump on a broad, bipartisan infrastructure bill. The White House\u2019s opening gambit, however, was slammed Tuesday by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who said it would raise costs for travelers.A day earlier,       Marc Short,        the White House director of legislative affairs, told reporters that the administration wants to craft an infrastructure plan by year-end. Congress may also need to pass a tax-reform bill to fund the infrastructure projects, but progress is stalled because lawmakers first want to overhaul the nation\u2019s health system.\u201cNot a single major player has shifted position on the air-traffic-control debate since last year,\u201d according to the person familiar with the legislative details. Without industry consensus, this person added, it is unlikely the Senate will be able to hammer out a compromise privatization measure by the September deadline for renewing the FAA\u2019s authority.Responding to bipartisan criticism of privatization, Secretary Chao opened the door to cooperating with lawmakers over fees, governance structure and other details of the proposal. She said that over the past nearly three decades, traffic control modernization has lagged due to outdated procurement practices. Since serving as the department\u2019s No. 2 appointed official in the late 1980s, she told lawmakers, she is now \u201chearing the same arguments, the same description of the problem.\u201dBut a number of committee members stressed that enhancing consumer protections for passengers should be a higher priority for the Transportation Department. Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts said he anticipates extended congressional debate over further passenger safeguards, including proposals to limit baggage fees, cancellation fees and other airline charges to \u201cwhat is fair, what is reasonable (and) what is proportionate.\u201dHours after Secretary Chao\u2019s appearance, House Democrats released an alternative bill calling for \u201ctargeted reforms\u201d at the FAA intended to provide stable funding, personnel reforms and a streamlined acquisition process for air-traffic modernization. Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, said the legislation offers \u201creal, achievable modernization\u201d options, instead of GOP proposal that he contends will end up \u201cjeopardizing the safety and security of our aviation system.\u201dRep. DeFazio and other Democrats proposed similar changes last year, but they were opposed by Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress.\u2014Susan Carey contributed to this article.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mit-gets-140-million-pledge-from-anonymous-donor-1496866275", "news_time": "2017-06-07 16:11:00", "news_title": "MIT Gets $140 Million Pledge From Anonymous Donor ", "keywords": "alumni,donation,higher education,mit,pledge,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,political,general news,education", "content": "The Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0announced that it had received a $140 million pledge from a graduate of the school\u2014with no name, and no strings attached.An unrestricted gift of that size is rare in higher education, as donors often want a say in how their dollars are spent.

Mr. Temer then took over as president in August 2016 after Ms. Rousseff was impeached for breaking budget laws. Mr. Temer and Ms. Rousseff have denied wrongdoing.At a four-hour televised session at the Superior Electoral Tribunal, or TSE,       Herman Benjamin,        who is overseeing the case, said recent testimony from employees of construction group Odebrecht SA should be included in the trial.       Gilmar Mendes,        the head of the TSE, rejected Mr. Benjamin\u2019s argument.Since the complaints about illegal campaign funding were first filed more than two years ago, the country\u2019s investigation into bribery and kickbacks at Petrobras continues to reveal new evidence linked to the TSE case. Mr. Temer is also under Supreme Court investigation over allegations that he took bribes from meatpacker             JBS SA       in the graft scheme. He has denied wrongdoing.The trial, which started Tuesday night, was scheduled to last until Thursday before the extension, with the first votes expected as early as Wednesday. A simple majority at the TSE is needed to cancel the election results and Mr. Temer\u2019s mandate, but justices are allowed to change their minds during the trial and the court must wait until the final vote is cast to issue its ruling.Mr. Temer can appeal the TSE\u2019s verdict to the Supreme Court, although legal experts say that may not help as three of the electoral court justices also sit on the high court.

The usual gripe\u2014and they often have a point\u2014is that he frequently undercuts his own message or creates an unnecessary controversy. The latest twitter eruption invariably sends reporters scurrying to Capitol Hill and demanding a response from GOP lawmakers, who tend to view such questions as distractions from the important task of enacting needed reforms. But the conventional twitter-bomb damage assessments may be overstated.Let\u2019s consider a full accounting of the impact of our tweeter-in-chief. Yes, the President\u2019s 140-character fusillades typically attract immediate and nearly complete attention from the political reporting class. So it\u2019s hard to argue that they aren\u2019t distractions, but the question is how reporters would be spending their time if they hadn\u2019t been diverted to cover the latest missive from the White House. Would they instead be describing in loving detail how the burgeoning Republican plans to reform health care and reduce the tax burden will lead to healthier and wealthier Americans? Some would, but many would not.Also, if Mr. Trump is much less cautious than a conventional politician, this too carries benefits as well as costs. The President may infuriate his fellow GOP elected officials and even his own staff when he ignores all the work they\u2019ve done to craft an argument and instead decides to make a different one on the fly and share it with the digital world. But without having the normal fears of an experienced politician, he\u2019s also more comfortable taking positions that are bound to generate negative press, even if they\u2019re good for economic growth, for example.Take corporate income taxes. Economists increasingly understand that they fall hardest on workers, who suffer when investors have less incentive to pay for the new plant and equipment that allows workers to be more productive and thus to earn higher wages. But given the inevitable media beating that results, not every Republican would be comfortable proposing to slash the federal rate all the way down to 15% from 35%, as Mr. Trump has. And while he\u2019s extremely willing and even seems to enjoy bucking the conventional media wisdom, Mr. Trump also seems fairly flexible on the policy details.Accept Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter weirdness and set aside for the moment the potential damage that could result from his trade and immigration agenda and you have almost an ideal scenario for a growth-oriented Republican legislator. The person sitting in the Oval Office is willing to make deep cuts in the tax and regulatory burden but isn\u2019t a fanatic about the particular ways to achieve these goals. Congressional Republicans just need to send him something to sign.A big tax cut now can mean robust growth next year. Give voters an economy growing at 3% or 4% per year and creating 300,000 or more jobs a month. Very few of the people who take those new jobs will care as much as reporters do that Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201ccovfefe.\u201dRepublicans should also be realistic about how much people change during adulthood. Mr. Trump has enjoyed Twitter for years and he seems unlikely to kick the habit now. Rather than trying to tell the President of the United States to stop expressing himself on social media, perhaps White House aides might first try urging him to only tweet about topics that are not related to his current job. For example, Mr. Trump could continue to offer commentary on the careers of       Arnold Schwarzenegger       and       Rosie O\u2019Donnell,        but might refrain from discussing federal policies that are currently under judicial review.Not that chatting about show business is always cost-free. This week, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to create a new political controversy while tweeting about ESPN\u2019s decision to bring back Hank Williams, Jr. to sing the opening theme for Monday Night Football. But perhaps Mr. Trump could focus on musical questions, such as whether Mr. Williams should be joined occasionally by Florida Georgia Line and Nelly. Then again maybe a Williams pairing with Rihanna would reach a broader audience.There\u2019s much for the President to discuss.Bottom Stories of the DayQuestions Nobody Is Asking  \u201cDid Bill Maher forget that he\u2019s white?,\u201d             Chicago Tribune,June 6How Do We Find Needles in the Haystack of Raw Intelligence?  \u201cThird London attacker told Italian police: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a terrorist\u2019,\u201d Politico, June 6News You Can Use  \u201cGo Ahead.

Prime Minister       Alexis Tsipras       had promised that the measures would secure a deal on debt relief, which would open the way for Greece\u2019s inclusion in the European Central Bank\u2019s asset-purchase program, or quantitative easing, and would signal to investors the country\u2019s return to normality.The deal failed to materialize, and is unlikely to at the June 15 meeting. A compromise between the International Monetary Fund, which has made debt relief a condition for joining the Greek program, and Germany, the chief naysayer, was rejected by Greece at the May 22 meeting as offering too few specifics.Germany\u2019s finance minister,       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble,        insists that debt isn\u2019t the real problem in Greece. It is, instead, an economy with structural weaknesses stemming from a clientelist political system. There\u2019s a lot to be said for this argument.Witness recent developments in the country. On the day of the failed eurogroup meeting last month, it was revealed that       Ivan Savvidis,        a Russian-Greek tycoon who owns a string of businesses and a football club in Greece, had purchased a 19.6% stake in Mega channel. Mega is a private television station, for years the country\u2019s most-watched. Owned until recently by some of Greece\u2019s top oligarchs, it is mired in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy.Mr. Savvidis boasted in an interview in early May that he was sure to gain control of one of the main TV stations \u201cwithin the month.\u201d Bank executives told Kathimerini newspaper that they were placed under pressure from the government to greenlight the Mega transaction.Mr. Savvidis, in the same interview, praised Mr. Tsipras, drawing comparisons to       Vladimir Putin       as a way of complimenting the prime minister. He also savaged the leader of the opposition,       Kyriakos Mitsotakis,        for, among other things, opposing a bill that would relieve Mr. Savvidis of the obligation to pay a \u20ac38 million ($42.8 million) fine imposed on another of Mr. Savvidis\u2019s companies, the tobacco producer SEKAP, for cigarette smuggling. The fine was incurred before Mr. Savvidis bought the company.The Russian-Greek businessman, formerly a member both of the Russian Duma and Mr. Putin\u2019s party, is also a party to the joint venture that was recently declared the preferred bidder for a 67% stake in the port of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second-largest after Piraeus.Meanwhile, Mr. Tsipras has been trying to shore up support by pushing for tens of thousands of employees on short-term contracts to be placed on the government\u2019s permanent payroll. He has restricted the autonomy of private schools from the regulatory reach of the Ministry of Education and has introduced a bill to do the same thing to universities while also reinstating the powers of student politicians to participate in their governance.He has stood back while ministers and lower-level officials place roadblocks on important investments such as the Hellenikon project, which would see private residences, offices, recreational facilities and even a large park and casino built on the Athenian coastline. In its doomed effort to retain government control of the energy industry, the Syriza-led coalition government has also reduced PPC, the state-owned electricity company, to dire financial straits.What is equally worrying is that New Democracy, the center-right opposition, is doing little to prove that it has overcome its own statist, clientelist past. Mr. Mitsotakis has the right instincts on policy, but he has been timid in imposing his views on a largely unreconstructed party.What emerges is a more restrained version of old-style Greek opposition politics\u2014promising growth and tax cuts without specifying where the painful offsetting spending cuts will fall. On the critical issue of combatting diaploki (government-business collusion), furthermore, it\u2019s far from clear that New Democracy is committed to a true rupture from traditional crony-capitalist practices and not merely seeking to replace Syriza\u2019s preferred bidders with its own.But here\u2019s what Mr. Sch\u00e4uble is blind to: He doesn\u2019t acknowledge the role played by Greece\u2019s creditors, above all his own government, in perpetuating this state of affairs. Crushing austerity, born of the European creditors\u2019 unwillingness to acknowledge the obvious unsustainability of Greece\u2019s debt, deepened and prolonged the Greek crisis and undermined necessary structural reforms, and their proponents, in the eyes of the Greek public.This myopic stance, dictated by domestic political calculations in creditor countries, led to the rise of Syriza and the disastrous negotiations that nearly led Greece out of the eurozone. Now, having brought Mr. Tsipras completely to heel, Germany and its allies continue to choke off its recovery and threaten another liquidity crunch.Whether it is the hubris of the victor or plain political cowardice, it is unworthy of those who claim to be Europe\u2019s leaders\u2014and who face the arduous task of rebuilding the euro\u2019s legitimacy, after a period of unprecedented turbulence.Mr. Palaiologos is a journalist at the Kathimerini newspaper in Athens and the author of \u201cThe Thirteenth Labour of Hercules\u201d (Portobello Books)."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bonds-pull-back-after-recent-gains-1496846306", "news_time": "2017-06-07 15:43:00", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Pull Back After Recent Gains", "keywords": " 10-year treasury,bond yields,comey testimony, fed rates,government bonds,interest rates,james comey,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,u.s. government bonds,u.s. treasury,U.S. government,James Comey,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt", "content": "U.S. government bond-prices edged lower Wednesday as investors expressed a measure of relief at the release of written congressional testimony from former FBI Director       James Comey.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.180%, compared with 2.147% Tuesday\u2014its lowest close since Nov. 10.

Now, after losing back-to-back games to the No. 8 seed Nashville Predators, the situation has gotten so dire that the Penguins may be considering hockey\u2019s nuclear option: switching goaltenders.After Pittsburgh\u2019s Game 4 loss on Monday, coach Mike Sullivan declined to say if Matt Murray would start between the pipes for Thursday\u2019s Game 5. After the team gave up a combined nine goals in its two losses, some have clamored for veteran Marc-Andre Fleury to step in for the 23-year-old Murray.But such a switch would be unprecedented in recent history: No goalie has started Game 5 or later in the Finals after not having started any of the first four since at least 1990, according to Stats LLC.The only reason the Penguins are in this position is because of their absurd depth at the position. They have one of the top young talents in Murray, who leapfrogged Fleury a year ago to lead the team to the title as a rookie. And Fleury, a two-time All-Star who was in net when the team won in 2009, has already been the team\u2019s savior this postseason, highlighted by a shutout in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.This decision\u2014or non-decision\u2014is made even more difficult by the fact that their performances have been so indistinguishable this postseason. Murray, despite his recent struggles, has a .925 save percentage this postseason. That\u2019s one thousandth of a point higher than Fleury\u2019s .924. Murray, meanwhile, is 5-3 as a starter during the playoffs compared with Fleury\u2019s 9-6 record.But to realize why the switch may be rash, Pittsburgh has to look no further than its opponent. Amid doubts about Pekka Rinne\u2019s performance in net to start the series, Nashville coach Peter Laviolette made the smartest move of the series by doing absolutely nothing. Now the series is tied because of that.Not panicking over goaltenders is also one of the lessons from the most famous game in hockey history. After a 2-2 first period in the 1980 Olympic semifinals, Russia benched superstar goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. His backup gave up two goals in the third to lose the game. In Russia, it\u2019s a haunting memory that cost the country a likely gold medal. In the U.S., it\u2019s simply known as the Miracle on Ice.Update: On Thursday, Sullivan said Murray would start in goal in Game 5.Appeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Penguins Consider A Goalie Switch: Smart or crazy?.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-know-about-the-sectarian-rift-in-the-middle-east-1496864192", "news_time": "2017-06-07 15:36:00", "news_title": "What to Know About the Sectarian Rift in the Middle East", "keywords": "iran attacks, islamic state, islamic state attack, middle east muslim, sectarianism, shiite muslim, sunni muslim,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action", "content": "Islamic State claimed responsibility for twin terror attacks in\u00a0Tehran on Wednesday, bringing the region\u2019s sectarian divide to the heart of Iran\u2019s capital doorstep. Here are a few things to know:Iran is fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq but had never been attacked domestically.Iran, the region\u2019s major Shiite Muslim power, has assisted the fight against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq since the Sunni Muslim terror group started taking over territory in Iraq in 2014.In Syria, Iran has sent troops and financial help to President       Bashar al-Assad.       Mr. Assad is fighting both Islamic State and rebel groups challenging his rule in a long-running civil conflict. Iran has also thrown its support behind Shiite militias in Iraq that are allied with its army in the fight against Islamic State.Part of Iran\u2019s strategy in involving itself in those fights has been to prevent Islamic State\u2019s extremism from reaching its borders. Wednesday\u2019s attacks mark the first significant operation by the group in the country.Shiites are concentrated in Iran.Iran, with its population of around 80 million, is the largest Shiite-majority country in the world. The other main Shiite actors in the region are Iraq, which also has a large Sunni population, and Hezbollah, a militia and political movement in Lebanon.A majority of tiny Bahrain\u2019s population is Shiite, and there is a concentration of Shiites in eastern Saudi Arabia. Mr. Assad and his ruling clique are largely Alawite, a smaller branch of Islam that overlaps in major ways with the mainline Shiite faith Iran follows. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels practice Zaidism, a Shiite branch more distantly related to the dominant one in Iran.Islamic State reserves special vitriol for Shiites, branding them heretics.Most Muslims are Sunni.Egypt is the largest Sunni-majority state in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia, which is Iran\u2019s main rival for power in the region. Many other countries\u2014including Syria, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait\u2014are Sunni majority.Many Sunni states have participated in U.S.-led efforts to defeat the extremist group.The U.S.\u2019s position is complicated.Since the rise of Islamic State, the U.S.\u2019s regional priority has been to defeat it. That has created an alignment of interests among the U.S., Iran and Sunni governments.While the U.S. is allied with many Sunni countries and Iraq, it has not traditionally been friendly with Iran, with which it has no diplomatic relations.The U.S. has tolerated Iran\u2019s presence on battlefields against Islamic State, allowing Shiite militias in Iraq to band together and fight the group with Iran\u2019s support. But those militias aren\u2019t integrated with U.S. forces.The attacks could lead Iran to assert itself on regional battlefields.Iran may react to the attacks by plowing more resources into the battle against Islamic State, according to analysts studying the effects of Wednesday\u2019s events in Tehran. That could mean a greater Iranian presence in Iraq and Syria, which could introduce new political and military complications for the U.S. and other actors, they said.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-nominee-for-financial-post-backs-america-first-policies-1496836801", "news_time": "2017-06-07 15:09:00", "news_title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Nominee for Financial Post Backs \u2018America First\u2019 Policies", "keywords": "david malpass,trump malpass,trump trade ,trump trade disputes,trump trade wars,David Malpass,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The       Trump       administration\u2019s nominee to be Washington\u2019s top financial diplomat, ex-Bear Stearns chief economist       David Malpass,        advocated an America-first revision of the world\u2019s economic architecture as senators reviewed his nomination Wednesday.Mr. Malpass, a former senior official in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, has long been critical of global trade agreements and multilateral financial institutions that represent the backbone of world economic diplomacy.As the Treasury\u2019s undersecretary for international affairs, Mr. Malpass would act as the administration\u2019s key advocate for dealing with sensitive economic diplomacy on issues such as exchange rates and cross-border rifts over financial regulation, including at the Group of 7 and Group of 20.Before a brief Senate Finance Committee nomination hearing, Mr. Malpass said he would endeavor to help \u201cour domestic industries remain competitive while encouraging foreign investment in the U.S. that creates more jobs here.\u201d Washington\u2019s international policies, he said \u201cneed to work toward broader prosperity,\u201d adding, \u201cI will work to build a stronger U.S. and global economy that raises real median incomes.\u201dIn a slew of public comments over the past two decades, Mr. Malpass has said many of these trade agreements and financial institutions have failed to deliver on their original mandates, aren\u2019t serving American interests and are ripe for a U.S.-led revamping.He has reproached the International Monetary Fund for failing to tame global currency volatility and for focusing bailout programs on budget austerity, higher taxes and exchange-rate depreciations.He has taken Europe to task for the centralization of fiscal power, disparaging the European Union\u2019s expanding bureaucracy. He has called the North American Free Trade Agreement a \u201cmonstrously large, managed trade process\u201d that didn\u2019t work for small U.S. firms. And he has denounced the prolonged cycle of global monetary easing\u2014including the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts\u2014as counterproductive policies that delayed the global economic recovery.But that doesn\u2019t mean he will reject global institutions, according to former officials who have worked with Mr. Malpass in past Republican administrations. Rather, they say, he will likely seek to leverage America\u2019s power to Washington\u2019s advantage through them, even if that means downsizing them.\u201cI think he\u2019ll be a pragmatist, too,\u201d said       Tim Adams,        president of the Institute of International Finance, who worked with Mr. Malpass in the Reagan administration\u2019s Treasury.Mr. Malpass faced little questioning by the committee Wednesday, signaling his nomination should face scant opposition when lawmakers move to approve him. A vote hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled.Mr. Malpass, who speaks Spanish, Russian and French, isn\u2019t a stranger to multilateral institutions. In the Reagan administration, he was responsible for approving aid through them during the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s.The 61-year-old Michigan native would take on the mantle of top financial diplomat at a time when many U.S. allies are worried President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform could spark trade wars and upend the economic order the U.S. established in the wake of World War II.The administration sees reviving the U.S. economy as critical to strengthening global growth. And that means challenging other countries on policies the administration believes come at the expense of U.S. businesses and workers.One core theme in Mr. Malpass\u2019s career as an economist is calling for greater global exchange-rate stability. Although the administration recently declined to label any country a currency manipulator, it has warned China, Japan, South Korea and several other countries against future exchange-rate interventions that give their economies an unfair trade advantage over U.S. companies.The only criticism Mr. Malpass faced Wednesday was on the administration\u2019s dollar policy. Oregon Sen.       Ron Wyden,        the ranking Democrat on the committee, said mixed messages from Mr. Trump and Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       leave the public bewildered.\u201cIs the administration for a strong dollar or a weak dollar?\u201d Mr. Wyden asked rhetorically. \u201cNobody knows.\u201dMr. Malpass didn\u2019t comment. But he said in his opening remarks part of his mandate is \u201cprotecting the trustworthiness of the U.S. dollar.\u201dThe IMF\u2019s Greek bailout has been also been a special target for Mr. Malpass. The near decadelong debt-debacle hasn\u2019t only put a major dent in the IMF\u2019s credibility, but it has also given critical U.S. lawmakers ammunition in appropriation fights over funding for the emergency lender.Mounting problems in several of the world\u2019s largest emerging-market economies could test the IMF\u2019s finances. Meantime, Greece\u2019s still-simmering debt problems could give the administration an argument to counter requests from the fund for more bailout resources.Mr. Malpass, who wants smaller, more streamlined multilateral institutions, will also be responsible for making the case to Congress for administration plans to cut U.S. lending to the World Bank.One position Mr. Malpass has likely had to change heading into the Trump administration is on the U.S. trade gap. The White House sees the trade deficit with China, Germany and other countries as evidence of unfair terms that give other economies an advantage at the expense of U.S. workers. But a little over a decade ago, Mr. Malpass penned a Wall Street Journal commentary that said policy makers should \u201cEmbrace the Deficit.\u201d\u201cThe trade deficit and related capital inflow reflect U.S. growth, not weakness,\u201d Mr. Malpass said in late 2006.That is a view more in line with many U.S. economists, who say that the Trump administration\u2019s fixation on the deficit is leading it to craft policy solutions that won\u2019t help the economy\u2019s underlying troubles.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oecd-moves-to-limit-tax-avoidance-by-multinationals-1496862478", "news_time": "2017-06-07 15:07:00", "news_title": "OECD Moves to Limit Tax Avoidance by Multinationals ", "keywords": "base erosion,beps,multilateral convention,tax treaties,treaty shopping,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,regulation,government policy,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,fraud,personal finance,tax strategies,tax fraud", "content": "More than 70 countries and jurisdictions signed an agreement Wednesday limiting the ability of multinationals to exploit divergences between tax treaties, a practice known as \u201ctreaty shopping\u201d that enables companies to pay lower taxes.The agreement\u2014the so-called multilateral instrument\u2014is part of an attempt by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to limit companies\u2019 ability to shift profits to low-tax locations, a practice known as base erosion and profit shifting.The U.S. wasn\u2019t among the signatories, which include the European Union\u2019s 28 member states, China, India and Australia, among others.\u201cIt [the multilateral instrument] is going to kill treaty shopping, which is one of the techniques for companies to avoid tax,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the center for tax policy and administration at the OECD.The U.S., he said, already has robust anti-abuse provisions in place and companies have little opportunity to set up local operations in order to get tax breaks on their activities in other countries.The effort to reduce tax avoidance was launched in 2012 following a surge in government spending to contain the financial crisis and the global recession. One goal of the drive was to harmonize a web of more than 3,000 bilateral treaties that provided a host of loopholes for businesses attempting to lower their tax bills.The signing ceremony in Paris comes just days after the EU at the end of May adopted rules aimed at preventing companies from exploiting differences between EU tax systems and those of non-EU countries. They are set to go into effect in January 2020.Corporate treasurers are now looking at the potential implications of the changes on their tax planning. \u201cThe multilateral instrument takes away uncertainty, but also removes opportunities for creative tax planning that companies have used in the past,\u201d said Michael Graf, co-head of European tax at Dentons Europe LLP, a law firm.Once the agreement has been ratified by the legislatures of the signing countries\u2014a process expected to take months, if not years\u2014it should guarantee much greater coherence between international tax treaties, Mr. Graf said, ultimately benefiting a majority of multinationals. But some companies might be left with international tax structures that no longer work.The emphasis on increased coherence between tax treaties will change how multinationals set up their tax structures, said Tim Wach, managing director at Taxand, a Canadian tax advisory firm.Companies that are currently in the process of setting up new tax structures\u2014for example a new global treasury center\u2014could face challenges because of this, Mr. Wach said. \u201cThese firms will have to deal with uncertainty around whether their solutions are still fit for the purpose,\u201d he said.The agreement includes an improved dispute-resolution process, one of the aspects that finance chiefs and tax directors support, Mr. Wach said. Nevertheless, complexity remains an issue. \u201cThe publication of consolidated versions of the treaties impacted by the multilateral instrument would simplify matters and add greater transparency,\u201d Mr. Wach said.At a recent tax conference held by Taxand in Frankfurt, close to 80% of finance chiefs and treasurers said the multilateral instrument would benefit multinationals, according to Mr. Wach. A total of 136 finance and tax chiefs working at multinational companies in the Americas, Europe and Asia took part in that survey.Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-pledges-major-military-spending-to-bolster-global-role-1496862292", "news_time": "2017-06-07 15:04:00", "news_title": "Canada Pledges Major Military Spending to Bolster Global Role ", "keywords": "canada,canada defense,canadian government,defense spending,donald trump,justin trudeau,military spending,nato,trump,NATO,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,politics", "content": "OTTAWA\u2014Canada intends to ramp up defense spending over the next decade by more than 70% as it upgrades its military equipment and adds soldiers to take on a larger role on the global stage in promoting security and fighting terrorism.The spending commitment unveiled\u00a0Wednesday marks\u00a0the second part of a reset in Canadian foreign policy amid what Ottawa says is growing isolationism from the Trump administration. The rise in Canadian defense expenditures could also address longstanding concerns abroad and at home that Canada wasn\u2019t pulling its weight as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Canadian defense spending is set to rise from last year\u2019s level of 18.9 billion Canadian dollars ($14.04 billion) to an estimated C$32.67 billion in 2027, or an increase on a cash basis of 73%. By 2025, total defense spending is expected to reach 1.4% of Canada\u2019s gross domestic product\u2014above last year\u2019s 1.2% level but still below NATO\u2019s preferred target of 2% of GDP.By 2021, over 20% of defense expenditures will be focused on the acquisition and refurbishment of major equipment, or roughly double last year\u2019s 11% level.Canadian officials said the increased spending reflects a changing global landscape in which economic inequality, cyberattacks and terrorist activity pose a significant threat to Canadian prosperity. \u201cWe recognize that the distinction between domestic and international threats is becoming less relevant,\u201d Canadian Defense Minister       Harjit Sajjan       said. \u201cWe cannot be strong at home unless we are also engaged in the world.\u201dAt a press conference, Mr. Sajjan said the new policy is meant to address funding shortcomings over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the government to hold up its end of the bargain.\u201dLast month, President Donald Trumpcriticized NATO members\u2014although with a particular focus on Europe\u2014for failing to bolster their spending on defense. Current and former European officials acknowledge the continent lacks the military capabilities to defend itself.The surge in military spending marks a pivot of sorts for the Liberal government, which in its election campaign in 2015 promised to keep defense spending at current levels and vowed not to \u201cshort change\u201d the military. The government didn\u2019t signal a large spending increase in security when it released its 2017 budget plan roughly three months ago, and officials skirted questions about where the funding would come from.Defense-policy documents didn\u2019t address concerns over a diminished U.S. leadership role in the postwar order, which was a focal point of a speech by Canadian Foreign Minister       Chrystia Freeland       in parliament Tuesday.Before the release of the new policy directive, defense analysts had said Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric on NATO would push Canada to revamp its security policy.\u201cIn his determination to \u2018make America great again,\u2019 he is moving to dismantle much of the international security architectures that have served Canadian security so well over the years,\u201d said       Robert Huebert,        a University of Calgary professor and defense-policy expert.Canada\u2019s planned increased outlays on defense include the acquisition of a fleet of 88 new fighter jets, or an increase from the 65 originally planned, and 15 warships. Canada also wants the size of its forces, or military personnel, to grow to 71,500, up from 68,000, which will allow Canada to expand in areas such as fending off cyberattacks and intelligence.Canada is also aiming to increase the proportion of women in the military to 25% by 2026, from its current level of roughly 15%.A report earlier this year from the Canadian Senate warned the government was shortchanging its defense and security operations, and this marked an \u201cunacceptable\u201d approach for a NATO member. The Senate report said among NATO members, Canada ranked 23rd out of 28 countries in terms of defense funding.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gold-hovers-near-2017-highs-1496835664", "news_time": "2017-06-07 14:58:00", "news_title": "Metals: Gold Hovers Near 2017 Highs", "keywords": "base metals,copper,copper futures,gold,gold futures,industrial metals,precious metals,risk trade,Marex Spectron,metals markets,gold markets,commodity,financial market news,copper markets,non-ferrous metals markets,precious metals markets", "content": "Gold\u2019s rally paused Wednesday, after hitting fresh 2017 highs on Tuesday on the back of increased macroeconomic and political risk.Gold for August delivery settled down 0.3% at $1,293.20 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, breaking a three-session winning streak.Copper for July delivery fluctuated between gains and losses and ended the day up 0.2% to $2.5515 a pound in New York.The WSJ Dollar Index was recently up 0.2% at 88.11, making dollar-denominated metals more expensive for foreign buyers.Gold\u2019s downtick came after recent sharp gains amid long-term macroeconomic fears about Chinese and U.S. growth and short-term risk in the Arab Gulf after Saudi Arabia along with other regional players severed ties with Qatar earlier this week.Last Friday\u2019s weak nonfarm jobs data had the triple effect of depressing both the dollar and U.S. bond yields, and lowering investor expectations of more than two additional Federal Reserve rate increases in 2017.Wednesday saw the dollar continue its descent, hitting new seven-month lows.

The assailants were shot and killed by police.Mr. Thomas\u2019s family and police had called for information after he went missing the night of the attack.\u00a0Witness statements suggested Mr. Thomas may have been struck down by the attackers\u2019 van and thrown into the river, police have said.The body was found Tuesday night at 7:45 p.m. in London near Limehouse, a riverside section of London downstream from the bridge attack.The discovery came as more information emerged about those who died in Saturday\u2019s attack.Police said Wednesday the victims included       Sara Zelenak,        a 21-year-old Australian living and working in London.Family members confirmed the death of       Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda,        a 39-year-old Spanish national who has been hailed as a hero for trying to fight off the attackers with his skateboard.\u201cMy brother Ignacio tried to stop some terrorists and lost his life trying to save others,\u201d said his sister, Isabel Echeverr\u00eda, in a             Facebook                   post. \u201cIgna, we love you and we\u2019ll never forget you.\u201dFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that three French nationals have died. \u201cFrance has paid heavily in these attacks,\u201d he said.Mr. Macron didn\u2019t name the victims. A French police official has said the they include a 27-year-old man from Normandy named Alexandre. Friends and family say two other French victims are missing: Mr. Thomas and Sebastien Belanger, 36, a chef at London restaurant Coq d\u2019Argent.Investigators are working to piece together a picture of the lead-up to the attack. Authorities had been warned about at least two of the attackers but weren\u2019t actively monitoring them, raising questions about the country\u2019s security gaps.Authorities haven\u2019t said publicly how they believe the three attackers knew each other. But two of them, Khuram Butt and Rachid Redouane, attended a male-only swimming session at a local community center in east London, according to an organizer of the sessions.Akhtar Uzzaman said Butt had attended the sessions since January, sometimes bringing his young son. Redouane joined in early May.Butt seemed quite rude sometimes, jumping and splashing in the shallow pool, while Redouane was the quiet one, Mr. Uzzaman said.Police early Wednesday said they had arrested a 30-year-old man as they searched a property in east London as part of their investigation into the attack, a day after arresting a 27-year-old man.

But his administration can grant waivers to officials to circumvent that order, which relaxed rules imposed by former President       Barack Obama       on former lobbyists\u2019 work in government. Aside from the two dozen waivers granted to officials in federal agencies, Mr. Trump has also given waivers to at least 16 White House officials, copies of which were released last week.The Trump administration has so far outpaced Mr. Obama on granting ethics waivers. Over the course of his two terms, Mr. Obama granted about 50 waivers to officials in federal agencies;\u00a0in four months, Mr. Trump has already handed out about a quarter as many.Critics have said the high number of waivers Mr. Trump has granted calls further into question his campaign pledge to rid Washington of special interests and \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201dWhite House Press Secretary       Sean Spicer,        asked last week whether certain waivers had violated ethics rules, said the waivers were from Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, not federal law, and that the president \u201cis the ultimate decider on that.\u201dThe waivers released\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0show the administration will allow       Brian Callanan,        who serves as deputy general counsel at the Treasury Department, to work on housing finance reform, \u201ceven if an issue arises that might impact pending litigation in which [his] former employer, Cooper & Kirk PLLC, represents one of several plaintiffs.\u201d In his work at the law firm, Mr. Callanan focused on regulatory litigation and government investigations. The waiver says he will not communicate with his former employer.Some of the waivers permit officials to interact with news organizations that were their former employers.       Anthony Sayegh,        the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department who previously worked for Fox News, can continue to \u201cparticipate in matters\u201d involving that outlet, his waiver says. Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the State Department who was previously employed by             21st Century Fox,       can continue to communicate with the company.Not all lobbyists working in the administration appear to have been granted waivers.       Geoff Burr,        a former lobbyist for the Associated Builders and Contractors, now works at the Transportation Department and doesn\u2019t appear to have been given a waiver, according to the set released by the Office of Government Ethics. Nor has       Byron Anderson,        special assistant to the secretary at the Labor Department, who previously served on the in-house lobbying team at Transamerica, a financial-services firm.In total, the ethics office released two dozen ethics waivers on Wednesday, including some from the Obama administration.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regional-rift-hits-container-shipments-to-qatar-but-not-lng-exports-1496860082", "news_time": "2017-06-07 14:28:00", "news_title": "Regional Rift Hits Container Shipments to Qatar, but Not LNG Exports ", "keywords": "dispute,exports,imports,lng,natural gas,qatar,qatari,shipments,trade,Maersk Line,MAERSK-B.KO,Orient Overseas Container Lines,corporate,industrial news,supply chain,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,liquid petroleum gas markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,liquefied,compressed gas,marine transport,freight transport,logistics,marine freight,water transport,shipping,transportation", "content": "Three days into a diplomatic fallout between Qatar and its neighbors, container cargoes heading toward the tiny Arab nation are choked but crucial natural-gas exports haven\u2019t been affected.Qatar is the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas with a 30% market share. Brokers in London and Singapore said Qatari exports of LNG haven\u2019t been disrupted by the rift and Qatar-flagged vessels continue to pass through the Suez Canal.However, the container liners that supply Qatar with food, clothing and electronics aren\u2019t accepting cargo to and from the country, with brokers saying the situation could intensify if relations between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbors aren\u2019t normalized.Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on Monday severed relations with Qatar, accusing the nation of financing and harboring extremists. The Gulf states closed off air, sea and land routes, causing a rush on supermarkets in the Qatari capital of Doha and disrupting airline travel between the nations.Qatar, with a population of about 2.3 million, imports 80% of its food requirements from neighbors like the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, according to traders. Food mostly arrives on container ships and trucks.\u201cFood supplies and other products like medicine, clothes and shoes, are under siege with no container traffic and scores of trucks stuck in the border with Saudi Arabia,\u201d a London shipping broker said. \u201cQatar has to figure out new supply chains, if relations are not normalized over the next two weeks.\u201dContainer shipping firms like Maersk Line, the world\u2019s biggest boxship operator, use Dubai\u2019s Jebel Ali transshipment hub to discharge Qatari-destined cargo, which is then forwarded with smaller vessels to Doha. Jebel Ali is run by Dubai-based port operator DP World, which Tuesday said it is banning all \u201cvessels destined or arriving from Qatar\u201d until further notice.\u201cWe expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid. We have confirmation that we will not be able to move cargo to and from Qatar in and out of Jebel Ali,\u201d a Maersk spokesman said. \u201cWe will notify our customers on alternatives as soon as possible.\u201dFrance\u2019s CMA CGM and Hong Kong\u2019s Orient Overseas Container Lines also have suspended bookings to the country. Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. said it is still accepting cargo but will follow restrictions arising from the diplomatic spat.Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Commerce said there was no reason to panic, noting the country has abundant strategic food reserves. By Tuesday afternoon and into Wednesday, crowds at a large supermarket in central Doha had thinned, and supplies of water, fish and beef hadn\u2019t run out as during the previous day. Qatar\u2019s government also fixes the prices of essential grocery items, which has ensured no sudden price hikes for consumers.Container ships are still able to dock at Qatar\u2019s own terminals, but most of the nation\u2019s ports can\u2019t accommodate big vessels. Qatar\u2019s government has said it would continue to import goods by air and sea. Its only land border is with Saudi Arabia.Several regional and global leaders, meanwhile, are pushing the Arab countries to find a diplomatic solution to the spat.Qatar-flagged tankers and other ships aren\u2019t banned from crossing the Suez Canal, allowing them access to European markets and beyond, despite Cairo\u2019s move to cut relations with Doha.\u201cOnly states that are at war with Egypt can be barred from using the Canal, which is not the case here,\u201d said       Tarek Hassanien,        a spokesman for the Suez Canal Authority.The brokers also said they aren\u2019t aware of any major disruptions on oil exports moved on very large crude carriers.\u201cMost LNG and crude cargoes are on long-term chartering contracts with shipowners from across the world,\u201d said a Singapore broker. \u201cThese kinds of cargoes won\u2019t be affected unless the diplomatic spat gets really ugly.\u201d LNG prices were largely unchanged Wednesday.Peter Sand,        chief shipping analyst at BIMCO, a group of the world\u2019s biggest shipowners, said LNG exports go directly from Doha to Asian importers and won\u2019t be affected.

The country\u2019s ruling party moved up a scheduled vote on legislation allowing the deployment of hundreds of Turkish troops to Qatar, a decision seen as a strong symbol of its ties to the country.The diplomatic rupture pits neighboring countries allied with the West against each other, complicating shared efforts to combat Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Qatar is home to America\u2019s largest military base in the Middle East, from where U.S. forces oversee the international air bombing campaign against the extremist group.The positions of Germany and Turkey are at odds with that of U.S. President       Donald Trump,        who in a series of messages on Twitter on Tuesday sided with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others, appearing to take credit for the move, which he said was aimed at countering extremist ideology and terror financing.\u201cI have never seen the U.S. taking sides like this,\u201d says Ibrahim Fraihat, professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar. \u201cIt raises questions on whether the U.S. could play a role as mediator.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments contradicted statements made by other top administration officials who called for dialogue, causing confusion on U.S. policy. A U.S. State Department official said Wednesday America\u2019s ties with Qatar remain strong and that it hopes the crisis will soon be resolved.Turkey, which like Qatar sees itself as supporting moderate Islamic political parties in the wider region, is seeking to mediate between the opposite sides, as are two Gulf countries: Kuwait and Oman, who along with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional alliance whose future existence is now far from certain.Utku Cakirozer, a Turkish lawmaker with the opposition Republican Peoples\u2019 Party said that the decision to move up the parliamentary vote on two bills \u2014which passed easily\u2014was \u201chighly significant.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d       Mr. Cakirozer       said.Last month, Turkish and Qatari generals finalized a military base agreement under which up to 600 Turkish troops would be deployed to Doha. The troops mission would be to help train Qatar soldiers with mine-clearing and other non-lethal tactics.Turkey and Germany have also faced tensions. Germany said on Wednesday it would move its 250 troop engaged in the campaign against Islamic State from its base in Turkey to Jordan after Ankara refused to allow German lawmakers access to the troops.Mr. Gabriel spoke after meeting his Saudi counterpart, Adel al Jubeir. Addressing the press, the Saudi foreign minister reiterated Riyadh\u2019s position, saying Qatar had supported extremist organizations for years and failed to cooperate with its neighbors.Mr. Jubeir said that Saudi Arabia and the other countries that broke ties with Qatar don\u2019t seek an outside mediator, but that a possible resolution to the dispute should come through the Gulf Cooperation Council.Qatar has dismissed all allegations against it as baseless and called for dialogue to resolve the dispute.The diplomatic break also carries commercial implications for Qatar. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries closed air and sea routes to the tiny peninsula,which is heavily dependent on imports, including food. Qatar\u2019s only land border, with Saudi Arabia, is also closed.S&P cut Qatar\u2019s long-term rating to AA- from AA, citing the recent regional dispute.Saudi Arabia cooperates closely with the West on counterterrorism and against Islamic State. But it has also drawn widespread criticism in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere for its past role in spreading radical ideologies and for not having done enough to stop terror financing.Mr. Gabriel said both Saudi Arabia and Qatar are countries whose practices in the past have worried Germany.\u201cWe have therefore a great interest for everyone in the anti-IS coalition to agree that there mustn\u2019t be any kind of financing of terrorist organizations,\u201d he added.\u2014Yeliz Candemir and       Zeke Turner       contributed to this article.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com, Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com and Margaret Coker at margaret.coker@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/think-your-lirr-commute-is-getting-worse-youre-right-1496859499", "news_time": "2017-06-07 14:18:00", "news_title": "Think Your LIRR Commute is Getting Worse?

He and his wife moved to Port Washington, N.Y., four years ago, lured by good public schools and a 35-minute ride to Manhattan on the train.As Mr. Candres, 35 years old, waited at New York Penn Station one recent evening\u2014a day on which an Amtrak power failure made him 40 minutes late for work\u2014he said his daily commute has become plagued by disruptions and overcrowded trains. He fears it will only get worse.\u201cIt does make me worried when I think of all the work that is needed going forward,\u201d he said.Over the first four months of this year, 82.3% of the LIRR\u2019s evening rush-hour trains managed to reach their destinations on time, according to the Journal analysis. Morning-peak trains fared better, with 89.7% trains reaching their destinations on time, but that still was the third-lowest rate in a decade.Two derailments at Penn Station this year, one involving an Amtrak train, the other an NJ Transit train, exacerbated longstanding problems caused by an aging rail infrastructure that is struggling to cope with rising ridership.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR, provided data showing that issues with Amtrak\u2019s operations were responsible for 21% of the 10,000 canceled or delayed trains through the first five months of this year.But the Journal\u2019s analysis found that the increasingly unreliable LIRR service since 2013 isn\u2019t all Amtrak\u2019s fault.Over the five years from 2008 through 2012, the railroad\u2019s systemwide on-time performance for the evening rush hours averaged 93% during the first four months of those years. Over the last five years, the average monthly on-time performance has declined to 87%.According to the figures the MTA provided, Amtrak was responsible for an average of 7.4% of LIRR delays in the previous nine years.The LIRR operates on about 3 miles of Amtrak-owned infrastructure into and out of Penn Station. An Amtrak spokeswoman, Christina Leeds, said that while the derailments had caused \u201cunplanned disruptions,\u201d extensive repair work this summer would \u201cimprove reliability for all customers.\u201dMs. Leeds added: \u201cAmtrak works closely with LIRR, including making joint decisions on the dispatching of trains, to minimize disruptions and delays to all passengers traveling in and out of New York Penn Station.\u201dDelays have been more acute on particular lines. During the evening peak hours over the first four months of this year, trains on the Babylon and Oyster Bay lines recorded average on-time performance of 80%. Service to Hicksville and Huntington fared worst with on-time performance of 76%.The LIRR considers a train late if it is canceled or if it arrives at its final destination six minutes after its scheduled time.LIRR President Pat Nowakowski said the railroad\u2019s problems are a function of increased ridership, which grew 10% between 2011 and 2016 to 89 million people a year, its highest level since 1949. Last year, the LIRR scheduled 247,000 trains, a 7.4% increase from 2011.A delay on just one of these trains, especially during the peak hours when tracks and tunnels are scheduled to their full capacity, cascades through the system, affecting many other trains. On the day that Mr. Candres was late for work, two trains lost power just outside Penn Station during the morning peak period, delaying more than 100 trains.\u201cBecause everything is scheduled so precisely and so tightly to flow with one another, when one gets delayed, you have a domino effect,\u201d Mr. Nowakowski said.More commuter pain is expected this July and August when Amtrak, which owns and operates Penn Station, is scheduled to close several tracks to carry out extensive repairs following the derailments.NJ Transit will divert its Morris & Essex Midtown Direct service to Hoboken where passengers will have to cross the Hudson River using a ferry or the PATH rail system. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie warned that passengers who continue to use Penn Station this summer will undoubtedly face further delays.The LIRR hasn\u2019t released its revised schedule yet. But it is likely to reduce services into Penn Station, diverting some passengers to stations in Brooklyn and Queens where they will transfer onto the subway system, which also suffers from deteriorating on-time performance. New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       has predicted a \u201csummer of hell\u201d for commuters.A report by the New York state comptroller in April found that in 2016, the LIRR blamed 27% of delays on passengers, mostly for boarding or exiting the train too slowly at stations with short platforms or because of overcrowding.That same year, the LIRR took responsibility for 30% of disruptions, mostly because of unscheduled infrastructure repairs and mechanical problems with trains. In 2016, the LIRR recorded 3,000 delays or cancellations caused by engineering, its highest number in at least 15 years. The railroad is on track to surpass 3,500 engineering-related delays this year.Mr. Nowakowski said the best way to improve on-time performance is to increase capacity.He pointed to the MTA\u2019s $10 billion East Side Access project, scheduled for completion in 2022, which will deliver passengers to a new terminal below Grand Central Terminal.He also cited a $1.5 billion project, still in an early phase, to add a third track to part of the LIRR\u2019s main line. The line is so congested that for two hours each weekday morning the railroad runs trains in only one direction.Until such projects are completed, Mr. Nowakowski said LIRR must make do with the capacity that it has.That includes two East River tunnels that are gradually being eaten away by corrosive residue left over from floodwaters that surged through the tubes in 2012 during superstorm Sandy.He said that when disruption strikes during peak hours, the railroad switches to a prearranged plan, canceling some services and \u201cstrategically\u201d running trains that offer the best alternatives to get commuters to their destination. That often leads to overcrowding.\u201cThere\u2019s no good solution,\u201d Mr. Nowakowski said.Write to Tom McGinty at tom.mcginty@wsj.com and Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'LIRR Rush-Hour Woes the Worst in Years.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-cushion-that-saved-taxpayers-from-banco-populars-failure-1496857915", "news_time": "2017-06-07 13:51:00", "news_title": "The Cushion That Saved Taxpayers From Banco Popular\u2019s Failure ", "keywords": " coco, cocos, popular's failure,popular's sale,Banco Popular Espanol ,POP.MC,Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria,BBVA,ES:BBVA,Banco Popular,Banco Santander S.A.,ES:SAN,regulation,government policy,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services", "content": "Since the 2008 financial crisis, politicians have sworn to protect taxpayers and depositors from the threat of failing banks. In Spain, European and national regulators have just demonstrated exactly how that is done.Bondholders burned Wednesday in the overnight resolution and sale of         Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol               shouldn\u2019t be at all surprised. Any bond, even a perpetual one, that was issued with an 11.5% coupon in 2015 was clearly a very risky investment.The rest of the market for risky bank bonds (often called cocos after one type that is designed to be converted into equity) has taken the move entirely in its stride. Prices of similar debt from other banks were little changed on Wednesday. Two examples: The price of the most recent junior bond from Spain\u2019s             BBVA                   was down 1.6%, while a U.S. dollar junior bond deal from             Deutsche Bank,       which saw huge volatility in its issues last year, was up 0.6%.These bonds come in various kinds, but all are designed to absorb losses beyond what is covered by equity when a bank gets into trouble. The most important are so-called additional Tier 1 bonds that are very close to equity. They can be convertible into equity (when they are cocos) or sometimes they just suffer losses in value. But there are other, slightly safer bonds, known as Tier 2 debt, that can also be written down or converted at a regulator\u2019s discretion when a bank needs to be resolved. In Banco Popular\u2019s case, both were wiped out.Banco Popular made for an easier first-case use of European regulators\u2019 full resolution powers than other banks might have. It is only Spain\u2019s sixth-biggest bank by assets, its domestic rivals are relatively healthy and they were undisturbed by its troubles. It didn\u2019t need much capital, it\u2019s just that there were no private investors left who were willing to provide it.Analysts and investors, however, said that the process and the wider market reaction showed these bonds and the resolution rules were working exactly as they should. The move solved the problem of a failing bank without risking a single penny of taxpayers\u2019 cash. Analysts said the outcome also showed the importance of investors being very careful about which bank they buy into.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.The main problem for investors here is the potential lack of transparency from regulators ahead of a resolution, which is a process that allows regulators to take control of a bank and sort it out. In Popular\u2019s case, there was a sudden increase in deposit withdrawals in the past couple of days. Regulators knew this, bondholders didn\u2019t. As far as investors knew, the bank hadn\u2019t breached its capital requirements and still had hopes of selling itself.Regulators can make a determination that a bank is failing or likely to fail with information that investors don\u2019t have.

But Russian President       Vladimir Putin       last week suggested that \u201cpatriotic\u201d Russian hackers may have been involved in the breach of Democratic National Committee servers last year, a statement some observers viewed as a roundabout admission of Russian involvement.Mr. Putin compared the political scandal roiling the Beltway to anti-Semitism, saying critics of his country are similar to those who blame Jews for problems real and imagined.\u201cThe other team lost,\u201d Mr. Putin said, referring to the Democratic Party\u2019s result in the election. \u201cThey are reluctant to acknowledge the mistake. They do not want to admit that they did not get it, that they miscalculated. It is easier to say, \u2018We are not to blame. The Russians are to blame. They interfered in our election, but we are good.\u2019\u201dAdded Mr. Putin: \u201cIt reminds me of anti-Semitism: The Jews are to blame for everything.\u201dThe U.S. intelligence community released a report earlier this year that claimed Mr. Putin directed a campaign aimed at influencing the outcome of the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump. Those claims received renewed attention this week after the arrest of a U.S. government contractor over the weekend in connection with the leak of a National Security Agency document that concluded Russian spies hacked computers of a U.S. company to steal information on voting system.Talk of Russophobia is part of a larger official Russian narrative of encirclement: The political elites of the U.S. and its Western allies want a weak and supine Russia, the reasoning goes. And they deliberately stir up popular hostility toward Russia.In remarks Tuesday,       Valentina Matviyenko,        the chairwoman of the Russian senate, said Russophobia \u201cis one of the ways to contain Russia, the growth of its political influence, our development. However, Russophobia does not exist among ordinary people,\u201d according to remarks in the parliamentary gazette.Adding fresh fuel to the inflammatory rhetoric was Montenegro\u2019s formal accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Monday. NATO\u2019s expansion is a major irritant to Moscow: Even though Russia has no border with the tiny Balkan nation, Russian officials say the country\u2019s membership is part of a larger plan by a hostile alliance to encircle and threaten Russia.Speaking Tuesday in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       denounced Montenegro\u2019s NATO membership, saying: \u201cThe Russophobic campaign unleashed against the background of accession to NATO shows that Montenegro does not care about any pan-European principles, but wants to \u2018sell high\u2019 its anti-Russian statements. God is their judge, but we cannot ignore it.\u201dMr. Trump has frequently expressed admiration for the Russian president. But expectations of a rapprochement between Moscow and Washington have faded amid continuing investigations into ties between Russia and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle.Andranik Migranyan, a Russian political scientist and professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, said the current atmosphere in Washington mirrored descriptions in The Paranoid Style in American Politics, a 1964 essay by historian       Richard Hofstadter       about how conspiracy theories influence American politics.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it Russophobia,\u201d Mr. Migranyan said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on today in American politics is another wave of paranoia.

That makes them about 100,000 years older than any other fossils of Homo sapiens\u2014the species to which all people today belong.\u201cThese dates were a big wow,\u201d said anthropologist       Jean-Jacques Hublin       at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Leipzig, Germany. He led an international team of scientists who reported the discovery Wednesday in Nature. \u201cThis material represents the very roots of our species\u2014the very oldest Homo sapiens found in Africa or anywhere.\u201dUntil now, most researchers believed that modern humankind emerged gradually from a population centered in East Africa around 200,000 years ago. Previous discoveries of early Homo sapiens fossils have been concentrated at sites in Ethiopia.The fossil discovery at Jebel Irhoud near Marrakesh in North Africa, however, suggests that early humans had already spread across most of Africa by then.\u201cWhat\u2019s really neat about this discovery is that you now have evidence of modern Homo sapiens across Africa, about as far from sites in East Africa as you can get,\u201d said anthropologist       Bernard Wood       at George Washington University\u2019s Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology, who wasn\u2019t involved in the find.As early experiments in the human form, these ancestors had quite modern-looking facial features, but relatively primitive skulls, suggesting that the cognitive capacities of modern brains had yet to take shape, the scientists said.Their faces were likely so contemporary in appearance that they might pass unnoticed on a crowded city sidewalk, although they might need to wear a hat to disguise their skull\u2019s elongated shape, Dr. Hublin said.Such combinations of traits, though, blur the differences that distinguish one human ancestor from another, making it hard for scholars to classify species accurately. In fact, several early human species, such as Neanderthals, were so closely related to Homo sapiens that they could all interbreed, modern genetic evidence shows.But several independent experts said they agreed that the fossils most likely belonged to Homo sapiens.\u201cIt has a modern face and a primitive brain case,\u201d said       John Fleagle,        an expert on primate evolution at Stony Brook School of Medicine, who wasn\u2019t part of the research group. \u201cYou would expect it to have a few primitive characteristics even if it is on the main line of our lineage. It shows what is probably an earlier stage of our species.\u201dThe scientists found bones of three adults, a teenager and a child mixed in with sharpened flint tools and the butchered bones of gazelles and zebra, suggesting that a hunting party had camped there. Fires had scorched the tools and that proved key to determining the age of the find.The researchers tested the tools using a technique called thermoluminescence dating, which reveals how much time has elapsed since an object has been heated. By that measure, they calculated that the tools were 315,000 years old, plus or minus 34,000 years.They also dated tooth enamel from a fossil jaw using electron spin resonance, which can measure the residual radiation that has built up since a material formed. That yielded an age of 286,000 years, plus or minus 32,000 years, the scientists said.\u201cIt leads us to conclude that 300,000 years old is the best age for these fossils,\u201d said       Daniel Richter       at the Max Planck Institute, who conducted the dating studies.Write to Robert Lee Hotz at sciencejournal@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Scientists Find Earliest Human Specimens.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/agribusiness-angles-for-infrastructure-upgrades-on-u-s-inland-waterways-1496854757", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:59:00", "news_title": "Agribusiness Angles for Infrastructure Upgrades on U.S. Inland Waterways ", "keywords": "agribusiness,agriculture,barge,competitiveness,export,grains,rivers,transportation infrastructure,u.s. trade,waterways,Archer Daniels Midland,ADM,Bunge,BG,Cargill Inc.,Donald Trump,Rick Calhoun,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,edible oils markets,farming,food,beverages,tobacco,flour,malt products,inland water transport,consumer goods,food products,water transport,shipping,transportation,logistics", "content": "President       Donald Trump\u2019s       focus on infrastructure this week highlights a long-festering problem in the U.S. heartland: crumbling river systems that can make it more costly to transport crops.The U.S. river system ferries nearly three-quarters of export-bound U.S. grain to ocean ports that ship U.S. goods around the world. But most locks and dams, which allow grain-laden river barges to move between higher elevations and lower-lying waters, have outlived their intended 50-year lifespans, according to U.S. farm and industry groups.Sporadic breakdowns in river infrastructure add to transport costs of grain exporters like Cargill Inc.,             Archer Daniels Midland Co.       and             Bunge Ltd.       Additional costs resulting from idled boat crews and the need to shift more grain onto railroads add up.Grain exporters typically pass some of those costs on to farmers by way of lower prices paid per bushel of corn or soybeans. \u201cThe river sets the tone that domestic [crop] prices tend to feed off,\u201d said       Rick Calhoun,        who oversees barge operations for Cargill, the largest U.S. agricultural company by sales.Any unplanned long-term closings of certain locks on the Upper Mississippi or Illinois rivers could compound transport costs and result in a drop of as much as 21 cents for corn and 44 cents for soybeans in the per-bushel prices that grain companies pay to nearby farmers, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture research. Such closings could leave grain companies with less grain to market and reduce economic activity by up to $2.4 billion, according to the research.On the banks of the Ohio River on Wednesday, Mr. Trump highlighted the need to adequately fund the nation\u2019s aging locks and dams. \u201cTogether we will fix it,\u201d he said, though details on his plans remain scant. Mr. Trump echoed estimates by The Waterways Council Inc., a trade group for river-reliant shippers that has called for more spending on rivers infrastructure for years, and pegged the current backlog of high-priority maintenance at some $8.7 billion.The Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio rivers are most critical for barge transport of grain. Locks in the Pittsburgh area are among the nation\u2019s oldest, and facilities on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers also need maintenance, industry groups say. The La Grange lock and dam on the Illinois River is in dire need of rehabilitation, according to the Soybean Transport Coalition.Some grain companies have invested in rail facilities around St. Louis or further south so they have more options in case of problems on the upper river system.\u201cReliability is the really big concern we have,\u201d said       Mike Steenhoek,        executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, noting that crumbling concrete walls and rusty gate mechanisms are plain to see at locks in the Farm Belt. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before you have failure at one of these sites.\u201dCargill\u2019s Mr. Calhoun said while grain traders like Cargill aren\u2019t now systematically pricing in lock or dam failures on U.S. rivers, the threat of a 60- or 90-day closure looms. If such a breakdown were to hamper transport, it could slash the prices U.S. farmers get for their crops at a time when they already face sharply lower commodity prices and incomes.U.S. farm groups and agricultural conglomerates have complained about underinvestment in locks and dams for years while highways and airports have had priority for government funding. In late 2015, Congress authorized $405 million to upgrade locks and dams primarily on the Ohio River.Five years ago, drought in the Midwest led to low water levels on the Mississippi River south of St. Louis, exposing riverbed rocks that threatened barges hauling the autumn harvest. Grain companies had to run fewer barges carrying lighter loads down the river while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blasted the rocks away.Kenneth Hartman, an Illinois farmer based about 25 miles south of St. Louis, said per-bushel prices offered for his grain dropped by about 14% versus other parts of the state. Most local buyers of his crops, who ship them down the river, lowered the prices they were offering to compensate for the extra transport costs they faced during the emergency maintenance. \u201cFrankly, on the rivers we haven\u2019t done due diligence in keeping things up to speed like a farmer does,\u201d Mr. Hartman said.Added transport expenses also can make U.S. crops less competitive on global grain markets, where they are pitted against crops from ascendant farm powers like Russia and Brazil, whose land is cheaper and labor costs are lower. Export rivals from South America and Eastern Europe have eroded the U.S.\u2019s long-held agricultural dominance in global grain markets. U.S. exporters absorb some of the financial toll of inefficient transport. Meanwhile, significant delays undermine the perceived reliability of U.S.-grown crops, which could spur foreign-based livestock producers or food companies to seek steadier grain flows from other countries, agriculture officials say.U.S. farmers retain an edge on their overseas rivals when it comes to logistics\u2014for now. In Brazil, the cost to truck soybeans across the interior\u2014still the country\u2019s predominant means of transporting farm goods\u2014can range from $52 to $103 a metric ton, according to analysis by the United Soybean Board, compared with costs ranging from $21 to $30 a ton for truck, rail and barge transport in the U.S.But planned railroad and river projects in Brazil could cut transport costs nearly in half, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture projections, ratcheting up the competitiveness of Brazilian crops, when taking the country\u2019s typically weaker currency and cheaper land into account.Write to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com and Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Grain-Transport Costs Climb.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hyundai-u-s-sales-chief-departs-amid-sales-declines-1496849735", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:52:00", "news_title": "Hyundai U.S. Sales Chief Departs Amid Sales Declines ", "keywords": "declining,disappointing sales,hyundai motors,sales figures,u.s. sales chief,Hyundai Motor,005380.SE,Derrick Hatami,financial performance,earnings,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive", "content": "Hyundai Motor Co.\u2019s top U.S. sales executive resigned, the latest departure in the Korean auto maker\u2019s top American ranks during a string of disappointing sales results.Derrick Hatami,        the auto maker\u2019s vice president of national sales in the U.S., departed\u00a0Monday\u00a0for a \u201cposition outside the company,\u201d a Hyundai spokesman said. Hyundai has immediately begun searching for a successor while Sam Brnovich, the auto maker\u2019s southern regional general manager, \u201cwill support the overall sales organization,\u201d the spokesman said.Mr. Hatami\u2019s departure comes after Hyundai posted one of the industry\u2019s worst U.S. sales performances in May and months after the company\u2019s top American executive left.       Dave Zuchowski       headed Hyundai\u2019s U.S. operations for nearly three years before leaving in December amid stalling market share.Hyundai\u2019s U.S. sales plunged nearly 16% in May, and have fallen roughly 5% so far this year. The Korean auto maker has failed to keep pace with Americans\u2019 changing tastes over the past several years\u2014toward crossover wagons and larger sport-utility vehicles amid a run of low gasoline prices, said Adam Kraushaar, who chaired Hyundai\u2019s National Dealer Council until the end of 2016.The auto maker has also been selling too many vehicles to fleet customers such as rental-car agencies, a move that can ding residual values, Mr. Kraushaar said. \u201cThere\u2019s some instability at Hyundai and it\u2019s concerning,\u201d he said in an interview.Mr. Brnovich\u2019s \u201cmore than 30 years of experience in the industry will help us continue our momentum heading into the second half of the year,\u201d the Hyundai spokesman said, referring to Mr. Hatami\u2019s interim replacement. \u201cWe also have confidence in our entire sales organization to work hand-in-hand with Hyundai\u2019s dealer body to provide customers with industry-leading vehicles, technology and customer service.\u201d The spokesman added that Mr. Hatami \u201cserved the company well during his time as head of sales and we wish him nothing but success.\u201dMr. Kraushaar said over the past three years, Hyundai has been slow to respond to a changing U.S. market. A perfect storm of factors following the recession, including rising gas prices,             General Motors                   and Chrysler going through bankruptcy and a soft economy, led to Hyundai\u2019s gains in market share in a competitive U.S. market.Hyundai \u201cthought they had arrived,\u201d Mr. Kraushaar said. But after the economy began to recover and gas prices dropped, consumer preference shifted to crossovers, SUVs and pickups over sedans, which are Hyundai\u2019s traditional strength. Hyundai has struggled to maintain its momentum.Earlier this year, Hyundai\u2019s Chairman Chung Mong-koo said the auto maker and its affiliate             Kia Motors Corp.       will launch more than 10 new or revamped cars every year to meet changing consumer tastes.Although Hyundai\u2019s sales are slumping, the auto maker\u2019s commitment to the profitable U.S. market remains strong. At the beginning of the year, Hyundai said it would invest up to $3.1 billion in its existing U.S. manufacturing facilities and was considering building a new plant.Mr. Hatami was in his position as vice president of sales for just under two years, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before a brief stint at             Nissan Motor Corp.       from 2014 to 2015, he was with Hyundai for nearly a decade, holding various positions across the company.

Mr. Trump\u2019s June 14 speech will be followed the next day by a meeting with governors.\u201cThis is our best opportunity to address the skills gap that exists in the country and to address the student debt crisis that exists in the country,\u201d Mr. Cordish said. \u201cFour-year college is wonderful, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only option.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal last month would cut federal funding for work-study programs and eliminate funding for certain teacher-training initiatives as part of a 13.5% decrease next year in funding for the Education Department. It would also reduce funding nearly 40% for job-training programs administered by the Labor Department.Mr. Cordish said the cuts reflected the need to better organize some 31 workforce-training programs across 14 federal agencies. \u201cThe problem is accountability and effectiveness,\u201d he said.Mr. Cordish also said expanding apprenticeship programs and accreditation for vocational programs could be a \u201cbipartisan issue\u201d for Congress. He said the policy agenda would be a priority for Vice President       Mike Pence       and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, a senior adviser.\u201cWe have to open up accreditation so if you go to a technical school, you go to a community college, and you get a degree, that has to be something that\u2019s portable \u2026 just like a degree from a four-year university,\u201d Mr. Cordish said.Apprenticeships and other vocational training programs have been widely used in Germany and adopted in U.S. factories run by German manufacturers, including             BMW AG      ,             Volkswagen AG       and             Siemens AG      . They have received increased attention from U.S. business groups in recent years amid rising complaints over shortages of skilled workers.The Obama administration also promoted increased funding for apprenticeships as a part of a broader initiative to expand cost-free community college. Republican lawmakers said broadening community college access was an issue better left to state governments.But the Obama administration took a much tougher approach to regulating hundreds of for-profit colleges following a spate of recruiting scandals. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election last fall, shares of for-profit education companies rallied sharply on the hope that a more business-friendly Trump administration would take a largely hands-off approach to the industry.Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda to address worker retraining \u201cdoes involve expanding student aid so that it can be applied to vocational training and apprenticeship education without too much regulation stopping it,\u201d Mr. Cordish said Wednesday.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-rift-may-boost-extremism-germany-warns-1496837660", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:44:00", "news_title": "Qatar Rift May Boost Extremism, Germany Warns ", "keywords": " germany isis, islamic state, is terror attack, persian gulf diplomatic row,qatar saudi arabia spat,saudi qatar dispute, terrorism,Muslim Brotherhood,Sigmar Gabriel,Adel al-Jubeir,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics", "content": "Germany\u2019s foreign minister criticized Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries for isolating Qatar, saying the dispute could hurt the fight against terrorism and weighing in on a diplomatic break that is beginning to drive a wedge between the U.S. and some of its closest allies.Saudi Arabia and countries including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on Monday abruptly severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, citing the country\u2019s alleged support for religious extremism and its ties to Islamist groups like Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, which rules the Gaza strip.\u201cWe made clear that we in Germany and in Europe have a great interest for the situation in the Gulf region not to escalate,\u201d German Foreign Minister       Sigmar Gabriel       said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we can only win the fight against Islamic State when we stand side by side in the anti-IS coalition\u2026We are convinced that a dispute among partners and neighbors will in the end only make the wrong ones stronger.\u201dThe diplomatic rupture pits neighboring countries allied with the West against each other, complicating shared efforts to combat Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

In a series of messages on Twitter on Tuesday, Mr. Trump sided with Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and others and appeared to take credit for the move, which he said was aimed at countering extremist ideology and terror financing.\u201cI have never seen the U.S. taking sides like this,\u201d says       Ibrahim Fraihat,        professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar. \u201cIt raises questions on whether the U.S. could play a role as mediator.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments contradicted statements made by other top administration officials who called for dialogue, causing confusion on U.S. policy.A U.S. State Department official said Wednesday America\u2019s ties with Qatar remain strong and that it hopes the crisis will soon be resolved.\u201cWe are pressing the parties involved to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe continue to encourage the parties to resolve these differences quickly.\u201dLike Germany, Turkey - another close ally of both the U.S. and Qatar - has criticized the hard-line stance of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries against Qatar.\u201cWe disapprove of the sanctions against Qatar,\u201d Turkey\u2019s President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       said Tuesday. \u201cThis development, coming at a time when we need solidarity and cooperation more than ever, does not benefit any country in the region.\u201dTurkey is seeking to mediate the dispute as are two Gulf countries: Kuwait and Oman, who along with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional alliance whose future existence is now far from certain.Mr. Gabriel spoke Wednesday after meeting his Saudi counterpart, Adel al Jubeir. Addressing the press, the Saudi foreign minister reiterated Riyadh\u2019s position, saying Qatar had supported extremist organizations for years and failed to cooperate with its neighbors.\u201cWe have conducted these steps also in the interest of Qatar and in the interest of the region and in the interest of the security and stability of the region,\u201d Mr. al Jubeir said. \u201cWe hope that our brothers in Qatar will take the right steps to end this crisis.\u201dMr. Jubeir said that Saudi Arabia and the other countries that broke ties with Qatar don\u2019t seek an outside mediator, but that a possible resolution to the dispute should come through the Gulf Cooperation Council.Qatar has dismissed all allegations against it as baseless and called for dialogue to resolve the dispute.Speaking at an event in Berlin after his meeting with Mr. Gabriel, Mr. al Jubeir declined to outline the specific steps Saudi Arabia was demanding of its smaller neighbor.\u201cOur brothers in Qatar know what the demands are,\u201d the foreign minister told diplomats gathered at the conservative Konrad Adenauer Foundation. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s in the interest of the region to support extremist group, to incite via the media, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s supportive of stability in the region to try to destabilize countries\u2026 It is our hope our brothers in Qatar will recognize this.\u201d\u201cAfter a number of years you get to the point where you say: our patience as run out. We don\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d Mr. al Jubeir added.The diplomatic break also carries commercial implications for Qatar. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries closed air and sea routes to the tiny peninsula, which is heavily dependent on imports, including food. Qatar\u2019s only land border, with Saudi Arabia, is now also closed.Saudi Arabia cooperates closely with the West on counterterrorism and against Islamic State. But it has also drawn widespread criticism in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere for its past role in spreading radical ideologies and for not having done enough to stop terror financing.Mr. Gabriel said both Saudi Arabia and Qatar are countries whose practices in the past have worried Germany.\u201cWe have therefore a great interest for everyone in the anti-IS coalition to agree that there mustn\u2019t be any kind of financing of terrorist organizations,\u201d he added.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com and Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-is-losing-the-pacific-to-china-1496853380", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:36:00", "news_title": "The U.S. Is Losing the Pacific to China", "keywords": " alibaba, china, diplomacy, foreign investment, pacific islands, paypal, trade,vanuatu,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,building construction,leisure facility construction,construction,real estate", "content": "Port Vila, VanuatuAcross the Pacific islands, a quiet but determined chess game is being played for control of the region. Only one side, however, is competing in earnest. The other appears to be ceding ground without much of a fight.This is a new phenomenon. For more than 100 years, the U.S. has viewed the Pacific Ocean as an \u201cAmerican lake.\u201d But recently much has changed. The Philippines, long an American ally, has pivoted away to China, while the rest of the Pacific islands are also being wooed with Chinese diplomacy and investment.The U.S., meanwhile, has remained absent. Former President Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d has proved to be empty rhetoric. Today there is little evidence that the U.S. is putting any significant resources into the Pacific islands.President Trump has an opportunity to do something substantial here, but his office may be distracted by the Middle East, as has been the case with every prior administration.For the price of a single day\u2019s war in the Middle East, the U.S. could shore up its Western flank by courting the Pacific islands with investments in tourism and vital infrastructure while engaging meaningfully with its leaders. Instead, China is picking them off one by one.Where China has unleashed multibillion-dollar investments throughout the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, offering critical infrastructure projects, planeloads of tourists and access to financial inclusion, the U.S. has stayed silent. It continues to neglect its treaty allies in Micronesia and ignore the rest of the region.Palau is still waiting on $216 million in funds promised in 2011 as part of its agreement to provide the U.S. with exclusive military access. Similar frustrations may lead the Federated States of Micronesia to terminate its own treaty with the U.S. next year, well ahead of its expected 2023 expiration. And in American Samoa, one congresswoman is warning about the lack of defense capabilities, as well rising Chinese influence in Samoa. In Melanesia, China is focusing resources on Papua New Guinea and deploying diplomacy in Fiji.But the difference between Chinese and U.S. engagement is most stark in Vanuatu.Recently the Vanuatu government signed off on a deal with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation to upgrade the island\u2019s three main airfields. The focus will be extending Port Vila\u2019s Bauerfield, the capital\u2019s primary airport, to allow for direct flights from China by next year. Built by the U.S. Navy in 1942, Bauerfield is named after Lt. Col. Harold W. Bauer, a fighter pilot in the U.S. Marines shot down that year during the Battle of Guadalcanal. The Chinese will also upgrade Pakoa airfield in Santo, the island where a young James Michener was based during World War II before writing his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \u201cTales of the South Pacific.\u201dNo U.S. company tendered for either contract. In fact, there\u2019s no U.S. engagement in Vanuatu at all, not even a resident ambassador. Meanwhile, China has built the national Parliament, the prime minister\u2019s office, the foreign affairs building, the Melanesian Spearhead Group secretariat, a national convention center and a national stadium.The quid pro quo? Vanuatu was the first Pacific nation to support China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea, soon followed by Nauru and Papua New Guinea.The region has also been shut out by online commerce.             PayPal,       Visa and other U.S. financial companies don\u2019t recognize any Pacific island nations. But       Jack Ma\u2019s            Alibaba Group                   recently sent representatives to help get Vanuatu and all the other Pacific nations onto his e-commerce platforms, including Tmall and Alipay.If the U.S. offers no aid, no investment, no infrastructure and no access to e-commerce platforms at a time when China is offering all of the above, is it any surprise that Pacific island governments and their people are turning to China?Unless Washington starts in earnest to engage the Pacific islands\u2014vital bases during World War II\u2014its lack of investment, diplomacy and financial inclusion will inevitably see the region swing to China. The U.S. will have ceded the entire board, one piece of the Pacific at a time.Mr. Bohane is a photojournalist, author and television producer who has covered Asia and the Pacific islands for the past 25 years."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/santander-buys-banco-popular-after-ecb-determined-rival-was-likely-to-fail-1496818501", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:35:00", "news_title": "Santander Buys Banco Popular for \u20ac1 After Rival Deemed \u2018Likely to Fail\u2019", "keywords": "banco popular, bank rescue, bank resolution in europe,ecb, ecb, eurozone banking, eurozone banks, italy,santander, single resolution mechanism,spain, spanish banking, troubled banks in europe,Banco Santander S.A.,SAN,Banco Popular Espanol,POP.MC,Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol,European Union,Banco Popular,ES:SAN,Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A.,ES:BBVA,Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena,Ana Bot\u00edn,corporate funding,share capital,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,banking,central banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks", "content": "MADRID\u2014            Banco Santander SA        SAN -1.12%       has acquired Spanish rival Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol SA in an overnight auction for the nominal amount of \u20ac1 ($1.13) after the European Central Bank determined the ailing lender was near collapse, providing a test of Europe\u2019s banking rules enacted after the financial crisis.The overnight rescue of Banco Popular marks a swift and decisive response by the European Union to stop the downward spiral of Spain\u2019s most troubled big bank.While the Spanish banking sector is largely healthy, Banco Popular has proved a weak link. The lender\u2019s balance sheet is weighed down by around \u20ac37 billion in foreclosures and other nonperforming assets accumulated since the country\u2019s real-estate boom went bust.The sale of Banco Popular also marks the first major move by the Single Resolution Board, the European body charged with dealing with failing banks and ensuring that taxpayer money doesn\u2019t go to bailing out troubled lenders.Instead, shareholders and junior debtholders are in line for losses, along with holders of contingent convertible debt, also known as CoCos, which European authorities have encouraged banks to issue in recent years.Lenders across the region, including Banco Popular, have used this kind of debt to raise billions of euros of capital. The securities pay coupons like normal bonds, but convert to shares if the bank\u2019s capital ratios sink below a certain level, thus making them the first bondholders to be wiped out in a bank failure. Analysts said the rescue could lead investors to demand greater premiums on bonds issued by European banks struggling with soured loans or low provisions.The Single Resolution Board\u2019s initiative in Spain follows criticism that Italy last month sidestepped Europe\u2019s new rules by using a loophole to approve the injection of public money into troubled lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.Banco Popular has been floundering for months though in recent weeks its crisis deepened as investors became increasingly concerned it wouldn\u2019t be able to sell assets, raise capital or find a buyer.Like other troubled lenders in Italy, Portugal and Greece and elsewhere in Europe, the bank hasn\u2019t been able to generate strong enough profits to help shore up its balance sheet. Banco Popular\u2019s share price had plummeted more than 50% in the past week alone.The ECB had become increasingly concerned about the deterioration of Banco Popular\u2019s finances, before determining on Tuesday \u201cthat the bank was failing or likely to fail,\u201d according to a statement.After recent attempts by Banco Popular to find a buyer in a private sale failed, EU banking authorities launched a rapid-fire auction Tuesday night, with Santander emerging as the buyer early Wednesday morning, Santander Executive Chairman Ana Bot\u00edn said. She declined to say how many other banks were involved in the auction.One of the banks invited to the Tuesday auction was Spain\u2019s         Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,       people familiar with the process said separately. But Spain\u2019s No. 2 bank by market value decided against bidding for Banco Popular, those people added.\u201cOur approach is to turn the bank into a digital house, so when we look at a physical asset like Popular, we are extremely demanding on pricing,\u201d BBVA Chairman Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez said at an event in Madrid. The sale, he added, was \u201cgood news from the economic point of view because there was a problem in the system and that problem was fixed.\u201dThe rescue imposed steep losses on junior bondholders and wiped out shareholders, while senior bondholders were spared.Questions remain over whether senior debtors will necessarily be off the hook in future bank rescues if a buyer isn\u2019t found, for instance, or if the rescued lender is in worse shape than Banco Popular. \u201cThere will be occasions when senior debt will suffer,\u201d said       John Raymond,        an analyst with CreditSights in London.The transaction also spared taxpayers, fulfilling a major objective of EU banking rules that were enacted after a number of European governments used public money to shore up teetering banks during the financial crisis.A private solution for a teetering bank \u201cis great news for Europe,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn said during a news conference in Madrid. \u201cThis is a strictly private operation.\u201d The speed with which Banco Popular was rescued belies the image of EU institutions as lumbering and inefficient, Ms. Bot\u00edn said.The assertiveness by the European authorities in the Spanish case may quiet some criticism of how they have handled the Italian banking crisis. However, it remains to be seen how the new banking regime responds to situations more complicated than that of the Banco Popular, where authorities had a financially sound buyer in Santander and the Spanish banking sector is generally in rude health.The combination of Banco Popular and Santander creates Spain\u2019s largest bank, with 17 million customers, leapfrogging rivals             Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA       and             CaixaBank SA      . Santander also acquired Banco Popular\u2019s unit in Portugal, where Santander has a large market share. Santander, which was already one of Europe\u2019s largest lenders, now plans to raise \u20ac7 billion in a rights issue before the end of summer to fund a cleanup of Banco Popular\u2019s balance sheet. Santander shares closed down 0.9% in Madrid.Santander can benefit from Banco Popular\u2019s strong franchise in lending to Spain\u2019s small- and medium-size businesses. Spanish banks have tried to boost their loans to small- and medium-size companies as their bread-and-butter business of selling mortgages has been less robust amid Spain\u2019s economic recovery from a deep crisis.Santander said the transaction is expected to generate a return on investment of 13% to 14% in 2020 and would boost earnings a share by 2019.Santander will book \u20ac7.9 billion in provisions for Banco Popular\u2019s nonperforming assets. That will increase coverage for real-estate assets and nonperforming loans to 69% from 45%, which was the lowest coverage ratio among major Spanish banks.Citigroup Inc.       advised Santander. Jefferies International Ltd. and Spain\u2019s Arcano Partners advised the Spanish bank bailout fund known as FROB, which helped orchestrate the rescue.\u2014Julia-Ambra Verlaine and Ben Dummett contributed to this article.Write to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Santander Buys Rival For 1 Euro In Rescue.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hatch-optimistic-on-gop-tax-agreement-but-no-answer-yet-on-rates-revenue-1496846179", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:24:00", "news_title": "Hatch Optimistic on GOP Tax Agreement But No Answer Yet on Rates, Revenue ", "keywords": " donald trump, house republicans, republican party, republicans,taxes, tax plan, tax reform, white house,Orrin Hatch,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Finance Committee Chairman       Orrin Hatch       said he has no set target for tax rates or tax revenue as lawmakers struggle with what tax breaks to curtail in their rewrite of the tax code.While the Trump administration seeks a 15% corporate tax rate and House Republicans call for a 20% tax rate, down from the current 35%, Mr. Hatch remained circumspect. He said only that he wants to get tax rates as low as possible.\u201cUntil we perform the surgery and start eliminating preferences and credits in order to bring down rates\u2014and get official feedback from the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2014we cannot speak definitively on the rate targets,\u201d he said in a speech at a conference\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cAnd, of course, we have to see just where our members are going to object to the removal of certain tax provisions because, once again, our margin of error with regard to the vote total is very slim.\u201dMr. Hatch, a Utah Republican, said he was optimistic that Republicans would be able to overcome their internal differences and he said lawmakers agreed on about 80% of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. Republicans, who control the House, Senate and White House, are aiming for the most significant rewrite of the tax system since 1986 and they say they will complete their work this year.So far, however, the administration has offered a one-page outline and the biggest revenue-raising changes in the House plan are under fierce political attack.Mr. Hatch said he thought the administration and House Republicans would move off of their rate goals to get a bill signed into law.\u201cI think we\u2019re making some serious headway toward a workable framework,\u201d said the Senate\u2019s longest-serving Republican, whose committee is in charge of tax policy. \u201cThere are some unresolved issues, but, in my view, they are far from insurmountable.\u201dOne of those disagreements is the House proposal to include a border adjustment in the corporate tax, exempting exports and taxing imports. Mr. Hatch said that plan would have a hard time getting through the Senate, citing industries that are \u201capoplectic\u201d about it and objections from GOP senators. But Mr. Hatch that he was willing to hear more details once House Republicans write them.Mr. Hatch said he was willing to hear more details once House Republicans write them, but he also said that a plan that can\u2019t attract 51 senators is a \u201cwaste of time.\u201dMr. Hatch also said he wasn\u2019t necessarily wedded to the idea of having the tax plan be revenue-neutral\u2014that is, raising as much money as the current system does. Although he expressed a preference for bipartisan cooperation, he also acknowledged that Republicans may go it alone, using procedures that would allow for a simple-majority vote.Even that would be challenging because of differences among Republicans, who have 52 seats in the Senate and disagreements among themselves. He cited some \u201cbudget hawks\u201d among Republicans who are wary of deeper budget deficits.\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t see a problem with a tax-reform proposal that loses revenue in the short term if we can show that it will help our economy on a better growth path,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cBut, like I said, we\u2019ll need to see where the votes are.\u201dThe Trump administration has backed both revenue-neutral plans and promised large tax cuts. Key congressional leaders\u2014including House Speaker       Paul Ryan       and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2014have backed a revenue-neutral approach, after assuming additional revenue that would be generated because of the tax cuts.Rep. Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he still hoped for a bipartisan approach, noting that lawmakers agree generally on the problems in the tax system.But, in a speech at the same conference, he warned against repeating anything like the tax cuts signed by President       George W. Bush       in 2001 and 2003.\u201cApparently,\u201d Mr. Neal said, \u201cdeficits only matter when there\u2019s a Democratic president.\u201dWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/glassy-los-angeles-home-seeks-44-million-1496852680", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:24:00", "news_title": "Glassy Los Angeles Home Seeks $44 Million", "keywords": "doheny estates, geofencing,jean-jacques allouche,los angeles ,luxury homes, luxury real estate,mansions,paul lester,stradella ,political,general news,personal finance,real estate,property,buying,selling a home,construction", "content": "A just-finished 12,000-square-foot, modernist home in the exclusive Doheny Estates of Los Angeles will list for $44 million.The home, a glassy, three-level spread with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, sits on a 0.8-acre bluff overlooking the ocean, according to listing agent       Paul Lester       of the Agency.

If you get on a \u2018RapCaviar,\u2019 it\u2019s like being on 100 stations around the world.\u201dIn late 2014, Billboard began counting streams on digital-music services towards album-chart rankings. That encouraged rappers to release music officially and commercially instead of on \u201cmixtape\u201d sites such as Datpiff.com\u2014turning hip-hop into a major generator of No. 1 hits, blockbuster albums and streaming royalties, critics say.Before the late 1990s, record labels used to spend lavishly to develop artist careers, but such outlays became tougher once the music industry was undermined by piracy in the digital era. Instead of grooming artists from the ground up, labels now often sign acts with big social-media followings that can immediately draw fans to albums and live shows.By contrast, Mr. Liles, 49, known in the business for his radio-promotion prowess, says he gives artists time to build an audience and a style. 300 Entertainment helps manage and promote musicians, sifting through reams of data from Spotify to more efficiently book tours and allocate marketing dollars.When promoting acts, Mr. Liles doesn\u2019t go straight to big radio stations or Spotify\u2019s most popular playlists, such as \u201cRapCaviar,\u201d with 6.9 million followers. He says he takes the slow approach, getting songs in clubs and more specialized playlists, to build a compelling narrative for the artist. In addition to running 300 Entertainment, he manages artists, including D\u2019Angelo and Trey Songz.Migos, Young Thug and Fetty Wap make \u201ctrap music,\u201d a melodic, anti-commercial subgenre of rap from the South that\u2019s transforming pop music, critics say. New Jersey, where Fetty Wap is based, isn\u2019t a traditional area to spot hip-hop talent, says Tuma Basa, global programming head of hip-hop at Spotify, who oversees \u201cRapCaviar.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re keeping their ears to the street,\u201d he says.300 Entertainment has deep pockets in the technology, financial and music industries. Besides Google, the firm has big Wall Street investors such as former hedge fund manager Noam Gottesman and his investment firm TOMS Capital LLC.Mr. Cohen, who left 300 Entertainment in December to become global head of music at Google\u2019s YouTube, remains 300 Entertainment\u2019s biggest individual investor and a powerful ally.This year, YouTube will add artist and record-label promotional activities to the algorithm it uses to suggest to users which music videos to watch next. Besides 300 Entertainment, Google has invested in Kobalt, a music-services company that is an alternative to major labels.The music business has long viewed YouTube\u2014the world\u2019s biggest de facto music-streaming service\u2014as an enemy, accusing it of paying insufficient royalties. Given the iciness between YouTube and major labels, Mr. Cohen\u2019s 25-year-long friendship with Mr. Liles gives 300 an undoubted advantage. \u201cI had enough time with them that they understood the blueprint\u2014now they\u2019re in execution mode,\u201d Mr. Cohen says.\u201cOne of the first things that got jettisoned in the two decades of [music-business] decline was the artist development process,\u201d Mr. Cohen says. \u201cWe hired artist-development people before we did promotion people.\u201dIn music, 300 partnered with Quality Control, an influential Atlanta rap label that formed in 2013 and has been cultivating the whimsical Migos and 19-year-old Lil Yachty. For distribution, there\u2019s a deal with Warner Music Group, where Mr. Liles previously worked with Mr. Cohen. \u201cWe have the mindset of an indie and the muscle of a major,\u201d Mr. Liles says.The rest of 2017 will be busy: Fetty Wap and Young Thug are releasing albums soon and a new Detroit rapper, Tee Grizzley, is gathering steam. 300 Entertainment is also expanding into other genres with artists such as rock band Highly Suspect and dance-pop act Cheat Codes.\u201cI want to build a story, using playlists, and then use that to translate into terrestrial radio,\u201d Mr. Liles says. \u201cWhen you have art, you have to allow it to make it to the Smithsonian\u2014not just the street corner.\u201dWrite to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/planetarium-review-musicians-look-to-the-stars-1496852594", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:23:00", "news_title": "\u2018Planetarium\u2019 Review: Musicians Look to the Stars", "keywords": "arts in review, bryce dessner, james mcalister, music, nico muhly,planetarium, sufjan stevens,Bryce Dessner,James McAlister,Nico Muhly,Sufjan Stevens,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,reviews", "content": "If you were the singer-songwriter       Sufjan Stevens,        and your best-known works were grand, pop song cycles about individual states\u2014\u201cGreetings From Michigan\u2014The Great Lakes State\u201d (2003) and \u201cCome Feel the Illinoise\u201d (2005)\u2014where would you look for a larger canvas and bigger challenges? Whole countries? Maybe, that isn\u2019t a huge leap. The universe? The hubris required might be too great;       Charles Ives,        after all, labored over his \u201cUniverse\u201d Symphony for nearly two decades, and left it unfinished. But the solar system is both promising and manageable, even if the concept already yielded a symphonic evergreen,       Gustav Holst\u2019s       seven-movement suite, \u201cThe Planets\u201d (1916).Mr. Stevens had occasion to consider the question in 2011, when       Nico Muhly,        a composer known for his inviting orchestral and choral music, but who also dabbles in DJ\u2019ing and electronica, was commissioned to write a new work for Muziekgebouw Frits Philips Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, and invited Mr. Stevens,       Bryce Dessner       (a guitarist in the National, and also an increasingly prolific classical composer) and       James McAlister       (a percussionist and composer of electronic beats) to collaborate.Their piece, \u201cPlanetarium,\u201d drew on all their strengths, with shapely themes and a broad palette of electronic textures contributed by all four, adorned with lyrics and vocals by Mr. Stevens; subtle and consistently graceful guitar lines by Mr. Dessner; Mr. Muhly\u2019s string, brass and keyboard orchestration; and Mr. McAlister\u2019s tactile, layered beats.After touring with the work (complete with a laser show and projected NASA images) in 2012 and 2013, the quartet recorded the music and filed it away. But it nagged at them, as unfinished business, and in 2016 they reconvened to finish the recordings. They ended up reworking the music considerably. Now a 17-movement score that accounts for all nine planets (Pluto still rates), with additional tone paintings inspired by the sun and moon, the Kuiper Belt and black energy, as well as a handful of electronic linking pieces, the recorded version of \u201cPlanetarium\u201d is due from the 4AD label on June 9.Holst is a ghostly presence here, though none of \u201cThe Planets\u201d is quoted, even obliquely. Where Holst chose not to portray Earth, Mr. Muhly and company made \u201cEarth\u201d their longest, most texturally varied and intricately structured movement. But like Holst, these composers were as concerned with the attributes of the Greek and Roman deities for which the planets were named as with the celestial bodies themselves, and Mr. Stevens\u2019s thoughtful, poetic lyrics are suffused with mythological references, interwoven with strands of biblical and modern imagery and concerns.Mr. Stevens sings to the gods in these songs, and some sing back. Mars, for example, describes himself as the god of war, in assertive music with gritty brass and dramatic percussion; but he also muses on love, peace, forgiveness and trust, and implies that the choice is ours: \u201cI reside in every creature / dispose of the future / or put away your sword.\u201d Saturn describes himself as a melancholy contrarian: \u201cWhere there\u2019s light, I bring you darkness / Where there\u2019s health, I bring affliction / Where there\u2019s hope, I bring misfortune.\u201dJust as Holst\u2019s richly Romantic score is thoroughly of its time, so is this quartet\u2019s, drawing as it does on looped dance beats, pop song structures and harmonies, robotically processed vocal timbres, ambient synthesizer washes, and sound effects rich in pop culture \u201cspace music\u201d associations\u2014among them, a nod to       Paddy Kingsland\u2019s       electronic score for the 1981 BBC production of \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d (in \u201cPluto\u201d) and R2-D2 bleeps, whistles and clicks (in \u201cKuiper Belt\u201d).These pieces embrace so many disparate musical languages that at first they seem not to quite gel. But the more you hear Mr. Stevens\u2019s beautifully shaped vocal lines morph into electronic dreamscapes, pounding dance beats and monumental orchestral figures, the clearer it becomes that the interplay of these musicians\u2019 styles\u2014and the sheer audacity of the juxtapositions, with their confluences and stark oppositions\u2014gives \u201cPlanetarium\u201d a peculiarly satisfying coherence that keeps pulling you back into its orbit.\u2014Mr. Kozinn writes about music for the Journal."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-secretary-says-final-review-of-fiduciary-rule-in-motion-1496852318", "news_time": "2017-06-07 12:18:00", "news_title": "Labor Secretary Says Final Review of Fiduciary Rule in Motion", "keywords": "financial advise,labor secretary,retirement planning,retirement saving,trump budget,wealth adviser,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management", "content": "Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       said Wednesday that the first step has been taken in deciding the fate of a landmark retirement-savings rule that goes into partial effect this Friday.Mr. Acosta, at a congressional hearing on President       Donald Trump\u2019s       budget proposal, said the Office of Management and Budget put out a request for information Wednesday morning on the fiduciary rule. The OMB is the gatekeeper in the rule-making\u2014and rule-changing\u2014process.The OMB didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\u201cThat is the first step,\u201c Mr. Acosta said. \u201dWe need that information and data in order to decide how to proceed.\u201dMr. Acosta said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month that the so-called fiduciary rule\u2014which aims to eliminate conflicts in financial advice and ensure that brokers put the interests of retirement savers first\u2014wouldn\u2019t be further delayed. The Labor Department had pushed back the regulation\u2019s April 10 implementation deadline by 60 days, to June 9, after Mr. Trump called for a re-evaluation of the rule with an eye toward revision or repeal.Mr. Acosta on Wednesday elaborated on the rationale behind his decision to let the heart of the rule\u2014a best-interest standard of care required of stewards of retirement savings\u2014kick in even as the review stretches on.\u201cWe looked very carefully whether we could postpone it,\u201d Mr. Acosta said. \u201cWhen a rule is adopted the executive branch cannot just postpone implementation of that rule: You need a new rule to change the old rule.\u201d\u201cNo one in government should be able to snap their fingers and undo laws,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s not how democracy works.\u201dLetting the best-interest standard become effective this week doesn\u2019t preclude modifications or an outright repeal of the fiduciary rule, but it does effectively make the spirit of the regulation harder to reverse down the line, observers have said.

Mr. Comey said he worried the dinner was intended to \u201ccreate some sort of patronage relationship.\u201dThe president has denied he asked for a loyalty pledge, but said he inquired whether he was a target of the investigation.FEBRUARY:\u2022 In another conversation, the president expressly asked Mr. Comey to ease off the investigation of former national security adviser       Mike Flynn\u2019s       Russian contacts, Mr. Comey said in his statement. The president denies that.\u2022 Sen.       Richard Burr       and Rep.       Devin Nunes,        the Republican chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, which are running independent investigations into Russian interference, phone reporters after the White House urged them to counter media stories about the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russian officials.\u2022 White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus pushed FBI Deputy Director       Andrew McCabe,        and later Mr. Comey, to deny the accuracy of news stories about contacts between Russian officials and Trump campaign aides and advisers, a White House official confirmed. They both refused.MARCH:\u2022 An unidentified source in the White House gave classified intelligence information to Mr. Nunes in an attempt to widen the scope of the investigation to include actions taking by the Obama administration, according to people familiar with a White House visit by Mr. Nunes. Mr. Nunes said the material he viewed showed that the name of an associate of Mr. Trump was unmasked in a classified report.\u2022 The president pressed Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director       Mike Rogers       to make public statements exonerating his campaign of collusion with Russia, according to people familiar with those requests.Mr. Coats, in Senate testimony, declined to comment on the reports: \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president,\u201d he said. Mr. Rogers also hasn\u2019t commented.\u2022 Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump called him on March 30 to tell him he had nothing to do with Russia, and asked him what could be done to \u201clift the cloud\u201d and \u201cget out\u201d the fact that the president wasn\u2019t being investigated.APRIL:\u2022 Mr. Nunes steps down as head of the House Russia investigation under pressure after it is revealed that the White House was the source of his information about the Obama administration\u2019s surveillance of foreign officials in the U.S. The House probe is handed off to Rep.       Mike Conaway,        a Texas Republican with a history of conducting difficult investigations.MAY:\u2022 Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey, saying the FBI director did a bad job and that he considered him a \u201cshowboat.\u201d\u2022 In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey had assured him that he wasn\u2019t under investigation during the January dinner and in two phone calls. \u201cI actually asked him,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cI said, if it\u2019s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation?\u201d\u2022 In the same interview, Mr. Trump said \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d was on his mind when he fired Mr. Comey. The president also said he was frustrated that the investigation wasn\u2019t wrapped up but that he wanted it to be done \u201cabsolutely properly.\u201d\u2022 The next day, Mr. Trump told Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting that firing Mr. Comey was a relief. \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off,\u201d he said, according to a New York Times report.

He speaks Latin well enough to correct adults on their pronunciation.\u201cIt\u2019s Kicker-o,\u201d he says of the Roman orator. \u201dPeople always make the mistake. Like it\u2019s French or something.\u201dLatin and Ancient Greek, once the purview of elite private and Catholic schools, are showing up in public school classrooms across the country. From 2000 to 2016, the number of students taking the National Latin Exam, has increased roughly 30% to 142,271 from 110,015, according to Clement Testing Services. Nevada and New Mexico showed the biggest recent growth.Its popularity is spurred by shifting cultural tastes.       Percy Jackson       and Harry Potter have made Greek myths and Latinate spells cool. Spoken Latin, once a rarity outside the Vatican, has become all the rage. Students can geek out in Certamen contests, which are fast-paced jeopardy-like competitions about ancient civilizations. Parents are drawn to the rigor of the classical languages, where memorization is emphasized, and dissecting grammar and sentence structure can help with standardized tests.Nava Cohen,        Faiyaz\u2019s Latin teacher at Decatur, starts kindergartners off with songs. This year she translated \u201cOn Top of Spaghetti\u201d into Latin. As she introduces grammar and vocabulary she brings in the classics. In first grade they read simplified versions of the \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey.\u201d In second grade they start the \u201cAeneid.\u201d By third grade her students are \u201cmythology experts,\u201d she says.\u201cPercy Jackson is the single greatest thing to happen to this profession,\u201d she says.Modern takes on old myths help students tie the past to the present, says Ms. Cohen. As they have for generations, teachers vary the classroom work\u2014they teach       Julius Caesar\u2019s       military diaries, but also the racy love poems of Catullus. History and culture are taught hand-in-hand with noun declensions.\u201cRome was just such a powerful thing,\u201d says Faiyaz. \u201cBut it got to one point in history where it fell apart. I was shocked by that. An empire could just fall apart.\u201dFaiyaz wants to be scientist when he grows up.\u201cI am going to be a microbiologist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Greeks developed epidemiology.\u201dAt Washington Latin, a charter school in Washington, D.C., for grades five through 12 all students must take at least three years of Latin.\u201cLatin is an equalizer because we all start out from zero,\u201d says       Bill Clausen,        head of the humanities department.Some parents wonder if Spanish or Mandarin would be more practical because they are spoken in the world today, but middle school Latin has benefits, especially for students from less-advantaged backgrounds, says Mr. Clausen. It give them a sense of pride, he says.He says that when students learn Latin, they can quickly expand their vocabularies and use it to decipher SAT words and words in other languages. Latin also helps students break down English sentences into their grammatical components, a skill that is not often taught in English classrooms anymore.Caleb Tucker,        in fifth grade at Washington Latin, likes to greet people with a handshake and a rousing \u201cSalve.\u201d He has been at the school for a year and is astonished by how hard the language is.\u201cSome nights I have 17 words to memorize,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard, but I like it. I like it because it\u2019s hard.\u201dDespite the difficulty, the middle school classrooms at Washington Latin aren\u2019t rigid or stressed. Seventh grade teacher       Adam LaFleche       throws a red ball to students who holler out principal parts of verbs when he or she catches it. \u201cNolo! Nolle! Nolui!\u201d If a child misses the answer, Mr. LaFleche waits until they find it, and usually they do.\u201cSome professions, like nursing, require an insane amount of memorization,\u201d says Mr. LaFleche. \u201cYou have to know how to study for that.\u201dYoung children memorize Latin more easily than older children, which can benefit them in high school. Washington Latin has a teacher who will conduct an entire high-school class in Latin.The memorized ancient prose can come in handy later in life as well.       Alexa Hirschfeld,        33, studied Classics at Harvard before going on to co-found online stationery company Paperless Post. She studied Latin and Greek throughout high school in part to give her an edge in college admission, but also because she loves Sappho and Homer. The rigors of learning Ancient Greek helped prepare her for both entrepreneurship and understanding computer coding languages, she says.\u201cI liked the inaccessibility of it. The decoding. It\u2019s like an excavation.\u201dWhen dealing with a problem, she often thinks of the first book in the \u201cAeneid,\u201d in which Aeneas is speaking to his shipwrecked followers: \u201cMaybe someday you will rejoice to recall even this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing to think about when you are in a crisis,\u201d she says.Write to Nina Sovich at nina.sovich@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   History and culture are taught with noun declensions, not with verb declensions as was incorrectly stated in an earlier version of this article.

They bring back bags of jeans, haberdashery and car parts to a Communist island starved of consumer goods.\u201cThe Cubans are flooding in without speaking a word of Russian just to stock up,\u201d said Ricardo Trieto, a Russian-educated Cuban engineer who now translates for compatriot shoppers in Moscow\u2019s flea markets. \u201cIt\u2019s very profitable: Whatever you buy here you can sell it for more at home.\u201dThe U.S. trade embargo with Cuba remains in place despite the fact that President       Barack Obama       loosened restrictions for Americans to travel to Cuba last year and opened a U.S. Embassy in Havana in 2015 after more than half a century of severed ties. President       Donald Trump       has said he would roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s Cuban initiatives. All of this has helped revive a very Cold War-sounding trading relationship between Russia and Cuba.Consider the need for car parts in Cuba. Given the U.S. trade embargo, most cars in Cuba are either American-made cars from the 1950s or Soviet-era jalopies. The square-shaped models of Ladas and Nivas all but disappeared from Moscow\u2019s streets years ago.In Cuba, they are still going strong. Well, when they don\u2019t break down and need new parts, the shortage of which can produce some spectacular profits.In Moscow, a 1980 Moskvich\u2014another boxy offering from the Soviet era\u2014 might fetch around $500. In embargoed Cuba, it can go for as much as $14,000, Cuban taxi drivers say, fueling a booming cottage industry specializing in cannibalized car parts for the Caribbean island.At the sprawling Yuznii Port used-car market in southern Moscow, traders say up to 40% of the business comes from Cuban shoppers. \u201cWe would\u2019ve gone broke without them,\u201d said trader Timur Muradian.On a gray winter morning, a dozen Cubans dressed in ill-fitting beanie hats and gray puffer jackets walked around the market\u2019s metal containers filled with rusty car parts.\u00a0Several extra layers of clothing and skin darker than most locals easily gave them away to traders, who wooed them with shouts of \u201chola, amigo.\u201d\u201cI can buy anything I want here; it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Alejandro, who flew from Havana for the first time to buy tractor parts.Waving hands and typing into calculators with frozen fingers, the Cubans haggled over prices in the thousands of dollars for heaps of what most locals would consider useless scrap. \u201cThey buy up everything for Russian cars and tractors by weight, without even looking at what parts and models they are for,\u201d said Mr. Muradian. \u201cWhatever it is, they\u2019ll be able to sell it at a profit at home.\u201dA typical group of Cubans spends $3,000 to $7,000 in the market, stall owners say. These are astronomical sums for residents of an island where the average wage is $25 a month.Back in Cuba, whole villages chip in to send an envoy on shopping trips to Moscow, often using remittances from relatives in Miami or Madrid. Residents of the Rodas village in Cuba\u2019s central sugar belt said their cane would rot in the fields without an annual trip to Moscow to buy parts for their 1970s Soviet tractors.Some of the workers in this cottage trading industry are part of the tens of thousands of Cubans who went to the former Soviet Union as students. They studied engineering, medicine and science and returned to develop their Communist homeland. But when the Soviet Union and its subsidies collapsed in 1991, they often found themselves working as waiters and security guards for minimum wage.Soviet-educated Cuban engineer Raul Curo came back to live in Russia several years ago. He bought a taxi and became part of Moscow\u2019s booming Cuban expatriate community, servicing shoppers from the island. Mr. Curo meets Cubans in the airport and drives them around the city\u2019s flea markets, helping to translate and haggle.\u201cEveryone loves Cubans here. It\u2019s been like this since Khrushchev,\u201d Mr. Curo said, referring to the Soviet leader who risked nuclear Armageddon by striking an alliance with Cuba in the 1960s and deploying missiles there.During the low season, translator Mr. Trieto makes money giving Spanish lessons to Azerbaijani and Armenian stall owners in the city\u2019s flea markets. Others make ends meet giving salsa lessons in Moscow night spots such as Old Havana.Most Cuban shoppers come to Moscow for about a week and spend whole days trawling the city\u2019s flea markets to collect the 260 pounds worth of goods they are allowed on the plane for a fee.They borrow boots and parkas from friends and family and sleep on double-bunks in crammed Soviet-era apartments owned by Cuban expatriates. \u201cI\u2019ve never been this cold in my life, but I\u2019m getting used to it,\u201d said shopper Abelito. He said his first purchase was the warmest jacket he could find on the entire 150 acres of the Sadovod flea market.At the entrance of Lyublino\u2019s budget Moskva shopping center is a Cuban canteen adorned with pictures of the island\u2019s lush rolling hills and a photo of President Vladimir Putin with the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The Cuban cook serves up cheap homemade dishes of rice, beans and shredded pork.The shopping center offers a translation service and Cuban immigrants work in the center\u2019s cheap jewelry stalls. An Azerbaijani stall owner haggled in broken Spanish with a group of Cubans over a stack of jeans on a recent visit.\u201cThey basically live in the bazaar,\u201d said taxi driver Mr. Curo of his compatriot shoppers. \u201cThey came, they bought up, and they left. In a couple of months, they are back.\u201d\u2014Dmitry Filonov contributed to this article.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Where Do Cuban Tourists Go to Splurge?

The deal, which will allow Bebe the option to use the facility through Dec. 31, is expected to close in July.In addition, Bebe said it signed a deal with GBG USA Inc., to sell and transfer certain inventory and purchase orders related to its website and international wholesale business for $5 million.These deals are a part of a series of steps Bebe has taken to stave off a bankruptcy filing, a route many of its peers have taken recently.Bebe also publicly announced it reached agreements with substantially all of its store landlords to terminate existing leases for a lump sum $65 million payment. The Wall Street Journal reported late Tuesday the Bebe negotiations with landlords had come to a successful close.Last month Bebe announced it would permanently close its roughly 180 stores. Liquidators Tiger Capital Group LLC and             Great American Group                   LLC are working to run the chain\u2019s going-out-of-business sales. The retailer earlier announced it is working with B. Riley & Co. to help explore strategic options.To help make this payment to landlords possible, Bebe took on a $35 million loan from Great American\u2019s GACP Finance Co., which is slated to mature in May 2018. Bebe will use the proceeds from sales of its Benicia warehouse or Los Angeles design center toward repaying the loan and making interest payments, according to the SEC filing.Bebe\u2019s brand name and website will also live on through a joint venture agreement with Bluestar Alliance LLC, which it had signed last year. The company previously said in public filings that it intended to transfer its domain name, social media accounts and international wholesale agreements to Bluestar.The Brisbane, Calif.-based retailer has felt the pressure of declining mall foot traffic as consumers shift to online shopping. The move has not only pushed retailers toward discounts that eat away at profit margins, but for many, filing for chapter 11 protection.While the retailer had thrived in the early 2000s because of its signature fitted and revealing clothing, its popularity waned as trends shifted toward more subtle looks. The company previously announced its net sales for the quarter ending April 1 dropped to $65.7 million, compared with about $80 million for the same quarter last year.For many retailers, with filing chapter 11 protection comes a liquidation of a large portion or all of their stores. Recently Sports Authority Holdings Co., Limited Stores Co., American Apparel LLC and The Wet Seal Inc. have been among the retailers to permanently shut their doors. Meanwhile, retailers rue 21 Inc. and Payless ShoeSource Inc., which sought chapter 11 protection in recent months, are seeking to only close a portion of their stores and reorganize around the better-performing locations.However, Bebe has set itself apart from these retailers in finding a way to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection and cutting deals with its landlords, a group of creditors that often raise issues in chapter 11 filings.Bebe shares were trading up nearly 13% to $5.70 on Wednesday.Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095", "news_time": "2017-06-07 11:24:00", "news_title": "\u2018I\u2019m Not Sure I Understand\u2019\u2014How Apple\u2019s Siri Lost Her Mojo ", "keywords": "apple's siri,consumer tech: home tech,digital assistant,siri,voice-activated,Apple,AAPL,Amazon.com,AMZN,sports,recreation,routine general news,computers,consumer electronics,e-commerce,internet,online,technology", "content": "In late 2014, members of             Apple Inc.\u2019s        AAPL -0.17%       Siri team arrived at an             Amazon.com Inc.       event thinking they were ahead of the competition.Apple\u2019s three-year-old product had gained popularity for its ability to handle calendar appointments, text messaging and a few other simple tasks based on voice commands. Siri had no real competitors.The outlook quickly changed as the team watched Amazon\u2019s video showing off a small, voice-controlled speaker that could play music, order products and search the web. It demonstrated Amazon had figured out how to isolate voices from background noise and have a digital assistant respond to requests from a distance\u2014abilities Siri hadn\u2019t yet mastered.\u201cPeople at Apple\u2019s anxiety level went up a notch,\u201d said a former member of Apple\u2019s Siri team who was there that night.Today, Apple is playing catch-up in a product category it invented, increasing worries about whether the technology giant has lost some of its innovation edge.On Monday Apple announced HomePod, a home speaker powered by Siri that will start selling in December. The device will perform Siri functions such as dimming lights and setting reminders, though Apple touted it mainly as an advanced home-stereo system with superior audio quality. It spent years developing it.Apple also unveiled planned upgrades to Siri for the fall that will enable it to translate English phrases into five languages and to learn from users to deliver personalized suggestions for web surfing, messaging and other apps.Apple will enter the home-speaker market a distant third, at best. Amazon, which has been selling its Echo speaker for 2-\u00bd years, last month unveiled a device, also powered by the Alexa voice assistant, that includes a camera and a display for video calling. And it has partnered with companies to put Alexa into             Ford Motor Co.       cars,             LG Electronics Inc.       refrigerators, and             General Electric Co.       lamps.Alphabet Inc.,       which debuted its Google Assistant-based speaker last October, said last month it would make its voice product available through an app on iPhones.             Microsoft Corp.       in May unveiled a speaker for its voice robot, Cortana, and             Samsung Electronics Co.       is expected to install its planned Bixby assistant on home appliances.Siri has remained largely a feature of the iPhone, although it is also available on a handful of other Apple devices, including the Apple Watch. Siri\u2019s capabilities have advanced incrementally, with functions matched or exceeded by those of rival systems. Several independent studies have shown Siri is less accurate than Alexa or Google Assistant in responding to user queries.Some former executives, close observers and even devoted customers say Apple\u2019s innovative power appears to be waning, stymied by a lack of urgency and difficulty bringing ideas to fruition. In nearly six years under Chief Executive       Tim Cook,        Apple\u2019s stock has soared but the company has not delivered a breakthrough product on par with the string of hits under late founder       Steve Jobs,        which included the iPod, iPhone and iPad.Source:* Stone Temple Consulting Survey With 5,000 Search Queries Such As \u201cWhat is the Olive Branch Petition?\u201d** Loup Ventures Survey With 800 Queries, Including Commands Like \u201cRemind Me To Call Mom at 2 p.m.\u201dOne reason could be the iPhone itself, one of the most successful consumer products in history. It accounts for most of Apple\u2019s sales and dominates much of the company\u2019s focus, which former executives say has inhibited the company\u2019s ability to develop products untethered from the phone, as rivals did with their brand-new voice-activated devices.\u201cSiri is a textbook of leading on something in tech and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Holger Mueller, a principal analyst Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.Apple\u2019s supporters\u00a0say it often has entered categories after rivals and assumed a commanding position. And\u00a0Apple says the pace of its innovation has only accelerated. The company has tripled research-and-development spending over the past five years to $10 billion annually. It is working on a range of projects, including an autonomous driving system, that could become hits if they come to market. Apple notes that Siri, through its presence on the iPhone, is in the pockets of hundreds of millions of users globally\u2014far more than any rival\u2019s voice assistant.\u201cWe\u2019re very happy with where the company is from an innovation standpoint,\u201d Eddy Cue, the Apple senior vice president whose portfolio includes Siri, said in an interview before Monday\u2019s announcements, which also included augmented reality for developers and more-powerful Macs. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our DNA.\u201dThe race to develop digital assistants is one of the biggest areas of competition in the tech industry today. Industry executives say these products, powered by increasingly effective artificial-intelligence algorithms, are revolutionizing computing much like the PC and smartphone, leading to a future where computers will converse with humans, recall previous conversations and provide personalized responses without buttons or touchscreens.Siri was one of Mr. Jobs\u2019s last major new products. He became a fan in 2010 when it was launched by a small startup as a digital-assistant app for iPhones. In 30 phone calls over 45 days, he persuaded its founders to sell, according to Gary Morgenthaler, a Siri investor. He then pushed them to fine-tune a handful of features that would work flawlessly across millions of iPhones in multiple languages.Touted as \u201cthe best feature\u201d of the iPhone 4s in 2011 by Apple marketing chief       Phil Schiller,        Siri converted words to text and interpreted their meaning to describe the weather or make calendar appointments and helped fuel a 73% increase in iPhone shipments in its first year. A day after the announcement, Mr. Jobs died.In the years since, former Siri team members say, progress has been slowed by a failure to set ambitious goals, shifting strategies and a culture that prioritizes user privacy\u2014making it difficult to personalize and improve the product. The project also has suffered from the departures of key team members, some of whom went to competitors.About a year after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death, Apple hired Bill Stasior, an Amazon search executive, to oversee Siri. Mr. Stasior\u00a0studied artificial intelligence at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but his expertise was in search rather than speech or language. This led some members of the Siri team to believe he didn\u2019t fully appreciate the product\u2019s original vision: to expand beyond the iPhone to third-party apps.To make Siri available to additional apps\u2014so users, for instance, could check their bank balance or order a car service\u2014Apple needed to create a platform and coding tools that allows developers to integrate the virtual assistant into apps for the iPad, iPhone or Apple Watch. It did so in 2016.Apple declined to make Mr. Stasior available for an interview. He didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment.Siri co-founders       Adam Cheyer       and       Dag Kittlaus       left the team, citing personal reasons. They started a competing company, Viv Labs, to make a voice-based system available to third-party developers. Roughly a half dozen other members of the team followed. Samsung bought Viv last year for about $215 million.In 2014, Apple moved Siri to a machine-learning system that used algorithms to improve its performance. Mr. Cue compared the new system to a brain transplant, saying it made Siri more versatile, allowing it to field requests no matter their phrasing. For example, it could answer both \u201cGive me yesterday\u2019s Yankees score\u201d and \u201cWhat was yesterday\u2019s Yankees score?\u201d\u201cThe key about things like Siri is to make it not feel like something you have to think about,\u201d Mr. Cue said. Apple said Siri\u2019s error rate was cut in half.Around the same time, Amazon introduced Alexa and its Echo speaker. The company pioneered a new category, blanketing television with quirky ads featuring Alec Baldwin. It sold an estimated 11 million home speakers in two years.The device\u2019s popularity caught Apple off guard. It was designed to not only play music and answer questions but also control light switches and other home appliances, a concept Apple had recently introduced through a software system called HomeKit that allows developers to design thermostats and door locks that could be controlled by Siri.The iPhone, in many ways a huge advantage, was also becoming an impediment. Apple says more than 375 million of its devices access Siri each month across 21 languages, and that Siri fields nearly two billion requests a week. In the U.S. alone, it has 70 million unique users weekly. By comparison, Amazon\u2019s Alexa is available only in German and English, and Google Assistant is available only in seven languages.At the same time, the iPhone\u2014accounting for two thirds of sales\u2014so dominates internal focus that Apple largely abandoned the original Siri team\u2019s vision for an assistant that would go beyond calendar appointments and text messaging.Instead, Apple added languages, added a male voice to Siri\u2019s original female voice, and allowed users to verbally create reminders while reading an article or viewing something on the iPhone. Apple and other large companies \u201ctend to make improvements at the margin,\u201d said Larry Gillick, a former Siri speech scientist who serves as chief technology officer at a startup called Semantic Machines.Amazon and Google, which introduced its own assistant in 2016, also enjoyed advantages over Siri because they had more data from their robust search engines to train their assistants and less-restrictive privacy policies than Apple, former Siri employees said.Apple protects user privacy by randomly tagging Siri searches and keeping the data tagged for only six months, unlike Google and Amazon, which keep data until users ask for it to be discarded. The practice has complicated efforts to improve Siri because Apple relinquished control of data before it could be used to gauge the impact of software tweaks, former Siri engineers said.\u201cYou\u2019re hamstrung,\u201d said Jason Douglas, a former member of the Siri search team. \u201cThe iTunes store has great data but the scale of it is not Google or Amazon.\u201dMr. Cue said Apple often uses generic data rather than user data to train its systems and has the ability to improve Siri\u2019s performance for individual users with information kept on their iPhones.After Siri\u2019s brain transplant, plans to improve Siri\u2019s conversational ability stalled. Apple tasked Alex Acero, an expert in language processing, with combining two rival teams: speech recognition and natural language. The first involves adapting software to recognize spoken words, and the second involves interpreting those words. Following an executive-level power struggle, the project was transferred to another leader without expertise in the field, said Chuck Wooters, who was on the speech-recognition team.The change disillusioned some speech-recognition experts. One left for Google and another for Amazon, said Mr. Wooters, who also departed and joined the Semantic startup, which is developing technology to make virtual assistants more conversational.Apple declined to comment. Mr. Acero, who still works on Siri, didn\u2019t return requests for comment.Other employees were discouraged by the reluctance to allow third-party apps to employ Siri. Apple added the ability to use Fandango to buy movie tickets in 2013, but Mr. Stasior tabled a plan to extend Siri\u2019s abilities to more apps, two former employees said. By the time the project moved forward two years later, Apple had reduced the number of new commands developers would be able to use, a former engineer said.In June of last year, Apple unveiled about 150 new commands, called intents, for Siri at its annual developer\u2019s conference. It opened Siri to about seven types of apps, including payment and ride-sharing apps such as Venmo and Uber. By comparison, Amazon\u2019s Alexa allows developers to create custom commands, which it calls skills, and some 12,000 have been created, allowing users to order coffee, start a guided meditation or check their bank-account balance.The limited scope of Siri\u2019s commands disappointed many developers, said Brian Roemmele, a developer who attended the announcement. \u201cPeople went from being happy and excited to sitting in workshops and realizing, \u2018I can\u2019t use it,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cSome went back to that attitude: Siri\u2019s always going to be dumb. They moved on to developing for Google and Alexa.\u201dMr. Cue said Apple chose to open Siri to apps that people use frequently and make it versatile enough to understand requests said in a variety of ways. \u201cThese are things you do every day and use all the time,\u201d he said.Apple on Monday announced developers would be able to use Siri for four more types of apps, including notes and bank accounts.Siri\u2019s capabilities have lagged behind those of rivals elsewhere, as well. In tests across 5,000 different questions, it answered accurately 62% of the time, lagging the roughly 90% accuracy rate of Google Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, according to Stone Temple, a digital marketing firm.A separate study by Loup Ventures, a market-research firm, shows Siri performs better than rivals on core iPhone functions, so-called command-related queries\u2014making calendar appointments, placing phone calls, sending text messages\u2014but doesn\u2019t do as well answering questions accurately from the web.Apple has tried to close the gap through acquisitions. In 2015, it purchased VocalIQ, a Cambridge, England-based startup that designed a system to improve a virtual assistant\u2019s conversational ability.The plan was to feed Apple\u2019s data through the system to make Siri more conversational, a former engineer said, allowing a user to ask for a nearby coffee shop and subsequently narrow the list by asking for one with Wi-Fi.Google Assistant has begun to offer those conversational capabilities, but Siri still hasn\u2019t made that advance. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone does an A+ on conversation,\u201d said Mr. Cue. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging problem and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in that area. It will get a lot better and needs to get a lot better.\u201dWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as '\u2018Checking on That\u2019\u2014 How Siri Fell Behind.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-oil-exports-double-reshaping-vast-global-markets-1496833200", "news_time": "2017-06-07 11:19:00", "news_title": "U.S. Oil Exports Double, Reshaping Vast Global Markets", "keywords": "brent,crude oil,gasoline,gasoline price,nymex,oil,oil change,oil exports,oil price,opec,pump prices near me,Mason Hamilton,Kurt Barrow,Rob Thummel,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy", "content": "American oil exports are emerging as a disruptive new force in global markets.The U.S. exported 1 million barrels of oil a day during some months so far this year\u2014double the pace of 2016\u2014and is on track to average that amount for all of 2017, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Department and the International Trade Commission.In another era, a domestic glut and low prices, currently hovering under $50 a barrel, might have caused companies to slow the pace of drilling. But since Congress lifted a ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, shipments out of Texas and Louisiana have skyrocketed, taking the fruits of the U.S. fracking revolution to new markets.\u201cThe glut of crude around the world, coupled with extremely low prices to rent oil tankers, is upending petroleum flows,\u201d said       Kurt Barrow,        vice president at consulting firm             IHS Markit.While U.S. exports make up just 1% of global oil volumes, they are a new factor helping to tamp down prices and keep them rangebound between $45 and $55 a barrel. U.S. oil prices on Wednesday declined more than 4% to around $46 a barrel after weekly inventory data showed a surprise increase in stockpiles.Exports represent a relief valve for U.S. drillers, who are ramping up production at a pace to surpass 10 million barrels a day, a new record, by next year if not sooner.The U.S., which shipped more than 110 million barrels to foreign buyers from January to April, according to ITC data, is benefiting in part from a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to temporarily reduce output.The U.S. still imports a lot of foreign crude, averaging 10 million barrels a day last year, because it is the world\u2019s No. 1 oil consumer. But that level has dropped sharply in recent years.A major reason why U.S. exports are rising is that American crude has been selling at a discount of roughly $2.50 a barrel to the international oil-price benchmark, Brent, for much of this year.That spread makes it profitable to pay to transport U.S. oil to farther flung locales. If U.S. oil\u2019s discount to Brent gets bigger, American shipments will ramp up. If it shrinks, less U.S. oil will flow overseas.Another big reason for the increase in exports is so-called back-haul economics, said Mason Hamilton, an analyst with the Energy Department. Tankers carrying crude from the Middle East to Texas used to unload and go home empty. Now U.S. oil can be loaded on those tankers and make a pit stop in Europe on their way back.In late May,             Occidental Petroleum Corp.       successfully tested docking a supertanker that can hold more than 2 million barrels of crude. The test at its shipping terminal in the Port of Corpus Christi was part of a plan to eventually export bigger shipments from Texas to Asia and Europe.The U.S. still ships out nine times more refined petroleum\u2014like gasoline, diesel and propane\u2014than it does raw crude oil. But that could start to change.\u201cIt takes years to establish markets,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cRefiners are protective of their refineries. They want a consistent quality stream\u2014no mystery crudes\u2014so they are testing it out.\u201dIn 2013, 99% of the small trickle of oil that flowed out of the U.S. on special permits went to Canada. Since the lifting of the export ban, American oil has flowed to more than 30 countries, with China, Colombia and the U.K. emerging as big buyers.So far this year, Asian buyers have taken 39% of U.S. shipments as Canada\u2019s share has dropped to 30%, according to the latest federal data, which runs through April. European refiners have bought 22% and Latin America 9%.China, the world\u2019s largest oil importer, traditionally gets more than half of its crude from OPEC members like Saudi Arabia, Angola and Iran. But China, which imported a record 8.6 million barrels a day in December 2016, is stepping up imports of U.S. oil, as well as crude from Brazil, after its own production dropped significantly last year, according to the Energy Department.\u201cWe believe that more U.S. oil production will be needed to meet future global demand and offset production declines in China and Mexico during 2017 and 2018,\u201d said       Rob Thummel,        managing director for Tortoise Advisors, an energy investment adviser with $16.8 billion under management.Since the start of this year, more oil routes have been forged between the U.S. and India, Hong Kong, Australia and Denmark. Even Georgia, sandwiched between big oil producers Russia and Azerbaijan on the Black Sea, took a shipment of U.S. crude in March. In some cases, experts believe, countries are taking U.S. shipments to make a statement to their current suppliers: We have options.Italy and the Netherlands, where the pipeline-linked Port of Rotterdam serves as a major gateway to Europe, are also emerging as destinations for U.S. crude.             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC, which operates the largest refinery in Europe in Rotterdam, is among the companies that have shipped U.S. crude to the Continent.American crude\u2019s place in Europe remains relatively small, at just shy of 25 million barrels in the first four months of the year. But the exports are a challenge to Russia, which toppled the U.K. and Norway as the top oil exporter into the Netherlands 12 years ago.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Surging U.S. Exports Reshape Oil Market.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-the-man-the-myth-the-risk-1496848491", "news_time": "2017-06-07 11:14:00", "news_title": "Elon Musk: The Man, the Myth, the Risk", "keywords": "elon musk,model 3,tesla,Tesla,TSLA,Ford Motor,F,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive", "content": "Tesla Inc        TSLA -0.32%       is one of the hottest stocks on the planet, thanks to investor belief in       Elon Musk.

For example, analyst consensus called for $6.26 a share in 2018 in adjusted profits a year ago, according to FactSet. Now, analyst consensus calls for an 89 cent loss. A similar pattern can be observed out to 2020, but investors clearly don\u2019t mind.Therein lies the danger. The stock depends on Mr. Musk working his magic.

Delta used to give its top-tier frequent fliers free club membership, but now offers that as a choice in a bundle of options. United paid Global Entry fees for top customers three years, but stopped in 2015. And the most important loyalty benefit\u2014an upgrade\u2014has gotten much rarer because airlines are selling more first- and business-class seats, auctioning them off, and in some cases shrinking those cabins and reducing legroom there as well.\u201cThe loyalty is gone,\u201d says       Peter Boer,        a consultant to technology companies who is based in Florida and Virginia. He now buys business-class and first-class tickets on different airlines for his travelers, since he can\u2019t get an upgrade from American, where he\u2019s a lifetime platinum member.Even \u201csystemwide upgrades,\u201d the golden ticket for travelers that used to let you instantly upgrade any flight, are becoming harder to use, elite-level frequent fliers say. Systemwide upgrades are earned by travelers who spend heavily with airlines and fly more than 100,000 miles a year, or hit a milestone like 2 million lifetime miles. They used to get you confirmed upgrades when you bought your ticket.With United, you can\u2019t buy the cheapest ticket for international trips and use systemwide upgrade certificates. You must spend more for a coach ticket and then wait, not knowing if the upgrade will clear. If it doesn\u2019t come through, you paid more for your coach seat than necessary.On American, the available inventory of seats for systemwide upgrades has shrunk. That means waiting until departure on many flights to see if you\u2019ll get a cushier seat.Mark Kovac,        a Dallas-based business consultant who is a member of American\u2019s highest loyalty tier, invitation-only Concierge Key, bought coach tickets last fall for a family summer trip to London. He was told seats weren\u2019t available then to use his systemwide upgrades\u2014the first time that had happened to him.When he complained, American told him the airline\u2019s predictive models are blocking upgrades more often so premium seats are available to sell close to departure. \u201cIt is true that until a few years back, systemwide upgrades would, more often than not, get cleared at the time of booking. However, that is not the case now,\u201d a customer service representative at American\u2019s AAdvantage program wrote.To Mr. Kovac, that erases a big benefit. \u201cThis is probably the biggest, most noticeable thing they\u2019ve changed,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to want to save these for something special. Now I just use them whenever I can.\u201dMr. Kovac and his family did get upgraded shortly before the overnight flight to London on Friday, but his children, ages 10, 8 and 6, were spread around the cabin, he says.American says it has improved its international premium cabins and seen an increase in paid demand. \u201cWe continue to refine our systems to reflect the demand for the product while still providing as much availability as possible to our elite members,\u201d a spokeswoman says.Frequent fliers say they understand airlines\u2019 desire to sell premium seats rather than give them away, but upgrades used to be considered a necessary investment in loyalty. Frequent travelers essentially paid for those seats in advance by buying expensive tickets trip after trip.In January, American also chopped how many systemwide upgrades it gave out to 100,000-mile-a-year executive platinum members. Each year executive platinum members used to get eight SWUs. This year that was cut to four, with the opportunity to earn two for reaching 150,000 miles and two more at 200,000 miles.Gary Leff,        co-founder of the frequent-flier community InsideFlyer, says top travelers are complaining a lot about American lately because the airline is making changes after its merger with US Airways. American was considered the most generous for top customers, because Delta and United had already weakened some perks, he says. Now there are few major differences between the three big airlines, Mr. Leff says.Delta says the percentage of passengers in first class who paid to sit there used to be around 10%, but by next year will hit 70%. Airlines offer more first-class sales and discounted seats and push affordable upgrades by email and kiosk.To placate their best customers stuck in coach, American and United now give them the small consolation of a free cocktail and food item for sale onboard.A bigger upgrade issue looms for top-tier travelers: How \u201cpremium economy\u201d cabins will impact upgrades on international flights. Premium economy\u2014usually a separate cabin with more legroom, wider seats and upgraded food compared with coach\u2014has been a big hit on international airlines, priced several hundred dollars above coach tickets but several thousand below business class.American is rolling out its version now. Delta says its premium economy will launch in the fall. United says it is taking steps toward premium economy, too.The catch: On many international airlines, upgrades move you up one cabin. So instead of jumping from coach to business, an upgrade from economy moves you to premium economy. To get to business class you have to buy a premium economy ticket. \u201cIt reduces the value of the upgrade,\u201d Mr. Leff says.U.S. airlines have yet to say what their upgrade policy will be on flights with premium economy.Airline mergers swelled membership in the top tiers of loyalty status, so airlines have made it harder to qualify for elite status by adding annual spending requirements.In January, American created a new elite tier called platinum pro. It\u2019s halfway between its platinum, which requires 50,000 miles of travel a year, and 100,000-mile executive platinum. On May 20, the airline started ranking elite-level members on upgrade lists in part by how much they\u2019ve spent on American tickets the previous year.An American spokeswoman says changes were made so the best customers have the best access to perks.Mr. Boer, the consultant, says he understands airlines\u2019 desire to generate revenue and isn\u2019t angry. But he questions whether they will regret weakening loyalty for so many. \u201cAmerican is now just another airline in the mix,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m kind of wondering if our friends at American are shooting themselves in the foot.\u201dWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Airlines\u2019 Elite Fliers Find Fewer Perks.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/skin-care-ceo-gives-her-house-a-makeover-1496847731", "news_time": "2017-06-07 11:02:00", "news_title": "Skin-Care CEO Gives Her House a Makeover", "keywords": " architecture, home design, home renovation,luxury homes, luxury real estate,sabrina tan, singapore, skin inc,Sabrina Tan,political,general news,real estate,property,construction", "content": "Sabrina Tan, a former tech executive, decided to found her own skin-care company after spending thousands of dollars on a \u201cvanity graveyard\u201d of cosmetics that weren\u2019t working for her. In 2008, the Singapore-based businesswoman created Skin Inc., whose products are now sold in Sephora and in boutiques around the world.\u201cI come from tech and have a problem-solving background,\u201d says Ms. Tan, who previously worked in marketing-executive positions at             IBM                   and             Oracle,       and occasionally peppers her speech with techie buzzwords such as \u201cdisruption.\u201dA year after launching Skin Inc., she took on another problem-solving challenge: turning a dark, uninviting home in the Singapore suburbs into a light-filled space for her family.Ms. Tan, 43 years old, and her husband, Lim Teck Wee, spent about $2 million in 2009 on a 4,200-square-foot, semidetached home in Kovan, a suburb about 8 miles from Singapore\u2019s financial district.They had previously lived nearby, and recalled thinking of the property as a \u201cdark haunted house\u201d when they passed it on walks. But she liked the location, which was close to other family members, and she saw a chance to create the roomy family home she desired.Ms. Tan tore down everything but the structural pillars, transforming the three-story building into a bright, two-story, six-bedroom and three-bathroom home. The effort took about $700,000 and one trouble-filled year.Halfway through the process, the interior architect went bankrupt, leaving Ms. Tan to take charge. She wanted a modernist home that referenced Singapore\u2019s \u201cgarden city\u201d effort to create more green spaces that began in the late 1960s, and that committed to a green environment. The Tans had the front of the house moved back slightly to give more space to their frangipani-dominated garden.In another nod to the past, the facade was painted white with black window frames, reminiscent of colonial-era villas.Along the first floor, a wall of glass offers views of a small koi pond. \u201cI hate walls and wanted to bring the light in,\u201d says Ms. Tan.She kept spaces open. The stairs to the bedrooms have no rises\u2014in part, Ms. Tan says, so they could see their children\u2014an 11-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter\u2014when they played behind it.Inside, the centerpiece of the Tans\u2019 home is the living room. A black ceiling fan was inspired by the white fans of Singapore\u2019s kopitiams, or open-air cafes. Furniture includes a sunken table, and several pieces Ms. Tan bought at Grafunkt, a voguish local retailer.The dining table is nearly 10 feet long with a bench on one side, which Ms. Tan says reminds her of the seating in Singapore school cafeterias. It is also useful for the large gatherings the Tans host for business associates and their church group.The wall on the other end of the dining space has metallic wallpaper imported from Korea. Nearby is the indoor dry kitchen, for light cooking, that features black Italian granite and a frosted mirror backsplash.Upstairs, Ms. Tan\u2019s master bedroom has a two-story ceiling with a large window looking onto a terrace garden. Ms. Tan is most proud of the suite\u2019s indoor-outdoor bath, fitted with an egg-shaped bathtub, that has an opening onto the terrace covered only by shades. It was inspired, she says, by Japanese Zen gardens and the Hyatt Hotels baths she uses on her travels. The space, she adds, is where she can relax."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lebron-jamess-media-empire-is-doing-way-better-than-his-team-1496846788", "news_time": "2017-06-07 11:00:00", "news_title": "LeBron James\u2019s Media Empire Is Out Front (Even If His Team Isn\u2019t)", "keywords": "athletes podcasts,athletes social media,cleveland cavaliers players,lebron's legacy,lebron james decision,nba finals,sports media,trilogy,unineterrupted podcast,James LeBron,Maverick Carter,LeBron James,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news,media,entertainment", "content": "BURBANK, Calif.\u2014Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson received a text message recently from a number he didn\u2019t recognize.\u201cI\u2019m going to f\u2014ing kill your podcast!!!!\u201d it read.The sender was Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, who had just found out that Jefferson\u2019s show about the Cavaliers was more popular than his own podcast. \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy you bro,\u201d Green wrote. \u201cBad!\u201dJefferson and Green are on either side of a basketball rivalry that has returned to the NBA Finals for the third year in a row, with the Warriors leading the Cavaliers 2-0 heading into Game 3 on Wednesday night. They\u2019re also battling to lure listeners to their shows.That\u2019s where their competition ends and their role in turning the sports business upside down begins. Jefferson\u2019s and Green\u2019s shows belong to a network owned by Uninterrupted, a media startup founded by Cleveland star LeBron James and his business partner Maverick Carter, and backed by more than $15 million from             Time Warner Inc.\u2019s       Warner Bros. studio and Turner Sports unit.It\u2019s the latest evolution of a movement in which athletes, celebrities and other public figures are using social media and other technology to control their images and communicate directly with the public. In the process, they are loosening traditional media\u2019s grip on the way sports is delivered and consumed. James, Carter and their partners are betting some of the most compelling sports content in the shifting entertainment landscape will be created by the athletes themselves.\u201cThis is their media company,\u201d Carter said in an interview from his office inside a set house on the Warner Bros. studio lot. \u201cThis is the place they can come and tell the stories they want.\u201dUninterrupted\u2019s multimedia offerings include full-length documentaries, web series and a growing podcast network. Some of its shows have been licensed by traditional media outlets such as Fox Sports, which broadcast an Uninterrupted documentary about a mixed martial-arts fighter. Shows also appear on YouTube, Instagram and Uninterrupted\u2019s own website.The company is another potentially disruptive force at a time when established media outlets are under pressure to adapt to declining subscriptions for cable television. ESPN has lost more than 10 million subscribers in the past several years as customers have ditched the pay-TV bundle for streaming services. That cord-cutting was one of the reasons for a big round of layoffs in April.Ventures like Uninterrupted are limited in their power to supplant traditional media because there is no substitute for live games. That is why fees to broadcast NBA and NFL games have risen even as other forms of entertainment have watched their audiences scatter. Under a deal that went into effect this season,             Walt Disney Co.       and Time Warner pay the NBA an average of about $2.7 billion a year, roughly triple the sum of the previous agreement. That money also buys the broadcast partners special access to players like James and Green.But what more players have realized is that the leagues don\u2019t own their personalities and likenesses\u2014and there are now more vehicles than ever to satisfy fans\u2019 craving for an unfiltered view and make money along the way.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through the traditional gatekeepers to find an audience anymore,\u201d said Tom Spock, a partner at Scalar Media and former NBC executive. \u201cAnybody can distribute content now.\u201dUninterrupted executives say they\u2019re not interested in supplanting the traditional media. They point to James as someone who remains accessible to reporters even if he could bypass them and reach millions of people himself. It was in a news conference and ESPN interview last week\u2014not in a tweet or an Uninterrupted video\u2014that James made his first comments about Los Angeles police investigating a racial slur spray-painted on his home.\u201cUninterrupted is not journalism and never will be,\u201d said Adam Mendelsohn, a media strategist who advises James and Carter. \u201cUninterrupted is entertainment and a way for athletes to connect in new, creative ways with fans.\u201dSuch platforms are attracting investors\u2019 attention. The Players\u2019 Tribune, a website founded by       Derek Jeter       that recently announced its own podcast network, said in January that it had completed a $40 million fundraising round, bringing its total funding to $60 million.Uninterrupted was conceived in the immediate aftermath of James\u2019s decision to come back to Cleveland in 2014. He announced his move to the Miami Heat in 2010 with an ESPN special called \u201cThe Decision\u201d that was widely criticized in part for its insensitivity to the fans he was leaving behind in Cleveland. But his return to Cleveland was better received in part because it was unveiled more thoughtfully in an essay co-written by Sports Illustrated writer Lee Jenkins.Only hours later, on a private jet bound for the soccer World Cup in Brazil, James and Carter started talking about the potential for a company based on that process. They wanted to connect professional athletes with professional writers, producers and directors who could help them say what they wanted to say.The product of that conversation was Uninterrupted. The company soon struck a distribution deal with Bleacher Report, a website owned by Turner Sports, and it secured backing from Warner Bros. after an introduction by       Paul Wachter,        James\u2019s financial adviser and a Time Warner Inc. board member.Athletes who develop shows through Uninterrupted get access to resources to produce, promote and distribute them. The company also gives athletes a cut of any revenue from sponsorships or licensing deals, though terms vary. The company declined to say which athletes own equity stakes.Uninterrupted was born right before the Warriors and Cavaliers became the NBA\u2019s best teams. Their rivalry is the biggest story in basketball, and Uninterrupted is represented on both sides.It rolled out \u201cTrophies,\u201d a behind-the-scenes look at James and Green preparing for the playoffs, before their Finals showdown in 2015. Their rematch last year\u2014a series in which Green was suspended for a game after taking what the NBA termed a \u201cretaliatory swipe of his hand to the groin\u201d of James\u2014turned out to be the second season. The third season culminates with the final installment of the Finals trilogy between the Warriors and Cavaliers. Uninterrupted has camera crews in both locker rooms and elsewhere shadowing James and Green.Their third consecutive showdown was a fortunate break for Uninterrupted. The elimination of either player\u2019s team would have meant fewer episodes. \u201cIt\u2019d be like if Tony Soprano were killed in Season 3,\u201d Carter said.James and Green were featured in another Uninterrupted series, \u201cKneading Dough,\u201d a show about personal finance hosted by Carter and sponsored by             J.P. Morgan Chase.       Guests discuss the peculiar financial reality of pro athletes: They make the most money at an age when they know the least about it.       Kristin Lemkau,        the bank\u2019s chief marketing officer, said the idea of famous athletes sitting down and talking frankly about their financial decisions was an easy sell.\u201cI want a way to reach people that feels authentic and isn\u2019t cheesy, infomercial-type stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI would take shows like this all day long over digital ads that people hate.\u201dJames and Green also star in Uninterrupted\u2019s latest project, \u201cThe Shop,\u201d a 30-minute panel talk show set in a barbershop. ESPN plans to show clips of the pilot episode in its programming around Finals games.Uninterrupted\u2019s buzziest release, though, is a podcast that costs little to produce. The Cavaliers\u2019 show, Road Trippin\u2019, began independently and could have picked other podcast networks after its first episodes found an instant audience. Jefferson says he chose Uninterrupted in part because of his relationship with James. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to pitch,\u201d he said.The show is hosted by Jefferson and Channing Frye, longtime NBA players who were friends before they were teammates, and Fox Sports Ohio sideline reporter Allie Clifton, who keeps their conversations from devolving into chaos. James and Kyrie Irving are frequent guests, while most of their teammates have made appearances. \u201cIs that not the coolest, best thing?\u201d said Cavaliers owner       Dan Gilbert.The players record on the team plane or while they\u2019re huddled in hotel rooms. There is usually wine involved. And they speak candidly about topics they would rarely discuss otherwise. It was on this podcast that Irving said he believed the world is flat and the Cavs discussed the merits of different spinning classes.\u201cPeople want to see something they\u2019re not sure they should be seeing,\u201d Carter said.Road Trippin\u2019 is the most successful of the company\u2019s six current podcasts. It averages more than 175,000 downloads per episode, according to a person familiar with the matter, and it recently was the No. 1 sports podcast and cracked the top 20 on Apple\u2019s charts, which reward hot shows adding new subscribers. Green\u2019s show, Dray Day, remains below Road Trippin\u2019 in the rankings.Now other athletes are approaching Uninterrupted with their own ideas for podcasts and bigger projects.Los Angeles Clippers guard J.J. Redick was the first active NBA player with his own podcast, an interview show that started in 2016 under the Yahoo Sports umbrella, and the show resonated in a way that surprised him. \u201cWhen I did my first episode,\u201d he said, \u201cI literally thought to myself: I hope more than five people listen to this.\u201dHe now gets approached by fans not because he\u2019s an NBA player but for his work behind the microphone. When he stopped recording earlier this season, Redick was often asked when the podcast was coming back. The answer is this summer\u2014and he\u2019s moving the show to Uninterrupted.\u201cI crave autonomy in terms of the content I\u2019m putting out and the ability to talk about whatever topics I want to talk about,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThis is a platform that I can do that. I think that\u2019s attractive for a lot of athletes.\u201dThe rapid development of Uninterrupted when other media companies are struggling to reach a younger audience raises a natural hypothetical question. James went on ESPN to say he was leaving for the Heat in 2010. He chose Sports Illustrated to break the news of his move in 2014. How would he handle this type of situation in 2017?\u201cI think about it all the time,\u201d Carter said. \u201c100% we\u2019d tell it on Uninterrupted.\u201d\u2014Sara Germano contributed to this article.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'LeBron\u2019s Latest Move: Sports Media Playmaker.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rental-returns-lure-real-estate-investors-1496847312", "news_time": "2017-06-07 10:55:00", "news_title": "How (and Where) to Get the Best Return on a Rental Property ", "keywords": "investment properties, rentals,return on rental properties,single family rentals,political,general news,real estate,property,advice,construction", "content": "Some investors concerned about stock-market volatility are choosing a different place to park their money, buying homes in moderately priced markets and then renting them out.Kelly Vail, a 39-year-old technology change-management consultant in Dublin, Calif., purchased a four-bedroom house in Twinsburg, Ohio, for $175,000 in February, as an investment. After doing some research, she decided on this Cleveland suburb because of its demographics, strong job market and good schools. Her tenant pays monthly rent of $1,730, and Ms. Vail nets $350 in positive cash flow each month.\u201cIn my 20s, I believed that you invest your 401(k) in the stock market, but I had a negative experience,\u201d she says. \u201cI would rather have a passive income stream to live off of\u2014and it\u2019s a great way to diversify.\u201d Ms. Vail is in the process of purchasing a second single-family home to rent.The highest returns are typically available in areas where housing prices are lower, such as parts of the Southeast, Rust Belt and Midwest, says Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data Solutions, a real-estate data provider in Irvine, Calif. In a recent analysis of single-family rental returns in 375 U.S. counties with a population of at least 100,000, Attom found that the highest gross rental yields were in Clayton County, Ga., in the Atlanta metro area (23.7%). After expenses, Mr. Blomquist says investors are probably getting a 10% to 15% net yield, which is the rate of return on a real-estate investment after expenses are subtracted.For those interested in investing in rental homes, here are a few things to consider:\u2022 Maintenance costs money. Single-family rentals have expenses, from repairs and renovations to property taxes, insurance, routine maintenance and management fees\u2014Mr. Blomquist says a rule of thumb is to expect that 40% of gross rental income will go toward expenses\u2014and that cuts into returns. So can vacancies.\u2022 Invest for the long term. Real estate isn\u2019t liquid, so consider your investment to be long term. The average holding period for single-family rentals is five to seven years. \u201cThat\u2019s when you\u2019re going to get your most bang for the buck for this investment,\u201d says Mr. Hovland.\u2022 Consider condos. Andy Weiser, a real-estate agent with Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Florida 1st in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has a number of clients purchasing condominiums for investment at prices less than $100,000. \u201cA lot are afraid there is going to be a correction in the stock market,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of spending a lot of money on a house, you can buy a few apartments.\u201d He says that none of the properties would be considered \u201csexy,\u201d but that since they command lower rents, there is strong demand by potential tenants. He recommends purchasing only in condominium projects that welcome investors\u2014and paying cash. \u201cYou could have a problem if the building has too many investors,\u201d he says. \u201cBanks don\u2019t want to finance loans in those buildings.\u201dGood returns on single-family rentals are harder to come by in high-price coastal markets or other hot spots such as Denver or Austin, Texas. For example, Arlington County, Va., in the Washington, D.C., metro area has an annual gross rental yield of 3.4%.Mr. Blomquist says that many investors focus on starter homes selling for under $200,000. \u201cIf there\u2019s a downturn of some kind, or if you need to sell that property, you\u2019ll have the biggest pool of potential buyers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have the most potential renters as well.\u201dSteve Hovland, director of research at HomeUnion, an online real-estate investment management firm, says typical properties cost between $100,000 and $400,000 and have at least three bedrooms and two baths\u2014a size in demand with tenants and one that offers attractive yields. The net yield can range from 3% to 9%, depending on where the rental property is located, he says.Irvine, Calif.-based HomeUnion, which helps investors select, acquire, manage and ultimately sell single-family homes, has seen investor interest grow since its inception in 2014. The firm\u2019s closed-sales volume last year alone was over twice that of 2015, and current assets under management surpassed $100 million, up from $20 million at the end of 2015.Some investors take comfort in the steady income stream coming from these properties. \u201cEverybody needs a home, but not everybody is going to qualify for a mortgage,\u201d says Ms. Vail. \u201cSo there will always be a demand for rentals.\u201dAppeared in the June 9, 2017, print edition as 'Rental Returns Lure Landlords.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-gay-can-the-cavs-steal-a-game-against-the-warriors-1496846884", "news_time": "2017-06-07 10:48:00", "news_title": "Ben & Gay: Can the Cavs Steal a Game Against the Warriors?

But maybe not this good. The Warriors have taken a 2-0 lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals and made a potential sweep\u2014and the first undefeated postseason in the league\u2019s history\u2014seem like a real possibility. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s sports columnist Jason Gay and NBA reporter Ben Cohen emailed back and forth about what to expect in Game 3 on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET.BEN: Jason, um, is there any reason to believe this series isn\u2019t already over?GAY: Jeez! I\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t on the Cavs\u2019 team plane last year\u2014how quickly folks forget that Cleveland was beaten handily in Oakland in Game 1 and 2 of last year\u2019s Finals before turning it around in Game 3 en route to a remarkable Game 7 upset... oh wait I forgot the Warriors have Kevin Durant now.I don\u2019t know, Ben. I don\u2019t know. Durant is such a nightmare octopus for Cleveland\u2014a clear difference maker in the first two games. The Cavs have shown they can run and even shoot with the Warriors early, but eventually the pace and the mismatch become too much, and Durant exploits every vulnerability Cleveland has. It\u2019s not an embarrassment for Cleveland: this Golden State team is one of the great basketball teams of all time.Can I just say, however, that I am not on board with the whole \u201cI want to see them sweep, I want to see history\u201d idea with the Warriors? I\u2019ve heard a bit of that from fans. Not me, man! I want to see a better, more competitive games. Or game, even.BEN: I walked out of Oracle Arena on Sunday night so badly wanting to write something counterintuitive about how the series wasn\u2019t over yet. It\u2019s now Tuesday night, and I still haven\u2019t written it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d actually write. It really feels like the Warriors are unstoppable in the most literal sense. They seem impossible to stop.The funny thing about the Finals is that there are nearly 2,000 reporters credentialed to provide their expert analysis of these games, but the best explanation for what\u2019s happened so far is pretty simple: The Warriors have Kevin Durant now. They won 73 games last year and probably would\u2019ve won the Finals if Draymond Green hadn\u2019t been suspended in Game 5. They replaced the worst starter on that team with one of the best players in the entire world. One of their other best players in the entire world is now healthy, and one of their other best players in the entire world isn\u2019t watching a Finals game from the baseball stadium next door. Of course they\u2019re awesome.So what else are we supposed to talk about? I\u2019m happy to discuss Mike Brown\u2019s amazing collection of knit ties\u2014seriously: look at those knit ties!\u2014especially if it means not talking about whether the Warriors are ruining the NBA. I\u2019d rather eat Lake Erie oysters. Is it wrong of me to be completely bored with that conversation?GAY: Stop trying to make knit ties happen.And yes: basketball media seems to be engaging in a bit of revisionist history about Durant\u2019s move. Last summer, we were bombarded with very practical, condescending talk about how it was unfair to be upset or even question the move because it was made for pure \u201cbasketball reasons,\u201d i.e. Durant didn\u2019t simply go to the highest bidder. And yet it was never binary like that. It\u2019s totally OK to endorse Durant\u2019s right to do whatever he wants\u2014I mean, he can go play arena football for all I care\u2014but at the same time worry if it\u2019s good for the overall game.There seems to be little question it\u2019s tipped the balance in a less competitive way. Durant\u2019s old team, Oklahoma City, went from being a few bounces from the NBA Finals to being a playoff also-ran. And now there\u2019s talk about Golden State (if they keep it together) being utterly unbeatable for the next three or four seasons. Not good for basketball, and I think this is why       Adam Silver       was wary of the move right away, and why the league put in place protections to prevent it again.BEN: I feel like I\u2019m sitting next to Draymond Green at a podium. I have nothing to add.It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s anything more to say about this series. The Warriors are incredible, and the Cavaliers are in trouble. Game 3 is tonight\u2014I think the official tip is midnight\u2014so let\u2019s finish by rethinking what we thought a few days ago. Jason, Cavs in 7?GAY: I will go down with my ship. Remember: the Cavs were here last year. Same spot. You just have to pretend Kevin Durant doesn\u2019t exist. Dream.BEN: Kevin Durant does exist.

Some investors hope he does win.The seemingly counterintuitive choice\u2014markets typically welcome Conservative Party victories\u2014says much about how Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has upended the way investors view U.K. politics.Many investors say that Brexit will turn out to be negative for the British economy, throwing up tariffs and obstacles to trade and hurting the country\u2019s large finance industry. The Conservative\u2019s harder line on Brexit means that some of these fund managers argue their investments, in the longer run, will do better if Mr. Corbyn\u2019s Labour win or end up leading a coalition government with pro-EU parties.\u201cIf you see a Corbyn win, emotionally you\u2019d see a big trade off in the pound but afterwards it may stabilize and do a bit better if there is a sense Corbyn can negotiate a softer Brexit,\u201d said       Mark Dowding,        co-head of investment-grade debt at BlueBay Asset Management.\u00a0\u201cI think Corbyn would probably get an easier ride out of our European partners,\u201d he added.To be sure, while Mr. Corbyn has made significant ground in polls most investors still believe that the Conservatives will win a majority. In mid-April, some polls gave the Conservatives a lead of more\u00a0than 20 points\u00a0over\u00a0the Labour Party. That has narrowed to 8 points, according to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0average of opinion polls.A large Conservative majority is also viewed as being positive for markets. But that is also, in part, down to Brexit, because investors believe a big win would shore up Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       ability to push back against Conservative lawmakers who demand an immediate and complete break from Brussels.There are some investors who also see a Labour victory in any iteration as being the worst option for markets.\u00a0The party\u2019s election manifesto promises to hike income tax on anyone earning over \u00a380,000 ($103,200) a year while nationalizing the country\u2019s rail companies, water and energy utilities and postal service provider, the             Royal Mail Group.       Mr. Corbyn also has no government experience and is considered a maverick on foreign policy issues.Given this, analysts predict an immediate\u00a0fall in the pound should he win and big declines in U.K. shares, particularly utilities.\u00a0Labour\u2019s plans for increased fiscal spending could also send the yields on U.K. government bonds higher if, as expected, it pushed\u00a0up inflation, driving the Bank of England to nudge\u00a0up interest rates earlier than expected.Sebastian Raedler,        an equity strategist at             Deutsche Bank,       said\u00a0not a single one of the analysts in his bank\u2019s equity research team say their sector would do well under a Labour government.But if the ruling Conservatives lose the election that reduces the \u201cBrexit crash risk,\u201d said Mr. Raedler, whose bank believes that a Labour victory could be positive for sterling over the medium-term following an initial selloff.\u201cPeople find it hard to swallow that if you get someone that has an economic agenda that sounds like a throwback to the 1970s. that could be positive for the currency,\u201d he said.The \u2019Tories\u2019 have said they would pull Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner, given that Brussels demands the sort of free movement of labor that many Brexit voters rebelled against for access. Brexit supporters say that whatever happens the EU will want to keep trade flowing with Britain, a major buyer of its goods, and the country will also be able to carve out new deals with trading giants like the U.S. and China.But many in the market aren\u2019t convinced and are worried of a sudden lurch out of the bloc under the Conservatives.\u201cWhat really matters for markets and U.K. domestic demand is the prospect of crashing out\u201d of the EU, said\u00a0      John Wraith,        a rates strategist at UBS.Labour has said it would press ahead with Brexit. But the party is also expected to stay in the single market and be more welcoming to foreign workers, which many businesses want.The best case scenario, says\u00a0      Kallum Pickering,        economist at Berenberg Bank, would be a Labour minority government in which the party becomes reliant on the Liberal Democrat and Scottish National Party, both of which want to reverse the Brexit process.\u201cAs long as Corbyn is a lame duck on economic policy, that is fine,\u201d\u00a0he said.Some investors think it is simply too difficult to call how the market will react.       Julian Howard,        head of multi asset solutions at Swiss investment manager GAM, said he is \u201cloath to predict how the market will respond\u201d and has hedged any currency risk in sterling clients\u2019 portfolios.\u201cIt\u2019s so variable. the market just wants the certainty now,\u201d he said.Write to Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com, Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com and Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The Labour Party\u2019s election manifesto promises to nationalize the U.K.\u2019s rail companies, water and energy utilities and postal service provider, the Royal Mail Group.

At a mountain hideaway in India, the proprietor received us by pressing a red-powder dot onto our foreheads. But at Tebay Lodge, nestled deep in Alaska\u2019s Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, about two hours from Anchorage by amphibious prop plane, the welcoming gesture was an introduction to the air horn. \u201cYou will find an air horn in every room. Don\u2019t go anywhere without it,\u201d Jay Claus boomed to my family of five\u2014myself, my husband, my two teens and a tween. \u201cBlow it and I\u2019ll know there is a bear in camp. I\u2019ll come running with my gun,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cEven to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Especially then.\u201dTebay Lodge, which opened last June on the banks of sapphire-blue Tebay Lake, sits in a major bear thoroughfare, midway to the animals\u2019 all-you-can-eat buffet that is the summer spawning ground of the Copper River salmon just up lake. Jay, a 28-year-old native, built his lodge by hand, first clearing a gravel runway so he could get there, then felling and debarking trees and shaping them into sturdy pillars and posts. It sleeps only about ten guests and in summer, you need to rent the property in full, which is what we did, meaning that we had Jay, another guide and the lodge chef, who also happens to be Jay\u2019s girlfriend\u2014to ourselves. Over our weeklong stay, Jay rarely made a move without his guns, a rifle slung casually across his chest and a discreet handgun at his waist. I learned to gauge grizzly danger by noting the trigger readiness of his calloused hands.Nearing the end of our third day\u2019s outing, I saw Jay\u2019s fingers clench in high alert. Returning from a daylong trek several thousand feet up to a mountain pass, we were still a mile from our clanky motorboat, our transport back to home base. Though we\u2019d spent a half-day climbing up to the pass, our descent had whizzed by in 90 minutes, as we glissaded down the snowfields in our hiking boots, slipsliding along like penguins. In my many guided hikes on snow, I had never been allowed, let alone encouraged, to glissade\u2014\u201ctoo dangerous, you can lose control!\u201d the guides had warned. But Jay\u2019s core philosophy decreed that wilderness jaunts are meant to be a little wild. \u201cWhen was the last time you experienced any unpredictability?\u201d he queried my 16-year-old son, without waiting for a response before spouting his view that outdoor experiences have become overly controlled, almost hermetically sealed. I thought about the coddling we received on our other outdoorsy trips\u2014like the time we trekked up Mount Whitney and our guide kept us on a tight leash, even insisting on a strict schedule of rest stops. I can\u2019t imagine Jay would have approved.Once the snowfields, then scree gave way to meadows lush with wild iris and columbine in a deep valley, we spied the pond ringed with dense vegetation where we had begun our hike. Our motorboat was moored in Lake Tebay, on the other side of the pond, but before we could reach it, Jay stopped cold. \u201cBear,\u201d he muttered. He spotted it across the valley heading toward the water, right in our direction. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet,\u201d he announced. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way out.\u201d\u201cHo bear. Helloooo,\u201d Jay called out, as we cowered behind him. \u201cWe\u2019re just passing through. We\u2019re not planning to invade your territory.\u201d \u201cHooooo bear,\u201d my husband echoed meekly. Seconds later, 30 feet away, the bushes shook and a smallish black bear streaked through the foliage, then bounded away. On seeing its small stature, we sighed with relief, but Jay immediately disabused us of our naivet\u00e9. \u201cThese little guys are actually meaner,\u201d he said.Two days earlier we\u2019d encountered a much larger bear: We had just pushed off shore in the boat when we saw a gargantuan grizzly the color of cinnamon toast standing on his back feet at the water\u2019s edge. He was in Smokey stance. \u201cHe\u2019s scared of us,\u201d Jay reassured us. \u201cThese bears don\u2019t stand like that unless they\u2019re threatened.\u201d My daughter, clearly projecting, asked, \u201cDid you worry a lot about bears as a little kid?\u201d Grinning, Jay replied, \u201cNah. I started packing a rifle when I was five.\u201dJay\u2019s grandfather staked a land claim to 5 acres on the nearby Chitina River in the 1950s under the Homestead Act, and Jay\u2019s father raised his family 100 miles from the nearest road. Jay\u2019s forebears were among the first humans to inhabit their valley deep in a 13.2-million-acre backyard, which, in 1980, became the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park (now America\u2019s largest). In the 1960s, the family opened the rustic-chic Ultima Thule Lodge, now hosting Hollywood starlets and tech titans for unique flight safaris. In 2014, looking for independence, Jay struck out to develop Tebay. Friends flew in to assist with roof alignment, the installation of solar panels and counters (using flat stones found nearby) and the building of a wood-fired sauna and the two most enjoyable outhouses I have ever used (stocked with incense and climbing magazines). Jay also refurbished an old trapper\u2019s cabin, where my husband and I bunked. It was quite deluxe, with a cowhide rug, a fur throw draped on the big bed and a mosquito net hung like a princess canopy, yet still felt plenty rugged with no heat or toilet.Our final day began with great anticipation: All week Jay had talked up a day of water play on Tebay Lake, which seemed preposterous\u2014the water was 55 degrees and we\u2019d awoken to a sky full of mean, spitting clouds after two sun-bright days. But because we had lugged along wetsuits from California (as instructed), and because we had come to trust Jay\u2019s definition of fun, we were game.\u2018A black bear streaks through the foliage 30 feet in front of us.\u2019A few of us hiked halfway around the lake to an agreed-upon meeting spot while the others boated over with fishing gear, stand up paddleboards, kayaks and Little, a Lab retriever. Every toy was in use within minutes, my 14-year-old daughter paddling her dog pal around the inlet while her younger sister lay across my kayak squealing with delight, never mind that the air was chilly in a way that would have sent us racing inside at any other lakeshore. \u201cMom, get a picture,\u201d my son screamed from atop a lakeside cliff, ready to jump in. I missed the first shot, which was fine since he leapt seven more times.Midday, Jay lit a driftwood bonfire on shore. We huddled close, our wetsuits still on. Lunch arrived via boat delivery. As we bit into warm empanadas and sipped hot tea, we watched rainbow trout leap out of the water.On our return to the lodge we raced to the sauna, peeled off our clothes and sprawled across the built-in benches. As the warmth from the wood fire enveloped us, its logs chopped from trees on the property, I couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the power of hardscrabble ingenuity, and the very human instinct to make something from nothing. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be awesome to build one of these in San Francisco?\u201d I asked my husband. He fully agreed.Getting There The fastest way to reach Tebay Lodge from Anchorage is to charter a float plane through Regal Air, which leaves from Lakewood Airport, about a 10-minute cab ride from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. The flight is about two hours, and costs about $2,700 each way for up to seven people. Alternatively, fly commercial on Alaska Airlines to Cordova, and then charter a float plane through Cordova Air for the final 50 minutes to Tebay Lodge. The cost is $925 one-way for the charter, which holds up to four people (Cordova Air: 907-424-3289; Regal Air: 907-243-8535)Staying There In summer, Tebay Lodge is open for exclusive-use bookings only, for up to 10 people, from June to September (from $5,000 a night for the entire lodge, including meals; ultimathulelodge.com). The short winter season runs mid-March through April. You can rent the lodge in full or by the room (from $4,200 a person for a six-night stay, including guided ski excursions, some ski-plane flights, meals and transfers from Anchorage, pacificalpineguides.com).Appeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Wilder Dreams.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/onetime-los-angeles-home-of-groucho-marx-lists-1496845656", "news_time": "2017-06-07 10:27:00", "news_title": "Onetime Los Angeles Home of Groucho Marx Lists", "keywords": " celebrity homes, groucho marx,hollywood regency,irwin yablans,los angeles, luxury homes, luxury real estate,neel devani, sunset plaza ,you bet your life,Groucho Marx,political,general news,celebrities,living,lifestyle,personal finance,real estate,property,buying,selling a home,real estate agents,brokers,broadcasting,television broadcasting,construction,media,entertainment", "content": "The former Los Angeles home of the late       Groucho Marx       is going on the market for $4.2 million.Born Julius Henry Marx, the star of radio, film and television was best known for his witty retorts as the host of the game show \u201cYou Bet Your Life,\u201d which gave contestants cash for saying the secret word of the day.

Rockefeller, died in March at the age of 101 at another of his homes, in Westchester County, north of New York City.Brown Harris Stevens is due to list the property in the next few days, Trustees of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s estate had the home appraised and invited in brokers from a number of firms to discuss the listing.brokers said.Despite the cachet of the property\u2019s former owner\u2014a billionaire banker who once controlled Chase Manhattan Bank and wielded wide influence in New York and around the world\u2014the asking price is below the top prices at which Upper East Side townhouses have traded during the last decade because of its location and condition.The listing will come on the market at a time when sales of Manhattan townhouses and other top-end properties have been weak, though brokers said these luxury sales have picked up in recent months.The house was built in a colonial-revival style with modest floral decorations over the arched ground-floor windows.It is located in a less-prime location than many Upper East Side townhouses, mid-block between Third and Lexington avenues, far from the more prestigious addresses on or near Fifth Avenue and Central Park. It sits on a quiet block, but towering apartment buildings loom on the corner on Third Avenue.In its favor: its width. There are only a few dozen single-family townhouses on the Upper East Side that are 40 feet or more wide, according to city tax records, and several are owned by foreign governments.People who have visited Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s home, where he had lived for decades, say it is genteel, but plain and comfortable rather than extravagant\u2014except for the extraordinary paintings and objects on display.Brokers said it is in need of considerable updating by a new owner.Kathryn Wylde,        the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York, a business and civic group, who worked closely with Mr. Rockefeller over many years, said the house on East 65th Street \u201cwas perfectly kept and a reflection of his international travels and his taste in fine art.\u201dThe home was set up for intimate meetings rather than large parties, she said. \u201cEverything about it was fine and warm, traditional, not cold,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.The house, at 146 E. 65th St., is four stories and has 9,760 square feet of space, according to city records. It was built in 1925 for       Adrian Iselin,        an investment banker, and remained in his family until 1948.Jonathan Miller,        an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said the average width of a Manhattan townhouse is about 18 feet. As a result, a wide house can command a top price even if it isn\u2019t in a central location.\u201cTownhouse values skew higher as you move toward the park,\u201d he said, but wide houses are different. \u201cBuyers of a 40-footer aren\u2019t also considering a 20-footer,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you start getting wider than 25 feet it becomes its own market.\u201dIn 2015,       Jim Clark,        the billionaire founder of Netscape, paid $37 million, brokers said, for a 40-foot-wide townhouse at 125 E. 70th St. that was one block closer to Central Park, between Lexington and Park avenues.And in 2009,       Madonna       paid a total of $32 million for three adjacent townhouses on East 81st Street between the same avenues that bracket the Rockefeller townhouse, to create a mansion that is 58 feet wide, including a garage.Mr. Rockefeller isn\u2019t the only notable person who lived on the block.       Richard M. Nixon       bought the adjacent townhouse in 1979, and sold it a few years later to the Syrian government.Write to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Rockefeller Townhouse on the Block.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-uses-elephants-and-camels-to-map-remote-parts-of-the-globe-1496844063", "news_time": "2017-06-07 10:01:00", "news_title": "Google Uses Elephants and Camels to Map Remote Parts of the Globe", "keywords": "digital mapping ,google ,google australia ,google maps,maps and tech companies ,uluru ,Alphabet Inc.

One hitch: they had to avoid photographing certain parts of the red rock formation that are especially sacred to the local Aboriginal people.Having taken shots of many of the world\u2019s streets using cameras on vehicles, Google is moving to more difficult locations. On the South Pacific island of Vanuatu, where it captured images of a volcano, the company sought to photograph lava without any of its cameras falling in. And in Cambodia, monkeys destroyed its equipment.The images are being used to enhance Street View, a component of the company\u2019s popular Google Maps app, as the company searches for new features that will entice users. Starting today, users will be able to take a continuous, virtual walk around much of Uluru.Maps are becoming more important to the world\u2019s largest technology companies as they chase billions of dollars in potential advertising revenue and invest in something that is crucial to the autonomous-vehicle industry. The value of ads that are based on a user\u2019s location will grow to $32 billion by 2021 from $12 billion in 2016 in the U.S., according to estimates from BIA/Kelsey, a media and advertising consulting firm. These location-targeted ads will take up 45% of the mobile-ad market by 2021, the firm said, up from 38% last year.Google, a part of             Alphabet Inc.,        GOOGL -0.05%       has been cautiously adding advertising to Google Maps. Last year, it unveiled \u201cpromoted pins,\u201d where location markers appear in different colors to advertise certain businesses. The challenge for Google is integrating ads without cluttering the app.Competitors in mapping includeApple Inc.       and a host of other players, including privately-held Here Technologies, which is part-owned by German automakers             Audi AG      ,             BMW AG       and             Daimler AG      . In the market for general consumers, Google has a clear lead. Google Maps was the fourth most popular mobile app overall in the U.S., while Apple Maps was the 12th most popular, according to a 2016 report from comScore.On Monday, Apple said it would add floor plans for airports and malls in cities like Hong Kong, London and Chicago to its Maps app. It also is updating the app to show speed limits and lane navigation for drivers. The company hasn\u2019t said anything about extending its maps to remote locations.While Here Technologies isn\u2019t focusing on cultural sites like Uluru in the same way as Google is, it has a fleet of camera-equipped cars mapping roads in remote regions of the Philippines.\u201cCars have been stuck in mud, cars have not been too successful in crossing creeks and rivers, and cars have been stuck in sand,\u201d said Brent Stafford, Here\u2019s Asia-Pacific director.At Uluru, a roughly 2,800-kilometer drive northwest of Sydney in the central Australian desert, Google relied on amateur human cartographers, though in other remote locations, camera packs were donned by animals. An elephant helped to map in Thailand, and a camel wore a camera pack in the United Arab Emirates.\u201cThis is not a case of driving up there in a four-wheel drive and just going off road,\u201d said Casey Whitelaw, engineering director for Google Maps in Sydney.Google was approached by tourism officials from Australia\u2019s Northern Territory, where Uluru is located, to map the site. It also worked with Parks Australia, which operates the country\u2019s national parks, and the Aboriginal community near Uluru. It is a spiritual site for Aboriginal Australians and tourists flock to the red rock to see it change colors at sunrise and sunset.\u201cI hope it\u2019s not going to mean that people will look at it at home and think, \u2018Oh, OK, well I don\u2019t need to go to Uluru now,\u2019\u201d said Sammy Wilson, a local Aboriginal leader who also chairs the board for Uluru\u2019s national park, speaking through an interpreter in the Pitjantjatjara language. \u201cI hope that it will make them think about what more there is to learn and understand and appreciate from visiting here.\u201dGoogle was given a map that showed which areas of Uluru were too sensitive to photograph. Mr. Wilson offered a metaphor to explain why visitors are discouraged from taking pictures of some areas. He said Uluru as a whole is like a living room, a place to receive visitors. But particularly sacred areas around the rock are like a bedroom, a private area where visitors shouldn\u2019t go.By adding more remote sites to its maps, analysts say Google\u2014which has a reputation for \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects and public-minded goals like organizing the world\u2019s information\u2014is ensuring its consumers will continue to use its app, which offers opportunities to attract users to other company products.Imaging places like a volcano \u201csounds like a very Google-y thing to do, even if that by itself is not something that can be commercialized,\u201d said       Colin Sebastian,        a research analyst at Baird in San Francisco.Write to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Google Maps Travels the Outback.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-military-plane-with-104-aboard-goes-missing-1496838768", "news_time": "2017-06-07 10:00:00", "news_title": "Myanmar Military Plane Goes Missing With 120 Aboard", "keywords": " accident, andaman sea , burma, military plane, missing, myanmar, myeik, on board, passagers, plane, rescue,search,yangon,airplane accidents,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport", "content": "YANGON, Myanmar\u2014A military transport plane with 120 people aboard went missing Wednesday on a flight from southern Myanmar to Yangon, a military spokesman said.Gen.

Air France-KLM SA       and             Deutsche Lufthansa AG       are among the European carriers who have made similar complaints to their national governments and to the Commission.The EU\u2019s response comes at a difficult time for Mideast airlines. Demand for air travel has been hit by low oil prices and a U.S. ban on the use of some electronics on inbound flights from some Middle East airports including Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi.Qatar\u2019s flag carrier is under further pressure due to the move by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to isolate the Qatari government. The U.A.E. closed all Qatar Airways offices in the country on Wednesday, one day after Saudi Arabia did the same. The countries have also blocked flights to and from Qatar.The proposed EU legislation, which needs to be approved by the European Parliament and a body representing member states, comes as the bloc tries to negotiate far-reaching aviation agreements with countries such as the U.A.E. and Qatar, which would replace existing deals struck with individual EU states.The Commission is also trying to clarify longstanding airline ownership-and-control rules that limit foreign ownership to 49%.Foreign investment in European carriers, including Etihad\u2019s 29.2% stake in             Air Berlin                   PLC and a 49% holding in Alitalia before that airline entered bankruptcy protection, has raised questions over whether a minority owner may exerts control over decision making. Etihad has said it works closely with its partners while complying with EU rules.EU member states are responsible for ensuring investments in their airlines comply with the ownership-and control-rules. The guidelines are intended to ensure all countries apply the same yardstick and potential investors know what power they have to shape the future of the airline they are buying into.\u201cWe are trying to create legal certainty\u201d for all, Ms. Bulc said, adding that the caps on foreign ownership of airlines wouldn\u2019t be lifted.The EU\u2019s action comes at a pivotal time for Italy, which is seeking an investor to keep perennially unprofitable Alitalia flying. Alitalia has lost money for years amid high costs and growing competition from budget airlines.Rome is in talks with potential investors that may take a stake in the airline and has pledged more than $600 million to keep the carrier airborne through the busy summer travel season.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-cybersecurity-law-tested-by-iphone-information-theft-1496842716", "news_time": "2017-06-07 09:38:00", "news_title": "Apple iPhone Data Theft Tests China\u2019s New Cybersecurity Law", "keywords": "apple,china,cybersecurity,iphone,Apple,AAPL,Jack Ma, Liu Chunquan,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,contracts,orders,corporate,industrial news,outsourcing,regulatory breach,political,general news,crime,privacy issues,information security,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,smartphones,technology", "content": "BEIJING\u2014A week after China\u2019s first cybersecurity law took effect, an investigation over the alleged theft and sale of iPhone users\u2019 information looked set to test how well             Apple Inc.        AAPL -0.18%       and other companies protect Chinese citizens\u2019 personal data.Police in eastern China said they had detained 22 people, including 20 from Apple \u201cdirect sales outlets\u201d in China and companies Apple outsources services to. Police said those detained had used Apple\u2019s internal system to illegally obtain information associated with iPhone products like phone numbers, names and Apple IDs, and then sold the information.A statement by police in Cangnan county in Zhejiang province gave no further information on the Apple outlets involved, or details on the two other people detained. Calls to the police\u2019s news department went unanswered.The statement said the 22, who were detained May 3, charged from 10 yuan ($1.50) to 180 yuan for each piece of information and that the total amount of money involved was over 50 million yuan.An Apple spokeswoman in China didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.China has long struggled to rein in a robust black market in personal information, prompting one political activist last year to purchase and publish in a form of protest the private data of several Chinese tech CEOs, including             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       co-founder Jack Ma. The activist showed evidence of one vendor offering to sell personal information ostensibly belonging to Chinese President       Xi Jinping       for 1,000 yuan.A core aim of the cybersecurity law is to better protect individuals\u2019 private data, authorities have said.iPhone users\u2019 information is highly prized on the black market because of the belief they are more affluent. Obtaining data such as a user\u2019s Apple ID could help hackers lock iPhones remotely and then demand payment from the user to unlock it. The potential for abuse widens further if hackers gain access to a user\u2019s cloud storage.Ahead of the June 1 implementation of the cybersecurity law, foreign technology companies expressed concern, saying they were uncertain how it would affect their operations. Specific measures to comply with the law\u2019s mandates on protection of personal information are still being worked out, according to the regulator, China\u2019s Cyberspace Administration.Under earlier laws, companies have largely escaped punishment when employees used their access to internal computer systems to steal users\u2019 personal data, according to Liu Chunquan, an intellectual property lawyer with Shanghai-based Duan & Duan Law Firm.That has changed under the cybersecurity law, Mr. Liu said, with companies now potentially facing fines and other punishment by regulators unless they can prove their systems weren\u2019t to blame for leaks.\u201cNow with this law, Apple as a company faces much greater legal risk than it would have before,\u201d he said.A company could face fines of as much as 10 times the illegal revenue from a theft if it is found to have had inadequate protections against a leak, according to the law. In serious situations, regulators can temporarily close or revoke the business licenses of companies found in violation of the new law.Based on information police have released so far, government authorities could now have grounds to look into potential holes in Apple\u2019s internal data management in China, said You Yunting, a partner with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices.Cangnan police posted a series of photos of officers detaining and interrogating the detainees on the popular             WeChat                   messaging app. In one image, several people are shown standing in front of a police station in handcuffs.

Expectations were for a 3% rise, according to economists at Royal Bank of Canada.The previous month\u2019s building-permits data were revised higher, and now suggest permits decreased 4.9% versus the earlier estimate of a 5.8% decline.Building permits are meant to provide an early indication of construction activity in Canada and are based on a survey of 2,400 municipalities, representing 95% of the country\u2019s population. A permit gives a contractor the right to build but doesn\u2019t necessarily suggest construction has commenced.On a year-over-year basis, permits issued fell 3.3%. Building-permit data tend to be volatile on a month-over-month basis.Of particular note in the building-permits report was data for Toronto, which has been the prime of concern of policy makers in terms of frothy real-estate markets. The data agency said the Toronto market in April recorded the lowest level of single-family construction intentions and the lowest number of new single-family dwelling units approved since January 2016.The provincial government of Ontario\u00a0introduced roughly a dozen measures in April aiming to end housing speculation and curb house-price gains of 30% on a one-year basis. Chief among them was a 15% tax on foreign buyers of residential real estate in the greater Toronto region.The Bank of Canada had warned price gains in Toronto weren\u2019t sustainable, based on economic fundamentals.Overall, the value of building permits\u2014residential and nonresidential\u2014issued in Toronto fell 13.5% on a month-over-month basis, and a whopping 50.4% in the nearby city of Hamilton, Ontario.For the country as a whole, the value of residential permits fell 2.5% in April to C$4.47 billion, while nonresidential permits rose 4.1% to C$2.58 billion.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-weapons-fund-promotes-joint-development-1496826004", "news_time": "2017-06-07 09:13:00", "news_title": "EU Dedicates \u20ac500 Million to Unifying Its Fractured Defense Market", "keywords": "defense spending, eu defense,eu military, eu military spending, eu weapons, nato,north atlantic treaty organization,European Union,Donald Trump,contracts,orders,defense contracts,government contracts,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,politics,international relations,domestic politics,weapons programs,military armored vehicles,parts,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods", "content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Fresh on the heels of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       call for allies to increase military spending, the European Union\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0announced \u20ac500 million ($563 million) in funding by 2020 for a new program to unify its fractured defense market and jointly develop advanced weapon systems.European officials hope the initiative, in the works long before Mr. Trump\u2019s exhortation, will benefit from his push for European governments to spend more on defense. It may also help to blunt criticism from Washington.The history of attempts to unify Europe\u2019s fractured defense industry and military acquisition programs is littered with expensive failures. Defense analysts say national governments have repeatedly sought to direct limited resources to local companies.This time, the thinking is relatively modest. The EU will use the fund to\u00a0co-finance\u00a0several\u00a0projects ranging from \u20ac500 million to \u20ac1 billion\u00a0to develop a new generation of weaponry.European countries spend relatively little on military research. EU members, excluding the \u00a0U.K., which is departing, together devote roughly \u20ac5 billion annually to military research and development.The Pentagon, in contrast, spends roughly $80 billion annually to develop new equipment. Mr. Trump last month used a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders to blast allies for insufficient military spending that he said\u00a0unfairly\u00a0burdened U.S. taxpayers.While European diplomats were surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s hectoring tone, most accept that defense outlays must increase. Germany plans an 8% increase this year, but many analysts say even that won\u2019t close the gap. Jointly funded projects could help direct increased spending to needed European capabilities such as drones, cyber and robotics, officials and analysts say.The U.S. has pushed Europe to buy American weaponry, but European officials want spending to support EU companies.Previous European multinational defense programs have foundered, run over budget or failed to deliver capabilities on time.\u201cIt is the classic difficultly in a multinational program,\u201d said Douglas Barrie, a defense analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cToo many chefs, not enough bottle washers.\u201dThe new defense fund eschews the traditional approach to defense cooperation, driven by giant projects such as the Eurofighter combat jet or multinational conglomerates such as Europe\u2019s             Airbus SE.Instead, it will offer a cash boost to smaller defense-focused firms across the EU that are willing to cooperate. The goal is to convert ideas and research into actual defense equipment.Under the program, EU funds must be matched by national governments who commit to buy the weaponry developed under the initiative. The aim is to deliver \u20ac2.5 billion in overall European defense spending. More EU funding is expected after 2020.Money will go only to projects that use at least three companies in two countries. Officials have already been prodding defense and finance ministries to pitch projects. One project that could find favor is a multinational drone. The initiative is currently in a research phase due to end next year.Over time, officials hope they can use an expanded defense fund to encourage EU governments to cooperate on a raft of critical defense infrastructure, identifying more strategically common defense projects such as air-to-air refueling capabilities, which Europe badly lacks.In the past NATO has looked skeptically on EU defense projects, but more recently the alliance has sought closer ties with the bloc and backed its military initiatives as long as they don\u2019t duplicate the alliance\u2019s work.NATO Secretary-General       Jens Stoltenberg       praised the new EU initiative Wednesday, saying the fund could help develop new capabilities and create incentives for European countries to work together. \u201cIt will help us both to spend more and to spend better,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said.Officials would like the defense fund to work with another initiative that Brussels hopes to launch this year, a new military platform that would allow smaller groups of EU countries to develop common defense projects and missions without requiring the backing of all member states.European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker       and Czech Prime Minister       Bohuslav Sobotka       wrote this week in The Wall Street Journal\u00a0that without change, EU defense spending would remain inefficient.\u201cWhen it comes to defense, the EU has taken a scattershot approach,\u201d they wrote, citing 178 different weapon systems in the EU versus 30 in the U.S., and 18 European main battle tanks compared with one in the U.S.EU governments must still approve the fund. For many, the project marks another step away from the long-held taboo that EU resources shouldn\u2019t be spent for military purposes. EU leaders, such as France\u2019s new president,       Emmanuel Macron,        have become increasingly outspoken on the need for the EU to enhance its military prowess.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Julian E.

But in markets-obsessed Hong Kong, Muddy Waters\u2019       Carson Block       comes close.Certainly, Mr. Block\u2019s visit to Asia\u2019s leading financial center has caused a stir in its stock market this week. Investors and companies were on tenterhooks after Mr. Block said on Tuesday he would announce his latest target at the Sohn Hong Kong investor conference Wednesday.Even after Mr. Block revealed his next target\u2014        Man Wah Holdings Ltd.      , a Hong Kong-listed furniture maker\u2014the whirlwind continued. Man Wah\u2019s shares slumped by as much as 15.4%, leading to a halt in its trading.His impact, though, was arguably just as great on stocks he hasn\u2019t decided to target. Shares in companies that had fallen sharply the day before, as investors tried to guess who was on the Muddy Waters radar, suddenly surged back on Wednesday after Mr. Block finished speaking.         Tongda Group Holdings               Ltd., a maker of smartphone casings, rebounded 8.9%, after falling 10% the day before. Water supplier         China Water Affairs Group Ltd.       jumped 3.5% after it had dropped 9.4% on Tuesday.The violent swings in some shares Tuesday and Wednesday illustrate the outsized impact on markets investors such as Mr. Block can generate. Short sellers like Muddy Waters borrow shares to sell them with the hopes of buying them back at a cheaper price later on, aiming to profit from a price decline.Mr. Block\u2019s previous prescient calls on Chinese companies have made him a superstar at the annual Hong Kong edition of the Sohn conference, where a variety of market participants are given a short time slot to explain their latest big investing idea. On Wednesday, his every move was tracked by a mob of local reporters.Mr. Block shot to fame in 2011 following his campaign against Chinese forestry company Sino-Forest Corp., which filed for bankruptcy the following year. Late last year, he announced he had short sold China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co., which operates the most dairy farms in China, saying the company was worth \u201cclose to zero.\u201d In March, its shares fell 85% in a day and they have been halted since, with the company this week admitting it had lost track of most of its cash.During Mr. Block\u2019s presentation Wednesday he showed slides of a sofa he said he had dismantled as part of his research. He claimed Man Wah had failed to disclose all of its debt and that there were inconsistencies in its taxes that are \u201ca strong indicator of fraud.\u201dA spokeswoman for Man Wah, a Hong Kong-based company valued at $3.3 billion, said the company is aware of the Muddy Waters allegations and is looking into the matter. She said the company would issue a clarification statement in response to the claims. According to its website, Man Wah mostly develops and produces household items like sofas and mattresses, selling into markets including the U.S. and Europe.Proponents of short selling argue that a healthy amount of skepticism can be good for stock prices. But detractors say short sellers can sometimes unfairly push share prices lower simply by announcing a new target, whether such moves are warranted or not.Some at the conference on Wednesday weren\u2019t swept up in the Muddy Waters mania.\u201cIn a venue like this, speakers have 15 minutes to explain their trades and most of the time they can\u2019t get through all the information on each slide,\u201d said       Yuriy Humber,        managing director at Yuri Invest Research. In the case of Muddy Waters, \u201cyou see people trading purely on the reputation of the speaker,\u201d he said.Martin Wheatley,        former chief executive of the Hong Kong Securities & Futures Commission, the local market regulator, kicked off the conference with a speech touting the benefits that short sellers bring to the market, as they encourage more transparency and better price discovery. He said Hong Kong had one of \u201cthe most robust short-selling systems in the world.\u201d Mr. Wheatley joined Oasis Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, last month as an advisor.\u201cIt\u2019s not very often that a regulator stands up and says short sellers are good for the market,\u201d Mr. Humber said. \u201cThat really says something about the environment here.\u201dWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com, Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com and Joanne Chiu at joanne.chiu@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Star Short Trader Stirs Up Hong Kong.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-rockefellers-art-heads-to-auction-1496809800", "news_time": "2017-06-07 09:06:00", "news_title": "David Rockefeller\u2019s Art Heads to Auction", "keywords": "Christie's,art,art collecting,auctions,political,general news,charities,philanthropy,society,community,arts,entertainment,retail,wholesale,specialty stores,auction houses", "content": "Billionaire banker       David Rockefeller       collected beetles as a boy, but the trove of paintings, porcelain and silver he gathered over his century-long life could top $700 million when it heads to auction at Christie\u2019s next spring.The Rockefeller estate is poised to be the most expensive art collection the auction industry has ever handled, surpassing designer Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s $484 million estate sale at Christie\u2019s eight years ago and shopping-mall magnate A. Alfred Taubman\u2019s $469 million estate sale at             Sotheby\u2019s                   two years ago.Christie\u2019s confirmed Tuesday that it had won the right to sell roughly 2,000 pieces from the estate of Mr. Rockefeller, who died in March at age 101, and his wife, Peggy. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas, said the house wants to finish cataloguing everything before providing details on art or an overall estimate. Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s will said the banker expected his estate\u2019s liquidated assets to top $700 million. A former Christie\u2019s executive with knowledge of the deal said the house also expects the sale of the collection to cross that bar.Collectors pay premiums for art owned by fabled families and the Rockefeller name could transform the Christie\u2019s sale into auction theater. When Sotheby\u2019s offered up a 1950 Mark Rothko abstract from Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s collection in 2007, the house billed it as the Rockefeller Rothko, and the painting sold for $72.8 million, a record at the time for post-war art. Four years ago, when Christie\u2019s consigned a Botticelli \u201cMadonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist\u201d that once belonged to Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s father, the house dubbed the work the Rockefeller Madonna\u2014and sold it for $10.4 million, above its $7 million high estimate.As the last surviving grandson of Standard Oil baron John. D. Rockefeller\u2014the country\u2019s first billionaire\u2014David Rockefeller grew up in luxury and learned how to collect art by watching his mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, who championed modern artists like Wassily Kandinsky at a time when the world\u2019s wealthy were more taken by impressionists such as Claude Monet. Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s own tastes initially leaned toward heavyweights like Paul Cezanne and Camille Pissarro, but over time his homes in New York and Maine came to display a broader array of artists, from American painters like Andrew Wyeth to post-war mainstays like Willem de Kooning. As a longtime chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan Bank, he traveled widely and grew to admire Asian art.Dozens of works from his collection already have been pledged to New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, which his mother helped found in 1929. Mr. Porter said the rest going up for auction are of \u201cequal and astonishing significance.\u201dFamily spokesman Fraser Seitel said that in keeping with Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s 2010 pledge to give away the majority of his wealth, proceeds from the estate sale will be donated to a dozen charities, universities such as Harvard and cultural institutions like MoMA. In terms of art-related philanthropy, such a gift would rank near the top: In 1991, publisher Walter Annenberg left $1 billion to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and four years ago, cosmetics executive Leonard Lauder promised to give the same museum roughly $1 billion worth of cubist art.\u201cBecause he was blessed with great wealth, he always felt a responsibility to give back to society,\u201d Mr. Seitel said of Mr. Rockefeller. \u201cHe lived that credo every day of his life.\u201dChristie\u2019s plans to hold the auction in its New York saleroom in Rockefeller Center.Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.comAppeared in the June 7, 2017, print edition as 'rOCKEFELLER ESTATE TO GO ON THE BLOCK.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/effort-expands-to-boost-punishment-for-police-killers-1496840401", "news_time": "2017-06-07 09:00:00", "news_title": "Effort Expands to Boost Punishment for Police Killers", "keywords": "congress,crime,death penalty,officer down,police killed,police killers,police shootings,police shot,trump,John Cornyn,Trump,political,general news,national,public security,legal action,capital punishment,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations,domestic politics", "content": "After a rise in the number of police officers murdered last year, the       Trump       administration and some Republicans in Congress are pushing for tougher punishments for those convicted of killing police, including the death penalty.The Wall Street Journal looked at people charged with or convicted of fatally shooting a police officer from 2012 through 2016. In that five-year period, 6% received the death penalty and 47% face or could face capital punishment, according to the analysis of data from the Officer Down Memorial Page, a nonprofit group that honors fallen officers.The analysis also found that 29% received a life sentence, 10% face a life sentence and 7% were given less than a life sentence.President Donald Trump said during his campaign that all those convicted of killing police would get the death penalty under his administration, and one of his earliest executive orders called for\u00a0harsher punishments for violence against law-enforcement personnel.Last year, 66 law-enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty, up from 41 in 2015, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In a bloody span in July, five police were gunned down at a protest in Dallas, and three were killed in Baton Rouge, La.In Congress, bills are moving forward that would make killing or assaulting most officers a federal crime and make it more likely for those convicted of such murders to face the federal death penalty.Yet even as death sentences have declined sharply nationwide, more than half of those charged with fatally shooting a police officer from 2012 through 2016 are on death row or facing the death penalty, according to the Journal analysis of data from the Officer Down group.An additional 38% were sentenced to life in prison or currently face that punishment,\u00a0the\u00a0analysis found.An unusual coalition of state prosecutors and civil rights activists\u2014groups frequently at odds on criminal justice issues\u2014oppose the congressional bills, saying they are unnecessary and include provisions that would limit the filing of civil lawsuits in police brutality cases.Any prosecutor who doesn\u2019t already pursue a police killer to the full extent of the law \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a prosecutor for very long,\u201d said       Bill Fitzpatrick,        chairman of the National District Attorneys Association and the district attorney in Onondaga County, New York.\u00a0\u201cThere are lots of other things that state and local prosecutors need federal assistance on and this isn\u2019t one of them.\u201dOne of the bills, which the House passed last month, would make the murder of a police officer, firefighter or other first responder an \u201caggravating factor\u201d in federal sentencing decisions.Another bill, sponsored by the No. 2 Senate Republican,       John Cornyn       of Texas, would create a new federal crime for murdering a law enforcement officer; a convicted killer would be subject to the death penalty, while assaulting an officer would carry a mandatory-minimum sentence.Congress has broad power to enact criminal laws, even affecting behavior that isn\u2019t federal in nature.Police unions have applauded these efforts, especially, they say, because the previous administration was too quick to criticize law enforcement.\u201cWhen you\u2019re killing somebody whose main responsibility is to preserve life and happiness, you are showing a total disregard for humanity,\u201d said\u00a0Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which has 330,000 members.Police murder cases rarely go unsolved. Nearly all\u201499%\u2014were cleared over the past five years, meaning the suspect was either arrested, killed or identified.\u00a0The national clearance rate for murders of all types is 62%.Just a little more than half of the 200 people suspected of fatally shooting a police officer in the five years from 2012 through 2016 lived to face the justice system. Ninety-two were killed by police, died while fleeing or committed suicide.Under state laws, police\u00a0killers\u00a0automatically qualify for the harshest sentences.Even in Pennsylvania\u2014where the governor has halted executions\u2014prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for       Ray Shetler Jr.      , accused of fatally shooting\u00a0St. Clair Township Officer       Lloyd Reed Jr.       when he responded to a domestic disturbance call at the man\u2019s home in 2015.An attorney for Mr. Shetler said his client had a strong defense and that it was too early to comment on the death penalty. The prosecutor didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.In Florida, Orlando prosecutor       Aramis Ayala\u2019s       recent decision to forgo the death penalty in a police killing provoked Gov.       Rick Scott       to remove her, drawing a national backlash from civil rights groups that point to research showing minorities are disproportionately sent to death row.But the Florida instance is unusual, according to the data analysis.In cases headed to trial where prosecutors have made up their minds whether to seek the death penalty, 30 out of 31 are\u00a0currently seeking the capital punishment, according to the Journal\u2019s analysis. The exception is a Texas case involving an alleged killer with serious mental health problems.Six convicted police\u00a0killers\u00a0were sentenced to death over the five-year period.Twenty-nine got life without parole, two received more than 100 years in prison, and five got between 25 and 99 years. Though two-thirds of these sentences were in states with the death penalty, but the defendants were spared that punishment, often due to mental problems or because a plea deal was struck with the approval of the officer\u2019s family.Chris Cosgriff,        executive director of Officer Down, said his organization does \u201cnot take an official position on any pending legislation; however, we do believe that prosecutors should always seek the most severe punishment allowed by law for defendants charged with killing a law enforcement officer.\u201dWilliam Johnson,        executive director\u00a0of the National Association of Police Organizations, which represents about 240,000 officers, backs the proposed legislation that would allow the federal government to pursue the death penalty in states that don\u2019t have it.He said the intent isn\u2019t to disparage the job that local prosecutors are doing but to show that the federal government won\u2019t tolerate violence against law enforcement.Criminal-justice experts said that ratcheting up penalties won\u2019t do anything to prevent violence against police.\u201cIf they\u2019re talking about deterrence it\u2019s a sham,\u201d said       Michael Radelet,        a professor who specializes in capital punishment at University of Colorado Boulder. The fact that so many gunmen die at the hands of police or by suicide shows that the fear of the death penalty doesn\u2019t weigh heavily on their minds, he said.The 31 states that have the death penalty also have a higher per capita rate of police killings than states that don\u2019t, raising more questions about its impact on deterrence, according to a study by the Death Penalty Information Center, a\u00a0nonpartisan\u00a0research organization.Write to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com and Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-restaurant-opening-in-nomas-old-space-1496840400", "news_time": "2017-06-07 09:00:00", "news_title": "The New Restaurant Opening in Noma\u2019s Old Space", "keywords": "best restaurants in the world,copenhagen,danish cuisine,noma ,rene redzepi,Sn\u00f8hetta,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,partnerships,collaborations,facility closures,facility openings,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,reviews,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,technical services,architects,surveyors,business,consumer services,real estate,construction,leisure,arts,hospitality", "content": "THORSTEN SCHMIDT, a 40-year-old German-born Danish chef, has been keeping a secret for more than a year. Eighteen months ago, after years of discussions, he signed a partnership agreement with Ren\u00e9 Redzepi to open a restaurant in the space where Redzepi has operated his world-famous establishment, Noma, since 2003. (Noma, which closed in February, is scheduled to re-open at another location in Copenhagen later this year.) The new restaurant, called Barr\u2014Old Norse for barley\u2014will launch July 5 with a 17-item \u00e0 la carte menu of dishes inspired by the traditional fare of countries that surround the North Sea.The architectural firm Sn\u00f8hetta has designed Barr\u2019s dining room to accommodate 64 guests\u2014up from 40 at Noma\u2014with space for an additional 30 people in the bar. A brew master has been hired to collaborate on beer making in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Iceland; it was beer research, in fact, that nearly gave Schmidt\u2019s secret away. \u201cNormally I\u2019m not a big beer drinker,\u201d says Schmidt, in his first interview about the restaurant. \u201cMy family was like, \u2018What is happening, Schmidt? You never drink beer.\u2019 \u201dRedzepi and Schmidt have known each other since the earliest days of New Nordic Cuisine, dating back to when it was a manifesto but not yet a sensation. At the time of Noma\u2019s launch, Schmidt was training for a national chefs\u2019 competition (one he ultimately won) and spent a couple of weeks working in the Noma kitchen, helping Redzepi introduce Danes to a style of cuisine that would go on to make Copenhagen an unlikely home to the most influential culinary movement of its generation.In 2005, Schmidt opened his own critically acclaimed restaurant, Malling & Schmidt, in Aarhus, Denmark\u2019s second-largest city, working with local, New Nordic ingredients that were revolutionary at the time. He made ice cream with freshly chopped oak and prepared vegetables with roasted hay. \u201cThat was unthinkable,\u201d says Schmidt. \u201cNow it\u2019s a known thing.\u201dAt Barr, though menu items appear to be simpler, Schmidt will apply the kinds of techniques that he and Redzepi have spent the past decade perfecting. Diners will be able to order frikadeller, pork meatballs that are ubiquitous throughout Copenhagen and a staple in every grandmother\u2019s repertoire. Schmidt\u2019s version, however, is glazed with \u201cBarrmite,\u201d Barr\u2019s take on Marmite, and a byproduct of its brewing efforts (tests with different types of beer yeast are ongoing as Barrmite continues to evolve). And there\u2019s schnitzel, except this schnitzel features aged pork breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and powdered barley koji. Lactofermentations and garums (fermented pastes made from proteins like beef, pork, shrimp or grasshopper) will also be incorporated into a variety of dishes.Barr\u2019s cuisine is rooted in traditional home cooking and comfort food but with flavors and techniques few homes have access to. \u201cEighty percent of a dish will be something you know,\u201d says Schmidt. \u201cTwenty percent will be a new discovery.\u201d Redzepi says Schmidt\u2019s menu has been researched with the same rigor as his own at Noma.\u201cHe\u2019s approached it like you would any fine-dining tasting menu, even though it\u2019s a meatball,\u201d says Redzepi, just back from Noma\u2019s two-month-long residency at a pop-up location, built in Tulum, Mexico. He\u2019d arrived home to a fridge stocked by Schmidt with some of the items he\u2019d been developing for Barr. \u201cLiver paste and rye bread and a rhubarb compote,\u201d says Redzepi. \u201cIt was all very, very, very delicious.\u201d\u201cThis is a casual thing,\u201d says Schmidt, \u201cnothing snobby.\u201d Still, he does appreciate the historic weight of where he\u2019ll be cooking.\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic space,\u201d says Redzepi. \u201cYou have to do well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like the biggest honor ever,\u201d says Schmidt."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-attacks-pentagon-report-laments-u-s-cold-war-mentality-1496833957", "news_time": "2017-06-07 08:54:00", "news_title": "China Attacks Pentagon Report, Laments U.S. \u2018Cold War Mentality\u2019", "keywords": "africa,asia,beijing,china,china military,cold war,djibouti,dod,maritime militia,military bases,people\u2019s liberation army,pla,south china sea,the pentagon,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,defense department,executive branch", "content": "BEIJING\u2014China pushed back against a Pentagon warning about the Chinese military\u2019s growing ambitions outside Asia, calling the U.S. report \u201cirresponsible\u201d and saying China\u2019s defense policy was aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty.In a new report on the Chinese military published Tuesday, the U.S. Defense Department said China\u2019s military, the People\u2019s Liberation Army, was likely to try to expand its operations outside the region, while strengthening its ability to defend expansive territorial claims closer to home.\u201cChina\u2019s defense is for safeguarding China\u2019s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing Tuesday.

It ranks it among the best-performing hedge funds globally in what is proving to be another challenging year for the sector, according to WSJ-compiled data.The gains come as a boost for Lansdowne after its flagship Developed Markets fund, run by       Peter Davies       and       Jonathon Regis,        lost nearly 15% last year, one of its worst calendar year performances. This year that fund is up around 7%, according to numbers sent to investors.Named after a village in central France where Mr. Joab\u2019s family comes from, the Princay fund takes very large, concentrated positions in European stocks.

The adviser, who handles nearly $150 million in assets, particularly enjoys guiding women through changes such as divorce, widowhood or career shifts. \u201cIt\u2019s tough\u2026I know what it\u2019s like to face some of the challenges,\u201d she says.On working with women in transition: Ms. Renchik finds that the women she works with often know more about financial matters than they give themselves credit for. She sees this across the board with her clients going through transitions, whether they\u2019re career-minded or caregivers. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising and gratifying to have honest conversations and to watch clients understand that they do understand this and can make good, sound decisions,\u201d she says.On avoiding emotional reactions to market changes: Clients frequently voice concern about how global or political headlines might affect their investments as they home in on retirement or are in the midst of personal upheaval. Ms. Renchik advises them to refer to their original financial plan. \u201cEmotional reactions to things we can\u2019t control lead to mistakes,\u201d she says. She reminds clients that their personal financial plan was built to withstand volatility and that any adjustments should be made thoughtfully and intentionally.What clients are saying: Ms. Renchik notes that her clients are less concerned about the nuts and bolts of investing than they are worried about remaining independent. \u201cThe biggest concern from women in transition is, \u2018Am I going to have enough to take care of myself and to spend on my children and grandchildren?\u2019 \u201dOn the biggest industry challenge: Ms. Renchik worries about cybersecurity and data protection in the financial industry in a rapidly evolving technological age. She believes that the challenge of protecting clients\u2019 assets must be approached with consistency and rigor.On playing an instrument and financial advising: Ms. Renchik, who plays the piano, notes that both financial planning and learning an instrument require discipline, intention and focus. Yet, neither form is rigid. \u201cOnce you learn the fundamentals, you can add flourishes, personal tweaks and expression,\u201d she says.Proudest professional achievement is\u2026 \u201cWhen I see women grow and feel comfortable and confident in managing their financial affairs,\u201d says Ms. Renchik.\u2014Compiled by Lynn Shattuck"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-market-squeeze-starts-to-strangle-small-businesses-1496838908", "news_time": "2017-06-07 08:35:00", "news_title": "China Market Squeeze Starts to Strangle Small Businesses", "keywords": "china bond yields,china regulation,china regulators,deleveraging,pboc,The People's Bank of China,corporate,industrial news,small,medium businesses,economic performance,indicators,bank loan data,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news", "content": "SHANGHAI\u2014A sharp rise in the cost of borrowing in China\u2019s bond markets is the latest sign of conflict between Beijing\u2019s effort to rein in financial-system risk and its long-term goal of modernizing the economy.In a little-noticed shift, Chinese companies in recent weeks have been able to take out medium-term bank loans at a lower interest rate than bond investors demand. The average yield on AAA-rated five-year corporate bonds, currently 4.90%, has been above the central bank\u2019s corresponding benchmark lending rate of 4.75% since May 3, according to data provider WIND Info.The highly unusual reversal\u2014it hadn\u2019t happened since records began in 2006\u2014is largely down to Chinese regulators\u2019 attempts to tamp down speculation by investment funds that borrow heavily to leverage their bets.\u201cBeijing\u2019s deleveraging campaign is the main driver behind higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, from money-market rates to bond yields, and even banks are under pressure too,\u201d said Teck Kin Suan, senior economist at             United Overseas Bank                   in Singapore.The bond-rate surge is bad news for small and midsize private businesses, which typically have little access to bank loans. Corporate bond issuance has slumped and the number of companies scrapping bond plans has surged.\u2018The argument that now more companies will switch to traditional bank lending only stands in theory.\u2019The surge also marks a setback for Beijing\u2019s longstanding pledge to let capital markets play a bigger role than state-run lenders in funding the world\u2019s No. 2 economy\u2014a change that in theory should make capital allocation more efficient.The People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s campaign to tame highly leveraged investing began last summer and intensified in February and March when it twice raised a suite of key money-market interest rates. Government bonds haven\u2019t been spared: The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to a 29-month high of 3.69% on May 12 and has remained elevated since.Faced with soaring borrowing costs, a record 382 Chinese companies have delayed or cancelled a total of 327.7 billion yuan ($48.2 billion) in planned new bonds since the start of this year, up from 348 companies and 284.2 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.Total new corporate-bond issuance this year stands at 1.7 trillion yuan, down sharply from 4.1 trillion yuan at this point last year. Subtracting maturing bonds, net corporate bond financing since the start of the year stands at a negative 521.3 billion yuan, compared with a positive 1.9 trillion yuan a year earlier.While the economy has remained robust, growing 6.9% in the first quarter, some economists foresee a slowdown later in 2017 as it becomes harder for companies to raise funds. China\u2019s economy has been fueled in recent years by ever-rising credit, which has sent total corporate debt soaring to the equivalent of 150% of gross domestic product.\u201cThe argument that now more companies will switch to traditional bank lending only stands in theory. In reality, it\u2019s very hard to do so because banks are under pressure and even big state-run enterprises are finding it difficult to get cheap loans now,\u201d said       Liu Dongliang,        senior economist at             China Merchants Bank.Mr. Liu said companies that have put off issuing bonds in hopes of a retreat in borrowing costs need to accept that this has grown unlikely.\u201cPeople need to give up their false hope now,\u201d he said.Write to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-new-big-bet-augmented-reality-1496779717", "news_time": "2017-06-07 08:29:00", "news_title": "Apple\u2019s New Big Bet: Augmented Reality ", "keywords": "apple, apple developer conference, apple glasses, apple worldwide developers conference, ar, arkit, augmented reality, augmented reality apps, augmented reality glasses, augmented reality tool kit , pokemon go, tim cook, virtual reality,Apple,AAPL,Snap,SNAP,eMarketer,Ikea International,Microsoft,MSFT,Magic Leap,Alphabet Inc.

The technology is different from virtual reality, which uses computer headsets to create fully immersive digital worlds.Roughly 40 million people in the U.S. are expected to use augmented reality this year, up 30% from last year, according to research firm eMarketer. It estimates the total will rise to 54 million in 2019.Craig Federighi,        Apple\u2019s head of software, demonstrated the potential of Apple\u2019s new technology platform, ARKit, at the company\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference keynote Monday.While viewing a table on stage through an iPhone screen, Mr. Federighi added virtual images of a steaming cup of coffee and lamp. The images appeared to rest directly on the table, recognizing the real-world surface rather than floating above it.Apple Chief Executive       Tim Cook       has been a big proponent of augmented reality, saying he believes it will have broader success than virtual reality because it is less isolating.Several companies are already working on augmented reality, including headsets in development from         Microsoft Corp.       and Magic Leap Inc. Alphabet\u2019s Google Tango platform has been available on some smartphones for a about a year.Apple\u2019s ARKit, though, has the potential to democratize the technology by bringing it to roughly a billion devices without requiring separate hardware or software, as some competitors do. The company says the system uses camera data to find horizontal planes in a room and estimate the amount of light available.\u201cIt\u2019s a seminal event in the journey toward AR that Apple\u2019s come out and shipped something,\u201d said Matt Miesnieks, co-founder of 6D.ai, a computer-vision startup. He expects developers to use the software because of its relative simplicity and potential to reach across Apple\u2019s large user base.IKEA International A/S and Lego A/S are already working on augmented-reality apps using ARKit that could allow people to visualize furniture in their home or a virtual image of Lego Batman, Mr. Federighi said.Representatives of Wingnut AR, an augmented-reality studio from \u201cLord Of The Rings\u201d director Peter Jackson, showed an ARKit-based experience, seen through an iPad, in which airships battled in a virtual town square that was digitally dropped on a real table on stage, with the audience visible in the background.Apple\u2019s announcement came two months after Facebook opened its augmented-reality tools to developers. CEO       Mark Zuckerberg       said he expects the nascent technology to open the world to a new world of apps and services.Facebook\u2019s smaller rival, Snap, popularized simple augmented-reality tools that overlay bunny ears or dog noses on users\u2019 faces. It also allows users to add special effects to photos and backgrounds.By creating an augmented-reality tool kit for developers, Apple could spur its more than 680 million iPhone users to share augmented images through its iMessage service rather through Facebook or Snapchat, developers said.ARKit indicates Apple solved a difficult technical problem\u2014finding a way to use cameras and sensors in an iPhone to track the outside world, said Mr. Miesnieks. He said the same sensors and algorithms would run a pair of glasses, bolstering his belief that Apple plans to launch eyewear in the future.Apple declined to comment on whether it could develop glasses.\u201cThey\u2019re clearly getting developers ramped up for this,\u201d said Paul Reynolds, founder of Torch 3D, a startup focused on 3D-app development. \u201cI\u2019m sure for the iPhone launch they\u2019ll have nice content around it.\u201dWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the June 7, 2017, print edition as 'Apple Targets New Platform.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delphi-to-partner-with-frances-transdev-on-self-driving-vehicle-service-1496838077", "news_time": "2017-06-07 08:21:00", "news_title": "Delphi to Partner with France\u2019s Transdev on Self-Driving Vehicle Service", "keywords": "automated driving,driverless automobiles,self-driving,self-driving cars,self-driving service,Delphi Automotive,DLPH,Transdev,Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts,Glen De Vos,Yann Leriche,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicle parts,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,technology,transportation,logistics", "content": "DETROIT\u2014            Delphi Automotive        DLPH -2.58%       PLC said Wednesday it is joining with French bus and train operator Transdev to deploy a self-driving on-demand transportation service this year using the automotive supplier\u2019s automated driving technology.The two companies said it would be the first self-driving vehicle service to operate on public roads in Europe, and that they are looking for additional pilot program sites in North America. The French projects target short-distance commutes to and from train stations.The project showcases Delphi\u2019s system for automated braking and steering using multiples sensors as it attempts to reinvent itself as a high-tech player in the development of next-generation vehicles.\u201cIt really provides a clear pathway to commercialization,\u201d Glen De Vos, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, told reporters on a conference call.

Spain has shown Europe\u2014especially Italy\u2014how to deal with bad banks:             Banco Santander SA        SAN -1.12%       will buy         Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol SA       for a nominal \u20ac1 after Spain\u2019s resolution authority took control of the troubled lender and conducted a late-night auction on Tuesday.Santander investors don\u2019t get the rival group free: They must fund a \u20ac7 billion ($7.85 billion) rights issue to bolster the combined group\u2019s balance sheet. The prize is Santander becomes Spain\u2019s biggest bank with a 20% market share.The deal isn\u2019t risk free, but the decision by Spanish authorities to effectively wipe out Popular\u2019s equity and junior debt gives Santander a good cushion against more deterioration in Popular\u2019s bad assets. Also Santander is promising that the investment will deliver a 13% to 14% return in 2020.For those concerned about European-wide banking issues, Spain provides an important read through to Italy, which is wrestling much bigger problems. Though a straight comparison between the two is slightly unfair.Banco Popular was the last truly troubled bank in Spain and its slow-motion collapse this year hasn\u2019t hurt the stock and bonds of local rivals. In Italy, most banks carry lots of bad loans and last year they were shunned by investors more or less equally.Still, Tuesday night\u2019s swift action in Spain shows that Europe\u2019s new regime for dealing with failing banks can function quickly and cleanly\u2014even though it is the regime\u2019s hard rules on forcing bondholders to take losses that have complicated Italian efforts.The first thing Santander will do is increase Popular\u2019s provisions against bad loans and seized property assets by \u20ac7.9 billion, which will bring total provisions at Popular to 67% of the bad assets\u2019 original value. That compares with an average of 52% across other Spanish banks, according to Santander.Santander will also target \u20ac500 million in savings focused on Popular\u2019s headquarters, which Santander expects to leave it with a cost-to-income ratio of 50% across the enlarged group, one of the best in Spain.Santander\u2019s capital ratio will be more or less unchanged and still on target to be above 11% by 2018. Analysts at Berenberg think the bank could have raised more capital to boost its ratio closer to some of its biggest European rivals, although Santander insists it doesn\u2019t need a higher ratio, partly as it isn\u2019t involved in investment banking like French or German counterparts.There is one final risk for investors, however: a group of shareholders who bought into Popular\u2019s last \u20ac2.5 billion rights issue in January 2016 is threatening to sue. That could yet prove costly for Santander, which has no extra protections or indemnities from Spanish authorities as part of its takeover.The bank believes it has accounted for this risk. Santander investors will have to hold their noses and hope it has got that call right.Write to Paul J.

Google finally confirmed its plans last week, and ad-blocking companies tell him they\u2019re not too worried about it. As far as we know, Google\u2019s filter won\u2019t suddenly stop existing ad blockers from working, nor prevent users from downloading one. Plus, some existing blockers are far more militant about blocking ad tracking, which many users might prefer to Google\u2019s option, which only forces publishers to eliminate certain annoying formats.\u2014Two threads to follow\u20141) Who is affected most by Google\u2019s new \u201cFunding Choices\u201d tool, which lets publishers prevent ad-block users from viewing their content unless they enable ads or make a payment? Will it encourage more people to give up on ad blockers? Or will users simply be deterred from visiting those publishers and search for similar content elsewhere?2) If the ad filter proves successful, will Google continue to pay Adblock Plus for its \u201cAcceptable Ads\u201d whitelisting service?Macy\u2019s is shaking up its marketing, and the ailing department store has provided lots of details about what\u2019s down the line, AdAge reports.

They often serve as buyers of starter homes, allowing those homeowners to trade up.\u201cThey provide that greater mobility to the overall housing market. Without first time buyers the market becomes much more stagnant and less dynamic,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.In all, the number of first-time U.S. home buyers averaged 1.5 million a year over the last decade, compared with the historical average of 1.8 million, according to a new study to be released Thursday by             Genworth                   Mortgage Insurance that examines mortgage data from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Affairs and other sources. The study looked at data going back to 1994 and defined first-time buyers as anyone who hasn\u2019t owned a home in the last three years.Lackluster demand for homeownership among younger people has been one of the main factors holding back the housing recovery. Many young people have been delaying buying homes due to tight credit, student loans and rising rents that have made it difficult to save for down payments.\u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is confidence,\u201d said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at             CoreLogic Inc.But that is starting to change. So far this year, first-time buyers represented about 38% of the market, greater than the historical average of 35%, according to Genworth. Some two million first-timers purchased homes last year, or 37% of the market.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a very strong surge in first-time home buyers,\u201d said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth.A number of factors are propelling first-time buyers into the market. Many are entering their 30s, marrying and having children, and need more space than they can get by renting.Credit also appears to be loosening. According to Genworth, about 78% of first-time buyers are using low-down-payment loans, compared with the historical average of 73%.Economists said a wave of first-time buyers is likely coming over the next decade, as a large cohort in their mid-20s begin to buy homes.\u201cAs we\u2019re seeing millennials age into homeownership, there\u2019s a huge tailwind coming,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.To cater to rising demand from first-timers, home builders are starting to build less expensive homes after years of focusing mainly on the upper end of the market.U.S. homes got smaller last year for the first time since the recession. The median size of a new single-family home slipped 2% to 2,422 square feet in 2016, according to Census Bureau data released last week. While that is a small adjustment, it is the first time since 2009 and only the third time in the last 20 years it has fallen.Activity from repeat buyers, meanwhile, is now below historical levels, according to the Genworth survey. About 1.6 million repeat buyers financed home purchases last year, compared with the 22-year average of 2.4 million a year.That reflects declining mobility as homeowners move less due to the fact that they are underwater on their mortgages, they enjoy historically low mortgage rates or there are fewer enticing job opportunities.\u2014Jeffrey Sparshott contributed to this article.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-to-move-troops-fighting-islamic-state-in-turkey-to-jordan-amid-escalating-tensions-1496836306", "news_time": "2017-06-07 07:51:00", "news_title": "Germany to Move Troops Fighting Islamic State From Turkey to Jordan Amid Escalating Tensions ", "keywords": "germany aiforce turkey,NATO,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics", "content": "BERLIN\u2014Germany said\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0its air force contingent engaged in the campaign against Islamic State would leave Turkey after Ankara refused to allow German lawmakers access to the troops in the latest escalation of tension between the two North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Chancellor       Angela Merkel\u2019s       cabinet had approved her proposal to relocate the more than 250 troops to an air base in Jordan from Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, a launchpad used since last year by German forces to fly reconnaissance and refueling missions in support of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.The \u201cgreat patience\u201d Germany showed while Turkey denied access to the base had run out,       Ms. von der Leyen       said in an interview with German radio\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0morning.\u00a0\u201cWe have a parliament-led army and it goes without saying lawmakers need to visit the servicemen and women,\u201d she said.While the move means Germany will stop flying reconnaissance and refueling missions during the relocation, defense experts said they think the country\u2019s modest contribution to the anti-Islamic State coalition means the dispute is unlikely to undermine the campaign.But it marks an admission of failure by Berlin, which has gone out of its way to appease Ankara in talks between Ms. Merkel and Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       in Brussels last month and between the president and German Foreign Minister       Sigmar Gabriel       in Turkey this week.Despite mounting domestic pressure to toughen her line against a Turkish regime seen here as increasingly autocratic, Ms. Merkel has been reluctant to damage ties with Ankara, which is working with the EU on keeping a flow of refugees from the Middle East to Europe in check.But a succession of diplomatic spats centered on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown on domestic\u00a0opponents have sent the relationship to a historic low. After Turkey\u2019s decision to block German lawmakers from visiting German troops in Incirlik in recent weeks, Ms. Merkel finally yielded to demands from parliament that the troops be withdrawn.Germany will now have to transfer Tornado jets, a refueling aircraft, and thousands of tons of equipment from Incirlik to Jordan\u2019s\u00a0      Muwaffaq Salti       Air Base, according to Ms. von der Leyen. She said coalition partners would be asked to help cover Germany\u2019s operational responsibilities during the move. The entire relocation is expected to extend for up to three months.Until they can construct their own infrastructure, German troops will be able to use existing barracks belonging to the U.S., Belgium and the Netherlands at the new base, where Berlin already had an invitation to relocate from the king of Jordan, Ms. von der Leyen said.The move won\u2019t affect Germany\u2019s troops at the NATO base in Konya, Turkey, which the Turkish government has allowed lawmakers to visit.Turkey\u2019s ban on visits to Incirlik began last summer after German lawmakers voted to label Ottoman Turks\u2019 killing of more than a million Armenians about 100 years ago as genocide,Last September, Turkey briefly lifted the ban, but the tension has flared up again this year.This spring Mr. Erdogan\u2019s constitutional referendum spilled over onto German soil, host to the largest Turkish diaspora in the world, with Germany trying to block Turkish politicians from campaigning here and Turkey comparing modern Germany\u2019s government to the Nazi regime.Since this winter, Turkey has been holding a correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt in prison on terrorism-related charges that Germany says are trumped up.Following the last summer\u2019s coup attempt in Turkey, Germany began hosting asylum seekers affiliated with the Turkish opposition, which the country\u2019s government has targeted in a sweeping crackdown.Germany\u2019s parliament, or Bundestag, won\u2019t need to approve the cabinet\u2019s decision, Ms. von der Leyen said, since it won\u2019t affect the substance of the parliamentary mandate that governs the operation.Write to Zeke Turner at Zeke.Turner@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-limits-brings-cognitive-computing-to-industrial-firms-1496835001", "news_time": "2017-06-07 07:30:00", "news_title": "Beyond Limits Brings Cognitive Computing to Industrial Firms", "keywords": "BP,BP.LN,Beyond Limits,corporate,industrial news,data mining,knowledge,information management,political,general news,sciences,humanities,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas", "content": "Industrial companies are aiming to turn the reams of data that their machines produce into improved business.Beyond Limits, which uses artificial intelligence that came out of the NASA, has raised $20 million in Series B funding from             BP                   Ventures.

The company\u2019s artificial intelligence allows the system to reason and recognize anomalies even if there are insufficient rules or data. For example, when a Tesla crashed into a white truck while on \u201cautopilot\u201d mode, the car\u2019s system didn\u2019t sense a truck there because it recognized the truck as part of the sky. But Beyond Limits says it has a physics model in its reasoning software and could recognize that it\u2019s not possible for a truck to disappear so quickly, Mr. Abdallat said.The startup has focused on the oil and gas industry initially, but it can be applied to other areas such as health care. Companies like BP can use the technology to analyze data and help find oil reservoirs, improve the efficiency of wells, and predict when problems could arise.BP has been working with Beyond Limits for about a year and is now testing the technology in two areas with others in the works, said Meghan Sharp, managing director of BP Ventures, who is joining the company\u2019s board.

Turkey blames the U.S.-based cleric for last year\u2019s failed military coup attempt, while       Mr. Gulen       has denied any involvement.Mr. Kilic was scheduled\u00a0to be interviewed by counterterrorism police\u00a0in the coastal city of Izmir, where he was detained\u00a0on Tuesday, Amnesty said.\u00a0The\u00a0lawyer, who has served on Amnesty\u2019s board for various periods since 2002, is neither a member nor a supporter\u00a0of the Gulen movement, and in fact has been a critic of it, said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International\u2019s deputy director for Europe and Central Asia.\u201cThe fact that Turkey\u2019s post-coup purge has now dragged the chair of Amnesty International Turkey into its web is further proof of just how far it has gone and just how arbitrary it has become,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary-General       Salil Shetty.Turkey\u2019s Interior Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.The move against the lawyers is part of a larger crackdown in Turkey that started after the violent, but failed, attempt to overthrow the government last July. Since then, Turkey has been under a state of emergency, and roughly 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 others purged from their civil service jobs.Turkey says the actions are necessary to defend against a terrorist group, which is how the government classifies Mr. Gulen\u2019s organization. Amnesty, as well as many other human rights groups, political opposition parties and foreign governments, have condemned the crackdown\u00a0as arbitrary and in violation of human rights.Numerous people detained since last summer are alleged to have used the encrypted messaging app ByLock.\u00a0The app was popular among followers of Mr. Gulen, Turkish officials say, and the act of downloading the app has been grounds for detention, arrest as well as prosecution.Mr. Kilic was able to communicate with colleagues and his lawyer while police searched his office\u00a0Tuesday.\u00a0In those conversations, he told them that he\u2019s never had ByLock on his phone and had never heard of the app before it became commonly mentioned in the media in connection with Mr. Gulen\u2019s organization, according to       Ms. Van Gulik.       Mr. Kilic also said he didn\u2019t know the 22 other lawyers detained\u00a0Tuesday, Ms. Van Gulik said.In addition to his work with Amnesty International Turkey, Mr. Kilic was a commercial lawyer who has also specialized in refugee law, Ms. Van Gulik said.Mr. Kilic\u2019s detention doesn\u2019t appear to be connected to Amnesty International\u2019s work, the organization said. Its Turkey branch has about 40 full-time employees around the country working in coordination with headquarters in London, in addition to Amnesty International\u2019s separate research and advocacy in the country, Ms. Van Gulik said.A report issued by Amnesty International last month on public sector workers purged by the government after the coup attempt found that \u201cthe absence of individualized evidence has facilitated arbitrary dismissals on the grounds of score-settling, political affiliations, or even personal conflicts.\u201d\u2014Yeliz Candemir contributed to this article.Write to Ned Levin at ned.levin@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-10-point-1496832485", "news_time": "2017-06-07 06:48:00", "news_title": "The 10-Point.", "keywords": "political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action", "content": "Good morning,Assailants have struck Iran\u2019s Parliament complex in Tehran and the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini near the city, killing at least seven people and wounding more than 30.

The withdrawal would be the first by Anthem, a huge exchange insurer that has warned repeatedly that it was weighing its future in the ACA marketplaces. Both Humana and Aetna have said they will exit all of their current exchanges next year. Anthem\u2019s decision, which could leave 18 Ohio counties with no exchange plans, was immediately seized on by both sides of the debate over the Republican health bill. GOP senators are deeply divided over the fate of Medicaid, a fissure that threatens to thwart their legislative ambitions.Faulty cooperation among Europe\u2019s national police and security forces, for years an obstacle to stopping terror attacks, may have had a role in the failure to prevent Saturday\u2019s London rampage. Security agencies are probing possible links to Islamist networks of Moroccan origin, focusing on two of the attackers: Youssef Zaghba, a dual Italian-Moroccan citizen, and Rachid Redouane, a Libyan-Moroccan with an Irish identity card. In identifying Zaghba on Tuesday, U.K. police said he hadn\u2019t previously been a \u201csubject of interest.\u201d But Italian officials said he had been prevented from boarding a flight from Bologna to Istanbul last year, and that they had shared their concerns about him with the British.

Major U.S. stock indexes have soared to records this month, reflecting some investors\u2019 confidence in the recovery. Prices of bonds, which often decline when stocks rise, have also risen lately, while U.K. terror attacks and U.S. political turmoil have increased gold\u2019s following. The simultaneous gains have begun to concern some investors. Many point to a wave of money driving up asset prices, tied in part to lower bond yields and a lower dollar\u2014a confluence of events they say feels good but can\u2019t go on forever.

Walk around parts of Brooklyn, Portland or Pittsburgh, and you\u2019ll find stylish cocktail bars, barbershops and the occasional butcher shop staffed by young, college-educated employees. For an affluent segment of today\u2019s urban economy, these jobs have gone from low-status to glamorous, says sociologist Richard Ocejo, though hipsters generally aren\u2019t displacing workers at more conventional businesses in the same industry. Millennials are drawn to these occupations in part in reaction to \u201cthe ephemerality of the digital age,\u201d he says. The jobs usually have an element of performance to them, so working as an electrician or plumber is unlikely to prove as attractive.President Trump\u2019s tweets on his travel ban and London\u2019s mayor have raised two questions with critics: How seriously should they be taken and are they counterproductive?

But the administration has given few details as to how it will lure investors, the WSJ\u2019s Ted Mann and Ryan Dezember write. The administration says it can get private investors to put up capital by curtailing regulations and encouraging cities and towns to raise fees, like roadway tolls or water-usage charges. In theory, that will quickly provide revenue streams to win backing from private-equity firms, and             Blackstone Group\u2019s       recent announcement of a $100 billion infrastructure fund supports that notion. But it isn\u2019t clear whether investors will flock to the most urgent projects, involving sorely needed repairs on decrepit infrastructure that won\u2019t produce commercial returns, or low-margin investments in toll roads and bridges. Not all local governments have the expertise to negotiate complex public-private partnerships, preferring the simpler path of raising cash via municipal bonds. Last year, investors committed $59 billion to private-infrastructure funds worldwide, but are likely to spend much of that money outside the U.S., according to Preqin, a provider of investment-fund data.Amazon.com Inc.       is moving in on             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u2019s       core customers by targeting low-income shoppers. The online retail giant is lowering its Prime membership fee to $5.99 per monthf or about 20% of Americans who qualify for government assistance, down from the regular rate of $10.99 per month. Low-income shoppers are a big opportunity for retailers because many are only beginning to buy online, the WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens and Sarah Nassauer report. Last year, nearly one out of every five dollars spent through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) nationwide went to Wal-Mart. Online shopping isn\u2019t as accessible to some lower income consumers since they are less likely to have bank accounts and credit cards. Amazon introduced Amazon Cash earlier this year, which lets customers add cash to their account balance at more than 10,000 physical locations around the country. Wal-Mart is taking steps to keep low-income customers, including acquiring discount online retailer Jet.com last year and scrapping an annual fee for free shipping.E-commerce is taking off in Russia, but online retail in that country comes with its own unique logistical challenges. Chief among them: many Russian shoppers fear packages will be stolen if left on their doorsteps, and prefer instead to pick up their purchases at fulfillment centers, the WSJ\u2019s Art Patnaude reports. Retailers have customized their distribution networks for Russian customers and developed scores of fulfillment centers ranging from tiny pickup locations to expansive warehouses with drive-through service. That\u2019s adding to already booming demand for warehouses amid a recovery in consumer spending as Russia emerges from a sharp economic downturn. American warehouse developer Hines recently leased spaces in the Moscow and St. Petersburg regions to startup e-commerce companies, citing strong growth prospects. Warehouse vacancy rates in Russia fell to 10.4% from 11.3% in the second quarter of 2016, though that\u2019s nearly double the rate in the U.S., where space has been tight for many years.Lyft is hedging its bets when it comes to developing driverless cars. The ride-hailing service is working with startups to perfect the technology, after a year-long partnership with             General Motors Co.       has apparently failed to yield significant breakthroughs, the WSJ\u2019s Greg Bensinger writes. The shift comes amid a sense of mounting urgency among technology companies, auto makers and regulators as self-driving technology races toward widespread use. The benefits, in reduced deaths from automobile accidents and lower transportation costs, are potentially enormous. Lyft is collaborating with NuTonomy Inc. to dispatch its first fleet of driverless cars for customer use in the coming months. NuTonomy was first to put regular passengers in a self-driving vehicle, edging Lyft rival Uber Technologies Inc. by a matter of weeks last year. Companies ranging from             Ford Motor Co.       to Amazon.com Inc. are jockeying for an edge in autonomous vehicles that they hope could reap them billions in profits in the coming years. Ride-hailing companies are vying to be at the head of the pack, as most remain deep in the red, with human drivers their biggest expense.\u2018Instead of getting your coffee, you pick up your new iPhone.\u2019Wal-Mart revenue from spending through SNAP.Dubai\u2019s DP World banned Qatar-flagged ships from docking at its U.A.E. terminals.

VW was required to make the investment as part of a settlement, reached with civil and criminal authorities in the waning days of the Obama administration, in which German auto giant admitted to cheating on emissions tests. Some state officials and auto makers have complained that the VW provision resembles an unfair government-backed windfall more than a penalty.The Justice Department notably used the practice in several post-financial crisis settlements that resolved allegations that banks misled investors on shoddy mortgage-backed securities, including a $7 billion accord with             Citigroup Inc.       and a $17 billion settlement with             Bank of America,       both in 2014.The majority of those settlements were in the form of penalties paid to the U.S. Treasury and reduced loan balances for struggling borrowers, but they also included tens of millions of dollars in payments to housing counseling groups approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to state-based legal aid groups.Bank of America, for example, was required to pay $50 million to community development funds certified by the Treasury Department, $30 million to state accounts that helped low-income people with legal issues, and $20 million to housing counseling groups.Republicans blasted the provisions as a \u201cslush fund\u201d that directed money to Democratic interest groups and said the donations undermined congressional budget authority. The House of Representatives in September approved a bill to limit the practice.Obama administration officials have defended the third-party donations as consistent with well-established practice and said the recipient groups were helping victims of the banks\u2019 conduct avoid foreclosures and remain in their homes.According to a November 2015 report from a monitor overseeing the Bank of America accord, the bank said it had provided around $60 million in donations to hundreds of groups.More recent mortgage-securities settlements, including a $7.2 billion accord the Obama Justice Department reached with Deutsche Bank AG in January, didn\u2019t contain such provisions.According to Mr. Sessions\u2019 memo, the new policy makes exceptions if the payment provides restitution to a victim or \u201cdirectly remedies the harm that is sought to be redressed,\u201d including harm to the environment or from \u201cofficial corruption.\u201dWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-blockers-say-they-wont-be-replaced-by-google-chrome-ad-filter-1496829601", "news_time": "2017-06-07 06:00:00", "news_title": "Ad Blockers Say They Won\u2019t Be Replaced by Google Chrome Ad Filter ", "keywords": "new products,services,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,digital marketing,public relations,business,consumer services,computing,internet,online,technology", "content": "Major ad-blocking software providers are skeptical that the introduction of a new ad-filtering feature on Google\u2019s Chrome browser will stifle use of their own, more extensive products.According to the reigning ad-blocking tools, that\u2019s because Google is only willing to go so far in its attempts to appease consumers\u2019 distaste for being bombarded with ads.Google confirmed last week that by early next year its Chrome browser will block all ads from appearing on websites that are deemed to include bad advertising experiences for users. The feature will be switched on by default on mobile and desktop versions of Chrome, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s plans.Many publishing and advertising executives have described the new tool as a defensive move by Google, intended to help stymie the spread of ad-blocking software provided by other companies. If Google filters out the most irritating ad formats in Chrome, users will have less reason to seek out more drastic ad-blocking tools, the thinking goes.That could help preserve revenue for advertising-dependent publishers, as well as Google itself. Google generated $79 billion in ad revenue last year, amounting to 88% of its total annual revenue.Ad-blocking software developers welcome even a limited range of ad blocking from Google because it would help weed out the most intrusive ads and validate the ad-blocking business. But they don\u2019t expect Google\u2019s new feature to impact adoption of their own tools, largely because it doesn\u2019t go far enough to address consumers\u2019 frustrations with online ads or their concerns about online tracking.\u201cIt won\u2019t affect Adblock Plus uptake on Chrome,\u201d said Ben Williams, head of operations and communications at Eyeo GmbH, which develops the Adblock Plus software.Google\u2019s tool will only block ads from a site if it shows certain ad formats identified by an industry group called the Coalition for Better Ads, which Mr. Williams said is only targeting a small sliver of the annoying ad types many consumers want to avoid. The Coalition\u2019s initial list of unacceptable ad types included pop-ups, autoplay video ads with sound and \u201cprestitial\u201d ads that count down before displaying content.\u201cUsers have become accustomed to more stringent blocking,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cWhy would [users] trust ad industry standards?\u201dOver 105 million people use Adblock Plus software every month, the company said.Matt Maier, CEO of rival ad-blocking browser extension AdBlock, said he doesn\u2019t expect the Chrome feature to impact the use of his company\u2019s software in the short-term. But he did suggest that could change if online publishers more aggressively turn ad-blocking users away from their sites.Google has a new feature in beta called \u201cFunding Choices,\u201d which allows publishers to show visitors with an ad blocker a message asking them to enable ads on their site or pay for a pass that removes all ads.\u201cI think if Google actively enforces these guidelines, and publishers put up anti-ad-block walls en masse, then we could see the adoption of ad-blocking software impacted,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cBut retargeting and malware concerns aren\u2019t directly impacted by these proposed changes, which are big reasons why people use AdBlock, so I think there will still be a market for stand-alone blockers.\u201dEyeo and AdBlock have a complicated relationship with Google when it comes to ad blocking. Eyeo accepts payment from Google and other online ad companies in exchange for allowing some ads through its filter as part of a program it calls \u201cAcceptable Ads.\u201d AdBlock also allows these \u201cacceptable ads\u201d through its own ad filter by default.That means Google is not only a competitor and adversary to Eyeo when it comes to \u201cfiltering\u201d ads. It\u2019s also a major customer.\u201cWe\u2019ve been a part of AdBlock Plus\u2019 Acceptable Ads program for a while, along with many other digital ads providers,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOur support of the Better Ads Standard is about improving the user experience -- ad blocking is just a symptom of bad ads online. We believe the Coalition for Better Ads is the best way to improve the ecosystem -- and we\u2019re very committed to working with the industry to solve this problem.\u201dWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feeling-abandoned-russian-catholics-appeal-to-the-pope-1496827805", "news_time": "2017-06-07 05:30:00", "news_title": "Feeling Abandoned, Russian Catholics Appeal to the Pope", "keywords": "catholics in russia,great schism,pope francis,russian byzantine catholic church,russian byzantine rite,russian orthodox,vatican,vatican city,vatican tickets,Pope Francis,political,general news,society,community,religion", "content": "ROME\u2014A group of Russian Catholics is demanding greater recognition from       Pope Francis,        saying the Vatican\u2019s appeasement of Moscow threatens its very existence.Leaders of the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church, with fewer than 30,000 members world-wide, are meeting in Italy this week in their first such synod in a century.On the agenda is a longstanding request for their own bishop and resources for training their own clergy. Church leaders say the pope has ignored their appeals as he pursues closer ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, which is dominant in the country.\u201cThe survival of the Russian Catholic Church is what\u2019s at stake,\u201d said the Rev. Lawrence Cross, a Russian Catholic priest based near Melbourne, Australia. \u201cOne of the essential things we need for our survival, like any church or any family, is a father.\u201dArchbishop Cyril Vasil\u2019, secretary of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Oriental Churches, said his office was aware of the Russian Catholics\u2019 meeting but declined to comment.The complaints of the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church echo those of other groups who feel Pope Francis is willing to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of other priorities.Catholics in Ukraine accuse the pope of playing down Russian aggression toward their country in order to placate the Russian Orthodox Church, which has criticized Ukrainian Catholics\u2019 opposition to Russian-backed separatists. Russian President       Vladimir Putin       has cultivated a close relationship with the Orthodox Church as part of a nationalist campaign.And some members of China\u2019s underground Catholic church, who have remained loyal to Rome through more than half a century of persecution, worry the pope will betray their fidelity in pursuit of a deal with Beijing and the government-controlled official Catholic church there.The Vatican has sought stronger links with the Eastern Orthodox churches since the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, working toward ending a schism that dates to the 11th century. Pope Francis has made closer ties with the Russian Orthodox, who represent about two-thirds of the world\u2019s 250 million Orthodox Christians, an especially urgent priority in light of increasing persecution of Christians around the world. In 2016, Pope Francis became the first pope to meet a patriarch of Moscow.Amid that outreach, Russian Byzantine Catholics have felt particularly neglected. The election of Pope Francis, who had a record of supporting Eastern Catholics in his native Argentina, raised hopes that he would do likewise as pope. But those hopes, including a desire for a Russian Byzantine Catholic bishop, have been dashed.The Moscow Patriarchate tolerates the presence of a Catholic hierarchy to minister to ethnic Germans and Poles in Russia, said the Rev. Ronald Roberson, an adviser on ecumenical matters to the U.S. Catholic bishops\u2019 conference. \u201cBut if Rome were to appoint someone to lead ethnic Russian Catholics, the Russian Orthodox would go berserk,\u201d he said.Even as the pope meets frequently with Orthodox clergy at the Vatican, appeals from Russian Byzantine Catholics to meet with Pope Francis have gone unanswered,\u00a0Father Cross said.\u201cFrancis has let us down,\u201d said Father Cross. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been left out in the cold.\u201dVirtually all of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Catholics belong to the Latin\u2014or Western\u2014Church. A fraction, meanwhile, belong to about two dozen Eastern Catholic Churches, which regard the pope as their ultimate authority but have their own rituals, laws and traditions.The Russian Byzantine Catholic Church\u00a0is one of\u00a0the smallest of these churches. It celebrates a liturgy identical to that of the Russian Orthodox and seeks to serve as a bridge across the thousand-year gap between Catholicism and Orthodoxy.Yet its relationship with both sides is troubled. Russian Catholics suffered and died alongside Orthodox Christians under the Soviet regime. Yet the Orthodox Patriarchate of Moscow regards the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church, like other Eastern Catholic churches, as a vehicle for luring members of its flock to Rome.The overwhelming majority of the approximately 919,000 Catholics in the Russian Federation today are Latin Catholics, mostly ethnic Germans and Poles, Father Roberson said. The tiny numbers of Russian Byzantine Catholics inside Russia operate under the\u00a0wing\u00a0of a Latin rite bishop\u00a0in Siberia.Most Russian Byzantine Catholics today live outside of the Russian Federation, with communities throughout the West.St. Michael\u2019s Chapel in lower Manhattan, founded in 1936, attracted a small but dedicated congregation that at one time included       Dorothy Day,        founder of the Catholic Worker movement, and the poet-monk       Thomas Merton.Write to Francis X.

Mr. Weidmann still criticizes the bank\u2019s radical stimulus measures. But his tone has softened as evidence accumulates that the ECB\u2019s policies are working\u2014and as the race to become the institution\u2019s next president approaches.\u201cThere is currently no doubt that an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate,\u201d Mr. Weidmann said in a speech late last month, while suggesting he might not agree with his colleagues on the details.Only five years ago, he was boasting of clashes with fellow policy makers, and comparing easy-money policies to drugs and alcohol.As ECB officials gather Wednesday and Thursday in Estonia, what was once a bitter argument over the bank\u2019s far-reaching monetary stimulus is expected instead to be a pragmatic discussion about whether to start reducing it.Mr. Weidmann declined to be interviewed for this article.ECB President       Mario Draghi\u2019s       term ends in 2019. The jockeying to succeed him is likely to begin sometime after Germany\u2019s national elections in September. The presidency is determined by a vote of eurozone leaders.Mr. Weidmann has been carefully non-committal. \u201cI make a point of never taking part in speculation on such issues,\u201d he said in an interview last month, responding to whether he might be the next ECB chief.But German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       and her finance minister,       Wolfgang Schaeuble,        are reportedly prepared to push for him, on the basis that no German has led the ECB, which is based in Frankfurt, in its near 20-year history.Mr. Weidmann has been careful not to alienate his German constituency. While he has cooled his fiery rhetoric, he continues to criticize policies viewed with deep distrust in Germany, such as government-bond purchases.Despite his unpopularity in some European capitals, Mr. Weidmann would have a strong claim for the top job. Germany is the region\u2019s anchor economy, and the ECB was modeled on the Bundesbank. Mr. Weidmann\u2019s predecessor,       Axel Weber,        was widely seen as the front runner before he pulled out of the race, a decision that infuriated Ms. Merkel. Crucially, only a minority of Eurozone governments have required bailouts\u2014or come close. Many others are sympathetic to at least some German concerns.With a rapprochement between the ECB and its most important shareholder, the Bundesbank, the bank could stand a better chance of winning acceptance in Germany for some of its policies. And, as the ECB navigates an exit from its stimulus, it would stand a better chance of avoiding a public fight that could confuse investors and rattle financial markets.Mr. Weidmann\u2019s colleagues on the ECB\u2019s governing council are relieved about his new approach. Many had grown exasperated, complaining, usually in private, that Mr. Weidmann rejected anti-crisis measures while proposing no alternativesStill, the Bundesbank chief\u2019s newfound amity with the ECB is raising some concerns back home. Germans revere their conservative central bank for cementing the nation\u2019s postwar rebound. Much of Germany\u2019s political and economic establishment thinks the ECB\u2019s ultra-low interest rates punish German savers while taking the pressure off sluggish European economies such as France and Italy to reform.\u201cI fear that Mr. Weidmann has softened his opposition,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.Nor is it clear that a mere shift in tone will be enough to win around Mr. Weidmann\u2019s critics in southern Europe.When ECB President Mario Draghi repeatedly complained in public about colleagues saying \u201cNein zu Allem\u201d\u2014German for \u201cNo to everything\u201d\u2014it was clear whom he meant. The Italian hasn\u2019t made that jibe recently, though.\u201cMany in southern Europe certainly have strong reservations against Jens Weidmann, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Guntram Wolff, head of Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. Mr. Wolff cited the Bundesbank chief\u2019s opposition to bond-buying schemes that propped up struggling euro members during the region\u2019s debt crisis.His \u201cperiod of quietness\u201d probably has helped to soften objections in southern Europe to his potential candidacy, though it hasn\u2019t eliminated them, Mr. Wolff says.Mr. Weidmann is 49 years old and is a former International Monetary Fund official, He is from the southern German region of Swabia, known for its thrifty housewives that are frequently invoked by Ms. Merkel, to whom Mr. Weidmann served as chief economic adviser. He would be the youngest-ever ECB president.The last time the ECB presidency was open, Ms. Merkel pushed for Mr. Weber. But Mr. Weber\u2019s rift with other ECB members over the question of buying government bonds led to his resignation, and to Mr. Draghi becoming president in 2011.With his newly restrained tone, Mr. Weidmann appears to have learned from his predecessor\u2019s mistakes, which diminished German influence at the ECB.Under Mr. Draghi, the ECB has become the eurozone\u2019s most important crisis-fighter, in defiance of German orthodoxy that says central banks should stick to keeping inflation down. The institution has lent cheaply and freely to eurozone banks, cut interest rates to around zero or in some cases below zero, and bought more than \u20ac1.5 trillion in government bonds under its quantitative easing program (known as QE).All of those measures provoked anger in Germany. Many people feared they would lead to inflation and undermine the stability of the euro. Mr. Weidmann led the opposition to Mr. Draghi. He warned in 2012 that, for governments, \u201ccentral-bank financing can become addictive like a drug.\u201d\u201cIt is like an alcoholic saying that I need to get a bottle tonight,\u201d Mr. Weidmann said at another point in the crisis as the ECB pondered how to help countries threatened by financial-market panic.Most economists say events have largely vindicated Mr. Draghi.The steady improvement in the eurozone\u2019s recovery can be traced to the cumulative effect of ECB stimulus measures since 2014, says Greg Fuzesi, economist at J.P. Morgan in London. Eurozone growth outpaced the U.S. in the first quarter and inflation has jumped in recent months from zero to 1.4%, approaching the ECB\u2019s target range.At a town-hall meeting in Karlsruhe, Germany late last year, Mr. Weidmann acknowledged the positive impact of the bank\u2019s bond-buying program, the quantitative-easing policy he had repeatedly voted against.One young woman argued the policy was ineffective, citing a conversation with a banker.\u201cHow do you know that QE has had no effect?\u201d Mr. Weidmann replied. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe everything bankers say.\u201dWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-biotech-no-news-is-bad-news-1496827801", "news_time": "2017-06-07 05:30:00", "news_title": "In Biotech, No News Is Bad News   ", "keywords": " biotechnology,biotech stocks, cancer conference, catalysts, loxo, stock performance,American Society of Clinical Oncology,Loxo Oncology,LOXO,Vertex Pharmaceuticals,VRTX,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,REGN,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,cancer,political,general news,health,medical conditions,commodity,financial market news,biotechnology,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences,biopharmaceuticals", "content": "Biotech stocks have a special need for catalysts.

But the people with knowledge of the deal say it functioned as an emergency loan to help Moscow through a budget squeeze.Moscow agreed with Qatar that Russia would buy back at least a portion of the stake from the rich Persian Gulf emirate, the people said. The Qatar Investment Authority and Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities giant, formed a partnership to buy the 19.5% stake in Russia\u2019s energy jewel at a time when Mr. Putin\u2019s government needed cash.The people with knowledge of the deal say the buyback arrangement was negotiated with involvement from Mr. Putin and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Russia and Qatar saw it as an opportunity to build a bridge between countries that had taken up opposite sides in the Syrian civil war, the people said. One of the people said the buyback would happen in the next 10 years.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he didn\u2019t agree with the characterization of the deal as an emergency loan. He didn\u2019t respond to further questions.Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority said the deal\u2019s contract contained no right for Russia to buy back Rosneft shares from the consortium they created.\u201cThe transaction did not include an option or agreement for Rosneft, Rosneftegaz or the Russian state to buy the stake or parts of the stake acquired by the consortium,\u201d Glencore said.\u201cThe consortium alone controls the future ownership of these shares,\u201d the Qatar Investment Authority said through a London public-relations firm.Rosneft, the world\u2019s largest listed oil producer, is traded publicly in Moscow, but it isn\u2019t easy to buy and sell large pieces of the company because it remains majority-owned by the Russian state and is an instrument of economic power for Mr. Putin.The people familiar with the deal said a time-limited structure and a buyback agreement for the deal worked for both Qatar and Russia.Qatar wanted its Rosneft stake to be temporary, the people said. The emirate believes it will profit from selling the shares back to Russia at a later date, the people said, betting that oil prices will rise and push up Rosneft\u2019s share price. Qatar saw the political benefits of giving Russia access to quick cash as a sort of loan to address a budget deficit that had widened due to lower oil prices, the people said.After the deal, a range of talks opened between Russian and Qatari businesses on a scale not seen before, Russian news agencies have reported.For Russia, a temporary deal was also preferred by       Igor Sechin,        a Putin confidante who runs Rosneft and its parent company Rosneftegaz, one of the people said.Until the deal with Qatar and Glencore, Mr. Sechin had publicly opposed privatizing any more of Rosneft, which is already 20% owned by             BP                   PLC. That ownership slice came about when BP sold its share of Russian oil company TNK-BP in exchange for the piece of Rosneft, and cash.According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Sechin approached Glencore about a deal under pressure from Mr. Putin, who needed to raise cash during a 2016 budget crunch, when oil prices fell to 12-year lows. Russia\u2019s federal budget relies on the oil-and-gas industry for about a third of its revenue. Glencore executives said the stake was too big for it alone, the people said, so the company brought in its biggest investor, the Qatar Investment Authority.When the deal was announced in December, Mr. Putin denied it was done \u201cbecause we lack money for particular budget expenditure items.\u201d He said at a news conference that Glencore and Qatar would \u201cimprove the management quality\u201d of Rosneft. The deal was called the largest-ever foreign investment in a Russian company.Shares in Rosneft rallied around 20% higher in the four weeks following the deal\u2019s announcement on Dec. 7. Those gains have been erased, with the share price down around 25% since the start of the year.Russia has since pushed Glencore and Qatar to find other investors to demonstrate the foreign interest in the Rosneft stake, sparking talks with companies and sovereign wealth funds, according to people familiar with the matter.Glencore shares rose after the December announcement, partly because it gives the company access to trade 220,000 barrels a day of Rosneft crude for five years\u2014a lucrative piece of Russian market share.Subsequent public disclosures have revealed parts of the deal\u2019s complex structure.Glencore says it only put up \u20ac300 million ($338 million) in equity for its stake, not the more than \u20ac5 billion implied by taking half a 19.5% piece of Rosneft valued at more than \u20ac10 billion. Qatar\u2019s investment totaled only about \u20ac2.5 billion, Glencore said.In an unusual arrangement, the rest of the financing was provided by Russian banks, which contributed \u20ac2.2 billion, and Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, which lent \u20ac5.2 billion to the Glencore-Qatar consortium, according to a Dec. 10 new release issued by Glencore. The financing is \u201cnon-recourse,\u201d Glencore said in the release, meaning the lenders couldn\u2019t pursue Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority if they weren\u2019t repaid.An Intesa spokesman said the loan to the Qatar/Glencore partnership \u201cis covered by a robust package of guarantees.\u201d Intesa is trying to spread the risk of its loan by syndicating it to other banks, but a person familiar with the matter said the bank hasn\u2019t yet found willing banks.Under the deal, the Rosneft shares aren\u2019t held directly by Glencore and Qatar but by a U.K. limited liability partnership, according to British corporate records.If there is an option for Rosneftegas or Rosneft to buy back a stake, then such a LLP entity is exempt from having to pay capital-gains taxes, said Sergey Vakhrameev, a Zurich-based portfolio manager of GL Asset Management, which invests on behalf of private clients, family offices and funds.Mr. Vakhrameev said he studied the corporate records of the deal as part of his work focusing on Russian companies. He said he had no knowledge that Rosneft plans to buy the shares back.\u201cThe structure of the deal is unusual,\u201d said Mr. Vakhrameev, who, among other aspects, referred to the several limited-liability partnerships set up in the U.K., along with entities in Singapore, that apparently will facilitate the original deal. \u201cIt is nontransparent.\u201dAfter the deal was announced, Mr. Putin awarded one of Russia\u2019s top honors for foreigners\u2014the Order of Friendship\u2014to Qatar Investment Authority\u2019s chief executive, Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud Al-Thani, Intesa\u2019s chief executive,       Carlo Messina,        and Glencore\u2019s chief executive,       Ivan Glasenberg.\u2014Giovanni Legorano, James Marson and Scott Patterson contributed to this article.Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Russia\u2019s Rosneft Stake Sale Had a Twist.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/australians-have-so-much-debt-theyre-becoming-afraid-to-spend-1496827275", "news_time": "2017-06-07 05:21:00", "news_title": "Australians Have So Much Debt They\u2019re Becoming Afraid to Spend", "keywords": " australia, economy,gdp, property, real estate, spending, wage growth,economic performance,indicators,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,government finance,government borrowing,economic news", "content": "SYDNEY\u2014Data analyst       Ben Reid       recently took out a 25-year loan on a home outside Sydney despite a frothy housing market in Australia, believing in the market\u2019s staying power. Payments on the $500,000 mortgage will consume about half his take-home pay.\u201cI\u2019d like a new car in the next couple of years but not sure where that cash will come from,\u201d said Mr. Reid, who is married with a 2-year-old son.Big personal debts and spending worries like Mr. Reid\u2019s are a gathering storm over Australia\u2019s economy, threatening a 25-year streak without recession. Growth rose an anemic 0.3% in the first quarter, Australia\u2019s statistics bureau said on Wednesday, putting annual growth on track to be the weakest since September 2009.Consumer spending has helped to cushion a deep downturn in mining investment when commodity prices slumped a few years ago. Consumption accounts for more than half of Australian GDP growth, of which nearly a third is retail sales.But much of that spending is from borrowed money rather than from savings or higher wages. Australia\u2019s savings rate fell to 4.7% in the first quarter, a 10-year low.As a result, Australian household debt has risen to a record 212% of income, according to the latest available data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That\u2019s the fourth-highest globally after Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark, and higher than the U.S. peak of 143% just before the 2007 global financial crisis.Now, as consumers bump up against the limits of their credit, that debt is biting into their spending, economists say.Retail sales in Australia have fallen or been flat for three of the past five months, the worst conditions in years. Wage growth is the lowest on record, according to government data going back nearly two decades.\u201cAustralia is decoupling further from the global recovery, with the consumer facing a cash flow and credit crunch,\u201d             Morgan Stanley                   analysts said this week.Signs of stress are growing on Main Street. A spate of retail bankruptcies since January has included shirt-sellers, shoe shops and fashion clothing chains. Among them was the Australian franchisee of U.K. retailer Topshop, which only set up shop here six years ago. The chain had nine stores, an online shop and space in 17 department-stores making around A$90 million in annual revenue when insolvency specialists took charge on May 24.Gerard Toweel,        who manages a vendor of musical instruments south of Sydney, Guitar World, said his business has stopped expanding and hiring as sales slow. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the economy slides into a recession,\u201d Mr. Toweel said.At a policy meeting on Tuesday, Australia\u2019s central bank said it was concerned that poor wage growth is crimping consumer spending and said that scenario is likely to persist.A downturn in consumer spending risks undermining the government\u2019s budget projections released just weeks ago. After a decade of budget deficits, the government projects a surplus in the coming years with aid from rising wages. Many economists thought that outlook was overly optimistic.Failure to meet the surplus targets could lead to Australia losing its AAA sovereign credit rating, which would drive up borrowing costs for federal and state governments, and the country\u2019s big banks.To be sure, recent softness in consumer spending may reflect temporary factors, such as a cyclone that left a trail of destruction in eastern Australia in March.But many economists aren\u2019t convinced that weak GDP growth will be short-lived, saying record-low wages growth and the rising debt burden are the source of the spending slowdown.\u201cThe retail sector is verging on recession,\u201d said       Josh Williamson,        senior economist at             Citigroup.The real-estate sector is a top concern.Low interest rates led many households to bet on property, often taking bank loans that required no down payment on a house. House prices in Sydney and Melbourne, the nation\u2019s two biggest cities, rose 11.1% and 11.5% in the year through May 31, according to an analysis by data company             CoreLogic.Now, as the U.S. leads the world in shifting to a cycle of rate increases, ratings firms and economists worry those bets could sour in Australia.\u201cYou\u2019re second guessing whether you\u2019ve spent too much over the weekend and weekly grocery shop,\u201d said Mr. Reid, the data analyst. \u201cAs much as we\u2019re aren\u2019t crippled at the moment, the uncertainty of what could happen always makes you double think.\u201dWrite to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.comAppeared in the June 8, 2017, print edition as 'Australian Consumers Turn Wary.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oecd-calls-for-ecb-taper-cuts-u-s-growth-forecasts-1496824211", "news_time": "2017-06-07 04:30:00", "news_title": "OECD Calls for ECB Taper, Cuts U.S. Growth Forecasts ", "keywords": "bonds,europe,european markets,inflation,interest rates,quantitative easing,European Central Bank,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news", "content": "The European Central Bank should wind down its bond purchases in 2018 and raise one of its key interest rates by the end of that year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday.The Paris-based research body also cut its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. this year and next, saying stimulative measures it had expected from the       Trump       administration would now likely be implemented later than it had previously anticipated.The OECD\u2019s call comes as ECB policy makers prepare to meet in Tallinn, Estonia, and marks a change in its stance since March, when it said policy makers should continue with current policies.With the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery set to pick up, and inflation higher than it has been in recent years, ECB policy makers have come under increasing pressure from Germany and elsewhere to wind down the stimulus measures they have launched since 2014.Those measures include purchases of government bonds that run at \u20ac60 billion a month, and a negative deposit rate, which means banks pay to hold funds at the central bank.\u201cWith core inflation projected to slowly approach the inflation target by end-2018, the European Central Bank should gradually taper asset purchases in 2018,\u201d the OECD said. \u201cInflation developments also warrant a gradual phasing out of the negative interest rate policy; in particular, the negative deposit rate could be raised toward the end of 2018 to make the policy rate corridor symmetric again.\u201dECB officials will meet Wednesday and Thursday to consider their next moves.       Mario Draghi,        the bank\u2019s president, is expected to express greater confidence in the economy after the meeting. He could announce a review into different exit strategies, but he is unlikely to directly address the timing of any future moves.Central bankers face a tricky task in signaling an impending removal of stimulus policies. When the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled an end to asset purchases in 2013, it sparked the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d, roiling stock and bond markets.Mr. Draghi doesn\u2019t always welcome advice from international institutions such as the OECD. Back in early 2014, when the International Monetary Fund was pressing for new stimulus measures, he responded with irritation to a call made a day ahead of an ECB policy meeting, suggesting it would not act similarly ahead of a Fed gathering.\u201cIt is a path toward normalization and is consistent with what the ECB has been saying,\u201d said       Catherine L. Mann,        the OECD\u2019s chief economist, of its new advice. \u201cMaybe it hasn\u2019t been as explicit.\u201dThe OECD\u2019s call came as part of its twice yearly report on the outlook for the global economy, in which it raised its growth forecasts for the eurozone both this year and next. By contrast, it lowered its forecast for the U.S. economy, and now expects growth this year of 2.1%, down from 2.4% in March. It also lowered its projection for 2018 to 2.4% from 2.8%, reflecting a later start for investment programs and tax changes it had expected from the new administration.\u201cThere\u2019s a realization that potential aspects of the program we thought would be in place by now have been pushed off to the end of the year, at best,\u201d Ms. Mann told The Wall Street Journal.The Paris-based research body also raised its growth forecasts for Japan and China for this year and next, and its forecast for global economic growth this year, to 3.5% from 3.3% in March. But it said investment spending would likely be too subdued to quickly raise productivity, a factor keeping wage rises limited despite falling unemployment rates.\u201cIn sum, the global economic outlook is better, but not good enough to sustainably improve citizens\u2019 well-being,\u201d said Ms. Mann.While the near-term outlook for growth has improved, the OECD believes financial markets are anticipating even better outcomes than are likely, raising the risk of a \u201csnap back\u201d in asset prices that could in turn hinder the global economy.\u201cWe do think that the financial markets continue to be disconnected from the state of the real economy,\u201d Ms. Mann said.The OECD also highlighted growing risks in housing markets, where prices in some countries have risen to levels that have in the past preceded busts.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-10-year-yield-falls-to-new-low-for-2017-1496760298", "news_time": "2017-06-07 01:08:00", "news_title": "U.S. 10-Year Yield Falls to New Low for 2017", "keywords": "bond yields,inflation,interest rates,monetary policy,reflation,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,PGIM Fixed Income,James Comey,economic performance,indicators,prices,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary", "content": "The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government note on Tuesday closed at the lowest level in 2017, extending its big slide since reaching this year\u2019s peak in March.The yield settled at 2.147%, compared with 2.182% Monday. It marked the yield\u2019s lowest close level since Nov 10. It traded above 2.6% in March. Yields fall as bond prices rise.Tuesday\u2019s demand for haven bonds reflects investors\u2019 caution ahead of several key events later this week that may affect global markets. Thursday will be the key focus with European Central Bank\u2019s policy meeting, the U.K. general election and congressional testimony from former FBI Director       James Comey.Other haven assets, including gold, the Japanese yen and the 10-year German bund--also gained ground Tuesday, reflecting some investors cutting back their appetites for danger to hedge potential downside risks for more perilous markets.Another boost for Treasurys, said some traders, was a report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, that China is prepared to increase its holdings of Treasurys under the right circumstances, as officials judge the assets are becoming more attractive than other sovereign debt and as the yuan stabilizes.China, the second-largest foreign holder of Treasurys after Japan, has been the biggest buyer of Treasury debt during the first quarter this year after cutting holdings last year, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In 2016, the country slashed its Treasury holdings by $188 billion. But in the first quarter of 2017, China increased its holdings by $29 billion to $1.088 trillion, the most recent such Treasury data released on May 15 show.The latest slide in the 10-year Treasury yield strengthened the bond market\u2019s turnaround after a big selloff in late 2016. Sell Treasurys was a popular way for investors to bet that a large fiscal stimulus in the U.S. would lead to stronger growth and higher inflation, known as the reflation trade. Confidence over President       Donald Trump\u2019s       fiscal agenda has been waning this year, causing investors to dial back bets on higher yields.\u201cThe bond market tells you that the reflation trade was overdone,\u2019\u2019 said       Michael Collins,        senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income.While the 10-year Treasury yield has been down by more than 0.2 percentage point this year, U.S. stocks hit a record high last week, with the Dow up more than 1,000 points since the end of 2016.Higher stocks and Treasury bond prices have been generating heated debate among investors this year. Some say the bond market is sending out a warning sign for investors to chase riskier assets with lofty valuations. Buying Treasurys offer some protection in case U.S. stocks suffer a big selloff.Others argue that many financial markets continue to benefit from generous liquidity thanks to bond buying, known as quantitative easing or QE, from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which are filling the void as the Federal Reserve has been pulling back support.\u201dQE is the tide that floats all boats, meaning all asset classes,\u2019\u2019 said       Jason Evans,        co-founder of hedge fund NineAlpha Capital LP.Mr. Evans said the 10-year Treasury yield at this low level doesn\u2019t offer value. But he refrains from placing large bets on the yield to rise, given that the consensus trade at the start of the year\u2014wagering on bond yields to rise\u2014has been derailed.A number of data releases have raised some questions about whether the U.S.\u2019s growth momentum may be less robust than investors had expected. Last Friday, the nonfarm jobs report showed a smaller-than-expected growth in  jobs in May. On Monday, a monthly gauge of the service industry, whose activities accounts for the bulk of the U.S. economy, was reported to have softened in May.Inflation has been showing signs of deceleration with some readings falling below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target again last month. Friday\u2019s jobs report also pointed to tepid wage inflation pressure even as the unemployment rate tumbled to a 16-year low.The inflation outlook is key to the Fed\u2019s plan to tighten monetary policy. Investors expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates next week following a rise in March. But some wonder whether a June increase could be the last one of the year, especially if there are further signs of decelerating inflation.The prospect of a go-slow Fed has reduced investors\u2019 concerns about a big rise in long-term Treasury yields. This, coupled with slowing inflation, is encourage investors to buy Treasurys. Since inflation chips away bonds\u2019 fixed returns over time, it is seen as a big threat to long-term government debt.Jack Flaherty, money manager at GAM Holdings AG, said he has bought long-term Treasurys in recent weeks. Now with the 10-year yield falling toward 2%, he becomes \u201ccautious,\u2019\u2019 because bond yields could rise if economic data show a rebound in both growth and inflation later this year.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 7, 2017, print edition as 'Treasury Prices Continue Their Rally.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-just-the-fangs-chinas-tech-rally-has-more-bite-1496811330", "news_time": "2017-06-07 00:55:00", "news_title": "Not Just the FANGs: China\u2019s Tech Rally Has More Bite ", "keywords": " alibaba, alphabet, amazon, china rally, china tech, facebook, fang,fangs, google, netflix, tencent,Alibaba Group,BABA,Amazon.com,AMZN,Alphabet Inc.

But China\u2019s tech giants,             Tencent Holdings Ltd.        TCEHY 0.10%       and             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -0.24%       are motoring at an even faster pace. They have each surged more than 40% so far this year and hover around record highs.Still, analysts and investors say these stocks have more room to rally. The companies are growing rapidly, their business models are diversified beyond just pure tech plays and their share prices are cheaper than the FANG group.Tencent and Alibaba, which together make up one-fourth of the MSCI China Index by market capitalization, have helped push the index 24% higher so far this year, far outpacing U.S. benchmarks. The MSCI China Index, which includes mostly Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and the U.S., is a vehicle for stock investors to gain exposure to China despite capital controls that limit direct foreign investment in domestic markets.For now, analysts are only getting more optimistic about Tencent\u2019s and Alibaba\u2019s futures, thanks to strong earnings and revenue growth. More than 90% of analysts who cover both companies say they are a buy; neither company has a sell rating, according to FactSet. Based on 12-month price targets, these analysts forecast double-digit gains for both companies over the ensuing year.\u201cFundamentals for these large-cap internet stocks have been pretty resilient,\u201d said       John Choi,        head of Hong Kong and China Internet research at Daiwa Capital Markets. \u201cThe overall momentum is still very strong and I think there is more to come.\u201dHong Kong-listed Tencent is the owner of China\u2019s largest social network, WeChat, and the world\u2019s largest videogame publisher by revenue. The company has a market capitalization of around $330 billion, or roughly the size of             Exxon Mobil Corp.       It has been investing and forming partnerships outside of China, including a 5% stake in       Elon Musk\u2019s            Tesla Inc.       Tencent logged $171 billion in revenue last year. Analysts expect that to nearly double within two years, according to FactSet.Caroline Yu Maurer,        the Hong Kong-based head of Greater China equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management, which has a stake in both companies, said Tencent is benefiting from a growing audience and increasingly sticky user base. WeChat had 938 million monthly active users in the first quarter, up 23% from a year earlier.\u201cIf Tencent can show more signs of monetizing WeChat, it would only give investors even more confidence,\u201d Ms. Maurer said. \u201cBut for now they\u2019re not desperate to find a new revenue source.\u201dAlibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is the e-commerce giant that runs popular online-shopping websites Taobao and Tmall. It has also surged to record highs, thanks to a string of strong quarterly results. Alibaba\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter revenue, reported last month, climbed 60% from a year earlier, a sign of strength for China\u2019s consumer economy. After shares rose following its initial public offering in New York in late 2014, the stock struggled for a few years before jumping in 2017.Even following these big rallies, Tencent\u2019s and Alibaba\u2019s valuations are rich but not exorbitant. Tencent fetches 35 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, below a recent high in 2014. Alibaba trades at a more reasonable 27 times forward earnings, which is roughly around its average in its three years on the public markets. By comparison, the four FANG stocks in the U.S. trade at an average multiple of about 90 times projected earnings. Amazon and Netflix, historically richly valued stocks, sport triple-digit multiples.\u201cWhen companies like Tencent and Alibaba have earnings growth at 40% or 50% even though they are already so big, you can justify a higher [valuation] multiple,\u201d Ms. Maurer said.Piling into tech has been beneficial for investors so far. Active U.S. fund managers collectively are outperforming their benchmarks for the first time in years, according to             Goldman Sachs,       thanks in part to their large positions in tech. But there are risks that ring true around the world.

It attracted a big Chinese investor in Tencent, which took a 5% stake in March, giving it local credibility and contacts. Shortly thereafter, Chinese state media tweeted a picture of Mr. Musk and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Beijing. Talk started swirling of a Tesla factory in China, which would end the import tax and possibly qualify Tesla for generous subsidies on which Chinese rivals such as BYD thrive. It boasts an ever-expanding list of its so-called supercharger stations in China.The question is, will whatever strategy Tesla is using to win those sales continue to work as it introduces its mass-market Model 3? Tesla hasn\u2019t said when next year it will launch the Model 3 in China and doesn\u2019t disclose sales margins there. Mr. Musk has said almost nothing in presentations or earnings calls about the China strategy, a glaring omission given China\u2019s increasing importance.Tesla may already be hitting a rough patch there. Based on customs data, research firm JL Warren Capital figures first-quarter shipments were down 15%, a trend that continued in April. Meanwhile, inventory built up. The number of vehicles sitting at dealerships in March and April was close to the highest ever for Tesla in China\u2014almost 5,000, a substantial count for a company that imported fewer than 12,000 vehicles last year.Tesla has been leaning on marketing tactics that will likely be short-lived. It has raised prices twice over the past year, both times announcing the increase was imminent\u2014which may pull demand forward, but is no way to generate new demand. It has offered discounted insurance\u201450% off for cars bought at a Tesla store\u2014as well as perks like free charging across the country for a limited time.Scalability is an issue. Tesla\u2019s success in big cities has been underpinned by another tactic: arranging coveted license plates for buyers.
