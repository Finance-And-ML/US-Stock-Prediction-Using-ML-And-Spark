The dollar index against a group of major currencies was 0.05 percent lower at 97.699. It had hit a one-month high of 97.871 on Tuesday as expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which hiked interest rates last week, would tighten policy again in 2017. The greenback's advance, however, stalled as the dollar-supportive bounce in U.S. Treasury yields was cut short overnight. Following a big drop in oil prices, the 10-year Treasury note yield fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing a large portion of the gains it made after the Fed left the door open for another rate increase this year.  Lower crude prices weaken inflationary pressures and in turn arrest the rise in U.S. yields,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  U.S. inflation indicators have not been strong to start with. Now that oil is falling, it could add further pressure to the dollar by weakening sentiment towards the U.S. energy sector.  The euro was steady at $1.1137 after retreating to a three-week low of $1.1119 overnight. The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 111.220 yen, off a near one-month peak of 111.790 touched on Tuesday. While the U.S. currency's advance may have stopped, some expected the losses to be limited, with the dollar seen eventually resuming its move higher.  Sentiment towards the dollar may not be great, but participants don't have strong motivation to buy the yen or euro either given the low-yield policies of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank,  said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.  And with Wall Street shares holding near record highs and the Fed seemingly intent on increasing rates, the market would not be in a hurry pass negative judgement on the dollar.  The pound was little changed at $1.2630. The currency had slid 0.9 percent overnight and plumbed a two-month trough of $1.2603. Sterling wobbled near two-month lows after BoE's Carney said on Tuesday that now was not the time to raise UK interest rates. Last week three out of eight BoE policymakers voted in favour of a rate hike and raised hopes for a near-term tightening. Commodity-linked currencies were also on the back foot after U.S. crude oil prices slumped to nine-month lows overnight on global oversupply fears. The Norwegian crown languished near a five-week low against the dollar after falling about 0.5 percent on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar, which fell about 0.35 percent overnight, extended losses to trade at C$1.3277 per dollar . The loonie moved further away from a 3-1/2-month high of C$1.3165 reached a week ago after Bank of Canada's governor expressed support for an interest rate hike. The Australian dollar edged down 0.1 percent to $0.7574 and the New Zealand dollar was 0.2 percent lower at $0.7228. Brent crude tumbled to seven-month lows on Tuesday as increased supply from several key producers overshadowed high compliance to an output cut deal among OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers.

That was, until St. Louis needed about 10 minutes to blow the whole thing wide open. The Cardinals took advantage of free baserunners during free baseball, scoring seven runs in the top of the 11th inning to take the opener of a three-game series against the Phillies 8-1 on Tuesday night.  I'm not even going to mention all the missed opportunities we had early on because that last inning is the one we want to remember,  St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said.  Just one guy right after the other, taking good at-bats. It was good to see.  Neither team had scored since the fourth inning until Phillies reliever Edubray Ramos walked Matt Carpenter and Dexter Fowler to begin the 11th, precipitating his removal from the game. Cardinals right fielder Stephen Piscotty delivered against Ramos' replacement, Casey Fien, smacking a 1-1 slider through the gap in right-center to score Carpenter and Fowler. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PhilliesSt. Louis catcher Yadier Molina and left fielder Tommy Pham put the exclamation points on the win. Each slammed a two-run home run later in the inning as the Cardinals (32-37) snapped a two-game losing streak.  He threw me a cutter first pitch, and I said if he throws it again, I'm going to crush it,  Pham.  I wish I could predict stuff like that, but I can't, I'm not that good. But it worked there.  Kevin Siegrist (1-1) earned the win by pitching a perfect 10th inning. The Phillies (22-47) were unable to do anything in response as they lost their fourth straight. The worst team in Major League Baseball has dropped 12 of their last 13 overall. Ramos (0-5) took the loss in his second straight appearance giving up multiple runs without recording an out.  Ramos couldn't throw strikes and Fien threw too many good, hittable strikes,  Phillies skipper Pete Mackanin said.  Tough way to lose a game after having such a good pitching performance.  With both teams desperate for positive momentum, each starting pitcher reversed poor recent outings and gave their clubs a chance. St. Louis' Mike Leake, who'd lost his last four starts while putting up a 6.20 ERA, held the Phillies to one run over six innings before being removed for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh. Philadelphia right-hander Jeremy Hellickson took the loss in four of his last five starts while giving up 22 earned runs in 27 1/3 innings over that time. He one-upped Leake, going seven innings while allowing one run and six hits while striking out four. Both starters had their share of difficulties in the middle innings, but both were able to limit the damage. Hellickson pitched around a two-on, one-out situation in the second inning after giving up a solo home run to third baseman Jedd Gyorko to open the frame. He got out of it with a flyout and strikeout. The next inning, a walk and double put men on second and third with nobody out, but Hellickson got Piscotty to ground out to third before Gyorko hit into a double play.  I didn't see that coming,  Mackanin said.  Usually when you get a man on third with nobody out you assume he's going to score...but (Hellickson) did a good job getting ground balls to get out of the jam.  Leake struggled in the fourth inning, walking the first two batters before getting a double play ball off the bat of Tommy Joseph. Philadelphia's Maikel Franco singled home the club's only run the next batter up. NOTES: The series continues Wednesday night as Phillies RHP Nick Pivetta (1-3, 4.46 ERA) opposes St. Louis RHP Michael Wacha (3-3, 4.78). ... This is the first of 20 straight days with a game for the Cardinals, taking them into the All-Star Break. ... The Phillies designated RHP Jeanmar Gomez and OF Michael Saunders for assignment and purchased the contracts of LHP Hoby Milner and OF Cameron Perkins from Triple-A Lehigh Valley. ... The Phillies also placed RHP Jerad Eickhoff on the 10-day disabled list with an upper back strain, and called up 1B Brock Stassi from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED6LVN1YU7"},

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was down 1.4 percent, or 77.55 points, to 5,679.70 at 0329 GMT. The benchmark on Tuesday ended 0.8 percent lower. Australia's metals and mining index fell as much as 2.5 percent to its lowest in over a month as Chinese steel futures slipped on Tuesday after a four-day rise. Pushing down the futures was of slower demand in the world's top steel consumer as rains affected construction activity in many parts of the country. Raw material iron ore was under pressure on the weaker steel prices. Most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange eased 0.7 percent to 430.50 yuan a tonne on Tuesday. Miner Rio Tinto declined as much as 3 percent to its lowest in more than a month, extending losses into a seventh straight session. BHP Billiton hit a seven-month low after falling as much as 3.7 percent. Financials stocks also dragged the index lower, with the  Big Four  banks losing between 1.3 percent and 2.4 percent.  Often in the Australian market, index related selling puts pressure on banks,  said  Ric Spooner, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.  So if we do have people, for example international investors, lessening their exposure to the Australian markets because of weaker commodity prices, then sometimes it involves selling mixed stocks generally including banks to reduce overall country exposure,  Spooner added. Gold stocks also suffered losses after the metal hit a five-week low on Tuesday. Newcrest Mining Ltd shed 1.5 percent to touch its lowest in nearly a month. Energy stocks were hurt by a 2 percent fall in oil prices on Tuesday, as a result of increased supply from several key producers overshadowing high compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output. Woodside Petroleum Ltd shed as much as 2.9 percent, hitting a seven-month low and Origin Energy Ltd dropped to a near three-month low. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index, which slipped 0.1 percent on Tuesday, dropped 0.5 percent, or 39.32 points, to 7,547.21. Losses in healthcare and materials stocks dragged the index down. Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd lost 1.5 percent and Fletcher Building Ltd 2.1 percent.

Attorneys for Martinelli, who has denied Panamanian prosecutors' accusation that he used public money to spy on more than 150 political rivals during his 2009-14 term, said he has lived openly in the United States for the past two years and has no plans to flee. U.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres said he is likely to decide within a week whether to release Martinelli, 65, who is being held in federal detention in Miami at the request of the Panamanian government. U.S. prosecutors have said they are fulfilling a treaty obligation with Panama in requesting that Martinelli, who was arrested on June 12, continue to be held.  His past behavior suggests he would do whatever is necessary to avoid returning to Panama, including jumping bond to a third country,  said Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels.  He has a massive amount of wealth that could sustain an escape to a third country where he and his family could stay in exile for decades.  Members of the CD (Democratic Change) political party take part in a protest to support former Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli, in Panama City, Panama, June 20, 2017.Carlos LemosMartinelli's attorneys argued their client is the target of a politically motivated prosecution by his successor, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Martinelli's attorney, Marcus Jimenez, pointed out the former president was arrested a week before Varela met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday. Slideshow (4 Images)He argued Martinelli is being targeted as a result of a  personal vendetta  by Varela, who was Martinelli's vice president. Last month, Martinelli said on Twitter that Varela was going after him to divert attention from his own problems.   Panama's purported charges against President Martinelli are legally defective, lack probable cause and are transparently motivated by politics,  the former leader's lawyers said in their motion seeking bail. Martinelli's attorneys also said he had already left the country to seek political asylum in the United States before charges were brought by Panama. Martinelli's legal team has submitted a bond proposal for $5 million, GPS monitoring of the former president, keys to his airplane, two helicopters, and various boats.

By late morning the blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.6 percent at 3,568.74 points. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent to 3,147.39. While the CSI300 has lagged a global stock rally so far this year, it had surged nearly 8 percent since mid-May, partly on expectations of the MSCI decision. As a result, traders said the news prompted some investors to take profits in blue-chips, which are no longer considered cheap after their recent run-up. Some also attributed the market apathy to the largely symbolic nature of the MSCI decision. The U.S. index publisher will add 222 yuan-denominated A shares to its MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with an initial weight of just 0.73 percent, and the change will only take effect beginning in June 2018.  The result is not a surprise,  said Hu Yuanzhi, Shanghai-based fund manager at Rationalstone Investment, noting that even ahead of the announcement, some investors were pocketing gains. She added that the China market still has a long way to go before it can gain true global recognition and attracts  sizable  amount of foreign capital. The CSI SWS Securities Index, which tracks securities companies, was up around 1.4 percent but it soon retreated and was basically flat. Rakesh Patel, head of Asia Pacific equities at HSBC, said:  Flows in the short term are actually (expected to be) quite modest, probably about $12-14 billion of flows from active and passive in year one after inclusion.  But on a five-10 year view, there's potential for $500 billion worth of inflows, which is huge. This is based on full-weight, full inclusion for both MSCI and FTSE.  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was down 0.2 percent at 25,800.98. The H-share index of mainland China firms was down 0.6 percent. It had firmed about 6 percent in recent weeks.  We're positive on the Chinese market but we prefer H-shares because we think there's more chance of A-share investors buying the H-shares...,  said Sean Taylor, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset Management.  But we have to note that in certain stocks, we can get exposure in the A shares to industries we can't get in H-shares.

The agency has simultaneously published Kyobo Life's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' with a Stable Outlook. The proposed securities will be Kyobo Life's direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS The proposed securities are rated one notch below Kyobo Life's IDR to reflect Fitch's assumption of 'below-average' recovery prospects in the event of a default, given the level of subordination. The securities rank senior to junior obligations, including preference shares, but rank junior to all other present and future senior and subordinated obligations of the issuer, other than the claims of the holders of other parity obligations. The securities initially have a maturity period of 30 years; and if not redeemed at the option of issuer on the first and subsequent maturity dates, they will be automatically extended for another 30 years from each such date. They are callable after five years, alongside a 100bp coupon step-up feature after 10 years. There is no additional notching for non-performance risk, as Fitch views this risk as 'minimal' under the agency's criteria. With regards to optional cancellation of distributions, management has the right to cancel payments, in whole but not in part, at its discretion. The mandatory capital ratio trigger occurs when the issuer is deemed to be insolvent. Fitch considers that the coupon cancellation triggers are unlikely to be triggered unless the company is under an extremely distressed situation on the brink of insolvency. As the proposed securities are afforded equity credit for regulatory solvency purposes, Fitch applies its 'regulatory override' and therefore classifies these securities as 100% equity capital within the agency's assessment of risk-based capital adequacy. However, these securities are classified as 100% debt for the agency's financial leverage calculations. Hybrids with coupon step-ups on call dates are typically treated as 100% debt by Fitch. The issuance will increase Kyobo Life's financial leverage. Fitch estimates its leverage at end-March 2017 to be below 15%, after including its planned issuance of USD500 million. This is stronger than the median score of 28% for 'A' rated issuers based on Fitch's methodology. Fitch also expects Kyobo Life's interest coverage to remain adequate and commensurate with its existing rating, after this subordinated bonds issuance. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of Kyobo Life's ratings in the near term is unlikely. However, over the longer-term, key rating triggers for an upgrade include a stronger market franchise and better positioning, with further international diversification, sustaining its regulatory risk-based capitalisation ratio above 350%, continued proactive management of its negative spread burden and consistently strong profitability, with pre-tax return on assets above 1.3%. Conversely, key rating triggers for a downgrade include a weakening business franchise, deterioration in capitalisation, with its risk-based capitalisation ratio falling below 250% on a prolonged basis and a sharp decline in its financial performance, with, for example, pre-tax return on assets consistently below 0.7%.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee.

Simpson, serving time in a Nevada prison for a 2008 robbery and kidnapping conviction, has been set for July 20, the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners announced on Tuesday. Simpson, famously acquitted in a sensational double-murder trial that gripped America two decades ago, was sentenced to as much as 33 years in prison for a bungled 2007 attempt in Las Vegas to recover memorabilia from his storied sports career. If granted parole at next month's hearing, he will remain in custody until at least Oct. 1, parole officials said. Simpson, 70, will appear for the hearing through a video feed from the Lovelock Correctional Center, about 100 miles northeast of Carson City, the state capital. If the four parole commissioners who are scheduled to conduct the hearing cannot agree unanimously on whether to release Simpson, the remaining three members will be contacted immediately to review the case and vote until there is a majority for approval or denial. Former football star O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife, was arrested in connection with an alleged armed robbery in a hotel room in Las Vegas, September 16, 2007, police said.Las Vegas Metropolitan Police DepartmentThe board in 2013 granted Simpson parole on several of the charges related to his conviction - namely kidnapping, robbery and burglary. But he remained ineligible for time still to be served on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and related sentencing issues. Simpson, one of the greatest running backs in the National Football League in the 1970s, was found guilty by a Nevada jury of all 12 charges against him for storming into a Las Vegas hotel room with five cohorts and holding two sports merchandise dealers at gunpoint, then making off with thousands of dollars in collectibles. The four other men originally charged in the case all pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution during Simpson's trial. His 2008 conviction came exactly 13 years after his controversial 1995 acquittal in Los Angeles of the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, who were found stabbed and slashed to death in June 1994. A civil court jury later found Simpson liable for their deaths and awarded $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families, a judgment that remains largely unpaid. Prosecutors said the Las Vegas robbery grew out of grudges Simpson had nursed since his murder trial and civil case. He claimed he was out to take back property that rightfully belonged to him.

The United States, Brazil and 10 other members of the 34-nation Organization of American States (OAS) issued a letter accusing Venezuela of undermining democracy, failing to feed its people and violating rights.   Considering the interruption of the democratic process in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we believe that there should be a settled solution that includes all Venezuelan parties for the benefit of the people of that nation,  said the letter issued at the OAS general assembly in Cancun, Mexico. It called for the release of political prisoners, respect for rights, an election timetable, a  humanitarian channel  to ship food and medicine, and the creation of a group or mechanism to help  effective dialogue among Venezuelans.  The 12 nations also called on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to abandon a July 30 vote for a super-body with powers to rewrite the country's constitution. Critics see Maduro's move as a ploy to hold on to power.  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez fired back, criticizing Mexico's rights record and highlighting poverty, violence and migration in Honduras and other nations. Related CoverageVenezuelan foreign minister threatens never to return to OASRodriguez said the country's planned constituent assembly was the only way to overcome the current crisis peacefully and called her critics  lapdogs of imperialism.   Do you want war? Is that what you want for Venezuela?  the minister said, wearing a red dress, the color identified with Venezuela's Socialist Party. She accused OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro of trying to stir up a civil war in Venezuela.  Great, we've reached the boss,  she said as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan began a speech, repeating her jibe that the OAS is an arm of U.S. diplomacy. Sullivan asked members of the OAS  to do right by the people of Venezuela  through the creation of a group to help facilitate a resolution. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez listens during the OAS 47th General Assembly in Cancun, Mexico June 20, 2017.Carlos JassoRodriguez said:  The only way you could impose this on us is with your Marines, which would meet a strong response in Venezuela.   She said Venezuela would never go back to the OAS. But she left the door open to participating in further meetings, saying that although Venezuela left the organization there was a two-year administrative period to finalize the departure in which it could still participate. Slideshow (4 Images)Honduran Foreign Minister Maria Dolores Aguero asked Rodriguez to explain how her government was going to alleviate Venezuela's problems.  Instead of responding to all of us who want peace for your people, why not tell us how you are going to resolve the crisis they are living?  Aguero said. A meeting on the sidelines failed on Monday to agree on a resolution formally rebuking Venezuela, where 75 people have been killed in protests in recent weeks.  A resolution, a strong declaration from this organization, is probably the only realistic way of avoiding a blood bath in Venezuela,  said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the executive director Americas for Human Rights Watch. Some of the meeting's participants remained optimistic they could reach a resolution and that Venezuela could avoid spiraling further into violence. The foreign minister of Guatemala, a nation that faced a 36-year internal armed conflict that left some 200,000 people dead, voiced that sentiment.  We don't wish that on anybody, least of all Venezuela, and if we were able to sit down and negotiate, Venezuela needs to be able to do that too,  Foreign Minister Carlos Morales said.

The holder of brands like Gloria Jean's Coffees and Donut King said in a statement it expected underlying net profit growth of 15 percent for the financial year to June 30, down from previous guidance of 20 percent growth. RFG, which has relied on growing through bolt-on acquisitions and increasing its store network, said it had been affected by hurdles in franchise growth overseas and supply chain issues at its domestic Michel's Patisserie cafe chain. Domestic growth was in-line with the prior year, with gains in most brands offsetting a decline for Michel's Patisserie. RFG said it would take a A$22 million ($17 million) non-cash writedown in its FY17 earnings following a reassesment of the recoverability of marketing advances to Michel's and its Pizza Capers business, partly due to a reduced number of outlets. The company said Managing Director Andre Nell will take over as chief executive later this year following the retirement of Gary Alford after two decades with the company.

For an earlier INSTANT VIEW on reactions to the decision, see Key points MSCI plans to add 222 Chinese shares to its Emerging Markets Index, with an initial weighting of 0.73 percent. The full inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks in the widely tracked MSCI Emerging Markets Index could pull more than $400 billion of funds from asset managers, pension funds and insurers into mainland China's equity markets over the next decade, according to analysts. Comments Rakesh Patel, Head of Asia Pacific Equities, Hsbc  The launch of Stock Connect has been a pivotal part of making this happen over the last couple of years or so. The reduction in suspension of stocks has also been quite important. Flows in the short term are actually quite modest, probably about $12-14 billion of flows from active and passive in year one after inclusion. But on a five-10 year view, there's potential for $500 billion worth of inflows, which is huge. This is based on full-weight, full inclusion for both MSCI and FTSE. For global equity funds, China only represents 3 percent of global equity funds right now in terms of weighting. This is versus the second-largest market cap in the world. So there's a big lag between where equity funds are positioned globally and how big China has become. As you start to see more inflows, China gets a bigger weighting in equity funds, which actually represents really where the market is today.  SEAN TAYLOR, ASIA PACIFIC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT  From today, international investors who don't know the A-share market, and who aren't looking at Asia from Asia, need to focus on that. Going forward, China and Asia are already a big part of the emerging market index, and will become increasingly bigger as time goes on. We're positive on the Chinese market but we prefer H-shares because we think there's more chance of A-share investors buying the H-shares... But we have to note that in certain stocks, we can get exposure in the A shares to industries we can't get in H-shares. China has been given a big tick in the box from the international investment community and the MSCI. And it might mean that over the next few years, they will accelerate reforms. It gives them the confidence to know that they are doing the right thing. KEN JARRETT, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, SHANGHAI  The inclusion of some China A-shares into MSCI's emerging markets index is another sign of China's ongoing integration into the global financial system. We hope that the MSCI decision will spur domestic regulators to bring China's stock markets in line with global norms and make the regulatory environment more predictable, improve transparency in the stock market listing process, and bring stronger rule of law to the wider securities industry. This would mean not banning major stockholders from selling shares during periods of market turbulence, not suspending the trading of stocks outside the use of predetermined circuit breakers, and therefore not creating the conditions that lead to moral hazard.  Medha Samant, Investment Director, Fidelity International  This has been a long awaited decision, so it's not entirely surprising. It will definitely now put Chinese companies on the map, these companies which were seen to be largely the domain of retail investors. From a sentiment and symbolic perspective, it's significant. But for those active investors who wanted to participate in this part of China's economy, they've already done so. The 0.7 percent inclusion, on an absolute level, doesn't look that big. But the fact is, when you look at the availability of companies, the size of the market, even a small shift makes a significant difference...A lot of them are in consumer and services sectors, which is what foreign investors find the most interesting part of China's growth. As we move ahead, as more details emerge, there will be more interest...It's making it easier for foreign investors to understand and have access to these companies. As things develop further, and we think the regulator will be working on that, it will definitely mean expanding the universe a bit.  KEVIN ANDERSON, ASIA PACIFIC HEAD OF INVESTMENTS, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS (via email)  In the short term, certain market policies and arrangements may continue to weigh on some investors’ minds. For example, trading suspensions of China A-shares, which most recently peaked in 2015, can create challenges for investors. Chinese stock exchanges also require pre-approval of any financial products linked to China A-shares. MSCI has highlighted the potential for disruptions to offering existing financial products based on the MSCI EM Index if a Chinese exchange denies approval of MSCI’s licensing of that index. Reservations remain over pre-approvals and technical issues related to Stock Connect, including the timely execution of trades and settlement, as well as a segregated accounts model that remains out of line with international standards. By and large, however, investors appear to be confident enough about the current framework. With China continuing to pursue its reform agenda, and the domestic market now too big to ignore, China’s ultimate aim of full inclusion should be the focus. China A-shares are estimated to grow to as much as 15 percent of the EM Index market cap, yet the timeframe for that remains uncertain.  JOHN SIN, HEAD OF ASSET SERVICING FOR GREATER CHINA, BNY MELLON (via email)  Despite the reduced A-shares index weighting of 0.73 percent, today's announcement represents a defining moment for the Chinese stock market. China's inclusion to MSCI's Emerging Market Index symbolises the continuation of China's inevitable rise and increased relevance within global portfolios. While the short and longer term impact will have to be monitored, investors will be cognizant that China's weighting and influence continues to increase.  GREG KUHNERT, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT INVESTEC ALL CHINA EQUITY FUND (via email)  At long last MSCI has included the second largest equity market in the world in their indices, thanks to improved accessibility from the Hong Kong and Shanghai/Shenzhen Connect programmes... We believe Chinese A shares bring great benefits to global investors, namely the ability to invest in a broader universe of ideas (over 3,000 listed A shares) that are more representative of the Chinese economy and its new growth drivers, along with greater diversification benefits from an overall portfolio volatility perspective. We believe in the long term that China as a country will play an outsized role in regional and emerging portfolios and may in itself become a unique asset class for asset allocators across the world.

Shares will decline broadly but will recoup towards the end of this week as China domestic equities joining the MSCI index is a temporary issue,  Kim said.          A senior government official said the South Korean share market could see outflows of up to 4.3 trillion won ($3.78 billion) after the U.S. index provider said it will add domestic Chinese equities to its widely tracked Emerging Markets Index          .                  While the inclusion could draw billions of dollars to China's A shares and decrease South Korea's weight in the index, most analysts expect the overall impact won't be significant on Seoul equities as the benchmark KOSPI is a highly liquid market.     Indeed, the government said Seoul shares are likely to shrug off an outflow of few trillion won, as the total market capitalization of stocks listed on the benchmark main KOSPI         is at 1,536 trillion won as of the closing on June 20.     Foreign investors net sold 100.5 billion won ($88.24 million) worth of KOSPI shares near mid-session, while institutional investors offloaded 72.4 billion won, which dragged down the index.      Market heavyweight Samsung Electronics             lost 1.9 percent while Hyundai Motor             was down 1.8 percent.     The South Korean won        dropped to a two-month low.      The won            was quoted at 1,141.2 against the dollar, down 0.5 percent versus Tuesday's close of 1,135.4.                                    0213 GMT    Prev close  Dollar/won             1,141.2      1,135.4  Yen/won                10.2515      10.2362  *KTB futures            109.43       109.44  KOSPI                 2,359.97     2,369.23  * Front-month futures on three-year treasury bonds   ($1 = 1,138.9000 won)   (Reporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)   ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/southkorea-markets-midday-idUSL3N1JI1G2"},

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc, Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd. Woodside, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, said in a statement that FAR had  apparently initiated arbitration proceedings . That came after FAR said on Tuesday that it had made a request to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to start arbitration. The project was due to start production as early as 2021, but has faced delays due to the ongoing ownership dispute between the two Australian energy companies. Woodside bought a 35-percent stake in the oil project last year from U.S. energy major ConocoPhillips and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year. Woodside said earlier this month that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator. FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and had said the Senegalese government was yet to approve the deal. However, Woodside said in its statement on Wednesday that Senegal's energy minister had issued an order confirming the company's participation in the project. Woodside shares fell 2.3 percent to A$29.22 ($22.13) in early trade on Wednesday, while shares of FAR were down 1.3 percent at A$0.074.

The drone crashed while returning to the North and was found equipped with a camera and aerial photographs of a U.S. anti-missile defence system site in a southern region of South Korea, South Korean officials told a briefing. The origin and flight path of the drone were confirmed in an analysis of the onboard computer and camera, South Korea's defense ministry and military officials told the briefing.  The intrusion of our airspace by the North Korean drone and photographing of a military base is a violation of the Armistice and an agreement on non-aggression and is an act of grave provocation,  Jeon Dong-jin, an official of the Joint Chiefs of Staff office said.  We strongly condemn the North's continued attempts at penetrating the South with drones and once again, demand all acts of provocation are halted,  he said during the briefing.  If North Korea continues to engage in acts of provocation against the South, our military will forcefully retaliate and we warn all responsibility for events occurring going forth is with the North.  The drone had been launched in the Kumgang-gun area in Kangwon Province on May 2, the defense ministry's spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told the briefing.  The aircraft proceeded to fly for a total of five hours and thirty minutes and its assessed flight path matched the evidence seen in the photographs taken by it,  said Moon. Moon added the drone had been found with roughly 550 photographs and the military assessed it aimed to collect information on South Korean military bases and the anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system located in Seongju, South Korea, 217 km (135 miles) south of Seoul. The drone had turned around in Seongju after taking photographs, Moon said, and later crashed in Inje-gun in the South's Gangwon Province where it was found by South Korean military on June 9. The U.S. THAAD anti-defense system has been deployed in South Korea to counter a growing missile threat from North Korea. North Korean drones are known to have flown over South Korea several times. The defense ministry said on Wednesday this latest drone largely matched another North Korean drone discovered in 2014 on Baengnyeong Island, near the inter-Korean maritime border.

That includes payments by three Russian companies and a Netherlands-based company, Inovo, controlled by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, they said. The FBI's interest in Kian has not been previously reported. Kian played a central role in securing and overseeing the Inovo contract, two people with knowledge of that project said.  It is not clear whether Kian is a target of the criminal investigation or whether investigators are trying to build a fuller understanding of how Flynn's company operated. A person recently interviewed by the FBI in connection with the Flynn investigation said agents from the bureau's criminal division had asked as much about Kian and his work on the project with Alptekin as they had about Flynn.  Kian did not respond to repeated requests for comment, nor did the lawyer he recently hired, Robert Trout. The FBI declined to comment. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to requests for comment. Alptekin declined to comment for this story but last month told Reuters that he was satisfied with the work done by Flynn Intel Group and denied any wrongdoing.  The FBI has been investigating whether Flynn's consulting firm lobbied on behalf of Turkey - after being paid $530,000 by Inovo - without making the proper disclosure, Reuters reported earlier this month. The federal investigation is being run by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller has a mandate to investigate contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 election campaign team and any related matters. Flynn was fired by the Trump administration in February after officials said he mischaracterized a series of phone calls with Russia’s ambassador last December.   The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has separately been looking into whether Flynn made false statements in applying for security clearance, said he was also scrutinizing Kian.   I have an interest in Bijan Kian and his interactions with General Flynn based on specific documents already obtained by the Committee,” Elijah Cummings told Reuters in an email.  Kelner has sought immunity for Flynn in exchange for his testimony, saying his client  certainly has a story to tell.     Special Counsel Robert Mueller departs after briefing the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on his investigation of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 20, 2017.Aaron P. Bernstein     Failed Coup Opens a Door In private conversations with potential clients, Kian portrayed himself as a rainmaker for Flynn, tapping into  connections cultivated during a five-year tenure as a director at the U.S. Export-Import Bank, according to one person who worked with the firm. Alptekin told Reuters in May that his firm hired Flynn Intel Group to research Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen's activities in the United States, which he suspected were  poisoning  relations between the United States and Turkey. Like Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Alptekin blamed a failed coup in Turkey last July on followers of Gulen. Carlos Barria/File PictureGulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the attempted coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. Kian oversaw key elements of the project that emerged, including a still-unfinished documentary on Gulen, according to two people involved in the project. Inovo paid Flynn Intel Group a total of $530,000, starting in September, according to a Justice Department filing by the company in March. Flynn Intel Group paid $80,000 to Inovo in  consultancy fees,  according to the filing, which does not provide more detail on why payments were made in both directions. On Sept. 19, Kian and Flynn met in New York with Turkey's foreign minister and energy minister, who is Erdogan's son-in-law, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.   In late October, Kian invited staff of the House Homeland Security Committee to Flynn Intel Group's headquarters in Virginia. The meeting was called to show off new mobile phone security technology, but Kian also used the opportunity to try to get a congressional hearing on Gulen, according to a person at the meeting.  At that point, the Flynn Intel Group had only disclosed its work for Alptekin's Inovo in a filing with Congress. It had not mentioned Inovo’s ties to Turkey. When Justice Department officials became aware months later that Kian and other Flynn Intel Group officials had met with Turkish officials they insisted on a fuller disclosure, people involved in those discussions said. The Flynn Intel Group made the more detailed disclosure in its March filing with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act that said the work that Flynn and Kian did for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Reporting by Nathan Layne; Additional reporting by John Walcott, Julia Harte and Jonathan Landay in Washington; Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Ross Colvin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-kian-idUSKBN19B0ZL"},

The program features a three-year initiative to help coordinate crime-fighting efforts among federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement and prosecutors, Sessions said in unveiling the new National Public Safety Partnership. Trump, a Republican, made tough-on-crime rhetoric a focus of his 2016 campaign. The new program stems from an executive order he signed in February mandating that the Justice Department provide support for local law enforcement.  We have a duty to make sure our country does not abandon all the progress we have made against crime over the past few decades,  Sessions said at a national meeting of law enforcement officials. His remarks were released by the Justice Department. Sessions did not disclose any new funding for the initiative, which will focus on gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence. The federal government will provide help in areas that include training, crime analysis, gun violence, community engagement and investigations. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivers remarks at a summit on crime reduction and public safety in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S., June 20, 2017.Yuri Gripas/File PhotoA spike in violent crime in 2015 continued into the first half of last year, with big cities seeing an average increase in murders of almost 22 percent compared with the same period the year before, Sessions said. The dozen cities chosen for the program are Birmingham, Alabama; Indianapolis; Memphis, Tennessee; Toledo, Ohio; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Buffalo, New York; Cincinnati; Houston; Jackson, Tennessee; Kansas City, Missouri; Lansing, Michigan; and Springfield, Illinois.  Sessions said more communities could be announced for the partnership this year. The 12 cities were picked because they have levels of violence well above the national average and are ready to receive training and aid, Justice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley said. Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials also helped choose them, he said. Chicago and nine other cities that were in a pilot program called the Violence Reduction Network will also take part in the initiative.

New Jersey-based J&J; has been battling a series of lawsuits over its talc-based products, including Johnson's Baby Powder, brought by around 5,950 women and their families. The company denies any link between talc and cancer. A fifth of the plaintiffs have cases pending in state court in St. Louis, where juries in four trials have hit J&J; and a talc supplier with $307 million in verdicts. Those four cases and most of the others on the St. Louis docket involve out-of-state plaintiffs suing an out-of-state company. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there. The ruling immediately led a St. Louis judge at J&J;'s urging to declare a mistrial in the latest talc case, in which two of the three women at issue were from out of state. It also could imperil prior verdicts and cases that have yet to go to trial.  We believe the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Bristol-Myers Squibb matter requires reversal of the talc cases that are currently under appeal in St. Louis,  J&J; said in a statement. The question of where such lawsuits can be filed has been the subject of fierce debate. The business community has argued plaintiffs should not be allowed to shop around for the most favorable court to bring lawsuits, while injured parties claim corporations are trying to deny them access to justice. Along with talc cases, large-scale litigation alleging injuries from Bayer AG's Essure birth control device in Missouri and California and GlaxoSmithKline's antidepressant Paxil in California and Illinois are examples of other cases where defendants could utilize the Supreme Court decision. Although he declared a mistrial on Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison left the door open for the plaintiffs to argue they still have jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said he would argue the St. Louis court still had jurisdiction based on a Missouri-based bottler J&J; used to package its talc products, which he said would create a sufficient connection to the state.  It's very disappointing to mistry a case because the Supreme Court changed the rules on us,  said Meadows. The lawsuit decided by the high court on Monday involved claims against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp by 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians over the blood thinner Plavix. Beyond Monday's mistrial, the Supreme Court's ruling could bolster a pending appeal by J&J; of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox, who died in 2015. A Missouri appeals court had said in May it would wait until the Supreme Court issued its decision to decide the appeal. J&J; has won only one of the five trials so far in Missouri. It previously sought to move talc cases out of St. Louis, but the Missouri Supreme Court in January denied its bid. The company has also cast the St. Louis court as overly  plaintiff-friendly and has allowed evidence linking talc to cancer that was rejected by a New Jersey state court judge overseeing over 200 talc cases. The plaintiffs are appealing. The talc verdicts against J&J; led the business-friendly American Tort Reform Association last year to declare the St. Louis state court the nation's top  Judicial Hellhole.  Now J&J; could try to use the Supreme Court ruling to dismiss many of the cases it faces in Missouri, according to legal experts. Corporations facing a large volume of cases in venues chosen by plaintiffs will likely cite the Supreme Court to try to dismiss those claims, said Rusty Perdew, a defense lawyer at the law firm Locke Lord.  You have a bunch of defendants who can go back and say, 'Judge, you got that wrong and you're going to have to dismiss claims by all those plaintiffs,'  he said.

The case has been monitored closely by other private equity-owned companies and their creditors, because it could spark more claims against bankrupt companies over so-called dividend recapitalizations, which involve a company borrowing money so it can pay the buyout firms which own it a special dividend. Payless' creditors had said in court filings that private equity firms Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital, which together hold 98.5 percent of the company and control its board, received more than $400 million in dividends in recent years. This added to the company's debt pile. Payless filed for bankruptcy in April with $838 million of debt, joining a long list of retailers struggling in a sharp downturn in the sector. Under the settlement, the shoe chain's unsecured creditors, largely its landlords and vendors, will receive $25 million in cash in the bankruptcy reorganization, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deal is not yet public.  The payout amounts to a recovery of between 17 and 21 cents on the dollar for the claims of the creditors, a major improvement from the pennies they expected when the case began, one of the people said.  The shoe seller and its owners did not to admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, the people said. The deal will net an additional $7.3 million for another pool of creditors, the people said.  Golden Gate and Payless declined to comment. Blum did not immediately return a request for comment. The agreement sets Payless on track to exit bankruptcy as soon as August, according to the people and court papers, avoiding winding down its business like many of its bankrupt peers.  Payless said last month that independent board member Charles Cremens was conducting his own investigation of possible claims against the private equity firms. The company opposed a separate investigation by the creditors, saying it could hinder attempts to bring the company out of bankruptcy. As part of its reorganization plan, Payless has said it must renegotiate 3,600 U.S. store leases as well as joint venture partnerships in Latin America, a region it has described as a cornerstone for future growth.

Australia's No. 1 insurer by premium income said an increase in weather-related claims in Latin America and a higher frequency of medium-sized risk-related claims in Asia would lift its combined operating ratio by 1 percent from earlier guidance. A higher combined operating ratio translates to lower underwriting profits for insurers.  We estimate it is about a 6 percent profit downgrade,  Shaw and Partners analyst David Spotswood said.  It is another stuff-up by QBE. The management, their track record is in tatters. They have got a 20-year track record of missing numbers and making mistakes.  The company did not warn of any problems in its emerging markets business at its annual meeting in early May.  They had their AGM and they were confident and a couple of months later, bang,  Spotswood said.  People are angry.  The company had been taking steps to boost earnings and reinstate investor confidence after years of underperformance. Those efforts include cutting costs, putting in place a comprehensive re-insurance plan, changing management teams and selling non-core or underperforming businesses. QBE Chief Executive John Neal said in a statement the company was  encouraged  by an improvement in the combined operating ratio in Australia, New Zealand and North America as well as a good performance in Europe in the first five months of the financial year. But he said the heightened claims activity in emerging markets would drag down the company's results. QBE forecasts a combined operating ratio of about 110 percent in the emerging markets division. A ratio of more than 100 percent indicates underwriting losses. The company's overall combined operating ratio is now forecast at 94.5 percent to 96 percent, compared with February guidance of 93.5 percent to 95 percent. The company forecast interim insurance profit margin to be in the range of 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent. It reported insurance profit margin of 9.7 percent in 2016. The insurer, which generates almost three-quarters of its premiums abroad, said in February it expected the market to remain challenging in 2017 though there were indications of a modest improvement. QBE shares are trading at the lowest level since March. The company declined to comment beyond its statement to the market.

Two days before European leaders meet in Brussels to discuss migration policy and other issues, Italy's Interior Ministry said 71,000 migrants have been rescued at sea this year, 26 percent more than the same period last year. Last week, the European Commission opened a legal case against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in asylum seekers under a 2015 plan to relocate migrants from frontline states Greece and Italy.  I'm sorry that not everyone, including in Europe, has shown the same willingness to take people in  as Italy has, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a message marking world refugee day.  More than 190,000 asylum seekers are living in state-funded shelters.   The refugee issue crosses national borders and involves the entire EU and is, in the end, a global phenomenon,  he added. Turkey has largely stopped migrants from setting off in small boats for the Greek islands since signing a deal with the EU last year. That has made Italy the main country through which migrants fleeing violence and poverty are reaching Europe.  There are a lot of problems in Chad... There is a lot of killing and a lot of violence,  said Ibrahim, who was rescued in the Mediterranean over the weekend along with his wife and infant daughter, who he held in his arms.   All we really want is to stay in a really safe place, where we can feel safe without any of these problems and any of these troubles, and not be fearful for our lives,  he told Reuters on the Vos Hestia rescue ship run by Save the Children. Almost 2,000 people have died trying to make the crossing  this year, and at least 130 people died at sea over the weekend in three different incidents, the U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday. There has also been a decline in the number of rescues by ships participating in the EU's anti-smuggling mission, Sophia, this year, Italian coastguard data show. Italian navy and coastguard picked up 41 percent of migrants rescued at sea last year, NGO ships 26 percent, and Sophia 25 percent.

In a complaint filed on Monday in Los Angeles federal court, Denise Daniels said the animated film, featuring color-coded characters representing individual human emotions, mirrors a children's program called  The Moodsters  that she conceived and pitched to Disney every year from 2005 to 2009. Daniels, who lives in Minnesota's Twin Cities area and has appeared on TV shows including  Today  and  Oprah,  said she had an  implied-in-fact  contract with Disney requiring that she be paid from box office, DVD, Blu-Ray, iTunes and merchandise revenue from  Inside Out.  The film has grossed more than $850 million worldwide since its June 2015 release. Daniels said this  extreme success  was not possible without her work, and that Disney should pay her because it is  custom and common in the entertainment industry.   A Disney spokesman, however, said  Inside Out  was an original Pixar creation.  We look forward to vigorously defending against this lawsuit in court,  the spokesman said. Ronald Schutz, a lawyer for Daniels, declined to comment. Daniels was unavailable to comment.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has begun considering legislation that would cover military action in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya and Yemen against the Islamic State, al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups.  I have always believed that it's important for Congress to exercise its constitutional role to authorize the use of force,  the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Bob Corker, told a hearing on Tuesday. As President Donald Trump has ordered stepped-up military activity in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, members of Congress also want Trump to present a strategy for defeating Islamic State and other militant groups.  It's difficult for us to carry out our responsibility unless we know what the commander in chief needs,  Senator Ben Cardin, the committee's top Democrat, said.  The Trump administration, like former President Barack Obama's, has been using a 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against al Qaeda passed after the Sept. 11 attacks as the legal basis for a wide range of military action since. Although there is bipartisan support for Congress to debate and vote on a new AUMF introduced by Republican Senator Jeff Flake and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, the measure faces stiff opposition.  Lawmakers have introduced war authorizations repeatedly in the past several years. But they have failed to advance amid sharp divisions in Congress over whether, or how, to limit commanders' use of military resources. Many war-weary members of Congress also do not want to vote for anything that might become a foreign military quagmire consuming taxpayer dollars or leading to widespread U.S. casualties. Trump has ordered stepped-up military operations against Islamic State and delegated more authority to his generals. U.S.-led forces said on Tuesday they had shot down an armed  pro-Syrian regime  drone near the border between Iraq and Syria. A U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet over Syria on Sunday. Democratic Senator Tom Udall voted for the 2001 authorization while he was a member of the House of Representatives.  I would have never imagined that vote supporting U.S. troops in Syria in 2017 and engagements with the Assad regime,  he said.

Brown's death triggered sometimes violent protests in Ferguson and around the United States, fueled by later police killings of unarmed black men in other cities. It also helped spark debate about racial bias in the U.S. justice system. Terms of the wrongful death settlement between Ferguson and Brown's parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, were not disclosed. U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber approved the settlement and ordered it sealed.  The gross settlement amount is fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each plaintiff,  Webber wrote. Both James Knowles, the mayor of the blue-collar, largely black St. Louis suburb, and Anthony Gray, the lead attorney for Brown's parents, declined to comment. Brown and McSpadden, his ex-wife, sued the city, former Police Chief Tom Jackson, and former police officer Darren Wilson in 2015.

Images of the teen's body, which lay in the street for more than four hours, and an aftermath in which police officials defended Wilson's actions and characterized Brown as a thief, enraged many in the black community.

The report said the city overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to blacks to boost city coffers, used police as a collection agency and fomented a culture of distrust that exploded when Brown was shot. A grand jury decided not to charge Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department declined to bring any charges of civil rights violations against him. Brown's death helped spark the  Black Lives Matter  movement protesting what was widely seen as the use of unrestrained lethal force against minorities by police.

The document, made public by the top court, is a significant step in the investigation, which is widely expected to lead to Brazil's top federal prosecutor lodging corruption charges against Temer by the end of next week, according to several sources with direct knowledge of the probe.  It also adds to doubts that Temer will be able to push through badly needed economic reforms through congress, needed to spark Brazil's economy just as it emerges from its worst recession on record.  Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of all accusations against him. Antonio Oliveira, a lawyer for Temer, told Reuters in a written statement on Tuesday that he had no comment about the police report. Temer is currently on a foreign tour.  The press office at JBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under Brazilian law, the investigation into Temer is overseen by a single top court justice, Edson Fachin, who last month approved the graft probe into the leader.   The allegations are based on plea-bargain testimony from JBS executives, who say they paid Temer at least $4.6 million in bribes since at least 2010 to help win lucrative government contracts, resolve massive tax disputes with the government and free cheap loans from the state development bank.

Once police conclude and deliver the entirety of their report into allegations against Temer to Fachin, the top federal prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, can then lodge formal charges against the president. The partial report was delivered on Tuesday, because it was the original deadline that Fachin gave investigators, but police now have five more days to continue their work.  Janot is expected to level charges against Temer by the end of next week, according to several sources with direct knowledge of the probe.  But Brazil's constitution mandates that any criminal charges against a sitting president must be approved by two-thirds of the lower house of congress. Only then can the Supreme Court try a leader.  Several lawmakers within Temer's governing coalition have told Reuters in recent days they are confident they can block any charges that may be filed against the president.      But they also acknowledge that the leader would be politically weakened if he is officially charged with corruption, adding to instability.  Aides and lawmakers close to Temer have also told Reuters that if more evidence of corruption emerges against the leader, it would make it increasingly difficult for him to maintain his unwieldy government coalition. That would hike pressure on him to resign. The investigation against Temer is separate from the multitude of probes prosecutors have launched in the last three years. Most center on large firms paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run firms in exchange for winning massive contracts.

FUNDAMENTALS       * The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade rose 0.2 percent to $4.73-1/4 a bushel, having closed up 1.2 percent on Tuesday when prices hit a high of $4.75-3/4 a bushel - the highest since June 23, 2016.     * The most active soybean futures rose 0.2 percent to $9.29-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 1.1 percent on Tuesday.     * The most active corn futures rose  0.1 percent to $3.70-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 1.4 percent in the previous session when prices hit a low of $3.69-1/4 a bushel - the lowest since June 1.     * The U.S. Department of Agriculture late on Monday rated 41 percent of the U.S. spring wheat crop as good to excellent, down from 45 percent a week earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected an improvement.      * A heatwave hitting France and southern Europe will damage this year's wheat crops, mainly in top EU producer France and in Spain, while rainfall benefited crops in Germany, Poland and Britain where they are expected to be higher, analysts said.      * The USDA late Monday rated 67 percent of the U.S. corn and soybean crops in good to excellent condition.

We consider this a terrorist attack,  prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters, declining comment on witness accounts that the man had shouted Islamist slogans before detonating what witnesses said were one or two devices in luggage. Although no one was hurt, billows of smoke pouring through Central Station and a shared awareness of Islamic State attacks in the city last year and more recently in Britain, France and elsewhere, sent evening commuters racing for cover. Police halted rail traffic, evacuated the site and cleared streets crowded with tourists and locals enjoying a hot summer's evening in the historic city centre between the station and nearby Grand Place, Brussels' landmark Renaissance town square. The Belgian capital, home to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, has been on high alert since a Brussels-based Islamic State cell organised the attack that killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015. Four months later, associates of those attackers killed 32 people in their home city. Since then, attacks in France, but also in Germany, Sweden and, most recently, in Britain, have been carried out in the name of the Syria-based Islamist militant group by other young men, many of them locals, raising fears of more violence in a city where almost a quarter of the population of 1.2 million are Muslim. Witnesses spoke of a man who shouted Islamist slogans, including  Allahu akbar  - God is greater - in Arabic, in an underground area of the station still busy with commuters making their way home and seemed to set off one or two small blasts. 'Isolated Acts' Security experts said Tuesday's incident could have been similar to  lone-wolf  assaults carried out by radicalised individuals with limited access to weapons and training.  Such isolated acts will continue in Brussels, in Paris and elsewhere. It's inevitable,  Brussels security consultant Claude Moniquet, a former French agent, told broadcaster RTL. With Islamic State under pressure in Syria - where Belgium has been the most fertile European recruiting ground for foreign Islamist fighters - he said attacks in Europe could increase, although many would be by  amateurs  doing little harm. He compared Tuesday's incident to that on Paris' Champs-Elysees avenue a day earlier, when a man was killed when he rammed his car, filled with explosive and weapons, into a French police convoy. No one else was injured. Rail worker Nicolas Van Herrewegen told Reuters that he was heading downstairs toward the underground platforms that serve long-distance and suburban lines running under the city centre.  There was a man shouting, and shouting and shouting,  he said.  He was talking about the jihadists and all that and then at some point he shouted: 'Allahu akbar' and blew up the little suitcase he had next to him. People just took off.  He described the man as quite dark and with short hair and said he was wearing a white shirt and black jeans. Remy Bonnaffe, a 23-year-old lawyer who was waiting on the concourse for a train home to Ghent, said he was startled by an explosion as he listened to music on his headphones. He took a photograph, which he later posted on Twitter, of flames shooting up from what he thought was a briefcase. There was a second blast farther away, which he could not see, followed by what sounded like gunfire, prompting him to run.  I think we had some luck tonight,  he told Reuters.  I'm happy that no one was injured and that this was basically a failed attempt.  People just feet from the explosion appeared unhurt and he said he saw no obvious damage to the walls around. As Prime Minister Charles Michel consulted with his security advisers, the national alert was maintained at its second highest level. Michel, who convened a National Security Council meeting for early on Wednesday, tweeted his thanks to the security forces and railway staff for their professionalism and courage.

Considering the size of global funds that track the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, we see possible outflow of about 600 billion won ($525.92 million) to 4.3 trillion won ($3.77 billion) from our equities,  Jeong Eun-bo, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission said in a policy meeting in Seoul. While such an outflow is a possibility from South Korea's benchmark index KOSPI and junior KOSDAQ, the overall impact won't be significant on South Korean equities, Jeong added. Early on Wednesday, U.S. index provider MSCI Inc. said it will add domestic Chinese equities to its widely tracked Emerging Markets Index, which will draw billions of dollars to China's A shares and decrease South Korea's weight in the index. The South Korean regulator said the country's weight in the index will shrink by 0.23 percentage points to 15.2 percent, as China's weighting increases to 28.4 percent from 27.7 percent. Seoul shares will shrug off an outflow of few trillion won, analysts said, as the total market capitalization of stocks listed on the benchmark main Korean Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) reached 1,536 trillion won as of closing on June 20.  Foreign investors generally buy and sell quite large amounts of local stocks, such an amount (4.3 trillion won) will not be a source of fear for local market players,  said Rhoo Yong-seok, a stock analyst at KB securities. South Korean equities saw a 9 trillion won of net inflow from foreign investors between January and May this year, which will more than offset any potential outflow following China's inclusion in the MSCI index, the FSC said.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Preamble from the Achnacarry Agreement: tmsnrt.rs/2sB4gwy By John Kemp LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - OPEC members are struggling to protect their revenues in the face of renewed competition from U.S. shale producers and other suppliers outside the organisation. OPEC's revenues from petroleum exports have fallen to just $446 billion in 2016 from $1.2 trillion in 2012 ( Annual Statistical Bulletin , OPEC, 2017). But past experience strongly suggests OPEC's effort to stabilise oil inventories and prices while protecting its market share will fail. Since the beginning of the modern petroleum industry, periods of high prices and concern about supplies running out have alternated with episodes of low prices and oversupply. High prices and concerns about availability normally trigger an exploration boom and rapid innovations in drilling and production technology as well as efforts to use oil more efficiently. The resulting increase in production and a slowdown in consumption growth creates conditions for a subsequent slump. The basic narrative has not changed since the first oil well was drilled in 1859, with periods of oversupply (1900s, 1930s, 1950s and 1990s) alternating with panics about shortages (1910s, 1970s, 2000s). The current oversupply and slump in prices has its roots in the panic about peak oil and soaring prices in the middle of the last decade. High prices between 2004 and 2014 spurred an exploration boom around the world as well as the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques in the United States. At the same time, the cost of oil led to renewed interest among governments, businesses and consumers in greater oil efficiency and alternative energy technologies including renewables and electric vehicles. The slump which followed was inevitable as were the subsequent calls for more coordination among producers to cut output, reduce excess stocks and boost prices. A Shooting Party Every slump prompts calls for more coordination, restrictions on production and the stabilisation of market shares ( Crude volatility: the history and the future of boom-bust oil prices , McNally, 2017). The most notorious was the secret agreement reached between Standard Oil of New Jersey (forerunner of Exxon), Royal Dutch-Shell and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (forerunner of BP) in September 1928. Walter Teagle, president of Standard Oil, John Cadman, chairman of Anglo-Persian, and Henri Deterding, managing director of Royal Dutch-Shell, met at Deterding's rented castle in the Highlands of Scotland. Afterwards, all Teagle would say was that  Sir John Cadman ... and myself were guests of Sir Henri Deterding and Lady Deterding at Achnacarry for the grouse shooting, and while the game was a primary object of the visit, the problem of the world's petroleum industry naturally came in for a great deal of discussion.  In fact the three men had reached a secret deal under which they would accept their current share of the oil market and not seek to increase it at the expense of the others. A draft, which seems to have been adopted without alterations, is reproduced in the official history of BP ( The History of the British Petroleum Company , Volume 2, Bamberg, 1994). The Achnacarry Agreement, also called the  As-Is  agreement because its attempted to stabilise the status quo, is worth studying because of the close parallels with the current situation in the oil market. Market Stabilisation Fears about shortages during the World War One and subsequent worries about the depletion of U.S. oilfields in the post-war period had caused real oil prices to more than double from $15 per barrel in 1915 to $37 in 1920. The result was an exploration boom and a subsequent slump in prices, which had fallen to just $19 by 1923, and remained depressed through the rest of the decade, even before the onset of the Great Depression after 1929.  Since its inception the oil industry has looked forward with apprehension to the gradual depletion and final exhaustion of its supplies of crude oil,  the preamble to the Achnacarry Agreement explained.  The temporary shortage of supplies that existed in certain countries during the great war further accentuated this fear and caused vast sums of good money to be expended to locate and develop reserves in all parts of the world where petroleum potentialities appeared, as well as accumulating large reserve stocks above ground.   Now the situation has changed. An adequate supply for a long time to come is assured. This is the result of the application of science to the petroleum industry.   On the other hand, more effective methods of handling crude have been developed so that the yield of gasoline from a given amount of crude has been enormously increased.   Methods of consumption are being made more economical; high compression motors are being developed; diesel engines and fuel oil is being is being utilized more efficiently and economically.   All these developments will have a marked tendency to slow down the rate of increase in consumption,  the agreement warned.  Excessive competition  had resulted in tremendous overproduction, as each oil company  has tried to take care of its own over-production and tried to increase its sales at the expense of someone else . The result was  destructive rather than constructive competition . No company could hope to cure its overproduction by increasing its market share when all the others were attempting to do the same. The rational solution was a market-sharing agreement in which all three companies agreed to accept their share of the current market and a proportionate share of any future growth in oil demand. As-Is specifically excluded oil production and imports into the United States because any attempt to cartelize the U.S. market was prohibited by U.S. antitrust law. Standard Oil nonetheless organised the Standard Oil Export Corporation and the U.S. Export Petroleum Association in a bid to control U.S. exports of crude and refined fuels to the rest of the world. And the three companies sought to formulate guidelines for competition in other countries with the Memorandum for European Markets signed in 1930 and the Heads of Agreement for Distribution signed in 1932. Ultimately, however, the Achnacarry Agreement was a failure. Part of the reason was the Great Depression, which resulted in a slump in oil demand, just as the oil companies were trying to restrict supply. But the discovery of the super-giant East Texas field in 1930 sparked an uncontrolled drilling race and a flood of oil onto U.S. domestic markets and into exports. The Achnacarry companies also proved unable to stem the flow of cheap crude from Russian and Romanian producers, both outside the agreement, into European markets, where it captured their market share. Achnacarry Warning Achnacarry holds many lessons for OPEC. The shale boom and growth of non-OPEC supplies are a reaction to earlier fears about shortages and high prices just as the exploration boom of the 1920s was a response to earlier fears about field depletion. OPEC's ability to coordinate with U.S. oil producers is constrained by U.S. antitrust laws, similar to the loophole in the Achnacarry Agreement, but without their collaboration it will prove hard to stabilise market shares. And any effort to stabilise market shares and support prices risks being undermined by new supplies not covered by the agreement. OPEC faced a similar problem 50 years later when the sharp rise in real oil prices as a result of the two oil shocks in the 1970s led to a surge in supplies from non-OPEC producers. Increased output from the North Sea, Alaska, the Soviet Union and China cut OPEC's share of the global oil market from 51 percent in 1973 to 28 percent in 1985. OPEC never really managed to reverse the loss of its market share. Production from  high-cost  sources such as the North Sea and Alaska proved surprisingly resilient despite lower real oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s. Only the collapse in output from the former Soviet Union during the 1990s and the rapid growth of the East Asian Tiger economies in the 1990s and China's industrialization in 2000s restored the organisation's fortunes. Efforts to stabilise the oil market have always failed because they cannot control the emergence of alternative supplies from rival suppliers and the reaction of consumers. OPEC is no more likely to succeed in containing the challenge from shale today than it was in dealing with the earlier challenge from the North Sea or the Achnacarry companies were in dealing with East Texas.

This obviously makes it more likely that both Paris and Los Angeles will be able to host the Olympic and Paralympics Games, and that's a good thing,  USOC CEO Scott Blackmun told reporters on a conference call.

A technical committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers met in Vienna on Tuesday to monitor compliance with the pact. The producers agreed at a May 25 meeting to extend the accord until March 2018. But oil has declined sharply since then, with Brent crude falling to a seven-month low near $45 a barrel on Tuesday on persistent over-supply concerns.  With recovering production from Nigeria and Libya - OPEC members exempted from supply cuts due to losses caused by unrest - adding to supplies, some OPEC delegates are questioning whether the agreement is enough. But oil ministers, including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, are of the view that the market is heading in the right direction and needs time to rebalance.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) aims to promote the domestic derivatives industry by loosening regulations that restrict how commercial banks, insurance companies and pension funds invest in commodity futures, Fang Xinghai, the commission's vice chairman, said on June 17. Fang, who was speaking at a financial forum in Qingdao, didn't give further details of the proposal, but it seems to fit into recent moves by the authorities in Beijing to promote commodity trading and become more of a player in global markets. The positive news out of the CSRC's announcement is that China seems to be getting serious about opening up its markets and encouraging a broader range of participation. Several commodity contracts have taken off in recent years, such as iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE). But these have often been criticised as more like legal casinos for day-trading retail investors rather than offering price discovery or viable hedging for market participants. As part of efforts to boost commodity trading, China's three major exchanges, the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and the DCE, are planning to boost the number of commodities that can be traded. Contracts for certain fruits, chemicals and electricity are among those being considered, adding to an already considerable array of contracts for commodities that would be considered somewhat obscure in Western markets, such as bitumen and silicomanganese. But while expanding the amount of commodities being offered and boosting the number and type of investors allowed to participate in the markets sounds promising, it's not straightforward. Trust Deficit If there is one thing investors have learnt about the authorities in Beijing is that they aren't afraid to intervene in what are supposed to be free markets if they don't like the price movements and volatility. On several occasions last year, the authorities took steps to crack down on trading in then hot commodities such as iron ore, steel and coal. Measures included increasing margins to be held against positions and boosting the cost of trading on the exchanges. These steps did have some impact on cooling commodity trading last year, but probably not to the extent that the authorities wanted. The problem for investors in Chinese commodity exchanges is that they can never be certain as to when, and how, the authorities will act to clamp down on trading. Allowing financial institutions to trade in commodities may smooth out some of the volatility, assuming they adopt longer-term positions based on expectations of supply and demand fundamentals. But if these investors choose to act more like hedge funds in taking large positions in order to drive the market in their preferred direction, it will boost volatility and undermine the use of Chinese commodity exchanges as a hedging tool. As the world's biggest producer, consumer and importer of commodities, China should have well-developed and open futures exchanges. But simply loosening regulations to allow for greater participation doesn't address the underlying problem in China, namely the uncertainty of government interference and the trust deficit this causes. To be truly effective, China's commodity contracts would also have to be fully open to foreign traders, something that isn't currently the case. But for foreigners to participate, regulatory certainty becomes essential, meaning Beijing must curb its inclination to intervene in the markets if it sees developments it doesn't like. It's this problem that has so far prevented China from setting up a crude oil futures contract, which would be aimed at capturing a chunk of the global trade in this key commodity. The struggles of China, the world's biggest importer of crude oil, to launch a viable futures contract covering the fuel shows just how far the country still has to travel in its ambition to become a global commodity hub.

OPEC's revenues from petroleum exports have fallen to just $446 billion in 2016 from $1.2 trillion in 2012 ( Annual Statistical Bulletin , OPEC, 2017).  But past experience strongly suggests OPEC's effort to stabilize oil inventories and prices while protecting its market share will fail. Since the beginning of the modern petroleum industry, periods of high prices and concern about supplies running out have alternated with episodes of low prices and oversupply. High prices and concerns about availability normally trigger an exploration boom and rapid innovations in drilling and production technology as well as efforts to use oil more efficiently. The resulting increase in production and a slowdown in consumption growth creates conditions for a subsequent slump. The basic narrative has not changed since the first oil well was drilled in 1859, with periods of oversupply (1900s, 1930s, 1950s and 1990s) alternating with panics about shortages (1910s, 1970s, 2000s). The current oversupply and slump in prices has its roots in the panic about peak oil and soaring prices in the middle of the last decade. High prices between 2004 and 2014 spurred an exploration boom around the world as well as the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques in the United States. At the same time, the cost of oil led to renewed interest among governments, businesses and consumers in greater oil efficiency and alternative energy technologies including renewables and electric vehicles. The slump which followed was inevitable as were the subsequent calls for more coordination among producers to cut output, reduce excess stocks and boost prices. A Shooting Party Every slump prompts calls for more coordination, restrictions on production and the stabilization of market shares ( Crude volatility: the history and the future of boom-bust oil prices , McNally, 2017). The most notorious was the secret agreement reached between Standard Oil of New Jersey (forerunner of Exxon), Royal Dutch-Shell and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (forerunner of BP) in September 1928. Walter Teagle, president of Standard Oil, John Cadman, chairman of Anglo-Persian, and Henri Deterding, managing director of Royal Dutch-Shell, met at Deterding's rented castle in the Highlands of Scotland. Afterwards, all Teagle would say was that  Sir John Cadman ... and myself were guests of Sir Henri Deterding and Lady Deterding at Achnacarry for the grouse shooting, and while the game was a primary object of the visit, the problem of the world's petroleum industry naturally came in for a great deal of discussion.  In fact the three men had reached a secret deal under which they would accept their current share of the oil market and not seek to increase it at the expense of the others. A draft, which seems to have been adopted without alterations, is reproduced in the official history of BP ( The History of the British Petroleum Company , Volume 2, Bamberg, 1994). The Achnacarry Agreement, also called the  As-Is  agreement because its attempted to stabilize the status quo, is worth studying because of the close parallels with the current situation in the oil market. Market Stabilization Fears about shortages during the World War One and subsequent worries about the depletion of U.S. oilfields in the post-war period had caused real oil prices to more than double from $15 per barrel in 1915 to $37 in 1920. The result was an exploration boom and a subsequent slump in prices, which had fallen to just $19 by 1923, and remained depressed through the rest of the decade, even before the onset of the Great Depression after 1929.  Since its inception the oil industry has looked forward with apprehension to the gradual depletion and final exhaustion of its supplies of crude oil,  the preamble to the Achnacarry Agreement explained.  The temporary shortage of supplies that existed in certain countries during the great war further accentuated this fear and caused vast sums of good money to be expended to locate and develop reserves in all parts of the world where petroleum potentialities appeared, as well as accumulating large reserve stocks above ground.   Now the situation has changed. An adequate supply for a long time to come is assured. This is the result of the application of science to the petroleum industry.   On the other hand, more effective methods of handling crude have been developed so that the yield of gasoline from a given amount of crude has been enormously increased.   Methods of consumption are being made more economical; high compression motors are being developed; diesel engines and fuel oil is being is being utilized more efficiently and economically.   All these developments will have a marked tendency to slow down the rate of increase in consumption,  the agreement warned.  Excessive competition  had resulted in tremendous overproduction, as each oil company  has tried to take care of its own over-production and tried to increase its sales at the expense of someone else . The result was  destructive rather than constructive competition . No company could hope to cure its overproduction by increasing its market share when all the others were attempting to do the same. The rational solution was a market-sharing agreement in which all three companies agreed to accept their share of the current market and a proportionate share of any future growth in oil demand. As-Is specifically excluded oil production and imports into the United States because any attempt to cartelize the U.S. market was prohibited by U.S. antitrust law. Standard Oil nonetheless organized the Standard Oil Export Corporation and the U.S. Export Petroleum Association in a bid to control U.S. exports of crude and refined fuels to the rest of the world. And the three companies sought to formulate guidelines for competition in other countries with the Memorandum for European Markets signed in 1930 and the Heads of Agreement for Distribution signed in 1932. Ultimately, however, the Achnacarry Agreement was a failure. Part of the reason was the Great Depression, which resulted in a slump in oil demand, just as the oil companies were trying to restrict supply. But the discovery of the super-giant East Texas field in 1930 sparked an uncontrolled drilling race and a flood of oil onto U.S. domestic markets and into exports. The Achnacarry companies also proved unable to stem the flow of cheap crude from Russian and Romanian producers, both outside the agreement, into European markets, where it captured their market share. Achnacarry Warning Achnacarry holds many lessons for OPEC. The shale boom and growth of non-OPEC supplies are a reaction to earlier fears about shortages and high prices just as the exploration boom of the 1920s was a response to earlier fears about field depletion. OPEC's ability to coordinate with U.S. oil producers is constrained by U.S. antitrust laws, similar to the loophole in the Achnacarry Agreement, but without their collaboration it will prove hard to stabilize market shares. And any effort to stabilize market shares and support prices risks being undermined by new supplies not covered by the agreement. OPEC faced a similar problem 50 years later when the sharp rise in real oil prices as a result of the two oil shocks in the 1970s led to a surge in supplies from non-OPEC producers. Increased output from the North Sea, Alaska, the Soviet Union and China cut OPEC's share of the global oil market from 51 percent in 1973 to 28 percent in 1985. OPEC never really managed to reverse the loss of its market share. Production from  high-cost  sources such as the North Sea and Alaska proved surprisingly resilient despite lower real oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s. Only the collapse in output from the former Soviet Union during the 1990s and the rapid growth of the East Asian Tiger economies in the 1990s and China's industrialization in 2000s restored the organization's fortunes. Efforts to stabilize the oil market have always failed because they cannot control the emergence of alternative supplies from rival suppliers and the reaction of consumers. OPEC is no more likely to succeed in containing the challenge from shale today than it was in dealing with the earlier challenge from the North Sea or the Achnacarry companies were in dealing with East Texas.

As temperatures climbed into the triple digits across the region, major airlines were forced to delay or cancel flights out of Las Vegas and Phoenix airports, citing difficulty in operating aircraft in extreme heat. American Airlines canceled 20 regional flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Tuesday after temperatures in the desert city soared toward 120 degrees F (49 C). At least four flights had been delayed at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas as of Tuesday afternoon. Aviations experts said hotter air was also thinner, causing a decline in performance for jet engines, especially during takeoffs.  As the ambient temperature at a particular airport increases, in this case into the 120s at Phoenix, the amount of lift and power in aircraft engines declines, and the result is that for any given runway length, you can carry less and less payload,  said Robert Mann, an industry analyst and former airline executive.  As temperatures get that extreme, you have to offload so much fuel or passengers or cargo that it no longer makes sense to fly,  he said. FILE PHOTO: A view is seen of the baggage pick-up area at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, February 13, 2008.Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus/File PhotoMann said aircraft may also be hampered because the charts used in flight manuals to calculate aircraft performance are not written with such heat in mind, making it impossible for pilots to accurately calculate payloads and takeoff speeds. The flights affected by the heat tend to be on smaller regional carriers, which use planes that operate under lower maximum temperatures.  It doesn't happen very often because these are exceedingly rare temperatures, but there's a point at which either runway length is insufficient or the speed is so high that the tires wouldn't be rated for it,  Mann said of those aircraft. The heat can also create issues for ground crews, where pavement temperatures can reach more than 150 degrees F (66 C), life-threatening conditions if workers are exposed to it too long. The National Weather Service said the heat wave resulted from a high-pressure system camped over the Four Corners region where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona meet. The sweltering weather was expected to peak on Tuesday or Wednesday as temperatures in Death Valley and the town of Needles, California, were forecast to spike as high as 127 degrees F (53 C).

Ferguson will remain CEO until October while Cenovus searches for a new leader, then stay on in an advisory role until March 2018, the company said.  It was the stock's biggest one-day percentage decline since March, when Cenovus announced plans to spend $13.3 billion to buy the oil-sands assets from ConocoPhillips in a deal that doubled the company's size.  The company's decision to announce Ferguson's departure without naming his successor upset investors looking for quick change at Cenovus.  There's no natural heir, they have not done a very good job of succession planning,  said Laura Lau, senior portfolio manager at Brompton Group, which owns Cenovus shares.

The company has lost about half, or $7 billion, of its market value since it announced the ConocoPhillips deal in March. The decline in Cenovus outpaced decreases in the overall energy sector, which sank as oil prices fell to a seven-month low, dropping below $43 a barrel.  The Toronto Stock Exchange's energy group index fell 2.5 percent to its lowest since April 2016. Also on Tuesday, Cenovus  unveiled plans to ramp up divestitures and sell C$4 billion to C$5 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt. Previously the company said it would offload about C$3.6 billion of assets including its Pelican Lake and Suffield conventional oil and gas assets. The company said it may also sell part of the Deep Basin gas field it acquired from ConocoPhillips and Marten Hills oil assets.  Ferguson told an investors meeting in Toronto that he is also looking to sell its Palliser and Weyburn conventional oil projects in a deal that could be announced in the fourth quarter. Cenovus has said the deal would allow it to utilize economies of scale to lower costs, and on Tuesday it said it will achieve C$1 billion in cost savings. Ferguson told reporters after the meeting that the company may cut some jobs as part of the cost reduction measures and divestitures. He did not provide specific numbers.

MSCI will announce its decision in June 2018, and any move to upgrade would take effect in two phases - in May 2019 and August 2019. Riyadh opened its market, the Arab world's biggest, to direct investment by foreign institutions in June 2015 and has been bringing its settlement and other systems closer to international practice since then. So many fund managers expect a positive decision.  Inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index would be a transformative catalyst not just for Saudi Arabia’s stock market but for exchanges throughout the entire region,  said Bassel Khatoun, chief investment officer for Middle Eastern and North African equities at Franklin Templeton Investments.  With approximately $2 trillion in active and passively managed money tracking it, MSCI’s EM Index is a significant dictator of equity market flows. Inclusion into MSCI EM will put Saudi, and the MENA region, firmly on the radar of international investors.” MSCI estimated 32 major Saudi stocks would gain emerging market status, giving the country a potential weight of 2.4 percent in its index. That calculation does not include the planned public offer in late 2018 of a roughly 5 percent stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, expected to be the world's biggest IPO. Listing Aramco in Riyadh would approximately double Saudi Arabia's weighting in the emerging markets index, fund managers estimate, possibly making the kingdom a bigger presence in the index than Russia and Mexico. Fund managers estimate an MSCI upgrade - as well as an expected decision by FTSE this September to lift Riyadh to secondary emerging market status - could bring over $50 billion of foreign money into the country in the next few years. That estimate includes  passive  funds which track indexes as well as actively managed funds. The Saudi market currently has a capitalisation of about $445 billion. With the economy and state finances squeezed by low oil prices, Riyadh is eager to attract foreign capital, partly to help improve the management of Saudi companies. But an MSCI upgrade would not guarantee a strong rally in share prices from current levels. The bourse is not cheaply valued - its 12-month forward price-earnings ratio is 13.9, while the MSCI Emerging Market Index is at about 12 - and the economy faces difficult times in the next few years. The government is imposing austerity policies to cut a huge budget deficit and will introduce a value-added tax next year. Partly because of such pressures, all types of foreign investors currently own only a little more than 4 percent of the market.

Key Points: MSCI's decision to add the  A  shares to its widely tracked Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF could move as much as $400 billion of funds from asset managers, pension funds and insurers to mainland China's equity markets over the next decade. The company had declined to add the shares for three years leading up to Tuesday's decision. MSCI decided not to add Argentina to the index and will consult on adding Saudi Arabia. Nigeria will remain a frontier market, awaiting further review. Comments:  ASHA MEHTA, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ACADIAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, IN BOSTON:   In terms of implications... I think we're likely to see more foreign investors looking for local access of the China A share market. It's conceivable that as more investors start to put capital to work in these markets, that will be a return driver. This may very well be a capital appreciation event. Valuations are not cheap right now, so I don't know how much room there is to go, and getting that local access can take some time to set up. There could be some short-term positivity on the announcement, but to really see foreign investors start to invest there it may very well take some time.  China A shares got it, and the regulator has done nice work in making the market more friendly to foreign investors. Argentina has tried to go down that route. The new president has implemented regulations that are more business friendly and set a tone that's been stronger for foreign investment. But in actuality, the local market is still hard to access. It's costly. I consider the capital gains tax environment in Argentina to be prohibitive.  NAEEM ASLAM, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT THINKMARKETS IN LONDON  MSCI has finally decided to add China A share to its emerging market index and this is going to bring fresh capital inflows. The Chinese economy has by far improved but the liquidity tightening by the central banks could jeopardize a number of small firm’s balance sheets. If that happens that would have adverse impact on the index. But for now, we do see this as catalyst to attract new capital.” LUKE OLIVER, HEAD OF ETF CAPITAL MARKETS FOR THE AMERICAS AT DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT  This is going to be a very methodical approach to adding A shares in the industry so it's going to be a slow burn.... It's a little bit of a surprise to the upside but not a significant divergence from what we expected....  Even today's inclusion is just the start of a much bigger move that's going to play out. They laid out what they wanted to see and China made some great advances toward that.  LUCY QIU, EMERGING MARKET ANALYST AT UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK On MSCI decision to add domestic Chinese stocks to global benchmark:  We think it will be a temporary sentiment boost but the real effect on fund flows will likely be limited. We expect about $8 billion to $10 billion initial fund flows after this inclusion. However, that’s just a drop in the bucket versus the average daily trading volume of $70 billion on the ‘A’ shares these days. But nevertheless it is a good, small step in including this huge market into the global equity index.  On Argentina, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia:  Both Argentina and Nigeria are delayed. We think Argentina could be initially hit, because the expectation for the inclusion was pretty high. Indeed, the market outperformed the rest of the emerging market or frontier market peers. Nevertheless the domestic fundamental story on the Argentina recovery/reform still remains despite the initial decision right now. We still think this could be a long term positive story but hold tight for temporary weakness.   On Saudi Arabia, it is good news that they have opened the consultation and it could be potentially a big one because Saudi is almost the size of MSCI Russia currently. So if it indeed gets included it could be very positive for Saudi to be integrated into the bigger emerging market family.  JOHN PRAVEEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT PRUDENTIAL INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS ADVISERS LLC IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY  China A shares have been included in the MSCI indexes (both Emerging Markets and ACWI) after many years of delays over concerns about market access. Thus, the inclusion of A-shares in the index itself is a positive for the Chinese financial markets in general as it gives a boost to the credibility of the financial system and gives easier access to both dedicated Emerging Market investors and to global investors seeking exposure to the Chinese market.    While the initial allocation itself is relatively modest, the selection of stocks is broader. The move is likely to encourage more investors to increase their exposure to mainland China companies and lead to further development of the domestic market in the medium- to long-term. Further, the move is only a first step and the China weight is likely to increase, given the size of the economy and the growing size of the market.   EMILY FLETCHER, DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BLACKROCK (BLK.N) LONDON       We note the decision by MSCI not to upgrade Argentina from Frontier to Emerging Markets status at this stage.  Whilst this decision may be a disappointment to some market participants, we would remind investors of the substantial positive macro-economic changes that Argentina has witnessed over recent years.   We welcome index provider MSCI’s decision to launch a review on whether to include Saudi Arabia into MSCI Emerging Markets index. In our view this is an endorsement of the positive Saudi Arabian stock market reforms. RYAN STORK, BLACKROCK INC CHAIRMAN, ASIA PACIFIC IN HONG KONG      We believe our clients will benefit from today's decision to bring Chinese equities into mainstream investment. BlackRock has continued to support all opening of investment in China's onshore capital markets for a number of years. As a fiduciary, we look forward to working with regulators and market participants to achieve the best implementation of today's announcement and eventual full inclusion of China A-shares in global indexes.  Mark Makepeace, Ceo of Ftse Russell (via Email): “FTSE Russell enjoys an open and positive dialogue with the Chinese authorities and China A shares remain on our watch list for possible inclusion as a secondary emerging market in our global equity index series. China is making significant progress towards opening its domestic A share and the FTSE Global China A Inclusion Indexes, launched in 2015, are being utilized by some major asset owners and managers enabling further choice for investors looking to include A Shares in their global portfolios.   FTSE Russell has a strong track record of developing China-focused benchmarks with around $30 billion of assets under management benchmarked to or tracking a FTSE China index and we will continue to consult with the market ahead of our annual review in September”.  Deborah Fuhr, Managing Partner at Etfgi Llp in London  The inclusion of A shares in MSCI EM and other indices is (an) important step in the evolution of the Chinese stock market. The inclusion will start slowly but will ultimately be around 40 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Many investors will use ETFs to gain or increase their exposure to China A share indices.   KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK “It’s definitely going to (put) upward pressure on the yuan. We will likely see an initial pop and then a leveling off. There will be more demand for the currency long term but you would probably see a lot of policy offsets. It might create a more active (Chinese) central bank to ensure the yuan doesn’t appreciate too much. China has been looking at this for some time and has prepared for it. At the end of the day, this legitimizes Chinese investments for global investors.” PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO (ON CHINA)   “There’s big differences between various emerging markets indices and what ETFs are following which ones….”  It’s still an under-represented country based on its market cap relative to other markets around the world.” “MSCI is now going to have three quarters of 1 percent in one of the larger emerging markets in the world.” “For an investors it depends on which index your ETF follows. You think you’re getting broad emerging markets, but you may not be.” BRENDAN AHERN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT KRANE FUNDS ADVISORS LLC IN NEW YORK      It's going to be this incremental dial-up. It's really as we suspected.... It's a small step but it's really just the first domino.... It's going to dramatically change the scope of the weighting over time that we're talking about.... Ultimately it means there's going to be more China in investors' portfolios....   It's good for China in that they want to institutionalize that market. They want foreign investment firms with their knowledge and expertise to help institutionalize the markets. So ultimately it’s a good thing for China. I think for investors it’s a market that's too big to ignore.... Switzerland, which has one-tenth the GDP of China, has a 50 percent larger weight in investors' portfolios today, and that makes no sense. So this step will help rectify this. BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN  It was ... widely anticipated that this subset of A shares would be included. China was already over 27 percent of the MSCI Emerging Market index, so this won’t be a huge change. Active managers have already been able to invest in these companies. Investors better have a better reason than index inclusion to invest in China. Thankfully, I think investors still have ample reason to consider investing in consumer-oriented firms.    I wasn’t surprised (on delaying the reclassification of Argentina). A 100 year bond at 7.9 percent clearly raises some eyebrows, but I think many are expecting that (President Mauricio) Macri’s policy changes will have some staying power. Mexico’s 100 year bond issued in 2015 is trading at a 4.392 percent yield, so maybe some people thought 7.9 percent is worth the risk.

The dollar index against a group of major currencies was a touch lower at 97.719. It had gone to a one-month high of 97.871 on Tuesday as expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which hiked interest rates last week, would tighten policy again in 2017 had energised dollar bulls. The greenback's advance, however, stalled as the dollar-supportive bounce in U.S. Treasury yields ended overnight. The 10-year Treasury note yield fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing a large portion of the gains it made when the Fed left the door open for another rate increase this year, following a big drop in oil prices.  Lower crude prices weaken inflationary pressures and in turn arrest the rise in U.S. yields,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  U.S. inflation indicators have not been strong to start with. Now that oil is falling, it could add further pressure to the dollar by weakening sentiment towards the U.S. energy sector.  The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 111.320 yen, off a near one-month peak of 111.790 touched on Tuesday. The euro was steady at $1.1137. The pound was little changed at $1.2634. The currency had slid 0.9 percent overnight and plumbed a two-month trough of $1.2603. Sterling took a hit after BoE's Carney said on Tuesday that now was not the time to raise UK interest rates. Last week three out of eight BoE policymakers voted in favour of a rate hike and raised hopes for a near-term tightening. Oil fell about 2 percent on Tuesday, with Brent settling at seven-month lows, after increased supply from several key producers overshadowed high compliance to an output cut deal among OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers.

He told me to make the bed, he gripped my throat so I couldn't scream, and then he hurt me,  she recalled, nervously drawing in the red sand with a twig while cradling a baby boy. Her mother found out about her ordeal when it became too difficult to hide her pregnancy. She immediately informed the village elders in their pastoralist community.  But they did nothing, and suggested Mariam just marry her uncle,  Fatouma Mohammed, her mother, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, her eyes full of anger.  So I decided to leave and take my children back to my mother's.  Mariam's story is far from uncommon in this Kenyan region bordering Somalia, home to many ethnic Somali families. Girls from pastoralist communities often must watch animals instead of going to school, and walk long distances to fetch water – making them an easy target for abusers. Prolonged drought is making matters worse, development workers in the area say.   Somali pastoralists are extremely proud. If they lose their animals, they are no one,  said Suli Abdi Buhad, the gender team leader at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian aid agency.  That leaves them unoccupied, even depressed, and can turn many into violent men,  she said. Abdi Buhad is part of a group of women and men – drawn from community members, police officers, journalists, health workers, and non-governmental organizations, among others – who last year set up a gender support desk and hotline in Wajir for victims of violence. Once a girl calls the toll-free number, the group alerts a local colleague or police officer, who investigates the accusation while providing the victim with moral and medical support. If the allegation is found to be substantiated and the victim is willing to come forward, the gender desk helps her bring the case to court. The initiative, which is part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program, is funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and led by Mercy Corps. Ubah Adan, director of the county department of gender, social and cultural services and also a member of the group, explained that, all too often, cases of rape and sexual assault in Wajir are settled by religious leaders, usually with compensation – a traditional form of Islamic law called maslaha.  They (elders) will order the culprit's clan to give the victim's family 100 camels, as punishment, which never go to the victim anyway,  she said. Of the few cases that do go to court, about one in three are dismissed due to a lack of evidence or the victim retracting her accusation, she said. Fatouma Mohammed, whose daughter's case is now being tried before a Wajir court, thanks to support from the gender group, said both of them routinely receive hate threats from her brother-in-law's family.   But we won't give up,  she said. The gender desk's efforts are starting to bear fruit. Adan said that in the past year nine cases of violence against women and girls have been tried, all of which resulted in jail sentences. In 2015, only two such cases ended in jail sentences, she said. Gender Champions In addition to seeking justice for victims of violence, the gender desk aims to shift traditional, patriarchal attitudes towards women and girls. Abdi Buhad said the group is trying to make men part of the solution, by identifying  gender champions  and convincing those men to speak out on local radio against violence and to promote gender equality.  We've started at home, by training our own husbands,  she laughed.  We want them to tell other men that it's okay to change your baby's nappy or cook for your wife.  She wants men to learn to adopt more resilient attitudes, similar to what she called women's  fighting spirit .  If a man loses his animals it's the end of the world,  she said.  But if the same thing happens to a woman, she'll just make tea and chapatis, sell them at the market and come back with the money.  Some of the women have received threats, however, and even been assaulted in retaliation for their work. Sophie Gedi, who calls herself  the oldest activist in Wajir  - she's in her late 50s - said she was stabbed in the face and bitten in the arm by a man for teaching girls to express themselves through dancing,  because he didn't like what I was doing to our culture.  Caught in the Middle Worsening drought has exacerbated already high levels of violence against women and girls, especially among pastoralist communities, said Diyad Hujale, program coordinator at Mercy Corps.   This year's drought has been particularly bad, causing pastoralists from Wajir to move to the north of the county – where there is more rain – and fueling conflict for land and water,  he said. Girls and women are often caught in the middle of disputes, he added.  Some pastoralists think that if you want to send a political message, to threaten another clan, you rape a girl,  he said. In the worst cases, girls are killed, he said. And  sometimes (her) body is even mutilated to distress the family. That type of conflict is extremely hard to resolve.  He hopes that by laying criminal charges against one person - rather than allowing responsibility for the violence to be attributed to an entire clan - the escalation of violence among groups can be reduced, along with the intimidation of victims that often follows. Waiting for Justice Adan said one of the biggest challenges facing the group is a lack of funds.  We're hoping for a bill to pass at the county level that would give us public funding as well as a board, which could help us lobby the government for policy change,  she said. Funding also would help the group build a much-needed shelter for victims of sexual violence, she added.   Far from receiving compassion, they are considered 'sullied' and rejected by their own families,  she said. For now, many victims like Mariam are still waiting for justice. Her case is ongoing, pending a DNA test that would prove her uncle is her baby's father.  The test costs over 20,000 Kenyan shillings (about $194) and needs to be done in Nairobi, the capital, over 600km from Wajir.  That's too expensive, and too far,  said Fatouma Mohammed, squeezing her daughter's hand. Mariam, who now refuses to venture outside her home alone, said she  almost wants him (her uncle) to be exonerated, so we can try to forget about all of this . She paused.   Even though I know I will never forget,  she said.  Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, editing by Laurie Goering.

As a middle-aged man dressed in blue jeans and a black polo shirt walks nearby, Mutiso pounces, flooding him with offers of cooked fish and a space to sit to eat it, near his fish stand. But a swarm of houseflies buzzing nearby and a dead marabou stork on the edge of the lake make the offer less appealing. The man dismisses Mutiso with a wave of the hand, and walks off.  This happens all the time because the place is so dirty,  said Mutiso, glancing at piles of plastic waste, rotten fish remains and used fishing nets on the lake's shores.  I may go out of business soon.  Plastic, paper and other waste - such as fertilisers and chemicals from nearby flower farms - have contaminated the popular lake's water over the past decade, killing wildlife and making it less appealing to tourists. Since January, however, a group of young Kenyans have been harvesting plastic waste from the lake and burning it to power a community cooker, which sells cheap meals to locals and the region's growing number of flower farm workers. Armed with carrier bags, the 15 employees of a local socially minded business collect solid waste such as plastic and fishing nets from the lake, and bring it to a cooker about 10 km away. Eric Njuguna, chairman of the  social enterprise  - Charicson Enterprises - said the cooker consumes 80 to 100 kg of waste every day. It has been running since the business was set up in 2015.  Our aim is to help clean up the lake, boil drinking water for the community and cook affordable meals for local workers,  he explained. Rising Pollution Timothy Kiogora, Nakuru County's director of environment, natural resources and energy, said pollution in the region's biggest freshwater lake is on the rise.   Hundreds of plants and migratory bird species which nest in the lake are dying due to increasing pollution from the flower farms,  he said.  This is costing the (county) government millions of shillings due to less tourists visiting the lake,  he said. Betterman Simidi, who heads Clean Up Kenya, an environmental non-governmental organization, said plastic and paper are not the only pollution problem for the lake.   The farms' fertilisers and chemicals are being drained  into the water and causing nutrient loading,  he said. That has led to the rapid growth of invasive plants, particularly water hyacinth.  Water hyacinth has spread into the lake, killing fish and clogging the flow path. The government should be doing more to protect it,  he said. Njuguna, whose workers are clearing plastic from the lake,  believes that while burning trash for energy is one way to reduce the lake's amount of solid waste, the community must also take responsibility for keeping it clean.  Most households do not have waste disposal units, so they just dump it wherever they like,  he said.  Charicson Enterprises has been promised about $20,000 from donors such as British retailer Tesco, ACE Environmental Consultancy and Vegpro, a local exporter of fresh produce, to build more cookers and help residents find a better way to dispose of waste, Njuguna said.  The money and training will help them buy and set up household bins to reduce uncontrolled dumping,  he said. Cheaper Food In addition to helping clear the lake, the company aims to help feed the village's population of over 80,000, over 30 percent of whom work seasonal jobs at nearby flower farms. Most workers cannot afford the costly meals – averaging 2,000 Kenyan shillings (about $20) – served in five-star hotels in the tourist area.  But by using plastic waste as free energy for cookers, the group can sell dishes made with vegetables, fruit and maize flour for just 15 shillings ($0.15).   Njuguna said it can serve up to 300 lunches per day. Youth volunteers take some meals directly to the workers, and the company also allows residents living near the cooker to boil water free, he said. Mercy Wambui, a housewife from the village, said being able to use the cooker was a big help.  I do not have to worry about getting firewood to use in my kitchen these days,  she said.  They (Charicson Enterprises) allow me to boil water for free, for drinking and bathing. Sometimes I can even make food for my family at the cooker.   Njuguna said he hopes the next step will be to use profits made from the sale of meals to help send five of the company's youth, who come from poor families, to college starting next year.

Although total assistance rose for a fourth consecutive year, the pace of growth slowed, independent UK-based research organization Development Initiatives said. One factor behind the slowdown may have been the lack of any sudden large scale disaster such as the 2015 Nepal earthquake or 2014 West African Ebola epidemic. Here are some facts from the Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2017: - The 2016 total comprises $20.3 billion in contributions from governments and EU institutions and $6.9 billion from private donations.  - Five government donors - United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Japan - contributed almost two-thirds of all government donations. - Combined contributions from European donors rose by 25 percent, but those from donors in the Middle East fell by 24 percent. - Kuwait's contributions were down 50 percent, Qatar's 57 percent and Saudi Arabia's 26 percent. - Germany more than doubled its aid. Belgium's contributions were up 58 percent, Denmark 51 percent and France 41 percent.  - The United States was the biggest government donor, spending $6.31 billion. - More than 164 million people needed international humanitarian assistance during 2016 - over a quarter living in just three countries: Yemen, Syria and Iraq. - Humanitarian assistance was concentrated on a few large crises with Syria, Yemen, Iraq, South Sudan and Ethiopia receiving more than half of all 2016 funding. - U.N.-coordinated appeals - which aim to raise funds from across the donor community to address humanitarian crises - requested $20.5 billion. Funding to these appeals reached $12.4 billion, leaving a 40 percent shortfall - There was a massive gap between the best and worst funded appeals. An appeal for Burundi was 99 percent funded while an appeal to tackle food insecurity in Gambia reached just 4 percent. - Funding from private donors increased by an estimated 6 percent in 2016, following a 26 percent rise the previous year.

Previously children as young as 14 could get married with parental permission and consent of a judge in the state that stretches from New York City north to Canada and west to the Great Lakes. The new law, signed by the governor of New York Andrew Cuomo, still allows for marriage at the age of 17 with parental and judicial permission. In the United States, some 170,000 children were wed between 2000 and 2010 in 38 of the 50 states where data was available, according to anti-child marriage group Unchained at Last. In New York state, home to 19 million people, more than 3,800 children were married in that time period.  This is a major step forward in our efforts to protect children and prevent forced marriages,  Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement. He added that the new state law will  provide minors with the rights and protections that they deserve and ensure that women are empowered to have control over their own lives.  Studies show child marriage is linked to poverty and school drop-out rates in the United States, with underage girls who marry 50 percent more likely to drop out of high school, according to research cited by the governor's office. Child brides are 31 percent more likely to live in poverty when they are older and three times more likely to be victims of domestic abuse than women who get married later, it said. The new law came after the state of Virginia last year passed a law limiting child marriage as did the state of Texas last week. Similar legislation is under consideration in a handful of other U.S. states. For although 18 is the minimum age for marriage in most of the United States, many states have legal loopholes allowing children to wed. In most states, for example, 16- and 17-year-olds can marry with parental permission, and some states allow children to marry if one is pregnant or just given birth, according to the Pew Research Center. In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie recently declined to sign into law a measure to make it the first U.S. state to ban any marriage of children under age 18, saying it would conflict with religious customs. Globally, 15 million girls are married each year before the age of 18, according to Girls Not Brides, a global partnership opposed to child marriage. Judy Harris Kluger, executive director of Sanctuary for Families, said New York state had taken an important step forward to  end a human rights violation.   Sanctuary for Families has seen firsthand that young girls who are forced to marry are more likely to suffer domestic violence and are much less likely to complete their education,  she said in a statement.

The recommendation, from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), reinforces the panel's previous guidelines, according to its chairperson.  Overall, (the) prevalence of obesity has leveled off, but we do see increasing rates in some populations,  said Dr. David Grossman, of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle.  We have not solved this problem and we must continue to work on this.  The obesity rate among U.S. children in general is stable at about 17 percent but is still increasing among African American girls and Hispanic boys, the USPSTF writes in JAMA. Children are considered obese if their body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight in relation to height, falls at or above the 95th percentile on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's growth charts - which would mean the child's BMI is higher than 95 percent of other kids of the same age and sex, according to the agency. Referring children and their families to comprehensive and intensive weight management programs, with 26 hours or more of contact with specialists over two to 12 months, resulted in weight loss, USPSTF researchers found. Those contacts could include group therapy or individual sessions, education and goal setting.  The amount of time these interventions consumed matters,  said Grossman.  Intensive usually means a minimum of 26 hours is required to see any effect of the intervention.  The USPSTF also looked at the use of medications like metformin and orlistat among obese children for weight loss, but evidence was scarce and the panel could not make any recommendations.  Despite the lack of evidence on use of medications for treating obesity in children, new research since the USPSTF's last recommendation in 2005 has made the new version stronger, Grossman said. Dr. Stephen Cook, of the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said doctors can screen children and teens for obesity but families may not have access to the needed treatments since insurers may not pay for those programs.  It really is sort of a form of weight bias in the sense that the system is ignoring this,  said Cook, who was not involved with the new USPSTF recommendation but is the Obesity Society’s ambassador to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Also, some insurers may only pay for treatment for a limited amount of time, whereas  obesity is a chronic disease,  he told Reuters Health.   You can’t necessarily cure it.   Grossman said weight management programs for youth are not as widely available as they are for adults.  Our hope is that these types of programs could someday be offered over telephone or televideo and that could overcome the access issues,  he said.

Trump,John Thune,Mike Pence,Mitch McConnell,Shelley Moore Capito,Ted Cruz,USA,HEALTHCARE/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans plan to unveil the text of their draft healthcare bill on Thursday as senators struggle over issues such as the future of the Medicaid program for the poor and bringing down insurance costs. Republicans in the chamber have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. The effort has been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives, which surfaced again on Tuesday. Democrats have also criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, staging a protest on the Senate floor on Monday.  Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer charged. President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare. The 2010 law extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month. Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more  generous  bill than that approved by the House, whose version he privately called  mean,  according to congressional sources. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under the House plan, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate healthcare bill would be different from the House version, but he did not elaborate. In the Senate, moderates including Senator Shelley Moore Capito have argued for a long, seven-year phase-out to the Medicaid expansion that happened under Obamacare. But Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday the phase-out in the bill might just be three years. Capito said on Tuesday she was also concerned the Senate healthcare plan might cap Medicaid spending and shift it to a lower growth rate in 2025.  That's an issue,  she said. Conservatives Wary Senate conservatives also seemed wary of the emerging bill. Ted Cruz, a member of a core group of 13 Republicans who have been working on the legislation, told reporters the bill did not yet do enough to lower health insurance premiums.  If it is going to pass, the bill is going to have to make meaningful steps to reduce premiums,  he said. Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare, Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chamber's 52 Republicans to ensure passage. McConnell announced a discussion draft would be laid out on Thursday. The bill will be brought to the Senate floor once the CBO has assessed its cost and impact,  likely next week,  McConnell said. Thune said the bill was not yet finalized, saying:  We're trying to get definitive determinations  on a range of issues. Vice President Mike Pence predicted that new healthcare legislation would be enacted this summer.  I want to assure you, before this summer is over ... President Donald Trump and this Congress will keep their promise to the American people, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare,  Pence told a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-idUSL1N1JH1ZV"},

Republicans in the chamber have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. The effort has been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives, which surfaced again on Tuesday. Democrats have also criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, staging a protest on the Senate floor on Monday.  Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer charged.  President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare. The 2010 law extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. Related CoverageSenate to release health bill at 0930 EDT Thursday: senatorsThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month. Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more  generous  bill than that approved by the House, whose version he privately called  mean,  according to congressional sources. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under the House plan, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate healthcare bill would be different from the House version, but he did not elaborate. Protestors gather during a demonstration against the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act, outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinIn the Senate, moderates including Senator Shelley Moore Capito have argued for a long, seven-year phase-out to the Medicaid expansion that happened under Obamacare. But Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday the phase-out in the bill might just be three years. Capito said on Tuesday she was also concerned the Senate healthcare plan might cap Medicaid spending and shift it to a lower growth rate in 2025.  That's an issue,  she said. Conservatives Wary Slideshow (6 Images)Senate conservatives also seemed wary of the emerging bill. Ted Cruz, a member of a core group of 13 Republicans who have been working on the legislation, told reporters the bill did not yet do enough to lower health insurance premiums.  If it is going to pass, the bill is going to have to make meaningful steps to reduce premiums,  he said. Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare, Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chamber's 52 Republicans to ensure passage. McConnell announced a discussion draft would be laid out on Thursday. The bill will be brought to the Senate floor once the CBO has assessed its cost and impact,  likely next week,  McConnell said. Thune said the bill was not yet finalized, saying:  We're trying to get definitive determinations  on a range of issues. Vice President Mike Pence predicted that new healthcare legislation would be enacted this summer.  I want to assure you, before this summer is over ... President Donald Trump and this Congress will keep their promise to the American people, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare,  Pence told a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers.

DeVos said her choice, A. Wayne Johnson,  will bring a unique combination of CEO-level operating skills and an in-depth understanding of the needs and issues associated with student loan borrowers and their families.  The financial aid sector gave the announcement a careful reception, with the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, or NASFAA, saying it looked forward to learning more about Johnson's views. Critics blasted Johnson's corporate past.  The student loan program touches the lives of 42 million borrowers. According to NASFAA, its size would put it in fifth place on the Federal Reserve's list of the largest U.S. holding companies, just behind Citigroup. That makes it a top issue across the country. In last year's election, Donald Trump and other Republicans campaigned on  getting government out of the business of student loans.  Democrats want to stay on the path forged by former President Barack Obama, who moved student lending from the banks to the federal government. DeVos has taken on higher-education finances since being confirmed in February. She recently began rewriting rules on for-profit college debt and decided to put one company in charge of servicing loans. The former financial aid chief operating officer, James Runcie, quit over proposed budget cuts, according to media reports, although the department said his poor management was a contributing factor. Johnson has a Ph.D. in higher education leadership, according to Tuesday's announcement. In a statement released by the department, Johnson said he looked  forward to accepting responsibility and accountability  for the programs with  a deep and sincere commitment  to borrowers.

To reach them, Brazilian companies have adopted mobile businesses, sending vans around the countryside selling traditional pastries, Portuguese language magazines and other goods from home. Perhaps most visible are the blue and yellow vans from state-owned Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), which often park near the local Brazilian supermarket in the towns they visit.  I can do my banking and shopping together on my day off,  said 30-year-old Kaline Lissa Kaneko, who works at a windshield wiper factory in Oizumi, in central Gunma prefecture. Many Brazilian immigrants - nearly all of whom are descendants of Japanese who moved to Brazil decades ago - have accounts at the bank so find it easier and often cheaper to send money home rather than opening a new account at a Japanese bank or going through an online service. Japan saw a big influx of Brazilian immigrants after it revised immigration laws in 1990 to encourage second- and third-generation descendants of Japanese emigrants to Brazil and their family members to work here. They peaked at over 313,000 in 2007 before Japan offered them incentives to repatriate after the global financial crisis, and fell to under 174,000 in 2015.

Picture taken April 2, 2017.Lisa TwaroniteTheir numbers are now bouncing back, helped by higher-paying jobs amid a worker shortage in Japan. They qualify for special descendent visas that allow them to work full-time, and their numbers could rise further if Japan extends the qualifications to include fourth-generation Japanese descendants. Most workers are paid by the hour and do not want to lose time on weekdays to do their banking during traditional banking hours.  It is very important for the community to have a easy access to this type of service, especially on weekends or holidays,  said Lilian Terumi Hatano, an associate professor of sociology at Kindai University in Osaka and the daughter of Japanese immigrants to Brazil. Japan is Banco do Brasil's biggest retail market outside Brazil. After paring back its traditional brick-and-mortar branches in the country from seven to three, a mobile banking service made sense for the company. Such itinerant banking services are common in developing countries but rare in Japan and other wealthier countries. Roving vehicles offering Brazilian merchandise have served Japan for decades, Hatano said, selling pastels, a traditional fried pastry with assorted fillings, as well as imported food and magazines.  Our community is not concentrated geographically,  said Marco Farani, a consul-general of Brazil in Tokyo, so such roving services  are an effective and convenient way of reaching out the Brazilian community in Japan.

The video footage is from the dashboard camera of the police cruiser of St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was found not guilty on Friday of second-degree manslaughter in the July 2016 shooting death of Philando Castile. Yanez shot Castile, 32, five times during a traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. . Like other  similar incidents across the United States, Castile's death fueled public outrage and debate about the appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. The aftermath of the shooting was broadcast on social media by Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with a young child. But the dashboard camera footage, shown in court during Yanez's trial, had not previously been made public. The video begins in silence as Yanez follows a white Oldsmobile driven by Castile on a lightly-traveled road. After pulling Castile's car over, Yanez exits his cruiser and tells Castile his brake light is broken. After Castile discloses he has a firearm, Yanez can be heard saying,  OK don't reach for it then.  Castile responds,  I'm, I, I was reaching for,  but before he finishes, Yanez, with right hand on his holster, says,  Don't pull it out.

The motion filed in state court in Tarrant County accused Tonya Couch of violating her drug- and drink-free bond terms by consuming alcohol.   The State of Texas respectfully prays that this honorable court revoke the defendant's bond and order the re-arrest of the defendant,  the motion filed by the prosecutors says. A lawyer for Couch was not immediately available for comment. Prosecutors for Tarrant County, which is home to Fort Worth, said they could not comment due to a gag order in place for the proceedings. Couch, 50, was indicted by a Tarrant County grand jury last year on charges of hindering apprehension and money laundering for aiding her son Ethan Couch violate a probation deal that kept him out for jail for killing four people while driving drunk in 2013. If convicted, she could face up to 10 years in prison. At Ethan Couch's trial in juvenile court in 2013, a psychologist testified in his defense that the then 16-year-old was a victim of “affluenza” and unable to tell right from wrong as a result of being spoiled by his family’s wealth. The probation deal reached in juvenile court sparked outrage from critics who ridiculed the affluenza defense and said that Ethan Couch's family's wealth had helped keep him out of jail. Ethan Couch is currently serving a nearly two-year jail sentence as a condition of his new probation terms as an adult. His case was transferred from the juvenile to adult supervisory system on his 19th birthday in April 2016.

Shire's SHP465 drug, known as Mydayis, contains the same active ingredient as the company's widely used ADHD treatment Adderall XR but is formulated to last up to 16 hours. Dublin-based Shire's Adderall XR, which manages symptoms for up to 12 hours, is available in generic forms.  It's obviously not a new molecule but it does extend delivery,  said Dr. Gregory Mattingly, who has been a study investigator in multiple Shire ADHD-drug trials. ADHD is characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that affects development. Estimates vary but recent data show up to 11 percent of American children are afflicted and more than half continue to suffer from it as adults. Shire, whose ADHD drugs Adderall XR and Vyvanse generated close to $2.4 billion in sales last year, plans to launch Mydayis in the third quarter of 2017. Both Mydayis and Adderall XR contain amphetamine, a stimulant that elevates levels of dopamine - a neurotransmitter associated with motivation, attention and movement. Stimulants carry a risk of abuse, can be poorly tolerated, and even be fatal in rare cases. Non-stimulant ADHD treatments have a cleaner side-effect profile but are typically less effective. Mydayis is designed to help eliminate the use of short-acting stimulants given to boost the impact of long-acting ones, especially among college students and adults, Mattingly said. However, the drug cannot be used for children aged 12 years and younger, the company said on Tuesday. Shire, which sponsored an awareness campaign on ADHD featuring Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine in 2011, first filed an application to market Mydayis in 2006, but faced multiple setbacks, including additional studies to satisfy the FDA. Other ADHD drug developers include Neos Theraputics Inc , Alcobra Ltd and Aevi Genomic Medicine . Privately held NLS Pharma, which is developing a non-stimulant ADHD treatment, reported positive mid-stage data last month.

Whirlpool shares rose more than 0.7 percent in after-market trading following the news. Fettig, 60, has served as CEO since 2004 and will remain as chairman of the board of the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company.  Jeff has done an exceptional job over a long and successful career,  said Robert Wetenhall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  He leaves the company in great shape with a strong management team in place.  Wetenhall said this was a  natural transition  to a new CEO and was to be expected after Fettig's 13 years at the helm of Whirlpool.  The move comes after a number of mixed quarters for the appliance maker.  Whirlpool reported a rise in sales in the fourth and first quarter - after reporting a decline in sales for the previous four quarters - but missed estimates in both quarters and lowered its earnings forecast for 2017 when reporting first-quarter results on April 24. Fettig steered the company through the Great Recession and oversaw the acquisition of Italian appliance maker Indesit for $1 billion in 2014 and Chinese appliance maker Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co Ltd, which it announced it would acquire in late 2013 for $552 million. Whirlpool has had problems recently with integrating Indesit and has been fighting a trade case against South Korean firms Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and LG Corp (003550.KS). The U.S. government recently determined those firms were selling their washers in the U.S. market at dumping prices.  Keith Snyder, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, said Bitzer was  probably the best pick to take over  at Whirlpool, as he has lead two of the company's four regions, North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.  Fettig has the company moving in the right direction and as an insider with years of experience, Bitzer is an excellent choice,  Snyder said. Whirlpool's stock is up 7 percent year to date.  In after-market trading, the company's shares were trading up 0.7 percent from their official closing price, at $196.

Others are placing orders earlier than before to ensure their perilously low inventories do no dry up completely.  After the supply shortages emerged we brought forward our procurement decisions ... to ensure a stable supply,  smartphone and personal computer maker LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) said in a statement, adding it had pushed up quarterly purchase decisions by about a month. Chip manufacturing technologies are growing increasingly complex, raising investment costs yet providing less output growth as some suppliers struggle to improve yields. This has caused some chip prices to double or triple from a year earlier. Some analysts say device makers could be forced to cut down on the amount of DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks at once, or NAND chips that are used for long-term data storage, on new products if the cannot get enough chips. A chip supplier source told Reuters a handful of clients have moved to 6-month supply agreements, accepting higher prices than the customary quarterly or monthly deals, to make sure they get enough memory chips for their products.   The problem will be more acute for the NAND market, where the iPhone remains a critical source of demand given the huge sales volumes and recent moves to increase storage capacity on the device,  said the source, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  Inventory Squeeze Signs of stress have already emerged: Huawei Technologies Ltd [HWT.UL] was criticized by consumers after it was discovered the Chinese firm used a mix of less advanced and powerful chips in its flagship P10 model that led to significant variations in performance.  Huawei did not respond to requests for comment on its memory procurement plans. About 18 percent of the global annual supply of NAND chips is bought by Apple, analysts say. In recent years, electronics makers have typically built up inventory during the first half to avoid being squeezed by Apple, which generally unveils its latest iPhone model in September. But the shortage of chips in the first half of the year has left many scrambling. Should the U.S. giant opt to push out more iPhones than usual or further increase the portion of high-storage models, that could further squeeze out other companies. Some analysts estimate Apple could ship as many as 100 million new iPhone 8s this year, compared with the 82.3 million iPhone 7s that Cowen & Co. estimates for 2016.    For the iPhone 8 launch there have been specific references to this by customers and distributors as a reason for longer delivery times and shortages,  said Tobey Gonnerman, executive vice president at U.S.-based component distributor Fusion Worldwide.   Buying buffer stock and holding product in hubs to protect against anticipated delivery interruptions has certainly become more common in recent months.  Apple declined to comment on its memory chip purchasing plans.   No Relief in Sight Chipmakers have been allocating more capital in recent years to boost production of NAND chips, where the shortage has been acute due to strong demand for high-end data storage products. Samsung Electronics will start NAND production at a $14 billion South Korea plant in the second half, while SK Hynix (000660.KS) will start making its new high-end NAND products in coming months. But analysts say meaningful new supply is unlikely to materialize until 2018.   SK Hynix told Reuters in a statement it has been meeting delivery dates but acknowledged supply conditions were tight, noting its inventory levels were at an all-time low and unlikely to increase in the near-term given continued demand. Samsung declined to comment on chip procurement for its electronic devices or inventory levels for its memory business.   Smartphone makers in China are also locked in an arms race to provide the most memory, which could further exacerbate the squeeze as they seek to counter the iPhone.     Some investors and analysts have voiced concerns about potential  de-speccing,  where product makers cut back on memory to cope with the shortages or margin pressures. IHS analyst Walter Coon said some firms were starting to prepare to offer products with lower memory content if market conditions remain tight. But analysts also say manufacturers will be loath to cut back on memory as such a move would be deeply unpopular, saying the firms are more likely to just not upgrade memory on new models.

Attracted by the prospects of a business that aims to tap increasing demand for storage of renewable power, Foresight will use its Foresight ITS fund to buy the project in Port of Tyne in northeast England from RES (Renewable Energy Systems). Foresight, which has about 2.6 billion pounds ($3.28 billion) of assets under management, did not give a price for the deal. The project, which is expected to start operations next year, already has contracts with Britain's National Grid (NG.L), to provide electricity balancing services and a government contract to provide back-up power to the system when demand is high. RES, will continue to build and operate the project, Foresight said. Rapid growth of solar and wind energy means that power supplies increasingly rely on the wind blowing or sun shining.  As a result, utilities are looking for new ways to store renewable energy for release into the grid when supplies are low. In Britain the challenge is especially acute because the buffer between supply and demand is tighter than in other European countries, with ageing fossil fuel plants being shut down.  The acquisition consolidates Foresight's position as a leader in investing both in renewable energy generation and the flexible grid infrastructure required to accommodate increasing penetration of renewables,  Dan Wells, a partner at Foresight,  said in a statement. Foresight funds manage a portfolio of more than 80 solar power projects in the UK, southern Europe, Australia and North America, as well as 28 Energy from Waste projects in Britain.

Japan's demographic challenges have for decades hindered efforts by policymakers to engineer a sustained economic recovery as the country's graying consumers, lacking confidence in the future, tend to scrimp and save rather than spend. Asked what was their biggest concern over the next three years, 40 percent of businesses cited the country's shrinking market, the Reuters Corporate Survey showed.  The domestic market isn't expanding and there's nothing we can do about it,  wrote a manager at an auto sector firm in the survey conducted June 2-15. But the problem of fewer customers is now being exacerbated by a lack of workers as population woes deepen, pressuring companies to raise wages and in some cases even cut back on services offered. Thirty-four percent of firms said the lack of workers was now their main concern.  We're having trouble both in hiring new grads and with pulling in people mid-career, especially those with technical expertise,  said a manager at a metals and machinery firm. Delivery firm Yamato Holding Co (9064.T) is one of many firms that has grabbed headlines recently, announcing in April it would cut delivery volumes and hike prices because it did not have enough workers. The country's working-age population has dropped 11 percent since its peak in 1995 to 77.2 million in 2015 and is projected to tumble to 45.2 million by 2065. While most firms said they could secure sufficient staff over the next three years, 26 percent thought they wouldn't be able to. By sector, IT services firms, transport as well as other services were the most pessimistic with 40-45 percent of companies worried they would be left short of employees. To secure sufficient labor, 48 percent said they would expand training and investment in human resources, a quarter saw wage hikes as a way to go, while 13 percent plan to hire foreign workers.     Worries about domestic demand and the lack of workers far outstripped other corporate concerns. Trade stagnation due to protectionism only garnered 9 percent of the votes, while deflation, a state of falling prices that has long been the bete noire of Japanese authorities, gained just 5 percent. The survey, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 526 big and mid-sized businesses, who reply on condition of anonymity. Between 200 and 240 companies answered questions on their three-year outlook. GRAPHIC: Japan Inc wary about shrinking domestic demand - tmsnrt.rs/2sGqwVV Cool on China Capex The poll also showed that 48 percent plan to expand domestic capital spending over the next three years, while 46 percent said they would keep it at current rates. The remaining 6 percent said they were taking a cautious stance. Those results underscore a firm, although not exactly robust, trend for Japan business investment - one that is being driven in part by the need for companies to invest in labor saving technology as they seek to offset the shortage of workers, said Hidenobu Tokuda, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, who reviewed the survey results. Japanese companies were, however, much more cautious about boosting investment in their main overseas markets. Over the next three years, only 12 percent plan to boost capital spending  in China and only 18 percent aim to do so in the United States.  We'll reduce the weighting of China in our investment strategy. It's easy to expand sales there given the size of China's market, but it's hard to raise profits due to regulations, licenses, high labor costs and opaque business practices,  wrote a manager at an electrical machinery firm. The outlook for investment in the rest of Asia was somewhat brighter with 38 percent expecting to lift investment.

Ferguson will remain CEO until October while Cenovus searches for a new leader, then stay on in an advisory role until March 2018, the company said.  It was the stock's biggest one-day percentage decline since March, when Cenovus announced plans to spend $13.3 billion to buy the oil-sands assets from ConocoPhillips in a deal that doubled the company's size.  The company's decision to announce Ferguson's departure without naming his successor upset investors looking for quick change at Cenovus.  There's no natural heir, they have not done a very good job of succession planning,  said Laura Lau, senior portfolio manager at Brompton Group, which owns Cenovus shares.  Unfortunately he is almost a lame duck.  Related CoverageCenovus CEO says company cut some jobs as it reviews operationsInvestors have rejected Ferguson's rationale for expanding in Canada's high-cost oil sands at a time when global crude prices remain weak and international energy firms are exiting the region. They complained the deal saddled Cenovus' pristine balance sheet with debt and brought it into natural gas operations, an area where the company has no experience.  It has gone from bad to worse for these guys,  said Brian Pow, analyst at Acumen Capital Partners in Calgary.  What they thought was a great acquisition three months ago is turning out to look like it was bought at the top of the market.  Oil Prices FILE PHOTO - President and CEO Brian Ferguson of Cenovus Energy addresses shareholders during the company's annual general meeting in Calgary, Alberta, Canada on April 29, 2015.Todd Korol/File PhotoCenovus closed down 84 cents at C$9.44 after hitting a record low of C$9.11. The company has lost about half, or $7 billion, of its market value since it announced the ConocoPhillips deal in March. The decline in Cenovus outpaced decreases in the overall energy sector, which sank as oil prices fell to a seven-month low, dropping below $43 a barrel.  The Toronto Stock Exchange's energy group index fell 2.5 percent to its lowest since April 2016. Also on Tuesday, Cenovus  unveiled plans to ramp up divestitures and sell C$4 billion to C$5 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt. Previously the company said it would offload about C$3.6 billion of assets including its Pelican Lake and Suffield conventional oil and gas assets. The company said it may also sell part of the Deep Basin gas field it acquired from ConocoPhillips and Marten Hills oil assets.  Ferguson told an investors meeting in Toronto that he is also looking to sell its Palliser and Weyburn conventional oil projects in a deal that could be announced in the fourth quarter. Cenovus has said the deal would allow it to utilize economies of scale to lower costs, and on Tuesday it said it will achieve C$1 billion in cost savings. Ferguson told reporters after the meeting that the company may cut some jobs as part of the cost reduction measures and divestitures. He did not provide specific numbers.

Seeking new, less crowded markets, activist investors are using Australia's shareholder-friendly laws to pressure corporate boards criticized as clubby and conservative in an effort to improve returns.   Whereas before it was quite normal for companies to address any potential shareholder activism in Australia behind closed doors, only now is there a real appetite to go public and to take the message direct to shareholders,  said Michael Chandler, governance director at shareholder engagement firm Global Proxy Solicitation.  Activists publicly targeted 26 Australia-listed companies in the first five months of 2017, a quarter more than same period five years ago, according to data from research firm Activist Insight.  While the number of targets is similar to last year, the size of targets has jumped. Elliott's three month campaign targeting BHP, known as  The Big Australian , has cemented the idea that no company is immune.     The strategy appears to be bearing some fruit, with activist shareholders winning board-level resignations or strategy changes.  Among the more recent campaigns, building firm Brickworks Ltd (BKW.AX) is in court to defend its corporate structure from attack by Perpetual Ltd (PPT.AX), while Wilson Asset Management forced the exit of Hunter Hall Global Value Ltd's (HHV.AX) chairman in April.   GRAPHIC on activist campaigns: here New Frontiers More attacks are also coming from overseas - a change for a country where activist investors have largely been homegrown. Between 2013 and 2016, 86 percent of Australian campaigns came from domestic investors, compared with 59 percent in Canada and 39 percent in Japan, according to Activist Insight data.  The U.S. markets are a bit saturated, so (activist investors) look at the markets that don't have as much activist focus at the moment and that are most similar to the U.S.,  said David Hunker, head of shareholder activism defense at J.P. Morgan.   Apart from New York-based Elliott's push into Australia, Britain's Crystal Amber Fund Ltd (CRSL.L) has moved aggressively into the market, last year building an initial 10 percent stake in medical device developer GI Dynamics Inc (GIDYL.PK). Crystal Amber backed a new management team's plan to commercialize the company's obesity and diabetes treatment, is pushing for an AIM listing in Britain and has grown its stake to more than 40 percent.  Unlike some other Asian markets, Australian corporate rules help activist investors. FILE PHOTO: Australian mining company BHP's new corporate logo, released to Reuters from their Melbourne, Australia, headquarters May 15, 2017. BHP/Handout viaFile PhotoShareholders can call a meeting to remove directors with only a 5 percent stake and boards are barred from putting in place U.S.-style  poison pills  to insulate themselves from a change of control. Yet compared with the United States, where Elliott last month raised more than $5 billion in 24 hours for a new fund, shareholder activism is still niche in Australia.  None of the big name marquee activists have really made an attack down here publicly until Elliott,  said Gabriel Radzyminski, managing director of Sandon Capital, one of the few dedicated activist funds in Australia.   You've got to have an appreciation for local mores and customs. It doesn't mean foreigners can't do it, but you have just got to be conscious.  Australia has a relatively insular, risk-averse community of board members and investors who for the most part do not seek public confrontation, said Gilbert + Tobin partner Justin Mannolini.  I do think we are culturally inclined to avoid conflict rather than to bring it on,  he said. Many independent directors also hold seats on multiple boards. “In Australia we have this independent non-executive director club where you have a large group of ex-CEOs, ex-bankers, ex-lawyers in some cases and they are very much dependent on their income for parts of their retirement in sitting on four or five board seats,  said another lawyer who advises boards and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals.  It is very much a club.  Sometimes, the mere act of taking a campaign public can sometimes be enough to shake things up. Directors don't want to be  tainted  and lose out on future roles and fees because they were rejected by shareholders. A Gilbert + Tobin review of the 2016 AGM season found nearly half of the proposed resolutions from activists seeking to remove board members were withdrawn before the meeting because the directors voluntarily resigned or the activist succeeded in getting a board appointment of its choosing. Some investors and directors say Australian boards do respond to feedback from major investors and they can achieve their aims without confrontational, public spats. For example, Insurance Australia Group (IAG.AX) in 2015 killed plans to establish a general insurance business in China after fund managers privately baulked at the risks. Shareholders in BHP succeeded in privately persuading the miner to change its dividend policy last year and to halt pricey expansion plans in 2012.     Aberdeen Asset Management portfolio manager Mark Daniels, whose firm owns BHP shares, said he couldn't recall any case in which he backed an activist's public push for change.  We wouldn't be invested in the company if we didn't like it in the first place,  he said.

To reach them, Brazilian companies have adopted mobile businesses, sending vans around the countryside selling traditional pastries, Portuguese language magazines and other goods from home. Perhaps most visible are the blue and yellow vans from state-owned Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), which often park near the local Brazilian supermarket in the towns they visit.  I can do my banking and shopping together on my day off,  said 30-year-old Kaline Lissa Kaneko, who works at a windshield wiper factory in Oizumi, in central Gunma prefecture. Many Brazilian immigrants - nearly all of whom are descendants of Japanese who moved to Brazil decades ago - have accounts at the bank so find it easier and often cheaper to send money home rather than opening a new account at a Japanese bank or going through an online service. Japan saw a big influx of Brazilian immigrants after it revised immigration laws in 1990 to encourage second- and third-generation descendants of Japanese emigrants to Brazil and their family members to work here. They peaked at over 313,000 in 2007 before Japan offered them incentives to repatriate after the global financial crisis, and fell to under 174,000 in 2015.

Picture taken April 2, 2017.Lisa TwaroniteTheir numbers are now bouncing back, helped by higher-paying jobs amid a worker shortage in Japan. They qualify for special descendent visas that allow them to work full-time, and their numbers could rise further if Japan extends the qualifications to include fourth-generation Japanese descendants. Most workers are paid by the hour and do not want to lose time on weekdays to do their banking during traditional banking hours.  It is very important for the community to have a easy access to this type of service, especially on weekends or holidays,  said Lilian Terumi Hatano, an associate professor of sociology at Kindai University in Osaka and the daughter of Japanese immigrants to Brazil. Japan is Banco do Brasil's biggest retail market outside Brazil. After paring back its traditional brick-and-mortar branches in the country from seven to three, a mobile banking service made sense for the company. Such itinerant banking services are common in developing countries but rare in Japan and other wealthier countries. Roving vehicles offering Brazilian merchandise have served Japan for decades, Hatano said, selling pastels, a traditional fried pastry with assorted fillings, as well as imported food and magazines.  Our community is not concentrated geographically,  said Marco Farani, a consul-general of Brazil in Tokyo, so such roving services  are an effective and convenient way of reaching out the Brazilian community in Japan.

Emil Rensing, 43, entered his plea to a single count of wire fraud before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott in federal court in Manhattan, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim announced. Rensing's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Rensing was arrested and charged in April 2016. Epix, a joint venture between Viacom Inc, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc, was not identified by name in the charging documents, but the company has confirmed that it was the alleged victim. In a criminal complaint, prosecutors said that while working at Epix from April 2010 to August 2015, Rensing caused the company to contract with vendor companies he owned to perform digital media services. Those services were largely never performed, and while the contracts listed several of Rensing's former professional associates as vendor personnel, those associates had never heard of the vendors, the complaint said.

The Hamilton County Coroner's Office was still conferring on Tuesday with doctors at a Cincinnati hospital who were treating Otto Warmbier, 22, before reaching any conclusions about his death a day earlier, investigator Daryl Zornes said.

He declined to estimate how long it would take for the coroner's office to complete its inquiry. Preliminary autopsy findings had been expected later on Tuesday or on Wednesday.

He was sentenced two months later to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, the nation's state media said.

Security Council resolutions. The North Korean government has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.     Warmbier's family has not specified how he slipped from a comatose state to death, but said in a statement on Monday that the  awful torturous mistreatment  he endured while in captivity meant  no other outcome was possible.

More than $2 trillion of planned investments in oil and gas projects by 2025 risk becoming redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker thinktank and a group of institutional investors. The report analysed the costs of oil and gas projects planned for approval by 69 companies into 2025. It then compared their carbon intensity to targets needed to meet the 2 degree limit set by the 2015 Paris agreement, which would lead to a decline in fossil fuel consumption. According to the report, Exxon, the world's top publicly-traded oil and gas company, risks spending up to half its budget on new fields that will not be needed. Shell and France's Total would see up to 40 percent of their budgets outside the limits. Fossil fuel companies have come under growing pressure from investors to reduce carbon emissions and increase transparency over future investments. Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, one of the authors of the report, said last week it had wound down investments in six companies, including Exxon, that it says violate the Paris climate agreement. The world's top fossil fuel companies have voiced support for the Paris agreement reached by nearly 200 countries. Many of them have urged governments to impose a tax on carbon emissions to support cleaner sources of energy such as gas. President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord which he said would undermine the U.S. economy and weaken American national sovereignty. The report gave the example of five of the most expensive projects, including the extension of the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan and the Bonga Southwest and Bonga North in Nigeria, which will not be needed within the 2 degree scenario. Around two thirds of the potential oil and gas production which is surplus to requirements under the 2 degree scenario is controlled by the private sector,  demonstrating how the risk is skewed towards listed companies rather than national oil companies,  the report said. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, widely considered the lowest cost oil producer in the world, would only see up to 10 percent of its production uneconomical under the carbon emissions scenario, the report said. The report's authors said their discussions with oil companies had shown they wanted to remain flexible to respond to future developments and possible changes in the oil price. International oil companies including Shell and BP have rejected the idea that some of their assets could end up redundant, saying the reserves they hold are too small to be affected by any long-term decline in demand.

Attracted by the prospects of a business that aims to tap increasing demand for storage of renewable power, Foresight will use its Foresight ITS fund to buy the project in Port of Tyne in northeast England from RES (Renewable Energy Systems). Foresight, which has about 2.6 billion pounds ($3.28 billion) of assets under management, did not give a price for the deal. The project, which is expected to start operations next year, already has contracts with Britain's National Grid (NG.L), to provide electricity balancing services and a government contract to provide back-up power to the system when demand is high. RES, will continue to build and operate the project, Foresight said. Rapid growth of solar and wind energy means that power supplies increasingly rely on the wind blowing or sun shining.  As a result, utilities are looking for new ways to store renewable energy for release into the grid when supplies are low. In Britain the challenge is especially acute because the buffer between supply and demand is tighter than in other European countries, with ageing fossil fuel plants being shut down.  The acquisition consolidates Foresight's position as a leader in investing both in renewable energy generation and the flexible grid infrastructure required to accommodate increasing penetration of renewables,  Dan Wells, a partner at Foresight,  said in a statement.

Japan's demographic challenges have for decades hindered efforts by policymakers to engineer a sustained economic recovery as the country's graying consumers, lacking confidence in the future, tend to scrimp and save rather than spend. Asked what was their biggest concern over the next three years, 40 percent of businesses cited the country's shrinking market, the Reuters Corporate Survey showed.  The domestic market isn't expanding and there's nothing we can do about it,  wrote a manager at an auto sector firm in the survey conducted June 2-15. But the problem of fewer customers is now being exacerbated by a lack of workers as population woes deepen, pressuring companies to raise wages and in some cases even cut back on services offered. Thirty-four percent of firms said the lack of workers was now their main concern.  We're having trouble both in hiring new grads and with pulling in people mid-career, especially those with technical expertise,  said a manager at a metals and machinery firm. Delivery firm Yamato Holding Co (9064.T) is one of many firms that has grabbed headlines recently, announcing in April it would cut delivery volumes and hike prices because it did not have enough workers. The country's working-age population has dropped 11 percent since its peak in 1995 to 77.2 million in 2015 and is projected to tumble to 45.2 million by 2065. While most firms said they could secure sufficient staff over the next three years, 26 percent thought they wouldn't be able to. By sector, IT services firms, transport as well as other services were the most pessimistic with 40-45 percent of companies worried they would be left short of employees. To secure sufficient labor, 48 percent said they would expand training and investment in human resources, a quarter saw wage hikes as a way to go, while 13 percent plan to hire foreign workers.     Worries about domestic demand and the lack of workers far outstripped other corporate concerns. Trade stagnation due to protectionism only garnered 9 percent of the votes, while deflation, a state of falling prices that has long been the bete noire of Japanese authorities, gained just 5 percent. The survey, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 526 big and mid-sized businesses, who reply on condition of anonymity. Between 200 and 240 companies answered questions on their three-year outlook. GRAPHIC: Japan Inc wary about shrinking domestic demand - tmsnrt.rs/2sGqwVV Cool on China Capex The poll also showed that 48 percent plan to expand domestic capital spending over the next three years, while 46 percent said they would keep it at current rates. The remaining 6 percent said they were taking a cautious stance. Those results underscore a firm, although not exactly robust, trend for Japan business investment - one that is being driven in part by the need for companies to invest in labor saving technology as they seek to offset the shortage of workers, said Hidenobu Tokuda, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, who reviewed the survey results. Japanese companies were, however, much more cautious about boosting investment in their main overseas markets. Over the next three years, only 12 percent plan to boost capital spending  in China and only 18 percent aim to do so in the United States.  We'll reduce the weighting of China in our investment strategy. It's easy to expand sales there given the size of China's market, but it's hard to raise profits due to regulations, licenses, high labor costs and opaque business practices,  wrote a manager at an electrical machinery firm. The outlook for investment in the rest of Asia was somewhat brighter with 38 percent expecting to lift investment.

Seeking new, less crowded markets, activist investors are using Australia's shareholder-friendly laws to pressure corporate boards criticized as clubby and conservative in an effort to improve returns.   Whereas before it was quite normal for companies to address any potential shareholder activism in Australia behind closed doors, only now is there a real appetite to go public and to take the message direct to shareholders,  said Michael Chandler, governance director at shareholder engagement firm Global Proxy Solicitation.  Activists publicly targeted 26 Australia-listed companies in the first five months of 2017, a quarter more than same period five years ago, according to data from research firm Activist Insight.  While the number of targets is similar to last year, the size of targets has jumped. Elliott's three month campaign targeting BHP, known as  The Big Australian , has cemented the idea that no company is immune.     The strategy appears to be bearing some fruit, with activist shareholders winning board-level resignations or strategy changes.  Among the more recent campaigns, building firm Brickworks Ltd (BKW.AX) is in court to defend its corporate structure from attack by Perpetual Ltd (PPT.AX), while Wilson Asset Management forced the exit of Hunter Hall Global Value Ltd's (HHV.AX) chairman in April.   GRAPHIC on activist campaigns: here New Frontiers More attacks are also coming from overseas - a change for a country where activist investors have largely been homegrown. Between 2013 and 2016, 86 percent of Australian campaigns came from domestic investors, compared with 59 percent in Canada and 39 percent in Japan, according to Activist Insight data.  The U.S. markets are a bit saturated, so (activist investors) look at the markets that don't have as much activist focus at the moment and that are most similar to the U.S.,  said David Hunker, head of shareholder activism defense at J.P. Morgan.   Apart from New York-based Elliott's push into Australia, Britain's Crystal Amber Fund Ltd (CRSL.L) has moved aggressively into the market, last year building an initial 10 percent stake in medical device developer GI Dynamics Inc (GIDYL.PK). Crystal Amber backed a new management team's plan to commercialize the company's obesity and diabetes treatment, is pushing for an AIM listing in Britain and has grown its stake to more than 40 percent.  Unlike some other Asian markets, Australian corporate rules help activist investors. FILE PHOTO: Australian mining company BHP's new corporate logo, released to Reuters from their Melbourne, Australia, headquarters May 15, 2017. BHP/Handout viaFile PhotoShareholders can call a meeting to remove directors with only a 5 percent stake and boards are barred from putting in place U.S.-style  poison pills  to insulate themselves from a change of control. Yet compared with the United States, where Elliott last month raised more than $5 billion in 24 hours for a new fund, shareholder activism is still niche in Australia.  None of the big name marquee activists have really made an attack down here publicly until Elliott,  said Gabriel Radzyminski, managing director of Sandon Capital, one of the few dedicated activist funds in Australia.   You've got to have an appreciation for local mores and customs. It doesn't mean foreigners can't do it, but you have just got to be conscious.  Australia has a relatively insular, risk-averse community of board members and investors who for the most part do not seek public confrontation, said Gilbert + Tobin partner Justin Mannolini.  I do think we are culturally inclined to avoid conflict rather than to bring it on,  he said. Many independent directors also hold seats on multiple boards. “In Australia we have this independent non-executive director club where you have a large group of ex-CEOs, ex-bankers, ex-lawyers in some cases and they are very much dependent on their income for parts of their retirement in sitting on four or five board seats,  said another lawyer who advises boards and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals.  It is very much a club.  Sometimes, the mere act of taking a campaign public can sometimes be enough to shake things up. Directors don't want to be  tainted  and lose out on future roles and fees because they were rejected by shareholders. A Gilbert + Tobin review of the 2016 AGM season found nearly half of the proposed resolutions from activists seeking to remove board members were withdrawn before the meeting because the directors voluntarily resigned or the activist succeeded in getting a board appointment of its choosing. Some investors and directors say Australian boards do respond to feedback from major investors and they can achieve their aims without confrontational, public spats. For example, Insurance Australia Group (IAG.AX) in 2015 killed plans to establish a general insurance business in China after fund managers privately baulked at the risks. Shareholders in BHP succeeded in privately persuading the miner to change its dividend policy last year and to halt pricey expansion plans in 2012.     Aberdeen Asset Management portfolio manager Mark Daniels, whose firm owns BHP shares, said he couldn't recall any case in which he backed an activist's public push for change.  We wouldn't be invested in the company if we didn't like it in the first place,  he said.

The combined companies could handle as much as 7 percent of the U.S. corn supply of over 15 billion bushels, according to the companies' websites.  Both Lansing and Interstate believe the industry needs consolidation and want to be out at the forefront of a more efficient and customer-focused business model,  Lansing President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Krueger said in a joint statement with Interstate on Tuesday. Interstate last year sold two grain elevators in Ohio to Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL]. Smithfield, the world's biggest pork producer, was seeking to eliminate middlemen such as grain handlers in a push to buy directly from farmers. Glencore Agriculture Ltd, jointly owned by Glencore and two Canadian pension funds, last month approached Bunge Ltd about a merger after Bunge Chief Executive Soren Schroder said consolidation was needed. Lansing was founded in 1922 and handles nearly 1 billion bushels of corn annually, supplying livestock farmers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, according to its website. Grain and energy trader The Andersons Inc owns about 39 percent of Lansing Trade Group. Lansing in 2015 also sold about 20 percent of its equity for $127.5 million in cash to New Hope Liuhe Investment Inc, a U.S. subsidiary of Chinese hog and feed company, New Hope Liuhe Co Ltd, according to a press release on its website.  Interstate Commodities handles about 200 million bushels of  grain with annual sales of $2 billion at elevators and rail terminals in South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Ohio and other U.S. states, according to its website.  Lansing and Interstate have had a strong relationship for decades and believe now is the perfect time to combine our teams,  Interstate Chief Executive Officer Greg Oberting said in a statement.

As temperatures climbed into the triple digits across the region, major airlines were forced to delay or cancel flights out of Las Vegas and Phoenix airports, citing difficulty in operating aircraft in extreme heat. American Airlines canceled 20 regional flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Tuesday after temperatures in the desert city soared toward 120 degrees F (49 C). At least four flights had been delayed at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas as of Tuesday afternoon. Aviations experts said hotter air was also thinner, causing a decline in performance for jet engines, especially during takeoffs.  As the ambient temperature at a particular airport increases, in this case into the 120s at Phoenix, the amount of lift and power in aircraft engines declines, and the result is that for any given runway length, you can carry less and less payload,  said Robert Mann, an industry analyst and former airline executive.  As temperatures get that extreme, you have to offload so much fuel or passengers or cargo that it no longer makes sense to fly,  he said. FILE PHOTO: A view is seen of the baggage pick-up area at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, February 13, 2008.Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus/File PhotoMann said aircraft may also be hampered because the charts used in flight manuals to calculate aircraft performance are not written with such heat in mind, making it impossible for pilots to accurately calculate payloads and takeoff speeds. The flights affected by the heat tend to be on smaller regional carriers, which use planes that operate under lower maximum temperatures.  It doesn't happen very often because these are exceedingly rare temperatures, but there's a point at which either runway length is insufficient or the speed is so high that the tires wouldn't be rated for it,  Mann said of those aircraft. The heat can also create issues for ground crews, where pavement temperatures can reach more than 150 degrees F (66 C), life-threatening conditions if workers are exposed to it too long. The National Weather Service said the heat wave resulted from a high-pressure system camped over the Four Corners region where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona meet. The sweltering weather was expected to peak on Tuesday or Wednesday as temperatures in Death Valley and the town of Needles, California, were forecast to spike as high as 127 degrees F (53 C).

Whirlpool shares rose more than 0.7 percent in after-market trading following the news. Fettig, 60, has served as CEO since 2004 and will remain as chairman of the board of the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company.  Jeff has done an exceptional job over a long and successful career,  said Robert Wetenhall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  He leaves the company in great shape with a strong management team in place.  Wetenhall said this was a  natural transition  to a new CEO and was to be expected after Fettig's 13 years at the helm of Whirlpool.  The move comes after a number of mixed quarters for the appliance maker.  Whirlpool reported a rise in sales in the fourth and first quarter - after reporting a decline in sales for the previous four quarters - but missed estimates in both quarters and lowered its earnings forecast for 2017 when reporting first-quarter results on April 24. Fettig steered the company through the Great Recession and oversaw the acquisition of Italian appliance maker Indesit for $1 billion in 2014 and Chinese appliance maker Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co Ltd, which it announced it would acquire in late 2013 for $552 million. Whirlpool has had problems recently with integrating Indesit and has been fighting a trade case against South Korean firms Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and LG Corp (003550.KS). The U.S. government recently determined those firms were selling their washers in the U.S. market at dumping prices.  Keith Snyder, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, said Bitzer was  probably the best pick to take over  at Whirlpool, as he has lead two of the company's four regions, North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.  Fettig has the company moving in the right direction and as an insider with years of experience, Bitzer is an excellent choice,  Snyder said. Whirlpool's stock is up 7 percent year to date.  In after-market trading, the company's shares were trading up 0.7 percent from their official closing price, at $196.

The combined companies could handle as much as 7 percent of the U.S. corn supply of over 15 billion bushels, according to the companies' websites.  Both Lansing and Interstate believe the industry needs consolidation and want to be out at the forefront of a more efficient and customer-focused business model,  Lansing President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Krueger said in a joint statement with Interstate on Tuesday. Interstate last year sold two grain elevators in Ohio to Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL]. Smithfield, the world's biggest pork producer, was seeking to eliminate middlemen such as grain handlers in a push to buy directly from farmers. Glencore Agriculture Ltd, jointly owned by Glencore and two Canadian pension funds, last month approached Bunge Ltd about a merger after Bunge Chief Executive Soren Schroder said consolidation was needed. Lansing was founded in 1922 and handles nearly 1 billion bushels of corn annually, supplying livestock farmers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, according to its website. Grain and energy trader The Andersons Inc owns about 39 percent of Lansing Trade Group. Lansing in 2015 also sold about 20 percent of its equity for $127.5 million in cash to New Hope Liuhe Investment Inc, a U.S. subsidiary of Chinese hog and feed company, New Hope Liuhe Co Ltd, according to a press release on its website.  Interstate Commodities handles about 200 million bushels of  grain with annual sales of $2 billion at elevators and rail terminals in South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Ohio and other U.S. states, according to its website.  Lansing and Interstate have had a strong relationship for decades and believe now is the perfect time to combine our teams,  Interstate Chief Executive Officer Greg Oberting said in a statement.  As a combined company, we will be able to grow both organically and through additional acquisitions.  The deal was expected to close in the third quarter. Terms were not disclosed.

A day after the launch of the 737 MAX 10 at the world's biggest air show in Paris, United said it would convert an order for 100 other 737 MAX planes to the new model. Gerry Laderman, United senior vice president, said the MAX 10 had  the best economics of the family , a boost for a plane Boeing designed to plug a gap in its range at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets, following runaway sales of the rival Airbus A321neo. The United deal brought the number of MAX 10s covered by air show order announcements to a higher than expected total of more than 320, though more than half were conversions and underlying new orders and commitments for Boeing stood closer to 160. Despite the interest in the MAX 10, analysts expect passenger jet orders at the Paris Airshow to fall short of recent boom years, as airlines digest a flood of deliveries. But over the longer term, Boeing sees an industry in rude health, forecasting 41,030 passenger and freight plane deliveries worth more than $6 trillion over the next two decades, up from 39,620 in a similar projection a year ago. Boeing's projection includes a 5 percent increase in the 20-year forecast for deliveries of single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, the cash cows of the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers. In a sign of that interest, aircraft leasing company Avolon announced a provisional deal to buy 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s worth $8.4 billion at list prices and said it would have a  hard look  at possible orders for the MAX 10. Related CoverageFactbox: Airbus, Boeing commercial aircraft deals at Paris AirshowBoeing's defense unit seeks franchise-level win: executiveItaly's Leonardo will not cut stake in MBDA: trade groupAirbus agreed a provisional $5 billion deal with low-cost carrier Viva Air, confirming a Reuters report. The European planemaker has seen arch-rival Boeing grab most of the headlines so far, but could turn to one of its top buyers as a potential wild card for the show, industry sources said. AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes remained in Paris on Tuesday after signing a data deal with Airbus and picking up an airline award, and could use the opportunity to evaluate jets at attractive prices as new orders wane. Asked by Reuters whether he would return to the show on Wednesday, a move that would typically signal he is in the market to buy, Fernandes said,  We'll see . A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flying display.Pascal RossignolAirbus declined to comment. Aviation Services Boeing's head of airplane developments meanwhile said he was  very optimistic  about the chances of establishing the business case for a mid-market jet project to open up new routes from the middle of the next decade. Air travel has been on a sharp uptrend, led by emerging economies as China looks set to replace North America as the world's biggest transport market in the coming years. Slideshow (10 Images)But China's economic expansion is slowing even as it remains above 6 percent a year. Boeing trimmed its 20-year forecast for average global traffic growth to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent. With demand for new jets cooling, planemakers are seeing greater opportunities in aviation services.  Boeing forecast that market could be worth $8.5 trillion over 20 years, growing at an average 4 percent a year. Airbus launched a digital services platform on Tuesday, which it said could crunch data to help airlines improve maintenance, reduce fuel burn and optimize routes. Bigger Not Better?  In a symbolic change likely to rankle with its European rival, Boeing ditched its forecast for very large four-engined airplanes such as the Airbus A380 and its own 747-8. For the first time, it lumped these models with large two-engined jets such as the Boeing 777 and the largest Airbus A350. Boeing has long argued that the  very large  category is on its way out as airlines switch to smaller twinjets. Both manufacturers have had to cut production of four-engined jumbos. Airbus insists the double-decker A380 has a future due to airport congestion and predicts 5 percent of aircraft delivered over the next 20 years will be in that category.  They would do that, the 747-8 isn't selling,  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said of Boeing's decision to ditch its separate forecast for the biggest planes.  We have no intention of sharing that market with them, albeit a smaller market than we might have thought.   Traffic is doubling,  he said.  (Boeing's) explanation is we'll fly more flights. I'm sorry, but you can't do it. You have to have bigger aircraft.

After three failed attempts, MSCI has finally decided to add mainland-listed shares to its global indexes. The move will be a relief for Beijing, which got egg on its face at previous annual reviews. But the move is largely symbolic and will generate only modest inflows to the PRC. MSCI first proposed to add domestically listed A shares to its benchmarks in 2013, but the plan was torpedoed by large asset managers who said China hadn’t taken sufficient regulatory steps to make its market more open to investors. Beijing then lobbied for inclusion as part of its campaign to get the Chinese yuan recognized in the International Monetary Fund’s internal quasi-currency, the Special Drawing Right, a step that was approved in 2015. Concerns about the ability of foreign investors to move freely into and out of A shares led MSCI to withhold its approval in previous reviews, though. Last year the index company cited monthly limits on repatriating cash, frequent trading suspensions and exchange pre-approval requirements as reasons for its decision. The December launch of a direct trading link between the Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges, mirroring an existing link with Shanghai, and a reduction in trading suspensions in recent months appear to have been decisive. The final list of 222 stocks is larger than the 169 that MSCI had indicated it was considering as recently as May. Even so, Chinese shares won't have a big impact to begin with. They will not enter MSCI’s benchmarks until June 2018, and because the index group is including them with just a 5 percent weighting to begin with, they will represent only 0.73 percent of the Emerging Markets Index, the most widely followed in that sector. Before the announcement, Aberdeen Asset Management estimated the move would generate inflows from index-tracking funds of no more than $15 billion. Even if the increased number of stocks produces correspondingly larger flows, that will pale in comparison with China’s roughly $7 trillion market capitalization. As with the IMF's SDR decision, the MSCI move carries more symbolism that practical import for now. It’s one smallish step forward in the liberalization of China’s financial markets.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

That is a change from years past, where high unemployment was at the top of the Federal Reserve's worry list for the U.S. economy. But with the U.S. unemployment rate now at 4.3 percent, most Fed officials are now convinced that nearly all Americans who want jobs can and do get them.   That is a main reason the Fed last week raised its target range for short-term interest rates for the second time this year, even though recent inflation readings have drifted away from the Fed's 2-percent target, confounding expectations based on history and theory.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen expressed confidence inflation would eventually perk up, but some policymakers cast doubt. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Tuesday became the latest to express worries on that front, saying he is increasingly concerned that a recent softness in inflation is a sign the U.S. central bank will struggle to get price pressures back to its 2 percent objective.  I will say that the most recent inflation data made me a little nervous about that. I think it's much more challenging from here on out,  Evans said in an interview with broadcaster CNBC. Evans, who is a voter this year on the central bank's rate-setting committee, said that global forces, not just specific one-off reasons, could be behind a retreat in inflation over the past three months. He said on Monday that he supports waiting until the end of the year before considering another rate hike. Speaking to reporters after a speech at the Commonwealth Club of California, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan had similar concerns, saying he wants to wait for more evidence that the recent retreat in inflation would be temporary.  And though Kaplan said he retains an  open mind  about how many more rate hikes the Fed should deliver this year, he also highlighted an additional worry: the likelihood in his mind that even when fully healthy the U.S. economy will need interest rates to stay below 3 percent.  With the 10-year Treasury yield barely above 2 percent, he said, markets are forecasting sluggish growth ahead, and the Fed should be  careful  about lifting short-term rates, now between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, much further. Kaplan, like Evans, votes this year on monetary policy. Meanwhile two other Fed policymakers, speaking at a conference on macroprudential policy in Amsterdam jointly organized by the Dutch and Swedish central banks, suggested they are concerned less about raising rates too fast or too high than about keeping them too low for too long. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making.  Reach-for-yield behavior can make financial intermediaries and the economy more risky,  Rosengren said. He noted financial intermediaries will need to factor in the possibility of lower rates, particularly during economic downturns, and flatter yield curves. Earlier, at the same conference, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer warned that while the United States and other countries have taken steps to make their housing finance systems stronger, a prolonged period of low interest rates has helped boost house prices, which was a precursor to the last financial crisis. Neither Rosengren nor Fischer mentioned the economic outlook or current U.S. monetary policy in their prepared remarks.

Trump,USA,CRIME/SESSIONS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has launched a 12-city partnership to combat spikes in violent crime as part of President Donald Trump's vow to support law enforcement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday. The Justice Department did not say how it chose the 12 cities, which are mostly in the eastern half of the country and include Buffalo, New York and Memphis, Tennessee. The program features a three-year initiative to help coordinate crime-fighting efforts among federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement and prosecutors, Sessions said in unveiling the new National Public Safety Partnership. Republican President Donald Trump made tough-on-crime rhetoric a focus of his 2016 campaign. The new program stems from an executive order he signed in February mandating that the Justice Department provide support for local law enforcement.  We have a duty to make sure our country does not abandon all the progress we have made against crime over the past few decades,  Sessions said at a national meeting of law enforcement officials. His remarks were released by the Justice Department. Sessions did not disclose any new funding for the initiative, which will focus on gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence. The federal government will be providing help in areas that include training, crime analysis, gun violence, community engagement and investigations. A spike in violent crime in 2015 continued into the first half of last year, with big cities seeing an average increase in murders of almost 22 percent compared with the same period the year before, Sessions said. The dozen cities chosen for the program are Birmingham, Alabama; Indianapolis; Memphis, Tennessee; Toledo, Ohio; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Buffalo, New York; Cincinnati; Houston; Jackson, Tennessee; Kansas City, Missouri; Lansing, Michigan; and Springfield, Illinois. Another 10 cities have taken part in a pilot program, and Sessions said more communities could be announced for the partnership this year. Among the cities in the program, Toledo saw a 50 percent jump in homicides from 2015 to 2016, to 36, and homicides in Memphis rose to 228 from 161 in the same period, according to local newspaper databases.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-sessions-idUSL1N1JH24P"},

We believe our clients will benefit from today's decision to bring Chinese equities into mainstream investment,  Ryan Stork, the company's chairman for Asia-Pacific in Hong Kong and one of its most senior executives, said in an emailed statement.  BlackRock has continued to support all opening of investment in China's onshore capital markets for a number of years.  MSCI said it planned to add 222 Chinese stocks – which will have an initial weighting in the index of just 0.73 percent. The full inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks in the widely tracked MSCI Emerging Markets Index could eventually pull more than $400 billion of funds from asset managers, pension funds and insurers into mainland China's equity markets over the next decade, according to analysts. BlackRock manages $5.4 trillion in assets and is a major MSCI client. MSCI also said it would not yet upgrade Argentina from the frontier market category where it has languished in recent years, and launched a review of its classification of Saudi Arabian markets. BlackRock portfolio manager Emily Fletcher said that Argentina has significant growth prospects and that  the government has made good progress in dismantling the protectionist structures of the economy.  Fletcher said in a statement that the Saudi Arabia review is  an endorsement of the positive Saudi Arabian stock market reforms  opening that market to more foreign investment.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres on Friday officially put forward Ghassan Salame, a professor of International Relations and Conflict Resolution at Sciences Po in Paris, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday.  The 15-member council must agree by consensus on the appointment of special envoys and members had until Tuesday evening to raise any objections. There were none, diplomats said.     The search for a successor to Martin Kobler, a German diplomat who has served as the U.N. representative in Libya since November 2015, began in February when Guterres proposed former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the job. The United States rejected Fayyad because of his nationality. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United Nations had been  unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.  Guterres described the U.S. rejection as  a loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people.  Following that objection, Russia and other council members then rejected a British candidate and an American candidate, said diplomats. Kobler's posting was briefly extended until the end of June.  Libya slid into turmoil after the 2011 overthrow of ruler Muammar Gaddafi, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. The U.N. envoy to Libya has been trying to broker peace. The political chaos and security vacuum has allowed Islamist militant groups to gain a foothold and human traffickers to thrive. Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by sea.

Syrian state television quoting army sources said they had resumed the offensive, which took place as U.S. and Russian officials were holding another round of secret talks on creating a  de-escalation zone  in southwestern Syria that would include Deraa. U.S. and Russian officials agreed a ceasefire, which ended on Monday, during talks in Amman aimed at strengthening goodwill before more detailed negotiations on setting up the  de-escalation zone , diplomats in Jordan said.      On Saturday the Syrian army said it would suspend combat operations in Deraa for 48 hours to support  reconciliation efforts . The halt in hostilities had been widely expected to be extended with signs of progress in the talks in Amman and an agreement to continue the detailed discussions, diplomats said. A rebel official said Russian jets played a major role in the intensive raids after the army and Iranian backed militias had resumed air and artillery bombardments in the city.   They tried to disperse the rebel forces on several fronts. This is a regime that does not understand truces and they will keep trying to attack but we are ready for them,  said commander Abu Rida Abu Nabout, head of the Liwa al Tawhid rebel group fighting in the city.  Rebels in the city and other residents have said this month that the army's bombardment of Deraa has intensified, and Western backed rebels said the army and Iranian backed militias had brought more troops to the city in a possible prelude to a campaign to wrest full control of the city. The army has failed to dislodge the rebels from their stronghold in Deraa city so far, however, and rebel forces have thwarted the army's drive to regain a major border crossing with Jordan and cut rebel supplies east and west of the city. One witness said barrel bombs, artillery shells and rockets were used in the bombardment of Deraa. Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front grouping of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, said rebels had thwarted a government advance towards a rebel held military base southwest of the city near the Jordan border.   They advanced toward the base but where then encircled by rebels and incurred heavy losses and had to retreat,  Rayes said, adding that at least 20 army and militia fighters were killed in what he described as a failed offensive.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is backed in the six-year-old war by Russia, Iran and Shi'ite militias while some of the rebels seeking to oust him are supported by the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies.

The court was told in the trial that Ryjenko's role at the EBRD required him to vet applications for investment from eastern European oil, gas and mining firms. It found he struck an agreement with a U.S.-based consultant who he then introduced to a number of firms in former Soviet states to help them make applications for EBRD funding.  Ryjenko then took 50 percent of the consultant's commission fee when the applications were approved, with the money paid into accounts in the name of his sister Tatjana Sanderson, who was declared unfit to stand trial.  Andrey Ryjenko repeatedly abused his position of power within a publicly-funded bank by accepting corrupt payments,  Elspeth Pringle, a prosecutor with the UK's Crime Prosecution Service's Specialist Fraud Division said in a statement. Ryjenko was also convicted of money laundering by concealing, disguising, converting and transferring criminal property and sentenced to two years in prison, which will run concurrently.

Andrey Ryjenko, 44, who has joint UK and Russian citizenship, had been found guilty of conspiring to make or accept corrupt payments between July 2008 and November 2009 while he worked at the London-based development bank. The court was told in the trial that Ryjenko's role at the EBRD required him to vet applications for investment from eastern European oil, gas and mining firms. It found he struck an agreement with a U.S.-based consultant who he then introduced to a number of firms in former Soviet states to help them make applications for EBRD funding.  Ryjenko then took 50 percent of the consultant's commission fee when the applications were approved, with the money paid into accounts in the name of his sister Tatjana Sanderson, who was declared unfit to stand trial.  Andrey Ryjenko repeatedly abused his position of power within a publicly-funded bank by accepting corrupt payments,  Elspeth Pringle, a prosecutor with the UK's Crime Prosecution Service's Specialist Fraud Division said in a statement. Ryjenko was also convicted of money laundering by concealing, disguising, converting and transferring criminal property and sentenced to two years in prison, which will run concurrently. The EBRD, which was founded in 1991 to finance the transition of former communist Europe to market and whose main shareholders are G7 governments, said its internal systems had flagged up the wrongdoing.  We discovered his activities in 2010 and informed the police,  it said in a statement.  The Bank did not suffer any loss as a result of his actions.  Ryjenko's lawyer in the case, Peter Lownds from the firm 2 Hare Court did not respond to an e-mailed request for a comment on the sentencing by the time this story was published.

Attorneys for Martinelli, who has denied Panamanian prosecutors' accusation that he used public money to spy on more than 150 political rivals during his 2009-14 term, said he has lived openly in the United States for the past two years and has no plans to flee. U.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres said he is likely to decide within a week whether to release Martinelli, 65, who is being held in federal detention in Miami at the request of the Panamanian government. U.S. prosecutors have said they are fulfilling a treaty obligation with Panama in requesting that Martinelli, who was arrested on June 12, continue to be held.  His past behavior suggests he would do whatever is necessary to avoid returning to Panama, including jumping bond to a third country,  said Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels.  He has a massive amount of wealth that could sustain an escape to a third country where he and his family could stay in exile for decades.  Martinelli's attorneys argued their client is the target of a politically motivated prosecution by his successor, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Martinelli's attorney, Marcus Jimenez, pointed out the former president was arrested a week before Varela met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday. He argued Martinelli is being targeted as a result of a  personal vendetta  by Varela, who was Martinelli's vice president. Last month, Martinelli said on Twitter that Varela was going after him to divert attention from his own problems.  Panama's purported charges against President Martinelli are legally defective, lack probable cause and are transparently motivated by politics,  the former leader's lawyers said in their motion seeking bail. Martinelli's attorneys also said he had already left the country to seek political asylum in the United States before charges were brought by Panama. Martinelli's legal team has submitted a bond proposal for $5 million, GPS monitoring of the former president, keys to his airplane, two helicopters, and various boats.

The move suggests China could play a much larger role in future vehicle production for North America, perhaps eclipsing Mexico as a low-cost manufacturing source. Ford painted the production shift from Mexico to China, slated for mid-2019, as a purely financial move that will save the company $500 million in reduced tooling costs. But Ford also expects to ship about 80,000 vehicles to China this year, including the redesigned Lincoln Navigator luxury sport utility vehicle, which goes into production this fall at Ford's Kentucky truck plant. Ford's decision to import its first vehicles from China to the United States is also the first major manufacturing investment decision made by new Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields in May. Discussion about the small-car production shift from Mexico to China began  a couple months ago  under Fields, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations. The decision also signals a shift in strategy at Ford, which is responding to dwindling U.S. consumer demand for small cars in favor of more expensive and more profitable trucks and SUVs. Cars accounted for more than 50 percent of U.S. auto sales as recently as 2012, but have fallen to just 37 percent of sales this year. Ford on Tuesday said it would invest $900 million at the Kentucky truck plant to build the redesigned Navigator and Ford Expedition. It has contingency plans to build more of the big SUVs at an Ohio plant if demand grows.

The Ford decision shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography,  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. Trump did not address the issue on Tuesday. The Ford logo is seen on a car in a park lot in Sao Paulo, Brazil June 2, 2017.Paulo Whitaker - RTX38PH6White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump  wants to create a tax system (so) that companies want to come back and bring back jobs in manufacturing here in the United States.  Although it is cheaper to build and ship cars to the United States from Mexico than China,  this was not a variable cost decision,  Hinrichs said in a briefing on Tuesday.  It allows us to free up a lot of capital  because Ford now has to retool only one plant - the existing Focus factory in Chongqing - rather than two to supply North America. The current Focus will be phased out of production in Wayne, Michigan, in mid-2018, according to Hinrichs. The Wayne plant will begin building a new Ranger midsize truck in late 2018 and a Bronco midsize SUV in 2020.  Ford executives told Trump last year that moving production to Michigan of bigger vehicles that were more profitable would secure the Wayne plant's future - a decision later praised by Trump. No U.S. jobs will be affected by shifting Focus production to China, Ford said, adding that it employs more U.S. hourly workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than any other automaker. The United Auto Workers labor union declined to comment. Hinrichs said  the capital saving outweighs the risk  of having to pay a potential border tax, or import tax, on the Chinese-built Focus. Ford U.S. Focus sales have fallen 22 percent this year, as low gas prices have helped spur more buyers into larger vehicles. Ford's full-size F-series pickup truck remains the best-selling U.S. vehicle by a wide margin. Unlike many consumer products, few Chinese-made vehicles are sold in the United States.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres on Friday officially put forward Ghassan Salame, a professor of International Relations and Conflict Resolution at Sciences Po in Paris, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday.  The 15-member council must agree by consensus on the appointment of special envoys and members had until Tuesday evening to raise any objections. There were none, diplomats said.     The search for a successor to Martin Kobler, a German diplomat who has served as the U.N. representative in Libya since November 2015, began in February when Guterres proposed former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the job. The United States rejected Fayyad because of his nationality. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United Nations had been  unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.  Guterres described the U.S. rejection as  a loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people.  Following that objection, Russia and other council members then rejected a British candidate and an American candidate, said diplomats. Kobler's posting was briefly extended until the end of June.  Libya slid into turmoil after the 2011 overthrow of ruler Muammar Gaddafi, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. The U.N. envoy to Libya has been trying to broker peace. The political chaos and security vacuum has allowed Islamist militant groups to gain a foothold and human traffickers to thrive.

The Global Dairy Trade (GDT) Price Index dipped 0.8 percent, with an average selling price of $3,434 per tonne, in the auction held in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The index had risen 0.6 pct at the previous sale.     After two years of declining prices, farmers and analysts had been concerned that a 50 percent rebound during 2016 could be temporary but prices got back on track the past few months as global supply tightened.     The fall at the latest auction was led by weaker-than-expected prices for whole milk powder (WMP), which fell 3.3 percent compared to derivative markets expectations of a 1.3 percent rise.      WMP has been selling regularly over recent months, so some buyers have sufficient coverage for now. The quantity of WMP sold to North Asia was less than seen at recent events,  said Amy Castleton, an analyst at AgriHQ.     The auction results can affect the New Zealand dollar          as the dairy sector generates more than 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The Kiwi slipped from around $0.7268 to $0.7237.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau intended the legislation to make good on a 2015 campaign pledge to modify a law passed by the former Conservative government that boosted powers of police and intelligence agencies. The legislation would create a National Security and Intelligence Review Agency responsible for oversight of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), cyber-spy agency the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and other departments including the Canadian Border Services Agency. It would replace current oversight bodies at the two spy agencies and review  every other department and agency of the government of Canada that has a security or intelligence function,  Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters. It would work alongside a separate oversight committee of members of parliament that has been proposed in another bill, Goodale said. Given the Liberal majority in Parliament, the bill is expected to be passed into law, though it is unlikely to be debated until fall at the earliest. One expert said he remained uneasy that the government was expanding its cyber capabilities.

Oil fell about 2 percent, with Brent settling at seven-month lows and U.S. crude at its cheapest since September, after increased supply from several key producers overshadowed high compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output. That slide weighed down energy stocks on Wall Street and in Europe.

Trump sat down in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for talks on the same day the U.S. Treasury Department added two Russian officials and 36 other individuals and entities to its list of those facing sanctions over Moscow's activities in Ukraine. Trump's meeting with Poroshenko was officially called a  drop-by  visit after the Ukrainian leader's separate session with Vice President Mike Pence. With TV cameras rolling, Trump said  a lot of progress has been made  between the two countries and that the pair had  very, very good discussions.  The sanctions target Ukrainian and Russian officials and companies that U.S. authorities accuse of helping Russia tighten its grip on the Crimean peninsula, a part of Ukraine annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move Western leaders denounced as illegal. Poroshenko called Trump, whose first five months in office have been dogged by a controversy over whether his presidential campaign team last year colluded with Russia,  one of the most reliable supporters  and  strategic partners  for Ukraine. In a statement issued after Trump's meeting, the White House said the discussion centered on  support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and President Poroshenko's reform agenda and anti-corruption efforts.  A separate White House statement issued after Pence met with Poroshenko said the vice president highlighted continuing U.S. support for implementing the Minsk agreement, the 2015 accord aimed at ending Russian support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States could back away from that agreement to avoid being  handcuffed  by the policy. Trump did not mention the accord. Before Trump's meeting with Poroshenko, the Treasury Department made its announcement about sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine that were being taken to keep pressure on Moscow to reach a diplomatic solution in Ukraine. A Treasury Department statement said,  U.S. sanctions related to Crimea will not be lifted until Russia ends its occupation of the peninsula.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement   there should be no sanctions relief until Russia meets its obligations under the Minsk agreements.  Lavrov Cites u.s. 'Russophobia' Speaking at a joint news briefing in Moscow with his French counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the new sanctions  regrettable  and said that  Russophobia  in the United States was raging  beyond all bounds.  U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 20, 2017.Jonathan ErnstOn Monday, Russia threatened to shoot down U.S. warplanes over Syria after a U.S. Navy fighter shot down a Syrian warplane. Poroshenko, speaking to reporters after his session with Trump, said he came away pleased with what he called a  full, detailed meeting.  He also held talks with Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.  We received strong support from the U.S. side, support in terms of sovereignty, territorial integrity and the independence of our state,  Poroshenko said. Slideshow (7 Images)At the Pentagon, Mattis noted the  severe casualties  Ukraine has suffered in its conflict with Russian-backed separatists.  The United States stands with you. We support you in the face of threats to sovereignty, to international law or to the international order,  Mattis said.  Poroshenko expressed hope for expanded U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation but did not directly answer a question about whether it was time for the United States to start providing lethal arms to Ukraine. The somewhat neutral body language between Trump and Poroshenko contrasted with chummy photos that emerged from the U.S. president's meeting last month at the White House with Lavrov and the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. Trump has said he wants better relations with Russia, but his goal has been complicated by tensions between the two countries over Syria and by opposition among many of his fellow Republicans in Congress to warmer ties with Moscow. The U.S. Senate passed legislation last week that would impose new measures against Russia and limit Trump's ability to roll back sanctions against that country in the future. In a little more than two weeks, Trump is due to hold his first meeting as president with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Trump has found himself on the defensive politically over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. His former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, previously worked on behalf of the political party of Viktor Yanukovich, the former Kremlin-backed leader of Ukraine.

The largest U.S. city is not allowed to use a project delivery method called  design-build  that other cities around the country - and New York state - have increasingly adopted to save time and money on major infrastructure projects. But city officials and industry firms are making a final push for the power to use this method before the state's legislative session ends on Wednesday. Due to New York's existing statutes, the city must continue using the traditional design-bid-build method, which employs a different party for each stage instead of the more streamlined single entity that collaborates on all aspects of a project from the start under design-build. A bill before lawmakers would allow three New York City agencies, including its Department of Transportation, to deploy design-build for eight specific projects, with provisions for using organized labor.  We will use it to save the taxpayers money, to speed up projects, and to bring innovation,  said New York City DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg in an interview.  We will use it for good purposes just as the state has done and just as almost every city and state across the country is doing.  Trottenberg wants to use design-build for the biggest, most complicated project on her department's roster: a $1.9 billion renovation of a  triple cantilever  section of an old, heavily used expressway, where three tiers of traffic are stacked atop each other as they curve through the borough of Brooklyn over 21 individual bridges. Just a few miles away from the cantilever, on a separate section of the same highway, the state successfully used design-build to construct the first span of a new $555 million Kosciuszko Bridge, which opened on time and on budget in April. Firms that build and finance major New York projects -- including Skanska AB, AECOM, HNTB, Citigroup Inc., RBC Capital Markets and Delta Air Lines Inc. -- sent a letter on Monday to state lawmakers urging them to pass the bill without delay. Lisa Washington, executive director of the Design-Build Institute of America, said New York City is  behind everybody else. It seems unfortunate that everything around these core infrastructure projects is reaping the benefits (of design-build) and New York City ... has been unable to.

In a speech to U.S. manufacturers, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress hoped to complete the job in the autumn, with a new tax system in place by the beginning of 2018. The goal is to get tax legislation to the floor of Congress during the first two weeks of September, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn told technology industry representatives at the White House. Republicans are promising the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, saying a simplified system with tax cuts for individuals and businesses, along with reforms to eliminate taxes on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations, can boost economic growth and create jobs. Independent analysts say there is no evidence that tax cuts drive long-term economic growth. Democrats contend that the Republican tax measures are designed to benefit wealthier Americans.  I am here to tell you we are going to get this done in 2017. Why are we going to get this done in 2017? Because we need to get this done in 2017,  Ryan told a conference hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful Washington lobby group.  This will create jobs. That is what this is all about, jobs, jobs, jobs, good-paying jobs,  he said. The  effort has drawn warnings and criticism from Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Republican moves to grant new tax breaks to the wealthy could jeopardize Democratic support for an increase in the government's borrowing authority later this year. Shortly after Ryan's speech, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's office called his remarks “a poor attempt to distract” from a lack of Republican initiatives on job creation. Top Campaign Pledge The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress face mounting pressure from U.S. businesses and their electoral base to deliver tax reform, a top 2016 campaign pledge that could determine whether Republicans retain control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. It was not clear whether Republicans can overcome infighting over healthcare legislation and government spending to move forward on tax reform. Earlier in the day, Vice President Mike Pence assured the same audience that tax reform would be done this year, in remarks echoed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a CNBC television interview. Ryan and Mnuchin are among six officials trying to craft a tax deal in closed-door discussions with Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican chairmen of two tax committees. “We’re comparing and contrasting various versions of reform to get the best possible one that gives us the lowest possible rates and most internationally competitive tax system, and the best one we can pass,  Ryan told CNBC after his speech. The Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 20 percent while the S&P; 500 has added 14 percent since Trump's election in November, as investors bet he would spark economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending. The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress have agreed that tax reform should eliminate estate and alternative minimum taxes, both levies on the wealthy. They also want to allow U.S. corporations to repatriate trillions of dollars in profits held overseas at a reduced tax rate and eliminate taxes on future foreign profits.

Hamidur Rashid, a Bangladeshi national, was charged with visa fraud, fraud in foreign labor contracting and aggravated identity theft in a criminal complaint unsealed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. Rashid, 50, appeared at a brief court hearing on Tuesday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott, and was released on bail. Christopher Flood, a public defender representing him at the hearing, said Rashid would be hiring another lawyer and declined to comment on the case. Prosecutors said that Rashid, an economist at the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs, initially contracted with the unidentified employee to pay her $420 per week, and submitted that contract to the U.S. State Department to obtain a visa for her. Before the employee entered the United States in January 2013, the complaint said, Rashid had her sign a new contract with a wage of $290 per week. Rashid took away the worker's passport, and told her at various times during her employment that she would go to jail and be sent back to Bangladesh if she worked for anyone else, according to the complaint. At first, Rashid did not pay her at all, but instead sent about $600 per month to her husband in Bangladesh, the complaint said. In October 2013, Rashid did pay the employee $600 and she left late that month, it added. While working for Rashid, prosecutors said, the employee worked far more than 40 hours a week, in violation of her original contract. Rashid is also charged with committing identity theft by setting up a sham bank account in the employee's name to make it appear to the U.N. that he was paying her a lawful wage. In fact, the complaint said, Rashid and his wife controlled the account. United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said the U.N. was aware of Rashid's arrest, and that  all U.N. personnel are expected to honor their private legal obligations, including with respect to engaging foreign domestic workers.

In Washington's strongest language yet on the Gulf dispute, the State Department said the more time goes by,  the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.   At this point, we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar's alleged support for terrorism or were they about the long-simmering grievances between and among the GCC countries,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, referring to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.     The State Department's comments came in contrast to the language taken by U.S. President Donald Trump who has accused Qatar of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are key American allies. The fact the State Department bluntly questioned Riyadh and Abu Dhabi's actions in public suggests Washington was keen for the parties to end the dispute.   We've just said to the parties involved: Let's finish this. Let's get this going,  Nauert said.  Qatar hosts a vital U.S. military base, Al Udeid, to which more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed or assigned and from which more than 100 aircraft operate. The United Arab Emirates, which along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain imposed the measures to isolate Qatar, has said the sanctions could last for years unless Doha accepted demands that the Arab powers plan to reveal in coming days.  The State Department, headed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was encouraging  all sides to de-escalate tensions and engage in constructive dialogue,  Nauert said. A U.S. official said Washington is urging Qatar to take steps to defuse the crisis, including signing on to proposals being drawn up the Treasury Department to strengthen controls against financing of militant groups. But this official and a second U.S. official said it was inaccurate to single Qatar out, and that the Saudis, Emiratis and other Gulf states face similar challenges in countering terrorist financing. Qatar's foreign minister, who is expected to travel to Washington next week, said Doha would not negotiate with its neighbors to resolve the Gulf dispute unless they first lift the trade and travel boycott they imposed two weeks ago. He added that Doha still believed a solution was possible.   Now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started, we are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the public nor to the Qataris the details about the claims that they are making toward Qatar,  Nauert added. There was no immediate comment from Riyadh or Abu Dhabi. Qatar's ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad al-Thani, welcomed the State Department's statement, tweeting:  We are confident in the ability of the U.S. to resolve this crisis . Qatar has denied accusations by its neighbors that it funds terrorism, foments regional instability or has cosied up to their enemy Iran. The first U.S. official said the dispute is driven more by economic rivalries, historical tensions and the personal dynamics of Gulf leaders than by the specific demands the Saudis and Emiratis are making on Qatar. The dispute has opened a rift among some of the main U.S. allies in the Middle East. Since the dispute erupted, Trump has taken a tougher stance against Qatar, while the State Department had sought to remain neutral. Nauert said Tillerson had three phone calls and two in-person meetings with the Saudi foreign minister. Tillerson also spoke by phone three times with Qatar's foreign minister and with the Qatari emir. The UAE's ambassador to the United States said last week a list of demands for Qatar was being compiled and would soon be handed to the United States. He said they would broadly address support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of these countries and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms. The Pentagon has said the boycott was hindering U.S. ability to plan for long-term operations in the region. Al Udeid is where command for the anti-Islamic State air campaign takes place.

Hamidur Rashid, a Bangladeshi national, was charged with visa fraud, fraud in foreign labor contracting and aggravated identity theft in a criminal complaint unsealed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. Rashid, 50, appeared at a brief court hearing on Tuesday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott, and was released on bail. Christopher Flood, a public defender representing him at the hearing, said Rashid would be hiring another lawyer and declined to comment on the case. Prosecutors said that Rashid, an economist at the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs, initially contracted with the unidentified employee to pay her $420 per week, and submitted that contract to the U.S. State Department to obtain a visa for her. Before the employee entered the United States in January 2013, the complaint said, Rashid had her sign a new contract with a wage of $290 per week. Rashid took away the worker's passport, and told her at various times during her employment that she would go to jail and be sent back to Bangladesh if she worked for anyone else, according to the complaint. At first, Rashid did not pay her at all, but instead sent about $600 per month to her husband in Bangladesh, the complaint said. In October 2013, Rashid did pay the employee $600 and she left late that month, it added. While working for Rashid, prosecutors said, the employee worked far more than 40 hours a week, in violation of her original contract. Rashid is also charged with committing identity theft by setting up a sham bank account in the employee's name to make it appear to the U.N. that he was paying her a lawful wage. In fact, the complaint said, Rashid and his wife controlled the account. United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said the U.N. was aware of Rashid's arrest, and that  all U.N. personnel are expected to honour their private legal obligations, including with respect to engaging foreign domestic workers.

U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency's power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the  cramming  of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T; Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a  conspicuous silence  on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short,  gossamer  memo  modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.  Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury's hands for six months. The CFPB's role as a public watchdog  extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,  Pauley wrote.  Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,  he added.  It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.  The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley's decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research.

In Washington's strongest language yet on the Gulf dispute, the State Department said the more time goes by,  the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.   At this point, we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar's alleged support for terrorism or were they about the long-simmering grievances between and among the GCC countries,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, referring to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.     The State Department's comments came in contrast to the language taken by U.S. President Donald Trump who has accused Qatar of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are key American allies. The fact the State Department bluntly questioned Riyadh and Abu Dhabi's actions in public suggests Washington was keen for the parties to end the dispute.   We've just said to the parties involved: Let's finish this. Let's get this going,  Nauert said.  Qatar hosts a vital U.S. military base, Al Udeid, to which more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed or assigned and from which more than 100 aircraft operate. The United Arab Emirates, which along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain imposed the measures to isolate Qatar, has said the sanctions could last for years unless Doha accepted demands that the Arab powers plan to reveal in coming days.  The State Department, headed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was encouraging  all sides to de-escalate tensions and engage in constructive dialogue,  Nauert said. A U.S. official said Washington is urging Qatar to take steps to defuse the crisis, including signing on to proposals being drawn up the Treasury Department to strengthen controls against financing of militant groups. But this official and a second U.S. official said it was inaccurate to single Qatar out, and that the Saudis, Emiratis and other Gulf states face similar challenges in countering terrorist financing. Qatar's foreign minister, who is expected to travel to Washington next week, said Doha would not negotiate with its neighbors to resolve the Gulf dispute unless they first lift the trade and travel boycott they imposed two weeks ago. He added that Doha still believed a solution was possible.   Now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started, we are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the public nor to the Qataris the details about the claims that they are making toward Qatar,  Nauert added. There was no immediate comment from Riyadh or Abu Dhabi. Qatar's ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad al-Thani, welcomed the State Department's statement, tweeting:  We are confident in the ability of the U.S. to resolve this crisis . Qatar has denied accusations by its neighbors that it funds terrorism, foments regional instability or has cosied up to their enemy Iran. The first U.S. official said the dispute is driven more by economic rivalries, historical tensions and the personal dynamics of Gulf leaders than by the specific demands the Saudis and Emiratis are making on Qatar. The dispute has opened a rift among some of the main U.S. allies in the Middle East. Since the dispute erupted, Trump has taken a tougher stance against Qatar, while the State Department had sought to remain neutral. Nauert said Tillerson had three phone calls and two in-person meetings with the Saudi foreign minister. Tillerson also spoke by phone three times with Qatar's foreign minister and with the Qatari emir. The UAE's ambassador to the United States said last week a list of demands for Qatar was being compiled and would soon be handed to the United States. He said they would broadly address support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of these countries and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms. The Pentagon has said the boycott was hindering U.S. ability to plan for long-term operations in the region. Al Udeid is where command for the anti-Islamic State air campaign takes place. Meanwhile, Qatar's attorney general said on Tuesday his country has evidence that the hacking of Qatar's state news agency was linked to countries that have severed ties with Doha.

Cenovus said it would replace Chief Executive Brian Ferguson, who championed an unpopular purchase of western Canadian oil sands assets, but did not name a successor, sending its shares down 8.2 percent to close at C$9.44. Earlier in the session, shares touched a record low of C$9.11. The overall energy group fell 2.2 percent, paring some of its earlier losses, but still hitting its lowest since April 2016.

Footage and photos from demonstrations on Monday showed at least three members of the National Guard - a military unit with public order responsibilities - aiming and firing pistols in clashes on a major Caracas highway.  A 17-year-old demonstrator was shot in the chest and died, while several others were injured.  You cannot keep killing people in the street!  opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa shouted during the early-morning protest in the middle-class El Paraiso zone of Caracas.  Who gave the order to shoot?  asked another lawmaker Jose Olivares as soldiers watched silently from inside their base. Venezuelan authorities said two National Guard members had been detained on Monday for what the interior minister called  presumed improper and disproportionate use of force  when thousands of protesters flooded the streets. And President Nicolas Maduro announced that the general in charge of the National Guard, Antonio Benavides, was being replaced by another military man, Sergio Rivero.  Win peace! That is our aim,  Maduro told Rivero, without giving reasons for the change. Opposition leaders accuse Rivero and other military leaders appointed by Maduro of human rights violations during the recent protests.  Generals and admirals that we denounced before the state prosecutors' office for committing atrocities against Venezuelans are being given honors and promotions,  wrote opposition legislator Gabriela Arellano via Twitter. The Defense Ministry and the Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue. Dummies simulating corpses and a cardboard coffin are seen at the gates of the Venezuelan National Guard headquarters during a protest by opposition lawmakers in Caracas, Venezuela June 20, 2017. Prensa PJ Diputados/Handout via REUTERSAs well as the fatalities, thousands of people have been injured or arrested since Venezuela's opposition began its latest street campaign against Maduro's socialist government in early April. They accuse Hugo Chavez's successor of becoming a dictator and wrecking the once-prosperous OPEC member's economy, demanding a presidential election to end his rule.  Maduro, 54, narrowly won election in 2013 to replace Chavez after his death from cancer, but has seen his approval rating halve to just above 20 percent during four years of an economic crisis causing hunger and shortages. Victims on All Sides Maduro says  terrorists  and  fascists  are leading the protests in an effort to topple him by force as briefly happened to Chavez in 2002. Government supporters, bystanders and some members of the security forces have also been victims of the violence, with gunshot wounds the most common cause. Though thousands turned out on Monday, many grassroots opposition supporters feel intimidated by the daily violence in cities around Venezuela, where masked youths barricade streets and hurl stones and Molotov cocktails against security forces with tear gas and water cannons. Pro-government gangs with guns sometimes join the fray. There is also some exhaustion setting in within protester ranks after 80 days of what the opposition calls  resistance  and the government terms  armed insurrection . Opposition leaders have, however, vowed to step up tactics to increase pressure on Maduro. They are seeking to halt Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, a move they say is rigged to keep him in power. Chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega has been leading dissent against the plan from within government, earning her a barrage of accusations from officials ranging from corruption to insanity and promoting violence. The Supreme Court on Monday accepted a request by a ruling Socialist Party lawmaker to begin the process of taking her to trial for committing  serious offenses.  Before any trial could take place, the Supreme Court would first have to hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether a trial is warranted.

The decision by BC Lietuvos Rytas's president Gedvydas Vainauskas to step down comes days after he said in a filmed interview that a team should not have more than two black players because  that's when bad things start to take place .  He also said the four black players on his team formed  a sort of a gang . He later issued a statement to apologize  if I was improperly understood.  In an effort to clarify his comments, Vainauskas said some foreign players acted irresponsibly in the playoffs and had a negative impact on the team's performance. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) called on FIBA, the sport's governing body, to take action against Vainauskas for comments they said  are as stupid as they are offensive .  Basketball is an institution that unites people around the world and it saddens us to see it tarnished by such racism,  the NBPA said in a statement on Tuesday.  Unfortunately, this serves as a reminder of just how far we still must go in ridding the basketball community, and our society as a whole, of such hateful sentiments.  Euroleague Basketball issued a statement last week saying it  strongly condemns any kind of discriminating comment or act of any kind against race, gender, sexuality or any other human condition  and that disciplinary proceedings had been opened. Vainauskas has since drawn comparisons to Donald Sterling, who infamously lost ownership of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and was banned from the league for life when a recording of him making racially charged comments surfaced three years ago. The NBPA is now calling for a harsh punishment for Vainauskas.  In order to ensure that such bigotry is stamped out, we call upon FIBA to take action so that this kind of hatred and racism is purged from professional basketball,  said the NBPA.  FIBA has been presented with the opportunity to show the world that racial discrimination will not be tolerated within our sport and we truly hope they take full advantage of it.

AT&T; Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure and CenturyLink Inc CEO Glen Post will be among the executives discussing advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, 5G wireless technologies and universal broadband, officials said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump will see  demonstrations of how these technologies will contribute to the 21st century economy and how the government can ensure that their safe adoption leads to the best possible outcomes for the American worker and American businesses.  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, Deputy Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House National Economic Director Gary Cohn and FAA and NASA officials will attend small group meetings before the group meets with Trump at about 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). Venture capital firms and portfolio companies also are expected. Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services that lead to universal access to broadband wireless. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks, the FCC said. Policymakers and mobile phone companies have said the next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely.

In a speech to U.S. manufacturers, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress hoped to complete the job in the autumn, with a new tax system in place by the beginning of 2018. The goal is to get tax legislation to the floor of Congress during the first two weeks of September, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn told technology industry representatives at the White House.    Republicans are promising the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, saying a simplified system with tax cuts for individuals and businesses, along with reforms to eliminate taxes on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations, can boost economic growth and create jobs. Independent analysts say there is no evidence that tax cuts drive long-term economic growth. Democrats contend that the Republican tax measures are designed to benefit wealthier Americans.  I am here to tell you we are going to get this done in 2017. Why are we going to get this done in 2017? Because we need to get this done in 2017,  Ryan told a conference hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful Washington lobby group.  This will create jobs. That is what this is all about, jobs, jobs, jobs, good-paying jobs,  he said. The  effort has drawn warnings and criticism from Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Republican moves to grant new tax breaks to the wealthy could jeopardize Democratic support for an increase in the government's borrowing authority later this year.   Speaker of the House Paul Ryan introduces his new tax policy at the National Association of Manufacturers Summit in Washington, U.S., June 20, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinShortly after Ryan's speech, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's office called his remarks “a poor attempt to distract” from a lack of Republican initiatives on job creation. Top Campaign Pledge The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress face mounting pressure from U.S. businesses and their electoral base to deliver tax reform, a top 2016 campaign pledge that could determine whether Republicans retain control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Slideshow (2 Images)It was not clear whether Republicans can overcome infighting over healthcare legislation and government spending to move forward on tax reform.     Earlier in the day, Vice President Mike Pence assured the same audience that tax reform would be done this year, in remarks echoed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a CNBC television interview.  Ryan and Mnuchin are among six officials trying to craft a tax deal in closed-door discussions with Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican chairmen of two tax committees. “We’re comparing and contrasting various versions of reform to get the best possible one that gives us the lowest possible rates and most internationally competitive tax system, and the best one we can pass,  Ryan told CNBC after his speech.  The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC is up nearly 20 percent while the S&P; 500 .SPX has added 14 percent since Trump's election in November, as investors bet he would spark economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending.  The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress have agreed that tax reform should eliminate estate and alternative minimum taxes, both levies on the wealthy. They also want to allow U.S. corporations to repatriate trillions of dollars in profits held overseas at a reduced tax rate and  eliminate taxes on future foreign profits.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates cut their ties with Doha earlier this month over comments alleged to have been made by the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and posted briefly on the Qatar News Agency's website on May 23 which Doha said had been hacked. The comments quoted Sheikh Tamim as cautioning against confrontation with Iran and defending the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi'ite movement allied with Tehran.  U.S. and European officials have said that while U.S  government agencies and experts were convinced that the news agency and the Qatari government's Twitter feed were hacked, they have not yet determined who did the hacking.  Qatar has evidence that certain iPhones originating from countries laying siege to Qatar were used in the hack,  the Qatari Attorney General Ali Bin Fetais al-Marri told reporters in Doha. Marri said it was too early to explicitly name the countries responsible for the hacking and declined to comment when he was asked if individuals or states were behind it. Arab countries at odds with Qatar accuse it of supporting militant groups and advancing the agenda of their arch-rival Iran in the region - charges Doha calls baseless. Marri also said that a list of individuals and entities designated by the Arab countries as terrorists was  baseless,  adding that Doha would legally pursue those who had done harm to the Gulf Arab state.  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain on June 8 named 59 people, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity, as terrorist.

MSCI decided not to add Argentina to the benchmark index and will consult on adding Saudi Arabia. Nigeria will remain a frontier market, awaiting further review. The full inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks in the widely Tracked MSCI Emerging Markets Index could pull more than $400 billion of funds from asset managers, pension funds and insurers into mainland China's equity markets over the next decade, according to analysts. MSCI’s decision to give so-called Chinese “A” share the green light – after having rejected them for three years – represents a symbolic victory for the Chinese government, which has been working steadily over the past few years to open up its capital markets.  This decision has broad support from international institutional investors with whom MSCI consulted, primarily as a result of the positive impact on the accessibility of the China A market of both the Stock Connect program and the loosening by the local Chinese stock exchanges of pre-approval requirements that can restrict the creation of index-linked investment vehicles globally,  MSCI said in a statement. The company has been in discussions with Chinese regulators and global investors for nearly four years on whether to add yuan-denominated shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen to the benchmark. It had left them out because of concerns over restricted access to China’s equity markets. In March, however, MSCI moved to relax its investment criteria by cutting the number of stocks to 169 from 448 in a bid to address curbs on repatriating capital from China and concerns over the country’s high number of suspended stocks. The revised proposal helped address these issues because the 169 stocks can be easily accessed by foreigners through the “Stock Connect” link launched in 2014 and significantly expanded in December. MSCI said it planned to add 222 stocks – which will have an initial weighting in the index of just 0.73 percent – and will begin a review of the  A  shares and include them in provisional indexes beginning in August.  The initial impact on the composition of regional and global indices will be extremely modest,  said Nick Beecroft, portfolio specialist of Asian equity at T. Rowe Price in Hong Kong.  However, over the long term, assuming further liberalization and regulatory reform of the mainland stock markets, the depth of China’s A-share market could mean China gains substantial weight within those broader indices.  Argentina's delay on reclassification to the emerging markets index came as a surprise to investors. The country's shares will remain in the smaller frontier markets index, where it has been since being reclassified from the emerging index in 2009.  While Argentina was not reclassified as an Emerging Market this year, we believe the country has made significant improvements in opening the country to foreign investments,  said Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X Funds.  Argentina has long met the threshold as an emerging market based on levels of economic development, but historically has closed itself off from global capital markets.  Saudi Arabia in April moved to a more favorable settlement cycle for institutional investors, which had been identified as the last major impediment for official watch-list inclusion. If it were added to the emerging markets index in 2018, Acadian Asset Management estimates the country could end up with a 2 percent to 3 percent weighting or up to 5 percent if it moves forward with plans to float state oil giant Saudi Aramco. Nigeria's shares will remain in the frontier index until at least November 2017, when MSCI will again address the country's access to markets.

Potential Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes, redirecting or withholding some aid to Pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other U.S. officials are skeptical of the prospects for success, arguing that years of previous U.S. efforts to curb Pakistan's support for militant groups have failed, and that already strengthening U.S. ties to India, Pakistan's arch-enemy, undermine chances of a breakthrough with Islamabad.  U.S. officials say generally they seek greater cooperation with Pakistan, not a rupture in ties, once the administration finishes a regional review, due by mid-July, of the strategy guiding the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan.  The discussions include officials from across the Trump administration, including the White House and the Defense Department, both of which declined comment on the review before its completion. Precise actions have yet to be decided. But Pakistan's embassy in Washington warned against  scapegoating  Pakistan to explain the stalemate in Afghanistan, pointing instead to Afghanistan's own troubled internal dynamics. It also noted past Pakistani efforts to battle militants and expressed willingness to work with the United States and Afghanistan on border management.  Singling out Pakistan and pinning the entire blame on Pakistan for the situation in Afghanistan is neither fair nor accurate, nor is it borne out by the ground realities,  said Abid Saeed, press minister at the embassy. A Pakistan Strategy Experts on America's longest war argue that militant safe havens in Pakistan have allowed Taliban-linked insurgents a place to plot deadly strikes in Afghanistan and regroup after ground offensives.  Although long mindful of Pakistan, the Trump administration  in recent weeks has put more emphasis on the relationship with Islamabad in discussions as it hammers out a regional strategy to be presented to Trump, who took office in late January, one official said.  We've never really fully articulated what our strategy towards Pakistan is. The strategy will more clearly say what we want from Pakistan specifically,  the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other U.S. officials question whether any mix of carrots and sticks can get Islamabad to change its behavior. At the end of the day, Washington needs a partner, even if an imperfect one, in nuclear-armed Pakistan, they say. The United States is again poised to deploy thousands more troops in Afghanistan, an acknowledgment that U.S.-backed forces are not winning and Taliban militants are resurgent. Without more pressure on militants within Pakistan who target Afghanistan, experts say additional U.S. troop deployments will fail to meet their ultimate objective: to pressure the Taliban to eventually negotiate peace.  I believe there will be a much harder U.S. line on Pakistan going forward than there has been in the past,  Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan ambassador to the United States, told Reuters, without citing specific measures under review.  Kabul has long been critical of Pakistan's role in Afghanistan.  Pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militants safe haven on its territory. It bristles at U.S. claims that Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, has ties to Haqqani network militants blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan. A senior Pakistani government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, doubted the Trump administration would press too hard, saying:  They don’t want to push Pakistan to abandon their war against terrorism.  Pakistani officials point towards the toll militancy has taken on the country. Since 2003, almost 22,000 civilians and nearly 7,000 Pakistani security forces have been killed as a result of militancy, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, which tracks violence. But the Pentagon, in a report to Congress released on Tuesday, explicitly accused elements of Pakistan's government of supporting Afghanistan-focused militant groups, including the Taliban and Haqqani Network, who it said retained  freedom of action  within Pakistan.  It called Pakistan  the most influential external actor affecting Afghan stability.  U.S. President Donald Trump walks to the White House in Washington, U.S. following his arrival from Camp David June 18, 2017.Eric ThayerIs Pakistan an Ally? Pakistan won the status as a major non-NATO ally in 2004 from the George Bush administration, in what was at the time seen in part as recognition of its importance in the U.S. battle against al Qaeda and Taliban insurgents. The status is mainly symbolic, allowing limited benefits such as giving Pakistan faster access to surplus U.S. military hardware. Yanking the title would be seen by Pakistan as a major blow. Some U.S. officials and experts on the region scoff at the title.  Pakistan is not an ally. It’s not North Korea or Iran. But it’s not an ally,  said Bruce Riedel, a Pakistan expert at the Brookings Institution think tank.  Lisa Curtis, prior to becoming senior director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, co-authored a report with Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's former ambassador to Washington, in which they recommended the Trump administration warn Pakistan the status could be revoked in six months.   Thinking of Pakistan as an ally will continue to create problems for the next administration as it did for the last one,  said the February report, published by the conservative Hudson Institute think tank. It was unclear how seriously the Trump administration was considering the proposal. The growing danger to Afghanistan from suspected Pakistan-based militants was underscored by a devastating May 31 truck bomb that killed more than 80 people and wounded 460 in Kabul.   Afghanistan's main intelligence agency said the attack - one of the deadliest in memory in the Afghan capital - had been carried out by the Haqqani network with assistance from Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Washington believes the strikes appeared to be the work of the Haqqani network, U.S. officials told Reuters. U.S. frustration over the Haqqani's presence in Pakistan has been building for years. The United States designated the Haqqani network as a terrorist organization in 2012. U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, then the top U.S. military officer, told Congress in 2011 that the Haqqani network was a  veritable arm  of the ISI. Any U.S. pivot in its approach would be sharply different than the one taken at the start of the Obama administration, when U.S. officials sought to court Pakistani leaders, including Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani. David Sedney, who served as Obama's deputy assistant secretary of defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia from 2009 to 2013, said the attempt to turn Islamabad into a strategic partner was a  disaster.   It didn't affect Pakistan's behavior one bit. In fact, I would argue it made Pakistan's behavior worse,  Sedney said. More Drones, Cash Cut-Off Pakistan has received more than $33 billion in U.S. assistance since 2002, including more than $14 billion in so-called Coalition Support Funds (CSF), a U.S. Defense Department program to reimburse allies that have incurred costs in supporting counter-insurgency operations. Last year, the Pentagon decided not to pay Pakistan $300 million in CSF funding after then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter declined to sign authorization that Pakistan was taking adequate action against the Haqqani network.      U.S. officials said the Trump administration was discussing withholding at least some assistance to Pakistan. Curtis' report singled out the aid as a target. But U.S. aid cuts could cede even more influence to China, which already has committed nearly $60 billion in investments in Pakistan.  Another option under review is broadening a drone campaign to penetrate deeper into Pakistan to target Haqqani fighters and other militants blamed for attacks in Afghanistan, U.S. officials and a Pakistan expert said.  Now the Americans (will be) saying, you aren't taking out our enemies, so therefore we are taking them out ourselves,  said the Pakistan expert, who declined to be identified. Pakistan's army chief of staff last week criticized  unilateral actions  such as drone strikes as  counterproductive and against (the) spirit of ongoing cooperation and intelligence sharing being diligently undertaken by Pakistan.

Venture capital firms and portfolio companies also are expected. Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services that lead to universal access to broadband wireless. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks, the FCC said. Policymakers and mobile phone companies have said the next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely. They face regulatory hurdles to adding infrastructure to create the system. The 5G networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the  internet of things.  They could improve road traffic by monitoring sensors in streetlights and cars. It could even help detect air pollution using sensors in trees.

U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency's power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the  cramming  of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T; Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a  conspicuous silence  on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short,  gossamer  memo  modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.  Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury's hands for six months. The CFPB's role as a public watchdog  extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,  Pauley wrote.  Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,  he added.  It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.

Brent LCOc1 ended 89 cents lower at $46.02 a barrel, its lowest settlement since Nov. 15, two weeks before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from January.  The U.S. crude futures contract for July CLc1, due to expire later on Tuesday, settled down 97 cents at $43.23, the lowest since Sept. 16.  Oil prices briefly pared losses in post-settlement trade after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. crude stockpiles had dropped more than forecast. Prices then gave up the gains. An official government report is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. Both benchmarks were down more than 15 percent since late May, when OPEC, Russia and other producers extended limits on output until the end of March 2018.  Given the expectation that you'll see higher production levels in several areas of the world, it's going to offset all they're taking off the market,  said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy. OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers' compliance with the deal to cut output reached its highest in May since they agreed on the curbs last year, reaching 106 percent last month, a source familiar with the matter said. OPEC supplies, however, jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the production reduction agreement.  Libya's oil production rose more than 50,000 bpd to 885,000 bpd after the state oil company settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan source told Reuters. Nigerian oil supply is also rising. Exports of Nigeria's Bonny Light crude are set to reach 226,000 bpd in August, up from 164,000 bpd in July, loading programs show.  The increasing August export program in Nigeria and the jump in Libyan oil output should pressure oil prices further in the short term,  said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.  If we get bearish U.S. oil statistics this week, we could see a test of $45 on Brent,  Varga said. Ahead of weekly U.S. inventory reports, U.S. crude oil stocks were forecast to have fallen 2.1 million barrels last week, while gasoline was seen building by 400,000 barrels after last week's data showed an unexpected build that weighed heavily on the market.   Recent data points are not encouraging,  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients.  Identifiable oil inventories - both crude and product in the OECD, China and selected other non-OECD countries - increased at a rate of (about) 1 (million bpd) in Q1.    Hedge fund managers have become very bearish about the outlook for oil prices as production from countries outside OPEC grows and threatens to undermine the effectiveness of OPEC’s output controls. The $1.3 billion Andurand Commodities fund was down 17.33 percent for the year by May 31, according to an HSBC report. Merchant Commodity Fund was down 12.38 percent by June 9, the report said.

In a speech to U.S. manufacturers, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress hoped to complete the job in the autumn, with a new tax system in place by the beginning of 2018. The goal is to get tax legislation to the floor of Congress during the first two weeks of September, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn told technology industry representatives at the White House.    Republicans are promising the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, saying a simplified system with tax cuts for individuals and businesses, along with reforms to eliminate taxes on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations, can boost economic growth and create jobs. Independent analysts say there is no evidence that tax cuts drive long-term economic growth. Democrats contend that the Republican tax measures are designed to benefit wealthier Americans.  I am here to tell you we are going to get this done in 2017. Why are we going to get this done in 2017? Because we need to get this done in 2017,  Ryan told a conference hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful Washington lobby group.  This will create jobs. That is what this is all about, jobs, jobs, jobs, good-paying jobs,  he said. The  effort has drawn warnings and criticism from Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Republican moves to grant new tax breaks to the wealthy could jeopardize Democratic support for an increase in the government's borrowing authority later this year.   Speaker of the House Paul Ryan introduces his new tax policy at the National Association of Manufacturers Summit in Washington, U.S., June 20, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinShortly after Ryan's speech, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's office called his remarks “a poor attempt to distract” from a lack of Republican initiatives on job creation. Top Campaign Pledge The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress face mounting pressure from U.S. businesses and their electoral base to deliver tax reform, a top 2016 campaign pledge that could determine whether Republicans retain control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Slideshow (2 Images)It was not clear whether Republicans can overcome infighting over healthcare legislation and government spending to move forward on tax reform.     Earlier in the day, Vice President Mike Pence assured the same audience that tax reform would be done this year, in remarks echoed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a CNBC television interview.  Ryan and Mnuchin are among six officials trying to craft a tax deal in closed-door discussions with Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican chairmen of two tax committees. “We’re comparing and contrasting various versions of reform to get the best possible one that gives us the lowest possible rates and most internationally competitive tax system, and the best one we can pass,  Ryan told CNBC after his speech.  The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC is up nearly 20 percent while the S&P; 500 .SPX has added 14 percent since Trump's election in November, as investors bet he would spark economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending.  The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress have agreed that tax reform should eliminate estate and alternative minimum taxes, both levies on the wealthy.

Meyer,Hannah James,Keith M. Buckley,Fitch Rates Brighthouse Holding's Preferred Securities 'BBB,(EXP,Credit / Debt Ratings,Life and Health Insurance (TRBC),Americas,Insurance (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),Corporate Events,United States","sector":"","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)' to Brighthouse Holdings, LLC's (BHI) proposed issuance of approximately $50 million of fixed-rate cumulative perpetual preferred securities. Fitch also assigned a Long-Term Issuer Default rating of 'BBB+' to BHI, reflecting the legal transference of Brighthouse Life Insurance, New England Life Insurance Company and Brighthouse Life Insurance of NY under BHI. Fitch previously had an expected rating of 'BBB+(EXP)' on BHI pending the transfer. The expected rating has been set two notches down from BHI's IDR to reflect a standard assumption of  poor  recoveries for preferred securities in a default, with no additional notching for non-performance risk. Fitch views non-performance risk as  minimal.  The lack of any additional notching is due primarily to the immaterial amount of proposed preferred securities relative to debt securities outstanding at upstream holding company Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (BHF), which Fitch believes makes risk of a coupon deferral highly unlikely. BHI will receive no proceeds from the issuance, as the securities are being sold by BHI's current parent, MetLife. KEY RATING DRIVERS Brighthouse's ratings continue to reflect the company's very strong statutory capitalization, significant operating scale, and strong risk-management capabilities. The business that will be contained within Brighthouse represents approximately 25% of MetLife's current total assets, which places Brighthouse as a top-12 U.S. life insurer on a standalone basis. The ratings also consider the company's above-average exposure to market-sensitive variable annuity and universal life with secondary guarantee businesses, which could have a negative impact on risk-based capitalization and earnings in an adverse market scenario. Fitch believes that further seasoning as a stand-alone company while maintaining a strong capitalization profile would ultimately reflect positively on the company's credit profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings assume a generally uneventful execution of Brighthouse's legal separation from MetLife. Significant adverse developments related to the separation could have negative implications for the ratings. In the near term, a significant decline in management's strategic target for statutory capital backing the variable annuity business at separation could lead to a downgrade. Longer-term, Fitch will apply its Prism capital model to Brighthouse when sufficient information becomes available, which is likely to be in 2017. A Prism capital score below 'Strong' could cause Fitch to reassess its view of Brighthouse's capital strength, which supports the rating. Additional downgrade sensitivities include a financial leverage ratio exceeding 28%, or a significant deterioration in profitability. The primary upgrade sensitivity would include establishment of a track record of strong operating performance, risk management and reasonable stability in capitalization following the company's separation from MetLife.

The problem, for many workers here, is one of quality, not quantity. That’s the case with Brandon Seitz. The rail-thin 32-year-old worked for 12 years on an assembly line at one of the local recreational-vehicle factories that have made Elkhart the RV Capital of the World. The job, Seitz says, nearly wrecked his health. His pay, as for assembly workers at most RV factories, was a combination of a low hourly wage and a large production bonus, referred to as the “piece rate.” The frantic rush to meet output targets — and thus earn bonuses — made it easier for accidents to happen, he says. During his first year, he tore tendons in his knee when a steel frame hit him. And then there was the heat. Most RV factories lack air conditioning. “I was constantly sweating,” he says. “There were days in summer when I drank two-and-a-half gallons of water and was still dehydrated.” In 2014, surgeons cut into his back and used a laser to break up and remove a large kidney stone that they said was caused by dehydration. That’s when Seitz vowed never to work on an RV production line again. “The money is good,” he says, but “it’s just so hard on your body.” A manufacturing revival was well under way in Elkhart by the time Trump began promising one during last year’s presidential campaign. During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the local unemployment rate hit 20 percent, among the highest in the country. It has since recovered to a seasonally unadjusted 1.9 percent, its lowest in nearly two decades and far better than the national rate, an adjusted 4.3 percent. The RV industry accounts for a big chunk of that improvement. Local officials estimate that half of jobs here are related to manufacturing and that half of those are linked to RVs. Today, Elkhart County and the surrounding region produce 85 percent of U.S.-made RVs. Unit sales last year were the highest since the 1970s. Judging by such numbers, times are good in Elkhart — not the sort of place to find those white, working-class voters who, feeling forgotten by the political class, helped propel Trump to the presidency. Trump Stronghold Yet, people here voted two-to-one for Trump, more so than even in deeply Republican Indiana as a whole. And a few months into the new administration, despite the investigations into alleged Russian involvement in the election, and despite the president’s failure so far to get much of the agenda he ran on enacted, support for Trump is strong among local workers, including many Reuters interviewed who stayed away from the polls last November. Seitz is one of the more recent converts. He didn’t vote in the November election. He says he wasn’t sure whom to believe. Now, he says, he would probably vote for Trump in the future. “He’s already living up this promise to bring work back from Mexico,” Seitz says. He and many other workers interviewed for this article don’t want more jobs like the ones readily available in Elkhart. They want jobs with steady, predictable pay for the long haul – the kinds of jobs that decades ago helped build and sustain a solid middle class in Elkhart and across the industrial Midwest. And they blame immigration and the forces of globalization for reshaping the work that is available. “I really think (Trump) can make America great again,” says Mary Swihart, 28, who voted for Trump. She works in an RV factory here owned by Thor Industries Inc (THO.N), the nation’s largest RV maker, where she earns about $15 an hour stringing wires into harnesses that go into the vehicles. She especially likes Trump’s pledges to halt illegal immigration and speed up deportations. Like many workers here, she believes that immigrants are willing to work for less than native-born workers and don’t complain as readily about bad conditions. “If we sent them back, it would mean more jobs for legal Americans,” she says. Elkhart County’s population is about 75 percent non-Hispanic white. About 30,000 Hispanics live in the county, according to Census data, forming a small but fast-growing community. Robert Warren, a former Census Bureau demographer who is now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies in New York, has estimated the number illegal immigrants in states and counties across the U.S. By his calculation, about 9,400 illegal immigrants, mostly from Mexico, live in Elkhart County, and of those illegal immigrants who work, 67 percent have some type of factory or production job. Officials at Thor and other local RV makers say they don’t pay immigrants less and don’t hire undocumented workers. “There’s no difference in pay,” says Jeffery Tryka, a Thor spokesman. “Every one of our workers is required to provide documentation that they’re here legally — so they’re all paid the same.” Water for Workers As for the work, Thor and other producers say their plants are safe, despite the hectic pace. “There’s no question it’s a physically demanding job,” Tryka says. Ken Julian, Thor’s vice president of administration and human resources, says the industry is constantly improving the ergonomics of assembly line jobs to make tasks easier and safer for employees of any age. To deal with the heat, he says, they also keep water or other drinks on hand, and “if we see a 100-degree heat index, we’ll shut the plant.” Industry executives say the bonus system is popular with workers, since it allows them to earn more money in less time. Attractive or not, jobs in the RV industry are emblematic of the kind of work that is increasingly the best option for blue-collar workers. The industry is prone to booms and busts, as wells as shorter-term fluctuations throughout the year, which can mean frequent layoffs, though that hasn’t been a problem amid the current production boom. The frenetic pace of piece work means many people stay at the best-paying assembly line jobs only for as long as they can stand it or until their health or stamina falters. When they no longer can, these workers often move into lower-paying jobs. That’s what Seitz did after his kidney-stone surgery. He now works in the service department at Jayco, an RV maker recently acquired by Thor. He figures he puts in about 48 hours a week, compared to the 35 hours he averaged on the assembly lines — and his weekly take-home pay is $500 less. But he much prefers working at his own pace and interacting with customers. His former employer, Forest River Inc, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Workers jump from job to job in search of better conditions or to maximize their earnings before the next downturn. At many RV factories, the annual turnover rate is 100% or higher – meaning a number equal to the total workforce or more is replaced each year. Much of the churn occurs as the companies struggle to fill the same lower-end, entry positions over and over again. Better Times RV workers are among the “anxiously employed,” says Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics in Fort Wayne.  Trump appealed to these workers by saying that “You’re working hard, but you’re still not doing as well as you’d like” and that there was a time in the past when their lives — and the jobs available to them — were better. That message resonated in Elkhart, once home to a more diverse industrial base that provided steady middle-class paychecks. Before it was the RV capital, Elkhart was known as the Band Instrument Capital of the World for the dozens of musical-instrument factories that operated here. Most of that work has moved to China. Elkhart also had a huge pharmaceuticals company. Miles Laboratories Inc invented the diabetic test strip here and once had Elkhart factories churning out everything from Flintstones vitamins to Alka-Seltzer tablets. Germany’s Bayer AG bought Miles in 1978 and eventually moved everything away. All that’s left is a roadside marker honoring the test strip. Stacy Curtis who use to work for Bincent Bach for twenty years making brass trombone slides poses for a portrait at her home in Elkhart, Indiana, U.S. June 13, 2017. Picture taken June 13, 2017.Joshua LottWhat’s happened in Elkhart has occurred across industrial America. The average wage on U.S. factory floors dropped below the average for all private-sector workers in 2006, and the gap has widened since. Manufacturing workers now earn an average of $20.79 an hour, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, below the $22 an hour for all workers. Service workers, meanwhile, pushed ahead of their factory-floor counterparts in 2008 and now earn an average of $21.79 an hour. A 2016 study by the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that a third of production workers in the U.S. earn so little that they qualify for some form of government assistance, such as food stamps. Many of these workers weren’t putting in enough hours to earn more, the study found, but about a third worked at least 35 hours a week. Stacy Curtis says she voted for Trump because she liked what he said about bringing back “good” jobs and for taking a hard line on immigration. Curtis dropped out of school at age 16 to work in a van-customization shop. She later landed a sought-after job at one of the town’s musical-instrument factories. It was a union job, with good pay, and it was prestigious for the skills needed to fashion thin metal into trumpets and trombones. In 2006, workers at Curtis’s factory went out on strike after the company, the Vincent Bach division of Conn-Selmer Inc, demanded changes in work rules that would allow it to pay lower wages to compete with Chinese rivals. The strike ended after three years, when workers severed their links to the United Auto Workers and accepted the company’s offer. Curtis didn’t go back to making trombones. 'You Hardly See Any Whites' As she sought factory jobs in recent years, always at far lower pay, she says she felt at a disadvantage because of her background. “You go look in these factories today and you hardly see any whites or Americans—they’re all Mexicans,” says Curtis, 54. Now unemployed, Curtis has applied for Social Security disability benefits, citing fibromyalgia and lupus. Sour attitudes about immigrants are part of a broader hostility to the forces of globalization that Trump’s campaign tapped into. And in the eyes of some people, comments like Curtis’s reflect a distinctly racial component to the Trump phenomenon in the Elkhart area. Tracy DeGraffreed, 48, is an African-American. He voted for Clinton in November. He has spent most his career in the RV business — many years for suppliers and, since 2015, running his own business as a trucker, towing RVs to dealerships. He says he understands why many of his white neighbors support Trump. “As an African-American, we’ve always been struggling,” he says. “But the Caucasians have always had what they wanted. Now they’re feeling the pain the others have always felt.” Slideshow (12 Images)That “pain,” he says, is the struggle for well-paid, secure jobs that were once relatively plentiful in Elkhart. “That’s why Trump won here.” Voters’ frustration was fueled in the middle of the campaign last year when two manufacturers with deep roots in Elkhart announced they were moving work abroad. CTS Corp, a maker of auto electronics that began here in 1896 as the Chicago Telephone Supply Co, said it was moving all of its Elkhart production abroad to “simplify” operations, cutting 230 jobs here and elsewhere in the U.S. Crown Audio, a subsidiary of Harman International Industries Inc that makes amplifiers, said it was moving 125 production jobs to Mexico and California in order to stay competitive. Over time, moves like that have left the local economy increasingly reliant on RV manufacturing. Each factory is typically dedicated to a handful of models. The result is a proliferation of workplaces. Thor, which had sales last year of $4.6 billion, operates 190 plants, most of them in or around Elkhart. The company’s complex on the outskirts of Goshen, down the road from Elkhart, has 30 separate plants sprawling out in a grid of metal buildings and parking lots. The factory buildings are more like workshops than the high-tech assembly lines used in the auto and other modern industries. The process is similar to home construction; workers hoist walls and install sinks as the RVs inch along while others crawl over, under and inside the vehicles. None of the plants are unionized and never have been. Nearly all of them pay by piece rate — something most other industries have abandoned. Workers receive a low base, about $10 an hour, and earn bonuses for hitting production targets.  At assembly plants that make the most expensive or in-demand models, workers can earn more than $60,000 a year when operations are humming. Less Tiring, Lower Pay Kirsten Southern, a 34-year-old mother of three, was paid by piece rate in successive jobs on RV production lines at two different companies. The work “tears your body down after a while,” she says. “A lot of bad things happen when piece rate comes into play, because you’re trying to rush to get things done,” she says. She was never injured on the job, she says, but she was constantly exhausted. She now works for lower pay as a receiving supervisor at an LCI Industries (LCII.N) plant in Goshen, making sure deliveries are accounted for and moved to the production line when needed. She has a fixed schedule, and she says she’s generally treated better. Had she voted last fall, she says, she would have voted for Trump. “I know Trump is for bringing the jobs back,” she says, “and I agree with that.” Piece rate pay fuels the hectic pace in the factories. That, workers say, has given rise to increased numbers of “speeders,” people who take methamphetamines and other stimulants on the job. Manufacturers say they enforce strict drug-free policies. Thor requires drug tests of job applicants and tests workers after accidents if drug use is suspected, says Julian, the Thor executive. Southern’s employer, LCI, is one of the industry players taking steps to try to make the work more appealing. Nick Fletcher, chief human resources officer, says when he arrived four years ago, turnover at the company was over 100 percent. It’s now less than 40 percent, and he expects it to continue falling. Fletcher has been on a campaign to end the piece rate system, which “doesn’t incentivize workers to be safe or produce high quality,” he says. More than 75 percent of the company’s workers are now on fixed hourly pay, averaging about $17.50, he says. Safety has improved, too. Fletcher points to a chart on his computer screen showing that the number of “recordable incidents” has fallen to 3.84 now from 6.22 in 2013. (Recordable incidents, a measure used by federal safety regulators, is the number of workplace injuries or illnesses that require more than basic first aid multiplied by 200,000 and then divided by number of hours worked.) The improvement is especially notable, Fletcher says, because it happened as LCI added 3,000 workers, for a total of 8,000. For the majority of RV factory workers, though, conditions remain much as they have been for years. Cassidy Davies jumped from one RV job to another earlier in his career, he says, because the atmosphere in many plants was unbearable. “I’ve seen people get into fist fights because somebody else used their power-drill battery,” says the 29-year-old. “And the money is constantly going up and down” as production rises and falls. He now works in a large Thor factory, which he says he likes better than any of the other places he worked. That doesn’t mean he thinks it’s the sort of job on which he can build a career. “I really don’t know how long I can do it,” he says, “because you’re beating the crap out of yourself every day.” Davies says he has never voted. “I don’t like the way Trump talks to people, the way he treats people,” he says. “But I do agree with some of the things he’s doing,” including Trump’s talk of bringing back good manufacturing jobs.

The incident closely followed Sunday's U.S. downing of a  piloted Syrian army jet in the southern Raqqa countryside after it dropped bombs near U.S.-backed forces. That was a rarity in modern warfare, representing the first time the U.S. Air Force had downed a manned jet since 1999. In the latest incident, the Pentagon said a U.S. F-15 aircraft flying over Syrian territory fired on the drone after it displayed hostile intent and advanced on coalition forces. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said it had  dirty wings,  meaning it was armed.  I can tell you it was an Iranian-made drone,  Davis said, declining to speculate on who specifically was operating it. A Western intelligence source said it was  unquestionably Iranian .  Related CoverageU.N. chief hopes U.S., Russia calm tensions over Syria They are testing the limits,  the source told Reuters without elaborating. The area falls in a part of Syria that was recently identified as a military priority by Damascus, and is seen as strategically important for Iran as it seeks to secure a land corridor between forces it backs in Syria and Iraq.      The U.S.-led coalition said the location was close to where another  pro-regime  drone, which intelligence sources had also identified as Iranian, was shot down on June 8 after dropping bombs near coalition forces. In an indirect reference to Iranian-backed forces that have been gathering in the eastern desert region, a U.S.-led coalition statement cited a recent escalation of tensions and said it would not  tolerate any hostile intent and action of pro-regime forces . Russian Warning  Russia, like Iran an ally of President Bashar al-Assad, issued a warning of its own to the United States in response to the downing of the Syrian jet, saying on Monday it would view as targets any planes flying west of the Euphrates River, though it stopped short of saying it would shoot any down. Still, the Pentagon said it had not seen hostile action by Moscow.  Public statements aside, we have not seen the Russians do any actions that cause us concern. We continue to operate, making some adjustments for prudent measures,  Davis said. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Russian militaries swapped accusations about an unsafe intercept involving a U.S. spy plane and a Russian fighter jet over the Baltic Sea. In Syria's tangled conflict, Washington backs a coalition of rebel forces fighting both President Bashar al-Assad and Islamist militants, while Assad is backed by Russia, Iran and Shi'ite militia. The U.S. military has repeatedly warned forces fighting on  Assad's side to stay away from a  deconfliction zone , agreed with Russia, near a garrison used by U.S. special forces and U.S.-backed militia around Al Tanf. On several occasions in recent weeks, warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have also struck pro-government forces to prevent them advancing from the Al Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria at a spot where the country's borders join Iraq and Jordan. Washington also described those strikes as self-defense. The competition between the Syrian army and the militias and U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels has stepped up in the Badia desert that stretches to the Iraqi border after Islamic State abandoned large swathes of territory as it defends Raqqa and Deir Zor. The Syrian army has been able to make rapid advances allowing them to reach the border for the first time in years.

In a series of floor motions, inquiries and lengthy speeches, Democrats criticized the closed-door meetings that Republicans have been holding to craft a replacement for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. They called for open committee hearings and more time to consider the bill before a Senate vote, which Republicans say could come in the next two weeks, although a draft bill has yet to emerge publicly. Lacking the votes to derail or change the Republican process, the maneuvers by the Democratic minority seemed more aimed at highlighting Republican efforts on a controversial issue. Polls have said that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Obamacare replacement that has passed the House of Representatives and that Senate Republicans are now considering. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that the closed-door Republican meetings on healthcare amounted to  the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen.   Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,  Schumer charged. The resulting legislation would likely throw millions out of health insurance, he said, while granting  a big fat tax break for the wealthiest among us.  Senators are not obligated to hold meetings in the open, but Democrats pointed out that there were lengthy committee meetings and many days of floor debate on Obamacare before it passed in 2010. Several Democrats moved for the healthcare legislation to be referred to Senate committees for hearings, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused. McConnell said all Republican senators have been involved to some degree in healthcare meetings and that Democrats would have a chance to amend the legislation they produce, once it is brought to the Senate floor.  We're going to have a meeting on the Senate floor, all hundred of us, with an unlimited amendment process,  McConnell said.  So there will be no failure of opportunity.  Senate Republican leaders would like a vote on healthcare legislation in July, before the July 4 recess if possible. But Republicans have struggled to coalesce around a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions. Senate Republicans also face pressure from the right. In the House, conservatives have written to McConnell to express concern about reports that say the Senate may water down the House bill.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-senate-idUSL1N1JH1XV"},

Aid workers are unable to vaccinate the population in and around Raqqa, a city held by Islamic State militants and a target of U.S.-led airstrikes.  The WHO reported two polio cases in an area of Syria partly held by Islamic State earlier this month, the first re-emergence of the virus in Syria since 2014 and a blow for hopes of eradicating the disease globally. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a U.N. briefing on Tuesday that 14 more cases had been found in the same area, the Mayadin district of Deir al-Zor province, and another had come from Raqqa, a city where Islamic State fighters are trying to resist a U.S.-backed assault. Tensions escalated on Sunday as the U.S. military brought down a jet near Raqqa for bombing near U.S.-allied forces on the ground, and Iran launched missiles at Islamic State targets in eastern Syria - the first time each state has carried out such actions in the multi-sided Syrian war. “We are very worried, because obviously if there is already one case of polio of a kid that is paralyzed it’s already an outbreak. We know for example that for one kid that is paralyzed there are almost 200 asymptomatic so it means that virus circulating, so it is very serious,  Jasarevic said. He said the WHO was doing a health assessment to ascertain whether the virus was circulating in Raqqa or if the polio sufferer had simply traveled there and caught the virus elsewhere. The 17 children who have been paralyzed so far first reported symptoms between March 3 and May 23, and confirming the presence of the virus takes 6-8 weeks, meaning the outbreak could grow before its extent is known. WHO plans to vaccinate 320,000 children under the age of five in Deir al-Zor and 90,000 in Mayadin, Jasarevic said.

Republicans insisted it was a procedural, not a policy, matter, noting that the Russia amendment to the Iran bill was 100 pages long and passed in the Senate only last week.  I strongly support sanctions against Iran and Russia to hold them accountable,  Brady said. Brady said House leaders were working with the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committee to determine how to proceed, but the Senate could address the issue by quickly updating the bill and sending it back to the House. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a majority of 52 seats in the 100-member Senate, and a more commanding 238- to 193-seat margin in the House. Brady could not predict when the House might vote,  including whether it would be before Congress' summer recess starts at the end of July. Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, said the committee is reviewing the bill.

Yes, it would, two new studies show. Parents in suburbia are comfortable having their children's doctors ask if having enough food is a concern, researchers found. And suburban doctors don't mind asking the questions and connecting families with assistance when needed.  What we found is that parents were really okay with this,  said Dr. Deepak Palakshappa, a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a researcher in its PolicyLab. In 2015, about 16 percent of U.S. households with children were food insecure, Palakshappa's team reports. What that means is that parents feel unable to provide enough food for themselves or their children, said Palakshappa, who led both studies. Children who grow up in those homes are more likely to have poor health, chronic medical issues and psychological issues, the researchers write. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in 2015 that pediatricians screen for and help solve food insecurity. In 2015 and 2016, the researchers had healthcare providers at six doctors' offices in suburban Philadelphia screen for food insecurity when parents brought children for their 2-month, 15-month and 36-month check-ups.  Altogether, the parents of 5,645 children were asked two questions: Had they ever run out of food for their family in the past year and had they ever worried about running out of food. About 77 percent of the families were successfully screened. About 3 percent answered yes to one of the two questions. With their permission, those families were connected with a nonprofit organization that helps people apply for government food assistance programs. In one of the two studies - both of which were published in Pediatrics - the researchers conducted 23 interviews with parents who were screened. Many of them said they were initially surprised,  because they just don’t think this is part of routine care,  Palakshappa told Reuters Health.  Ultimately they feel comfortable talking to their pediatrician and clinician about it.  In the second study, when researchers surveyed the healthcare providers, they found the providers didn't mind asking the two questions. Some were concerned parents would react negatively, but in fact, families were appreciative that the healthcare providers cared to ask about the issue.  Families really do feel comfortable talking about these issues with their pediatricians,  said Palakshappa.  This is one way to deal with families struggling to have enough food at home.

A Reuters correspondent at the scene an hour after the incident - in which police said the man set off a small explosion - said the area was quiet, with police manning a cordon and a few bystanders calmly watching security forces. Amid conflicting accounts of what happened, it was still unclear if the man had died. Paul de Vries, a Dutchman working in Brussels, told Reuters he saw police taking away a prisoner. Nicolas Van Herrewegen, a station employee, told public broadcaster RTBF that he saw a man shouting in a lower level of the 1930s station, which serves lines running under the city centre. He then appeared to yell  Allahu Akbar  in Arabic and to detonate something on a luggage trolley. People standing within three metres of the trolley were unhurt, Herrewegen said. Authorities were investigating whether it was a terrorist incident, a spokesman for the national Crisis Centre said. The national alert level was maintained at its second highest level. The Belgian capital, home to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, has been on high alert since a Brussels-based Islamic State cell launched an attack that killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015. Associates of those attackers, four months later, killed 32 people in their home city, including with bombs loaded on trolleys at Brussels Airport. Combat troops have been a fixture at transport hubs and in the main public areas ever since the Paris attacks. A series of further attacks in neighbouring France and Germany in the past year, as well as recent bloodshed in London and Manchester, have added to anxiety. Tourists Evacuated Stationmaster Jean-Michel Michel was quoted by DH newspaper saying:  We heard the explosion. My colleague thought it was a bomb. The explosion was on the mezzanine level. The man went down to platforms 3 and 4. He said 'Allahu Akbar'...  I would put him at about 35 years old.  The station and adjacent historic downtown area, including the baroque Grand Place city square, had been packed with tourists and locals on a hot summer evening before they were evacuated. The police spokesman said:  There was an incident at Central Station. There was an explosion around a person. That person was neutralised by the soldiers that were on the scene.  At the moment, the police are in numbers at the station and everything is under control.  Prime Minister Charles Michel and the interior minister were in the national crisis centre monitoring developments.

The vast, arid region has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups - some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State - that European nations, particularly France, fear could threaten Europe if left unchecked. Last year, the Sahel nations - Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania - proposed establishing special units, each of around 100 well-trained soldiers, which would be deployed in areas where jihadist groups are known to operate. The United States did not believe a resolution was warranted and did not want the world body to help fund it, diplomats said. The United States is one of five council veto powers, along with France, Britain, Russia and China. French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters on Tuesday he was confident of  strong support  among the 15-member U.N. council after two weeks of negotiation on the French draft text, which he described as having reached a  successful conclusion.   The text that we have we believe is strong in itself and also stronger in terms of the political support it will bring to the force,  Delattre said. Instead of authorizing the force to  use all necessary means  to carry out its operations, the draft resolution now  welcomes the deployment,  according to a copy seen by Reuters.  It no longer asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report back on options for U.N. support for the force and instead notes that the West African states are responsible for ensuring the troops have adequate resources. The draft resolution also encourages countries to also provide support. The European Union has already committed $56 million to the Sahel force. The United States is trying to cut the cost of U.N. peacekeeping and is reviewing each of the 16 missions as they come up for Security Council renewal. Washington is the largest contributor, paying 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget. Special units proposed by the five Sahel nations would complement the efforts of regular armed forces, a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali and France's Operation Barkhane, which has around 4,000 troops deployed across the region. France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali a year earlier. However, militants continue to attack in Mali and its neighbors.

The labor law proposal in Brazil, rejected in the social affairs committee by 10 to 9 votes, now moves to the constitutional and justice committee before its heads to the floor for a full vote.     The Brazilian real weakened as much as 1.7 percent to a one-month low to 3.34 to the dollar before recovering, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index dropped 2.01 percent.     Five-year Brazilian credit default swaps reached 242 basis points, the highest since May 22.     Traders feared a political scandal may have driven some lawmakers to reconsider their support for other reforms, including a proposal to cut pension spending seen as critical to balancing the government budget.     The news drove investors away from Brazilian assets, adding to falling prices of commodities from iron ore to crude that weighed on assets from wider emerging markets earlier on Tuesday.     News of increased supply by several key oil producers hammered crude futures to a seven-month low, reflecting unsuccessful attempts by OPEC and others to support prices by cutting output.     That had the Colombian peso slipping 0.97 percent to its weakest in a year. The Mexican peso was down 1.3 percent.     Shares of oil companies tumbled, weighing on stock markets in the region. Declining shares of Brazilian state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA subtracted the most points from the Bovespa index. Shares of Colombia's Ecopetrol dropped 2.9 percent.     Brazilian miner Vale SA also fell as concerns over Chinese demand for steel and global oversupply dragged iron ore futures lower.

Barbie's longtime boyfriend Ken is getting a makeover with new hair styles, a range of body types, a hip wardrobe and skin tones for every ethnicity. Toymaker Mattel on Tuesday announced 15 new Ken dolls, featuring seven skin tones, nine hairstyles and three body styles including a more muscular  broad  physique.   The move follows the introduction in 2016 of three new bodies - petite, tall and curvy - for Barbie that California-based Mattel said reflected a changing world. Ken, Barbie's faithful boyfriend of 56 years, is now catching up.  We are redefining what a Barbie or Ken doll looks like to this generation,” Lisa McKnight, senior vice president and general manager for Barbie, said in a statement. She said the variety of Ken dolls would allow girls to  further personalize the role they want him to play in Barbie’s world.  Ken was invented in 1961 as Barbie's buff, blue-eyed friend and has undergone many iterations including the first African-American Ken in 1981 and Earring Magic Ken in 1993, which became a big seller among gay men. In 2004, his romance with Barbie was deemed over by Mattel, but the toymaker officially reunited them on Valentine's Day in 2011. The launch of the new Ken range follows declining sales of Barbie dolls around the world as girls increasingly turn to other dolls and electronic toys. Mattel in April reported that Barbie sales declined 13 percent in the first quarter of 2017 when it also reported a much bigger than expected quarterly loss and cut its full-year sales growth forecast. All 15 Ken dolls will be in toy stores later this year.     Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-life-kendoll-idUSKBN19B2YH"},

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates cut their ties with Doha earlier this month over comments alleged to have been made by the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and posted briefly on the Qatar News Agency's website on May 23 which Doha said had been hacked. The comments quoted Sheikh Tamim as cautioning against confrontation with Iran and defending the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi'ite movement allied with Tehran.  U.S. and European officials have said that while U.S  government agencies and experts were convinced that the news agency and the Qatari government's Twitter feed were hacked, they have not yet determined who did the hacking.  Qatar has evidence that certain iPhones originating from countries laying siege to Qatar were used in the hack,  the Qatari Attorney General Ali Bin Fetais al-Marri told reporters in Doha. Marri said it was too early to explicitly name the countries responsible for the hacking and declined to comment when he was asked if individuals or states were behind it. Arab countries at odds with Qatar accuse it of supporting militant groups and advancing the agenda of their arch-rival Iran in the region - charges Doha calls baseless. Marri also said that a list of individuals and entities designated by the Arab countries as terrorists was  baseless,  adding that Doha would legally pursue those who had done harm to the Gulf Arab state.  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain on June 8 named 59 people, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity, as terrorist.

The loonie had surged as much as 2.5 percent since the release of stronger-than-expected jobs data earlier this month. Most of those gains came after the Bank of Canada signaled last week that higher interest rates lie ahead. On Wednesday, the currency touched its strongest point in 3-1/2 months at C$1.3165.                   I think the combination of market fatigue as well as oil  helped stall the Canadian dollar's gains, said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.         Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell on news of boosted supply by several key producers. U.S. crude oil futures        settled 2.2 percent lower at $43.23 a barrel, its lowest since September.               At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3264 to the greenback, or 75.39 U.S. cents, down 0.3 percent. It traded in a range of C$1.3205 to C$1.3285.         The loonie has benefited this month from short-covering after bearish bets on the currency reached a record high in May.                    To get people to keep buying it (the currency) you got to have an outright positive story that gets them long, and it's a little hard to spin that with oil at $43 a barrel, Anderson said.     Canadian wholesale trade rose 1.0 percent in April from March, led by higher sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. Analysts had forecast a 0.5 percent increase.                  The data adds to positive signs for the Canadian economy in the second quarter, said Nick Exarhos, economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a research note.            Chances of a Bank of Canada interest rate hike as early as next month have climbed to one-in-three, from nearly zero earlier this month, while a rate hike has been fully priced in by December, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                Canadian government bond prices were higher across a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            rose 5 Canadian cents to yield 0.916 percent and the 10-year             climbed 34 Canadian cents to yield 1.504 percent.     The 2-year yield fell 1.1 basis points further below its U.S. equivalent to a spread of -43.2 basis points. On Monday it touched its smallest gap in nearly four months at -42.1 basis points.

Hawkish comments from the bank's two top policymakers last week sent the Canadian dollar up 1.7 percent over two days, its best two-day run in a year, as markets recalibrated the risk that rate increases could be coming sooner than had been expected. The Canadian dollar has since declined slightly though it is still stronger than it was before a speech by a senior Bank of Canada official last Monday.  Some analysts said the bank began moving away from its dovish stance with policy statements in April and May that forecast the closing of the output gap would happen sooner and described recent economic data as  encouraging.   Governor Stephen Poloz in April characterized the bank's stance as  decidedly neutral.  That represented a significant shift in tone that markets did not fully grasp, which may have frustrated the central bank, said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management.  The Bank of Canada may be trying to correct the long impression of them as ongoingly dovish as opposed to shifting to a new tone,  Donald said of policymakers' recent remarks. The apparent gap in understanding between the central bank and markets illustrates the balancing act policymakers face in preparing the market for eventual tightening without boxing themselves into a corner as the economy faces a number of risks that could postpone a hike, particularly uncertain U.S. trade policy. In a speech last Monday, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the bank will assess whether the rate cuts it put in place in 2015 during the oil price shock are still needed. That was followed the next day by Poloz saying those cuts have largely done their work. A spokeswoman for the Bank of Canada said the bank could not comment further. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz looks at a display during a media preview of the new Bank of Canada Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, June 20, 2017.Chris WattieThe bank was likely aware that many economists were not forecasting rate hikes until 2018 and felt  we have to put them back on track, there's something they don't understand,  said Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Larentian Bank Securities. Markets are now fully pricing in a rate hike by the end of 2017, with a 33.5 percent chance of a hike at the bank's next meeting in July.  Slideshow (3 Images)While the U.S. Federal Reserve used forward guidance to ease the way for markets ahead of its first rate hike in nearly a decade in 2015, markets should be prepared for little in the way of explicit guidance from Poloz, who dropped the practice in 2014.  The Bank of Canada has wisely preserved its flexibility while putting the market on notice,  said Adam Button, currency analyst at ForexLive. Although that will likely mean more volatility in the Canadian dollar in the short run, it is preferable to having markets get too far ahead of the central bank, analysts said.  Seeing the market go where you're going but getting there before you do, that's not the ideal thing for a central banker,  said Fred Demers, chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities.  You don't want to feel like you're tied.  Analysts also chalked up the change in tone to Poloz's willingness to surprise markets if need be, as the bank did with its first unexpected rate cut in 2015.

Healthcare .SPXHC was the brightest spot in stocks with a 0.3 percent rise while the consumer discretionary .SPLRCD index showed a 1.25 percent drop in line with the energy index .SPNY decline. Oil prices fell about 2 percent after news of increases in supply by several key producers, a trend that has undermined attempts by OPEC and other producers to support the market through reduced output.  People really thought $45 to $55 was kind of the range of oil, but it is getting weaker and weaker and U.S. producers are getting more and more efficient,  said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. The market deepened its losses heading into the close after comments by Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan appeared to add to investor unease about the Fed's projected pace of monetary policy tightening. Kaplan said technology and globalization is holding down U.S. inflation, which suggested that low inflation might linger, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Today's action reflects growing investor concern about the Fed's designated path of tightening versus what the market is saying, exemplified in the fed funds futures market and the lower yield and the lower inflation reports,  said Hellwig. Earlier, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making.

The ceremony will take place in the European Parliament, the parliament said in a joint announcement on Tuesday with the executive European Commission and the European Council, which represents the 28 national governments of the EU. Kohl, who died aged 87, was Germany's longest-serving post-war chancellor, serving from 1982 to 1998. The architect of Germany's 1990 reunification, he was also a driving force behind the introduction of the euro currency. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would speak at the Strasbourg ceremony along with French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and former U.S. president Bill Clinton. After the ceremony, a funeral service will be held in Speyer Cathedral in western Germany, near Kohl's former home in Ludwigshafen. The office of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that at the request of Kohl's widow, his second wife, Maike Kohl-Richter, there would be no further state ceremony in Germany. Kohl, along with former European Commission chief Jacques Delors and Jean Monnet, founding father of the European project, are the only three people the EU has made Honorary Citizens of Europe, an honor bestowed for extraordinary work to promote European cooperation.

His comments chimed with remarks from German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said last month that Europe could no longer completely rely on its allies, pointing to bruising meetings of the G7 wealthy nations and NATO that were also attended by U.S. President Donald Trump. Germany holds the presidency of the G20 leading economies, a platform Merkel wants to use to safeguard cooperation, now strained by Trump's decision to pull out of a landmark climate protection agreement.  We have to improve our cooperation, we have to rely on our mutual trust,  Schaeuble said at a ceremony where he was awarded the Henry A. Kissinger Prize by the former U.S. secretary of state personally. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, June 14, 2017.Hannibal Hanschke We need to stick to our values, we need to be more convincing,  said Schaeuble, a veteran member of Merkel's ruling conservatives.  Schaeuble said the major problems in the world such as climate change, international terrorism and migration flows could only be solved when countries worked closely together.  If the United States is starting to take a skeptical view of its role as the guardian of global order – and we've already seen hints of this in recent years – then I would see this as a call to action directed at Europe, including Germany,  he said. Schaeuble said he doubted whether the United States truly believed the world order would be equally sound if China and Russia were to fill the gaps it left and if Beijing and Moscow were given a free hand to dominate their spheres of influence.  That would be the end of our liberal world order. This order is still the best of all possible worlds, for ethical, political and economic reasons. And we want this order to keep moving forward, or at least not see it weakened,  he said.

Slideshow (5 Images) We were very moved that this many Nazi objects were in Argentina,  said Bullrich.  We are happy to be able to say that they are no longer circulating through sales or among collectors.  Police and Interpol said they discovered the hidden cache behind a bookshelf and down a secret passageway. The roughly 75 artifacts included boxes, daggers and other objects bearing swastikas and depictions of Hitler, as well as devices intended to measure physical characteristics such as head shape. Nazism was based on the ideology that people designated as having Aryan traits were superior to other races. In the 1940s, millions of Jews were murdered by the state in Hitler's Nazi Germany, a genocide known as the Holocaust, along with others denoted as inferior. After the fall of the Third Reich at the end of World War Two, a number of high-ranking Nazi officials fled to South America. They included notorious figures such as Adolf Eichmann, one of the architects of the Holocaust, who was captured by Israeli intelligence agents in Buenos Aires in 1960 and later executed. The infamous doctor Josef Mengele, who carried out genetic research on humans, also lived for some years in the city. Authorities, who have not revealed the identity of the collector, said they were working with historians to trace the objects and identify how and when they likely entered Argentina.

Thirteen of the country's 14 armed groups along with representatives from the government signed Monday's accord in Rome. The deal, brokered by the Roman Catholic Sant' Egidio peace group, called for an immediate ceasefire. But clashes between former Seleka members and anti-balaka fighters erupted early in the morning in the town of Bria, around 580 km (360 miles) northeast of the capital Bangui.

There are also fires and looting of houses taking place,  said one aid worker present in the town, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.

The presence of rival factions in Bria has made the town a regular flashpoint, including during fighting that killed around 300 people and displaced 100,000 last month. Tuesday's clashes broke out near a camp housing people who had been forced to flee previous bouts of violence, according to the country's U.N. peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA.  We regret the presence of armed elements in IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) camps, which causes problems not just in Bria but also in other locations. It's a reality,  said MINUSCA spokesman Vladimir Monteiro.  Monday's peace deal is only the latest in a series of agreements aimed at putting an end to the conflict in Central African Republic, which has in recent months witnessed some of the worst bloodshed in years. The office of President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who was elected last year, applauded on Tuesday what it said was  an historic accord . However, other reactions in the capital Bangui were less optimistic.  (This accord) simply follows the same scenario repeated over and over,  said Joseph Bindoumi, president of the Central African League of Human Rights.  Those who signed are mocking the people.

The Portuguese manager owes Spanish tax authorities 3.3 million euros ($3.7 million), a Madrid prosecutor said in a statement, adding it had presented a claim to a local court.  Mourinho left Real Madrid in 2013 to manage English club Chelsea for a second spell before signing with United in 2016.  Prosecutors said he had failed to declare revenues from his image rights in his Spanish income tax declarations from 2011 and 2012,  with the aim of obtaining illicit profits .  They said Mourinho had already settled a previous claim relating to his Spanish taxes after a 2014 inquiry, which resulted in a penalty of 1.15 million euros. But tax authorities later found that some of the information presented in that settlement was incorrect, the prosecutors said.  Mourinho's agents at Portugal-based Gestifute said in a statement that the coach had not received any notification relating to the allegations from tax authorities or prosecutors.  They added that Mourinho had already dealt with questions raised by tax authorities in 2015, settling issues with his 2011 and 2012 filings and reaching a settlement regarding 2013.

Known as  the Special One , Mourinho, 54, is one of the most prominent and successful coaches in soccer today. In the season just ended, he won three trophies in his debut campaign at Manchester United, although he drew criticism after a poor league performance in which United finished sixth in the Premier League.

He has claimed a haul of domestic trophies with Chelsea and other clubs. The claims against Mourinho come amid a lengthening list of tax fraud cases involving soccer stars in Spain.  Real Madrid player Cristiano Ronaldo has been called to testify on July 31 in Madrid on allegations that he hid income from tax authorities between 2011 and 2014, the court said on Tuesday. Real Madrid did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations against Mourihno or Ronaldo's hearing.

Oil fell about 2 percent, with Brent settling at seven-month lows and U.S. crude at its cheapest since September, after increased supply from several key producers overshadowed high compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output. That slide weighed down energy stocks on Wall Street and in Europe. The S&P; energy index dropped 1.3 percent as the worst performing of the 11 major S&P; sectors and Europe's oil and gas sector slumped 2.2 percent.  People really thought $45 to $55 was kind of the range of oil, but it is getting weaker and weaker and U.S. producers are getting more and more efficient,  said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York  So if that is the case, they are going to keep pumping.  U.S. crude settled down 2.2 percent at $43.23 per barrel and Brent settled 1.9 percent lower at $46.02. The drop put U.S. crude in a bear market, traditionally defined as a drop of more than 20 percent from a recent high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 61.85 points, or 0.29 percent, to 21,467.14, the S&P; 500 lost 16.43 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,437.03 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 50.98 points, or 0.82 percent, to 6,188.03. The Dow and benchmark S&P; 500 hit fresh records on Monday, buoyed by a rebound in the tech sector. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.66 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.69 percent. The U.S. dollar strengthened for a second day, hitting a one-month high of 97.871 against a basket of major currencies as Federal Reserve officials maintained a hawkish tone on hiking interest rates. On Monday, New York Fed President William Dudley said halting the rate-hiking cycle now would imperil the economy. That was followed by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said on Tuesday the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks. In addition, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said he was increasingly concerned that a recent softness in inflation is a sign the Fed will struggle to get price pressures back to its 2 percent objective. Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said the Fed needs to be careful about raising U.S. interest rates further due to low rates on 10-year Treasuries. The dollar index rose 0.24 percent, with the euro down 0.2 percent to $1.1126. The greenback is up nearly 1 percent for the month. Sterling was last trading at $1.2624, down 0.85 percent on the day. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney doused speculation that he might soon back higher interest rates, telling bankers on Tuesday that he first wanted to see how the economy coped with Brexit talks in coming months. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.1565 percent, down from 2.188 percent late on Monday.

The float was the opening salvo in a $12 billion three-year International Monetary Fund lending program tied to reforms such as raising taxes and hiking energy subsidies. The higher monthly food subsidy allowance will come into effect starting July 1, an official at the supply ministry told Reuters.  The measure will increase Egypt's food subsidy bill for the 2017-18 fiscal year beginning in July to 85 billion Egyptian pounds from the 45 billion allocated this year, state news MENA reported. About 70 million Egyptians hold subsidy cards that allow them to purchase a range of staple goods like sugar, cooking oil and rice at outlets around the country.

{"news_time":"2017-06-20 16:01:00","news_title":"Back to basics: vital elements of an adviser gift policy","keywords":"Jason WallaceNEW,BC,FINREG,ADVISER,GIFT,POLICY","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - For investment advisers giving and receiving client gifts is a rather ordinary practice, but one that can greatly increase regulatory risk. Advisers frequently offer clients gifts of appreciation, often during the holidays and an advisory client may reciprocate. However, gift giving, no matter the value or recipient, must be free of conflicts of interest, favoritism and lack any future obligation of the client or advisory representative. To meet these standards, a firm must employ a well-defined plan or policy that includes the definition of a gift, sets monetary limits, a clear approval process and educates it advisory representatives. Gifts There are no specific rules governing gifts as they relate to advisory firms; the practice of giving and receiving gifts is most often regulated by reference to the anti-fraud provision of the Investment Adviser’s Act and the fiduciary duties an adviser owes to its clients.  Therefore, investment advisers should not offer gifts, entertainment or other items of material value that could be seen as extravagant or aimed at influencing decision-making or making a client feel obligated to the firm or that individual. Similarly, adviser representatives should not accept inappropriate gifts, entertainment, special accommodations, or other things of material value that could influence their decision-making or make them feel obligated to a client or service provider. Regulatory Guidance The most recent guidance came out in 2015; the Securities and Exchange Commission released guidance that highlighted the conflicts of interest that arise when personnel of a fund’s investment adviser are offered gifts or entertainment in the conduct of doing business. The guidance suggests that policies and procedures concerning the receipt of gifts or entertainment should be included in the fund’s compliance policies and procedures. It defers to the fund to determine whether there should be an outright ban, or a type of pre-clearance to determine if the gifts or entertainment would violate sections of the Investment Company Act. The SEC guidance was geared toward investment advisers of registered investment companies (i.e. mutual funds); however the basic issues and SEC recommendations are equally applicable to advisers of all types of clients, specifically those governed by the Investment Advisers Act.  Policy A firm without a gifts policy or one that omits critical items opens the firm to regulatory enforcement. Advisory firms will most likely be asked to produce a gift log during an SEC routine audit and questioned about any disparities from the written policies and procedures.  Keep in mind, if a firm prohibits the giving or receipt of gifts, it should supervise that prohibition and be sure it is being followed. A typical investment adviser gifts policy may include: • A definition of what constitutes a gift and entertainment. Usually a gift is a tangible object like a bottle of wine, an iPod or a set of golf clubs, though it can be tickets to a sporting event or even discounts on products and services unavailable to the general public. In general, entertainment would include meals, conferences and sponsored outings. Entertainment is often distinguished from a gift by whether persons from the firm who are relevant to the business relationship attend the event. Therefore, if an individual only receives sporting tickets, and is unaccompanied by someone connected to the firm, it would be considered a gift; • Setting limits for what is a nominal gift and one that may not require prior approval. Due to gift giving and receiving being such a common practice, a firm may choose to set a dollar figure that would be considered nominal that doesn’t require prior approval. The definition of nominal value will vary from firm to firm, but many will enforce a $100 dollar limit, whether given or received. The $100 limit is loosely adopted from FINRA Rule 3220 (here), which must be adhered to if the firm contains dual registrants. A firm can set a nominal value higher than that of $100, and many do. The specific dollar limit may depend on the nature and location of the firm and its clients. It's worth noting that FINRA recently issued a rule review report (here) that included possible increases to the limits on broker-dealer gifts. The amendments would increase the gift cap from $100 to $175. A typical entertainment policy will stipulate that a representative cannot provide or accept entertainment that is excessive in nature. Entertainment that may be considered acceptable or reasonable would be a dinner, a round of golf or a single sporting event. Keep in mind, the individual or firm that is providing the entertainment should be present, otherwise the entertainment could classify the event as excessive. A recent enforcement action (here) underscores the importance for investment advisers to adopt and follow rules designed to prohibit inappropriate gifts to and from clients by advisory representatives. According to the order, the adviser adopted a nominal gift value of $250 or less for its supervised persons. Despite the policy, several employees took numerous flights on private planes of advisory clients, none of which received prior CCO approval as required by the policy; • A clear gift approval procedure. Require pre-approval for the giving or receiving of any gift that exceeds the stated dollar amount and not considered nominal.  As with gifts, an entertainment policy may include pre-approval for certain business entertainment events that exceed a specific dollar limit or type of event (i.e. travel expenses or hotel accommodations) which is determined by the firm.  To aid compliance supervision and remove much of the speculation for advisory representatives, an advisory firm may create a list of common and acceptable types of gifts and entertainment; and • A detailed education program. A firm should include the gifts and entertainment policy as part of their ongoing education program. The education could be part of your code of ethics training or a separate module. Many third-party vendors offer online learning courses or if that cost is not feasible, regular informal training (i.e. role-playing during a staff meeting) is suggested to ensure awareness. --Acceptance of gifts, SEC guidance:here (Jason Wallace is a senior editor for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

{"news_time":"2017-06-20 15:56:00","news_title":"Will McDonald's customers wait for the new Quarter Pounder?","keywords":"United States,Bob Riley,Claudia Barcenas,Dunkin,Edgar Meza,Joe Jasper,Juan Rodriguez,Richard Adams,Stephen J Easterbrook,Tracy Moore,US,MCDONALDS,STRATEGY,ANALYSIS,Restaurants (TRBC),Company News,Major News,Enterprise Reporting,Analyses,Corporate Events","sector":"Business","content":"LOS ANGELES/DALLAS (Reuters) - Tracy Moore grew impatient as she waited for a Quarter Pounder recently in the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant in central Dallas.  The burger, made with fresh beef and billed as hotter and juicer than the original made from a frozen patty, is part of the company's effort to serve tastier food.  But after about four minutes, it was Moore who was steamed. Like other customers who'd ordered the new Quarter Pounder at the restaurant's drive-through, she was asked to pull into a parking space and wait.  If it's going to be that long every time, I won't order it. I'd go  elsewhere, said Moore, who hits the drive-through every morning for a Coke and dines frequently at the chain. The tradeoff between time and taste looms large for McDonald's Corp as it works to win back business lost to rivals. The introduction of cooked-to-order, quarter-pound burgers made with fresh beef is part of the chain's attempt to improve food quality. Announced in March, the new sandwiches are already in selected test markets and are expected to be served in all U.S. stores by mid-2018. But the success of the initiative may well hinge on satisfying important customers like Moore: speed-minded drive-through patrons who account for 70 percent of the firm's U.S. revenue. An on-demand Quarter Pounder takes about a minute longer to land in a customer's hands than does the original sandwich, according to restaurant managers and analysts, even though fresh beef fries up faster than frozen patties. That's because grilling begins only after a patron orders. Traditional Quarter Pounders were often cooked up in batches ahead of time. Every second counts in the fast-food business. McDonald's drive-through speeds already lag those of some major competitors, according to one widely watched survey. McDonald's does not share such data, but company representatives told  Reuters earlier this year that service times have slowed. Still, company executives are bullish on prospects for the popular Quarter Pounder, which accounts for about one-fourth of McDonald's U.S. burger sales. At an investor conference last month, Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the changeover has created fewer complications than expected and that restaurant operators are on board.  Some industry veterans, however, are skeptical. Richard Adams, a former Southern California McDonald's franchisee-turned-consultant, says convenience is paramount for the chain's patrons, who may go elsewhere if speed deteriorates.   Any time the cooking process begins after the customer orders, the service time will be slower,  Adams said.  The fresh-beef initiative comes as pressure builds on McDonald's kitchens.  Adams says restaurant crews already are juggling trickier menu items thanks to the recent national launch of McDonald's new  Signature Crafted  sandwich line, which allows customers to pick their own meat, buns and toppings.  Signature Crafted  quarter-pound burgers also will use fresh beef as it becomes available nationwide. McDonald's cooks could be further strained by the chain's embrace of self-service kiosks and mobile ordering. The technology shaves ordering times, but can create new bottlenecks by swamping kitchens at peak hours, as companies such as Starbucks Corp have learned. Fresh vs. Fast The revamped Quarter Pounder is the latest move by Easterbrook to modernize the 60-year-old chain and reverse four straight years of traffic declines.  It's also a direct shot at Wendy's Co, Whataburger and In-N-Out. Those fresh-burger chains are among the fast-food rivals that McDonald's says have siphoned 500 million U.S. transactions from its stores since 2012.  A sign advertising hamburgers made with fresh beef is seen at a McDonald's restaurant in Dallas, Texas, U.S. April 18, 2017. Picture taken April 18, 2017.Liz HamptonEasterbrook's introduction of all-day breakfast in October 2015 was a big hit and has helped lift sales. The company's stock price is up more than 25 percent so far this year.  Analysts expect the fresh-beef push, along with moves to ditch artificial ingredients in popular items such as chicken nuggets, to bolster sales by addressing consumer demand for simpler,  cleaner  and fresher ingredients. The Quarter Pounder makeover has won early support from analysts and McDonald's franchisees in the heart of cattle country, where the product has been tested for almost two years in about 400 stores in Oklahoma and Texas. Three Dallas-area McDonald's managers who spoke with Reuters estimated the switch has improved their Quarter Pounder sales from 20 percent to 50 percent, albeit aided by advertising and coupons.     We've been stealing customers from a Whataburger down the street,  said Edgar Meza, a manager at a McDonald's restaurant in an upscale neighborhood in north Dallas. Officials at Texas-based Whataburger, a regional chain, declined to comment. Some burger lovers are taking notice too. Slideshow (2 Images) They're a little juicier,  said Bob Riley, who was polishing off a Quarter Pounder at an outlet near Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood, his third McDonald's meal of the week.   I think Wendy's woke them up,  he said. Joe Jasper, a former McDonald's executive who owns 20 restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, has been deeply involved in the effort. He described the new Quarter Pounder as  the best burger in our industry, but more importantly, (one delivered) at the speed of McDonald's.   Trouble is, the  speed of McDonald's  isn't as fast as that of many of its competitors. The average service time at a McDonald's drive-through last year was 208.2 seconds, according to a study published by QSR magazine, an industry publication, using data from SeeLevel HX, an Atlanta-based business intelligence firm. That's well behind industry leader Wendy's at 169.1 seconds, according to the survey. Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts and KFC all beat McDonald's too. McDonald's narrowed the gap with Wendy's by one-third from 2012 to 2016 by adding more drive-through lanes at some stores and by scrapping products such as  snack wraps,  tortilla-wrapped sandwiches that proved time-consuming to prepare. Still, its average drive-through service time last year was almost 20 seconds slower than it was in 2012, according to SeeLevel HX data.  [For a look at drive-through speeds, see tmsnrt.rs/2sLWMqW]      Claudia Barcenas, assistant manager at a McDonald's off Dallas' Central Expressway, says her counter and drive-through staff inform patrons that fresh-beef Quarter Pounders can be delayed, particularly if the sandwiches are ordered well-done.   We have to explain that it takes a bit longer. Perhaps a minute,  Barcenas said. Whether that's worth it for McDonald's customers remains to be seen as the experiment goes nationwide. Juan Rodriguez waited on his lunch break for a fresh-beef Quarter Pounder at the drive-through of another Dallas McDonald's outlet about nine miles from Barcenas' store. At the three-minute mark, the 20-year-old was getting restless.  If it's better, I don't mind waiting,  Rodriguez said.  But if it tastes the same, then no.

At a meeting in Tehran, Khamenei said the Shi'ite militias were Iraq's main forces pushing back Sunni jihadist groups, and Baghdad should not trust the United States in the fight against the Islamic State, Iranian state media reported. The Shi'ite militias, known as Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) helped Baghdad defend the country against the Islamic State militant group when Iraqi military and police divisions deserted en masse in 2014. Since then, the Iran-backed militias, estimated to comprise  more than 60,000 fighters, have continued to attack the Islamic State, also known as Daesh, which has declared a Caliphate across swathes of Iraq and Syria. But Sunnis in areas freed from Islamic State control say the Shi'ite militias have carried out looting, abductions and murder. Some Arab leaders in northern Iraq have asked for the PMF to be dissolved or expelled from their Sunni-majority provinces.  The Daesh is retreating from Iraq and that is thanks to the government’s trust in these young devoted forces,  Khamenei told  Abadi in Tehran.  The Americans are against Popular Forces because they want Iraq to lose its main source of strength,  he added. U.S.-backed Iraqi forces have also dislodged Islamic State from Iraqi cities the militants captured, and are about to fully capture Mosul, which used to be their de facto capital in the country. After Saudi Arabia Abadi met Khamenei a day after his visit to Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival, in a Middle Eastern tour that will also include Kuwait.[nL8N1JH2LO] Iraq lies on the faultline between Shi'ite Iran and the mostly Sunni Arab world. Deep-running animosity and distrust between the two sides is fueled by sectarian divides. Abadi belongs to the Dawa party, a Shi'ite group with close ties to Iran. But he has managed relations with the Sunnis better than his predecessor, Nuri al-Maliki, and also improved Baghdad's ties with Saudi Arabia. Khamenei asked Abadi not to trust the Americans in their fight against the Islamic State, as  they and their regional allies (Saudi Arabia) have created Daesh with their money and do not wish to fully eliminate them  in Iraq. He said Iran was against the presence of American forces in Iraq under any circumstance including training Iraqi forces.  We should remain vigilant of the Americans and not trust them. The Americans and their followers are against Iraq's independence, unity and identity,  Khamenei said. Khamenei also reiterated Iran's disagreement with any measure that threatened the territorial integrity of Iraq and divides the country. Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region announced this month that it would hold a referendum on independence, a move that Baghdad's Shi'ite-led government has rejected.

The  Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act,  which also includes new sanctions against Russia, passed the Senate 98-2 last week, an overwhelming vote that could complicate President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow. But the measure must still pass the House before it can be sent to Trump to sign into law, or veto, and Republican staff members said the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill that raises revenue for the government must originate in the House, something known as a  blue slip  violation. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a majority of 52 seats in the 100-member Senate, and a more commanding 238- to 193-seat margin in the House. Democrats said the blue-slip concern could be easily overcome. They suggested that Republicans were stalling the bill out of loyalty to Trump, who praised Russian President Vladimir Putin last year during his election campaign.  This is nothing but a delay tactic and the public shouldn't be fooled by complex-sounding parliamentary procedure,  said Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Spokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the foreign affairs panel, did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the path forward for the legislation in the House. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a co-author of the bill, said he thought the  blue slip  issue had been addressed and that he hoped the House would take the bill up quickly. Corker said he had not heard of any resistance to the bill from anyone in the Trump administration.

The three-month suspension began last Wednesday and, according to a WADA statement, is a result of  WADA's quality assessment procedures that identified non-conformities with best practice.  Los Angeles is competing against Paris to host the 2024 Olympics and the local bid committee has selected UCLA as the site for the Olympic Village, which would house all competing athletes. During the suspension, the UCLA laboratory can carry out all its regular anti-doping activities, but it must obtain a second opinion from another WADA-accredited lab prior to reporting any adverse analytical finding for the glucocorticoids  prednisolone  and  prednisone ; and, the anabolic steroids  boldenone  and  boldione . WADA said suspensions limited to certain substances have been issued in the past and allow for appropriate monitoring of the lab to ensure full implementation of necessary improvements with the objective of a return to full compliance. An independent WADA Disciplinary Committee advised by WADA's Laboratory Expert Group delivered its recommendation for a limited suspension on June 14. The UCLA lab was notified of the decision two days later and has 21 days to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. As part of the process, WADA will conduct a site visit within a timeframe that reasonably allows the UCLA Laboratory to finalize implementation of all remedial actions.

Qatari men in traditional white robes waited in SUVs at the border to identify their camels as the beasts trotted across the remote frontier, braying and kicking up dust, under what the owners said was an informal deal with Saudi border guards.  Thank God I have my camels back!  said Ali Magareh, 40, waiting with his seven-year-old son at the crossing point.  For one week they kept them waiting there. The camels were starving. Some of the males were fighting and in very bad condition. My brother still has 10 or 11 camels in Saudi Arabia,  he said. A June 5 decision by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to cut diplomatic ties and all transport links with Qatar over its alleged support for terrorism has disrupted trade, split families and raised fears of military confrontation in the Gulf region. Qatar has denied accusations of links to terrorism. Tribesmen in Qatar whose relatives span the modern-day borders of the Arabian Peninsula say the boycott is threatening traditions dear to them including camel herding and falconry.  Camels cross Saudi Arabia's remote desert border into Qatar, June 20, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonHundreds of Qataris keep camels in desert areas in eastern Saudi Arabia during winter months to train and breed them for races and beauty contests - customs seen as an important link to a vanishing nomadic past. Prize camels sell in auctions for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Pictures of Asian workers tending to camels languishing on the Saudi side of the border were published in Qatari newspapers on Monday sparking outrage. Slideshow (6 Images)The Qatari government sent a convoy of water tankers and trucks carrying grass to the border on Monday to nourish the camels that had crossed the border. Before the discovery of vast natural gas reserves off Qatar's coast that crowned the small Gulf peninsular country with skyscrapers, bedouin roamed the desert and depended on meat and milk from camels to survive.  We fought wars over camels,  said Magareh.  It's one of our traditions. Not having camels in Qatar is like being a cowboy who has no cows.  He blamed leaders in the Gulf for falling victim to political bickering.  What can I say? Even if they have differences in politics, we are the people. Don't push us into your fight,  he said.  We just want to live out our days, to go to Saudi Arabia and take care of our camels and go back and take care of our family. We don't want to be involved in these political things.

That changed this week when Mkhwebane, an advocate with 20 years experience, slid a monetary policy bombshell into the findings of an investigation into an apartheid-era bailout of a bank bought by Barclays Africa Group (BGAJ.J). At the end of a 56-page summary of the probe the Public Protector launched an attack on the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and its constitutional obligation to protect the rand, a central pillar of the post-apartheid state. Specifically, Mkhwebane proposed changing the constitution to remove the phrase  to protect the value of the currency  from the definition of the SARB's primary role. Instead, it should define the bank's main objective as promoting  balanced and sustainable economic growth... while ensuring that the socio-economic well-being of the citizens are protected , she said. That set alarm bells ringing for many South Africans concerned that the change could lead to money printing and threaten the SARB's independence. The central bank's inflation targeting has long been derided by leftists from Zuma's ruling ANC party who see a weak currency as an economic panacea. Former SARB Governor Tito Mboweni was incensed, pointing to political skulduggery ahead of ANC elections in December that will replace Zuma, facing a series of scandals, as party leader.  When we negotiated our sovereign constitution, we entered into a covenant about the independence of the SA Reserve Bank,  he wrote in an essay.  It is unwise to try and change this at the slightest political provocation. It is a very serious matter for our beloved country. Please think carefully about this.  Mboweni, who was also instrumental in smoothing South Africa's return to the global financial system after Nelson Mandela's election in 1994, also lamented the potential damage to Pretoria's image and credibility. Currency and bond markets reacted sharply to the watchdog's comments, with the rand losing 2 percent in two days and bond yields spiking as ratings agencies warned of further downgrades to South Africa's already crumbling credit profile. Former finance minister Trevor Manuel, another architect of South Africa's post-apartheid stability, shared Mboweni's concerns.  This report extends so far beyond the remit of the Public Protector that it portends significant danger,  he told Reuters.  What is her locus standi to propose amendments to the constitution? That is so way above her pay grade.  Legally Flawed Legal analysts and the SARB denounced her conclusions as legally flawed and beyond her remit of investigating alleged corruption by public officials.  The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful,  it said in a statement. It would take urgent legal action, it added. Even the person who brought the initial complaint about the bank bailout, advocate and anti-corruption campaigner Paul Hoffman, was flummoxed.  It came like a bolt from the blue,  he told Reuters.  It wasn't asked for, it wasn't required and it isn't legal. The complaint had nothing to do with it. The scope of the powers of the Public Protector do not extend to changing the constitution because of what she had for breakfast.  Newspapers were equally perplexed.  What is Busi doing?  the Johannesburg-based Citizen asked in a front-page headline, while the Sowetan led on the backlash under the headline  Public Protector's directive slammed . With few other explanations to hand, suspicion has turned to Zuma and finance minister Malusi Gigaba, who some see as a political opportunist who regularly denounces the evils of  white monopoly capital  - shorthand for the disproportionate financial clout of the white minority, a lingering legacy of apartheid. As a remedy - and with the ruling ANC's popularity falling ahead of 2019 elections - Gigaba and others have been pushing for  radical economic transformation  without saying what it entails. But on Tuesday, he defended the central bank.  We need to protect at all times the independence of the South Africa Reserve Bank so we don't subject it to undue influence from anybody,  he told Reuters in an interview.     Mkhwebane also defended her integrity in a radio interview on Tuesday but she said the SARB's status as a lender of last resort  has commercial benefits only in respect of the financial sector , and  does not improve the socio-economic conditions of ordinary citizens .   Once the state takes control of creating money and credit, numerous benefits aimed at alleviating economic ails [sic] of ordinary disadvantaged people may be achieved,  she added.

JBS, whose controlling shareholder recently agreed to pay a massive leniency fine after becoming embroiled in sweeping graft probes that have ensnared politicians and executives, said in a securities filing that its board and state development bank BNDES still had to approve the planned asset sales. The sales, which aim to raise 6 billion reais ($1.8 billion), include a 19.2 percent stake in Brazil-based dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA, along with its Northern Ireland unit Moy Park Ltd and Five Rivers Cattle Feeding in North America. The largest asset on the block is Moy Park, which JBS bought from Brazilian rival Marfrig Global Foods SA two years ago for $1.5 billion. Moy Park supplies 25 percent of chicken consumed in western Europe, according to its website. It is one of Britain's top 10 food companies, with 13 processing and manufacturing units in Northern Ireland, England, France, the Netherlands and Ireland. Five Rivers, the biggest U.S. cattle feeding operation, has a combined capacity of more than 980,000 head of cattle and locations in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, and Idaho, according to its website. It handles nearly 10 percent of cattle placed annually on U.S. feedlots, according to the Livestock Marketing Information Center. Five Rivers also manages a 75,000-head capacity feedyard in the Canadian province of Alberta. Just two weeks ago, JBS said core U.S. assets were not for sale. JBS bought Five Rivers from Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL], the world's biggest pork producer, in 2008, along with other beef assets. Smithfield is now interested in getting back into the U.S. beef business, as well as poultry, its owner China-based WH Group Ltd told Reuters earlier this month. Smithfield declined to comment on Tuesday when asked if it was interested in the Five Rivers assets. Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], another major U.S. beef processor, also recently exited the cattle feeding business. Concerns that JBS might sell cattle slaughter operations, which could have cut into demand for feeder cattle, pushed U.S. feeder cattle futures to nearly a two-month low of 140.775 cents per pound after the JBS announcement. They later rebounded to trade down 0.075 cent at 144.925 cents.  Originally, we were unsure if a packer would have to close a plant or something like that. This is just divesting itself from a feeding unit that someone else could buy and operate,  said David Hales, a U.S. cattle analyst. JBS shares were down 4.4 percent at 6.07 reais in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo as the benchmark Ibovespa index fell around 2 percent. JBS has yet to hire an investment bank to sound out potential bidders, a person with direct knowledge of the company's strategy told Reuters, asking for anonymity to discuss the matter freely.  A sale of Vigor, which is majority-controlled by JBS' parent, J&F; Investimentos SA, has already been entrusted to two investment banks, Reuters reported last month. They have contacted French dairy producers Danone SA and Groupe Lactalis SA, Mexico's Grupo Lala SAB de CV and Switzerland's Emmi AG to analyze the business. JBS has a minority stake in Vigor.

Under the legislation, any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors is illegal and punishable by a fine. The law has been used to stop gay pride marches and to detain gay rights activists. The Strasbourg court ruled the law violated people's right to freedom of expression and discriminated against gay people.  The Court found in particular that, although the laws in question aimed primarily at protecting minors, the limits of those laws had not been clearly defined and their application had been arbitrary,  the court said in a statement.  Indeed, by adopting such laws, the authorities had reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia, which was incompatible with the values of a democratic society.  The ruling is likely to strain already poor relations between Russia and the Strasbourg-based court, which last year said Moscow had violated the European Convention on Human Rights in all but six of its 228 judgments in Russian cases.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed allegations that Russia prosecuted gay people.  On LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender), we do not prosecute for this or that orientation,  he told a joint news briefing with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Moscow.  Traditional Values  FILE PHOTO: Gay activists take part in a protest event called  March against Hatred  in St. Petersburg, Russia, November 2, 2014.Alexander Demianchuk/File PhotoPro-Kremlin politicians and Orthodox Church leaders saw the ruling as an attempt to foist what they call unacceptably liberal  European values  on a country whose leaders constantly emphasize the need to adhere to  traditional values .   The decision ... shows that our country has chosen the right path to preserve its culture and human identity,  Vitaly Milonov, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, said in an article on his website.   I'm sure that we will support the institution of a traditional strong family in future and shield children from attacks by all manner of minorities.  Homosexuality in Russia, where the influence of the socially conservative Orthodox Church has grown in recent years, was a criminal offence until 1993 and classed as a mental illness until 1999. The Russian Justice Ministry said in a statement it did not agree with the court and pledged to appeal the ruling within three months. It said the law was solely designed  to defend morality and children's health  and did not amount to a ban or public condemnation of homosexuality. Human rights defenders say the contested law has been broadly applied to intimidate Russia's LGBT community, however. Tuesday's case was originally brought by three Russian gay rights activists who were fined for holding banners designed to encourage acceptance of homosexuality, between 2009 and 2012. The court ordered Russia to pay them thousands of euros in damages. Nikolai Alekseyev, one of the activists, said in a statement the ruling was  a historic victory  that he pledged to use to urge the Russian authorities to scrap the law.  The way this law has been applied shows that it is not aimed at protecting minors, but at removing LGBT people, an enormous social group, from the public space, and at stripping them of their right to speak out or fight for their rights,  he said.

LinkedIn pits free speech against CFAA, DMCA","keywords":"Abhishek Bajoria,Deepak Gupta,Jonathan Blavin,Laurence Tribe,Munger Tolles,US,OTC,LINKEDIN","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - A data-crunching startup called hiQ relies entirely on the public profiles of LinkedIn users. HiQ sells “people analytics” to companies including eBay, Capital One and GoDaddy, scrutinizing employees’ LinkedIn profiles to advise clients on managing their workforces. HiQ employs 24 people and has raised $14.5 million in venture capital on the premise of access to information that LinkedIn users have agreed to allow the world to see.  LinkedIn does not want hiQ to access that information. On May 23, LinkedIn sent hiQ a cease and desist letter accusing hiQ of violating LinkedIn’s user agreement by scraping and copying data from other users. The letter demanded that hiQ stop using information gleaned from LinkedIn and informed the data cruncher that LinkedIn has blocked its access. If hiQ tries to circumvent the block, LinkedIn said, it will be in breach of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and California trespass law.  HiQ brought in Deepak Gupta of Farella Braun & Martel, who reminded LinkedIn counsel Abhishek Bajoria in a phone conversation that LinkedIn allows other companies, including Google, Yahoo and Bing, to use automated software to access and index its users’ public profiles. Gupta asked, according to his sworn statement, whether LinkedIn had cut off hiQ because it intends to develop competing products. According to Gupta, Bajoria said he did not know.  HiQ now contends in a declaratory judgment suit in San Francisco federal court that LinkedIn is abusing the CFAA, DMCA and California state laws in an attempt to shut down a competitor. In a parallel motion for a temporary restraining order, hiQ argues that the California Constitution and state court precedent guarantees hiQ’s free speech right of access to LinkedIn users’ public profiles. (HiQ withdrew the TRO motion for settlement talks with LinkedIn. According to a joint stipulation filed last week, those talks have failed and hiQ will file a renewed TRO application on Thursday.)  The case is shaping up as a big test of how much control a social media site can wield over information its users have deemed to be public. LinkedIn, which is represented by Munger Tolles & Olson, hasn’t yet filed any response to hiQ’s assertions, but its May 23 letter to hiQ says its user agreement – which hiQ touts as its justification for accessing users’ public profiles – specifically prohibits scraping and copying user information, as well as trading and selling information related to LinkedIn user data. LinkedIn appears to be poised to argue that even though its users want at least some of their information to be publicly available, LinkedIn is entitled to block access to the data.  The LinkedIn letter cites the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ December 2016 ruling in Power Ventures v. Facebook, in which the 9th Circuit held (among other things) that the social media site Power Ventures had violated the CFAA by continuing to access Facebook after Facebook rescinded its authorization to do so. Under Power Ventures, LinkedIn suggested in its letter to hiQ, hiQ will be on the hook for CFAA liability if it attempts to defy LinkedIn’s revocation of access.  HiQ claims LinkedIn’s supposed threats are not only anticompetitive but also a violation of the data scraper’s free speech rights. The company’s lawyers, who now include Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, argued that under the California Supreme Court’s 1979 decision in Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center and its progeny, LinkedIn cannot restrict the flow of public information. In Pruneyard, the state high court held that high school students collecting signatures for a petition protesting a United Nations resolution had a free speech right to approach shoppers at a privately-owned outdoor mall. HiQ argued in its withdrawn TRO brief that LinkedIn is, essentially, an electronic equivalent of the Pruneyard shopping center, “a marketplace of ideas on a previously unimaginable scale,” the TRO said.  “LinkedIn refers to itself as a ‘community’ and expressly holds itself out as a place ‘to meet, exchange ideas (and) learn,’” the brief said. “When a private property owner opens its property to the public, constitutional principles of free and open speech and access to information must be fully respected.”  HiQ’s brief is refreshingly candid, which seems appropriate for company relying on its free speech rights. The data scraper said it will go under without access to information from LinkedIn’s public user profiles – access that, hiQ points out, does not actually require LinkedIn membership. The company contends it is on the verge of a new financing agreement and is in talks to enter client relationships with Bank of New York Mellon, Chevron, Groupon, Honeywell and IBM. “All of these deals are endangered by LinkedIn’s conduct,” hiQ claims.  I emailed LinkedIn lawyer Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles but didn’t hear back. We’ll see what his client has to say about hiQ’s free speech argument on June 26, when LinkedIn is scheduled to respond to the data scraper’s TRO motion. HiQ lawyer Deepak Gupta declined to comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-linkedin-idUSKBN19B2WE"},

By far the biggest shock was number one seed Murray's abject 7-6(4) 6-2 defeat to Australian world number 90 Jordan Thompson -- a late call-up who only knew he was playing shortly before stepping on court against the defending champion. Second seed and world number three Wawrinka, runner-up at the French Open nine days ago, went down 7-6(4) 7-5 to Spain's Feliciano Lopez while another young Australian, wildcard Thanasi Kokkinakis, accounted for Raonic 7-6(5) 7-6(8). Temperatures, which had reached 38 degrees on court during the day at the west London club, were still sizzling when Murray took to court for his first grasscourt match of the season, having reached the semi-finals of the French Open. Initially he had been scheduled to face fellow Britain Aljaz Bedene but 23-year-old 'lucky loser' Thompson stepped in after Bedene withdrew with a wrist injury. Murray had lost only one match on grass since the summer of 2014 -- to Roger Federer in the 2015 Wimbledon semi-finals -- but looked uncomfortable on the slick surface as the errors flowed from his racket, especially off the forehand. Having taken a close first set Thompson, who reached the final of the Surbiton challenger event last week, raced through the second to the general surprise of the 10,000 crowd.  Andy's the world number one -- I've looked up to him and that's definitely the biggest win of my career. I took each point at a time. I didn't expect it to be winning in straight sets,  he told the BBC.  I was sitting around yesterday hoping to get a match. Here I am, I got in the draw and I was so lucky to be here. I don't know if I can say my immediate thoughts.   Murray looked flat and admitted it was a  big blow  in his build-up for Wimbledon where he will be aiming to defend the title he won for a second time last year. Britain Tennis - Aegon Championships - Queen's Club, London - June 20, 2017 Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka in action during his first round match against Spain's Feliciano Lopez Action Images via Reuters / Tony O'Brien Livepic It has happened in the past where guys haven't done well here and gone on to do well at Wimbledon,  said the Briton after the end of a 14-match winning streak on grass.  There is no guarantee that I won't do well at Wimbledon, but it certainly would have helped to have had more matches.  He played better. I didn't create loads of chances.  Slideshow (10 Images)After his defeat by Rafa Nadal in the Paris final, Wawrinka added Paul Annacone to his coaching team as a grass court specialist. The American previously coached Federer and Pete Sampras, who between them have taken 14 Wimbledon titles. But Wawrinka was below his best on Tuesday as Lopez produced some deft touches to support his big serve.   I came here with a lot of confidence and tennis is a lot about confidence,  Lopez told the BBC. Raonic said he would spend time on the practice court and in the gym after his defeat by Kokkinakis. It was the Australian's first win over a top 10 player as he began the long road back from playing only one match in 2016. A series of injuries over the past two years had sent his ranking to 993 from 69.  I've been out of the game for so long, it's huge for me,  the 21-year-old, now ranked 698, said.

A row over the independence of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) erupted this week after a public watchdog recommended it change its mandate from maintaining currency and price stability to acting in the interests of ordinary citizens.  We need to protect at all times the independence of the South Africa Reserve Bank so we don't subject it to undue influence from anybody,  Gigaba told Reuters in an interview.  Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of South Africa's constitutionally-sanctioned anti-graft watchdog, called on Monday for the change to the central bank's mandate. Parliament said on Tuesday it had received a request from Mkhwebane's office to change the bank's constitutional mandate. But the central bank has hit back, saying Mkhwebane's office had no business in making recommendations about how it is run, pledging to take urgent legal action.  At the moment the central bank is acting on its own initiative, on its own behalf,  said Gigaba, adding he was studying the Public Protector's report and would be taking legal advice.   We as Treasury, and I as the Minister of Finance, have not decided whether I am joining in ...I may or may not,  he said. Mkhwebane had made the proposal in a statement where she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa Group.  I don't understand how it then spills over to dealing with the broader role of the SARB, because the role of the SARB in the broader economy was not being looked at. It was not the subject of the investigation,  Gigaba said.  The latest controversy has rattled investors in Africa's most industrialised economy, which recently fell into recession. It has seen its credit rating downgraded and has been rocked by political turmoil and gripped by questions over President Jacob Zuma's stewardship. Gigaba added that inflation targeting had served South Africa well so far and that policy makers would like to keep inflation in the 3-6 percent bracket.   There are debates about whether we need to increase the bracket and review that specific mandate of inflation targeting but that role must not be changed lightly,  he said.  We need to have sufficient debate and discussion before we arrive at a conclusion whether we should change the policy or not.  Asked for more details on planned government spending cuts, Gigaba said he hoped to save 25 billion rand ($1.9 billion)through overhauling government IT contracts.  One of the most obvious ways to achieve savings is in the review of some of the big IT contracts by the office of the chief procurement officer,  he said. Spending cuts have become increasingly significant for South Africa as it aims to cut its budget deficit to 2.6 percent of national output by 2019/20 from 3.4 percent now.

Urine samples will still be used for the bulk of drug testing but, starting with the 2017-18 season that begins in October, blood testing will allow for the detection of human growth hormone, the PGA Tour said in a statement. As part of the changes, the PGA Tour will be adding three categories currently prohibited by WADA: asthma medications, allergy and anti-inflammatory medications, and pseudoephedrine over a designated threshold. While not a signatory of the WADA code, the PGA Tour said that  given the global nature of professional golf, consistency with the WADA list ensures professional golfers need to comply with just one list in competition around the world as well as in Olympic competition.  Another key change to a policy critics have long considered too opaque will see the PGA Tour, which currently only discloses suspension information for violations related to performance-enhancing drugs, move away from keeping certain player suspensions confidential. Starting next season, the PGA Tour will issue a statement once an adjudication process has been completed that will state the player's name, length of suspension and whether it came from a performance enhancing substance or recreational drugs. The PGA Tour, which organizes the main professional golf tours in North America, established its anti-doping program in 2008 after liaising with the other major golf tours and governing bodies around the world. But the PGA Tour and its advisors determined that a policy more specifically catered to golf was appropriate, which is why it differed in certain areas from the WADA Code that governs activities such as the Olympic Games.

The issue -- triggered by a public watchdog's recommendation -- comes just as South Africa's economy has sunk into recession, its credit rating downgraded and politics is gripped by questions over President Jacob Zuma's stewardship. Zuma has been facing mounting calls to resign ahead of a conference in December where his successor as party leader will be chosen. His term as head of state runs until a national election in 2019. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of South Africa's  constitutionally-sanctioned anti-graft watchdog, called on Monday for the central bank's mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to be changed, saying the bank should act in the interests of empowering ordinary citizens. Speaking on 702 Talk Radio on Tuesday, Mkhwebane said the central bank's mandate was focused on a  few commercial interests . The Reserve Bank said in a statement that Mkhwebane's office had no business in making recommendations about how it is run.  The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful,  it said in a statement.  Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, who is currently in London, told Reuters he was still studying the Public Protector's report and would make a decision on whether to back the central bank in seeking a court review of the recommendation. Call for Caution But Gigaba also stressed that the independence of the central bank must be protected at all times.  We should be very cautious about making proposals that are going to leave the economy -- and the institutions we have to manage our economy -- weaker,  he said.  The Secretary General of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party Gwede Mantashe said that Mkhwebane had over-reached her powers and undermined the central bank's credibility. However, the country's largest trade union and ANC-ally Cosatu backed Mkhwebane's position.  South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said Mkhwebane's recommendation  goes beyond what she is legally empowered to do  and was illegal. S&P; Global Ratings said it was  critical  that the operational independence of the central bank remains. South Africa's banking industry lobby group also backed the central bank, urging the government to confirm the bank's independence. Prolonged political turmoil has dealt several body blows to Africa's most industrialized economy.

The issue -- triggered by a public watchdog's recommendation -- comes just as South Africa's economy has sunk into recession, its credit rating downgraded and politics is gripped by questions over President Jacob Zuma's stewardship. Zuma has been facing mounting calls to resign ahead of a conference in December where his successor as party leader will be chosen. His term as head of state runs until a national election in 2019. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of South Africa's  constitutionally-sanctioned anti-graft watchdog, called on Monday for the central bank's mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to be changed, saying the bank should act in the interests of empowering ordinary citizens. Speaking on 702 Talk Radio on Tuesday, Mkhwebane said the central bank's mandate was focused on a  few commercial interests . The Reserve Bank said in a statement that Mkhwebane's office had no business in making recommendations about how it is run.  The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful,  it said in a statement.  Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, who is currently in London, told Reuters he was still studying the Public Protector's report and would make a decision on whether to back the central bank in seeking a court review of the recommendation. Call for Caution But Gigaba also stressed that the independence of the central bank must be protected at all times.  We should be very cautious about making proposals that are going to leave the economy -- and the institutions we have to manage our economy -- weaker,  he said.  The Secretary General of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party Gwede Mantashe said that Mkhwebane had over-reached her powers and undermined the central bank's credibility. However, the country's largest trade union and ANC-ally Cosatu backed Mkhwebane's position.  South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said Mkhwebane's recommendation  goes beyond what she is legally empowered to do  and was illegal. S&P; Global Ratings said it was  critical  that the operational independence of the central bank remains. South Africa's banking industry lobby group also backed the central bank, urging the government to confirm the bank's independence. Prolonged political turmoil has dealt several body blows to Africa's most industrialized economy.  Unemployment is at a 14-year high, key sectors of the economy are struggling as the country reels in recession and Fitch has warned that new rules on mine ownership introduced last week could deter investment.

Schneider,Douglas Meyer,Hannah James,Martha Butler,Fitch Maintains Arch's Debt Ratings on Negative Watch; Affirms I,Credit / Debt Ratings,Americas,Company News,Insurance (TRBC),Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),Corporate Events,Insurance (Legacy),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Property and Casualty Insurance (TRBC),United States","sector":"","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained the following Arch Capital Group Ltd. (ACGL) ratings on Rating Watch Negative: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --Series C and E preferred securities at 'BBB'. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of ACGL's various subsidiaries at 'A+' (Strong)/Stable Outlook. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Rating Watch continues to reflect Fitch's potential concerns about the financial strength of United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) and its implications for the overall credit quality of ACGL's holding company. ACGL purchased UGC (not rated), the leading provider of U.S. mortgage insurance, from American International Group, Inc. (AIG) for $3.26 billion on Dec. 31, 2016. The agency expects to resolve the Negative Watch by the end of July 2017 as part of our periodic annual review of ACGL and following a more detailed review of UGC's credit quality. This includes gaining an understanding of ACGL's operating strategy, business growth expectations and capital management plans for UGC. Fitch's affirmation of ACGL's IFS ratings reflects the company's strong and diversified business profile in both insurance and reinsurance lines, reasonable financial leverage, strong fixed-charge coverage and very strong profitability. These favorable factors are partially offset by potential risks associated with the company's expanding mortgage operations, primary of which are possible complications related to the ongoing integration of the operations and risk management practices of UGC into a combined mortgage insurance group. The ratings also reflect Fitch's negative sector outlooks on U.S. property/casualty (P/C) insurance and global reinsurance. RATING SENSITIVITIES The holding company ratings could be downgraded by one notch should Fitch view UGC's credit quality as meaningfully weakening ACGL's overall financial strength or debt servicing capabilities. Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade of both the IFS and holding company ratings include: difficulties experienced in the mortgage insurance operations, including failure to successfully integrate UGC, or sizable adverse prior-year reserve development. In addition, increases in underwriting leverage above 1.0x net premiums written-to-equity ratio or a financial leverage ratio above 25% could generate negative rating pressure. ACGL's hybrid securities ratings could be lowered by one notch to reflect non-performance risk should Fitch view Bermuda's regulatory environment as becoming more controlling in its supervision of (re)insurers. Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: continued improvement in ACGL's competitive market position while demonstrating favorable run-rate earnings and low volatility with a non-mortgage combined ratio in the low 90s; and successfully managing the expansion of its mortgage operations with the UGC acquisition. In addition, continued growth in equity while maintaining a financial leverage ratio at or below 20%, fixed-charge coverage of at least 10x and a net premiums written-to-equity ratio of 0.8x or lower could generate positive rating pressure. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has maintained the following ratings on Negative Watch: Arch Capital Group Ltd. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'A-'; --$300 million 7.35% senior unsecured notes due 2034 at 'BBB+'; --$325 million 6.75% series C non-cumulative preferred shares at 'BBB'; --$450 million 5.25% series E non-cumulative preferred shares at 'BBB'. Arch Capital Group (U.S.) Inc. --$500 million 5.144% senior notes due 2043 at 'BBB+'. Arch Capital Finance LLC --$500 million 4.011% senior unsecured notes due 2026 at 'BBB+'; --$450 million 5.031% senior unsecured notes due 2046 at 'BBB+'. Fitch has affirmed the following IFS ratings with a Stable Outlook: Arch Reinsurance Ltd. Arch Reinsurance Company Arch Reinsurance Europe Underwriting Designated Activity Company Arch Insurance Company Arch Excess and Surplus Insurance Company Arch Specialty Insurance Company Arch Indemnity Insurance Company Arch Insurance Company (Europe) Limited --IFS at 'A+'.

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments Fitch has adjusted ACGL's financial leverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios to exclude Watford Re's revolving credit agreement borrowings and interest expense. ACGL owns only approximately 11% of the common equity of Watford Holdings Ltd. (parent of Watford Re). However, Watford Re's financial results are required to be consolidated into ACGL, as ACGL is considered the primary beneficiary of Watford Re. The noted adjustment did not result in a different rating than had the adjustment not been made, but it is material in how Fitch views financial leverage and fixed-charge coverage.

Los Angeles is competing against Paris to host the 2024 Olympics and the local bid committee has selected UCLA as the site for the Olympic Village, which would house all competing athletes.

The world's largest brewer, which owns the Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, has sent out first information packages to prospective bidders and has asked for first bids before the summer break, the people said. The brands, which are only sold in Germany but have high profit margins, could fetch several hundred million euros, according to the sources, who declined to be identified. They said AB InBev was working with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) on the sale, which would follow its divestiture of SABMiller's European brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, to Japan's Asahi (2502.T). An AB InBev spokesman confirmed the company was considering the future of the German brands, saying it continuously reviews its portfolio.   We are having discussions regarding the future development of the Diebels and Hasseroeder brands along with their two associated breweries with a limited number of investors that would be able to implement a more focused strategy for these brands,  the spokesman said in an email.  It is very early days and we have nothing further to share at this stage.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Hasseroeder and Diebels have combined sales of about 140 million euros, the sources said. One source estimated they would fetch around 200 million euros, though another said it could be much more than that, based on profit margins north of 35 percent. That would result in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly 50 million euros.   Asahi paid around 15 times EBITDA for the European brands it bought from AB InBev, though the German brands are not expected to garner that high a multiple given that they are local brands in a tough market, rather than international.  Several sources predicted that the most interested buyers would be those that already have a presence in Germany. German brewers such as Bitburger or Radeberger are expected to express interest in Hasseroeder, one of the best-selling brands in eastern Germany, as well as for Diebels, which is famous for its top-fermented dark Altbier, drunk mainly in Duesseldorf and some neighboring cities.      The German beer market has grown increasingly competitive in recent years as consumer habits change and consumption slows, putting pressure on sales and profits.

Under the legislation, any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors is illegal and punishable by a fine. The law has been used to stop gay pride marches and to detain gay rights activists. The Strasbourg court ruled the law violated people's right to freedom of expression and discriminated against gay people.  The Court found in particular that, although the laws in question aimed primarily at protecting minors, the limits of those laws had not been clearly defined and their application had been arbitrary,  the court said in a statement.  Indeed, by adopting such laws, the authorities had reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia, which was incompatible with the values of a democratic society.  The ruling is likely to strain already poor relations between Russia and the Strasbourg-based court, which last year said Moscow had violated the European Convention on Human Rights in all but six of its 228 judgments in Russian cases.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed allegations that Russia prosecuted gay people.  On LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender), we do not prosecute for this or that orientation,  he told a joint news briefing with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Moscow.  Traditional Values  FILE PHOTO: Gay activists take part in a protest event called  March against Hatred  in St. Petersburg, Russia, November 2, 2014.Alexander Demianchuk/File PhotoPro-Kremlin politicians and Orthodox Church leaders saw the ruling as an attempt to foist what they call unacceptably liberal  European values  on a country whose leaders constantly emphasize the need to adhere to  traditional values .   The decision ... shows that our country has chosen the right path to preserve its culture and human identity,  Vitaly Milonov, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, said in an article on his website.   I'm sure that we will support the institution of a traditional strong family in future and shield children from attacks by all manner of minorities.  Homosexuality in Russia, where the influence of the socially conservative Orthodox Church has grown in recent years, was a criminal offence until 1993 and classed as a mental illness until 1999. The Russian Justice Ministry said in a statement it did not agree with the court and pledged to appeal the ruling within three months. It said the law was solely designed  to defend morality and children's health  and did not amount to a ban or public condemnation of homosexuality. Human rights defenders say the contested law has been broadly applied to intimidate Russia's LGBT community, however. Tuesday's case was originally brought by three Russian gay rights activists who were fined for holding banners designed to encourage acceptance of homosexuality, between 2009 and 2012. The court ordered Russia to pay them thousands of euros in damages. Nikolai Alekseyev, one of the activists, said in a statement the ruling was  a historic victory  that he pledged to use to urge the Russian authorities to scrap the law.  The way this law has been applied shows that it is not aimed at protecting minors, but at removing LGBT people, an enormous social group, from the public space, and at stripping them of their right to speak out or fight for their rights,  he said.

The disaster, now into its fourth day, also prompted Prime Minister Antonio Costa to question the emergency response system. Victor Vaz Pinto, commander of the civil protection agency, said a helicopter had been sent out to search for the aircraft but had found nothing.  I have no information that any airplane working for civil protection has crashed,  said Vaz Pinto, adding that an explosion heard by many in the vicinity may have been caused by abandoned gas bottles. Local media had earlier reported a Canadair plane had crashed. A Reuters photographer in the area said he saw a plane fly out of view and shortly afterwards he heard an explosion. The fire, about 200 km (125 miles) northeast of capital Lisbon, spread rapidly after starting on Saturday, killing many people in their cars as they tried to flee the blaze.  Costa called the fire the biggest human tragedy in Portugal in living memory. Several other fires have now spread through the region and there are now more than 2,000 firefighters involved in the efforts, said Vaz Pinto.  He said one fire further north in the village of Gois was very worrying and several residents were evacuated as a precaution. Firefighting workers look at a forest fire in Louriceira, Portugal, June 20, 2017.Miguel VidalThere have been reports and witness accounts about the slow response by the emergency services to the fire, prompting growing demands for an explanation.  I am surprised not by the fact that people have died, which is tragic, but by the fact that this hasn't happened earlier and more often,  wrote Paulo Fernandes, professor of forest sciences, in daily Publico.  Everything indicates there were mistakes.  Costa asked authorities for a report on what went wrong.  Why, for how long and what impact was there on the planning, command and execution of operations if your very systems were not working? What was done to establish alternative connections?  Costa asked of the emergency services, according to the state news agency Lusa. Slideshow (20 Images)Costa, who sought an explanation from the national civil protection agency, the weather institute and police, also asked why a road, where many people died in their cars, had not been closed off. Data from the European Forest Fire Information System showed that an area of more than 30,000 hectares had been affected, making it the largest ever fire in Portugal. The area burnt is nearly three times bigger than Lisbon and means the relatively small country accounts for more than a quarter of all fires in the entire European Union this year, the data showed.(here) The traditionally Catholic country holds its third day of mourning for the victims on Tuesday, after which demands for answers are likely to rise. The main center-right Social Democrats requested that a commission be created immediately to investigate the fires. Assuncao Cristas, leader of the center-right CDS-PP opposition party said the country was still in mourning, but after that  will come the time, in parliament, when all questions will be asked.  Officials have said communications were knocked out in the initial fierce fires when most people died, affecting mobile and fixed telephone networks.

The world's largest brewer, which owns the Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, has sent out first information packages to prospective bidders and has asked for first bids before the summer break, the people said. The brands, which are only sold in Germany but have high profit margins, could fetch several hundred million euros, according to the sources, who declined to be identified. They said AB InBev was working with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) on the sale, which would follow its divestiture of SABMiller's European brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, to Japan's Asahi (2502.T). An AB InBev spokesman confirmed the company was considering the future of the German brands, saying it continuously reviews its portfolio.   We are having discussions regarding the future development of the Diebels and Hasseroeder brands along with their two associated breweries with a limited number of investors that would be able to implement a more focused strategy for these brands,  the spokesman said in an email.  It is very early days and we have nothing further to share at this stage.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Hasseroeder and Diebels have combined sales of about 140 million euros, the sources said. One source estimated they would fetch around 200 million euros, though another said it could be much more than that, based on profit margins north of 35 percent. That would result in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly 50 million euros.   Asahi paid around 15 times EBITDA for the European brands it bought from AB InBev, though the German brands are not expected to garner that high a multiple given that they are local brands in a tough market, rather than international.  Several sources predicted that the most interested buyers would be those that already have a presence in Germany. German brewers such as Bitburger or Radeberger are expected to express interest in Hasseroeder, one of the best-selling brands in eastern Germany, as well as for Diebels, which is famous for its top-fermented dark Altbier, drunk mainly in Duesseldorf and some neighboring cities.      The German beer market has grown increasingly competitive in recent years as consumer habits change and consumption slows, putting pressure on sales and profits.

Healthcare was the brightest spot in the market while consumer discretionary stocks were some of the weakest with a 1.1 percent drop after news of an Amazon.com foray into fashion retail. Oil prices nosedived to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply by several key producers, a trend that has undermined attempts by OPEC and other producers to support the market through reduced output. The S&P; energy index was the weakest of the S&P;'s 11 sectors with a 1 percent drop. The drop in oil prices also appeared to affect the broader market beyond energy, according to Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  A lot of stocks that have absolutely nothing to do with oil are impacted by this,  said Massocca. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 31.48 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,497.51, the S&P; 500 lost 12.2 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,441.26 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 36.23 points, or 0.58 percent, to 6,202.79. Many investors were likely holding their fire on Tuesday ahead of a congressional election in Atlanta, according to Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida. He sees the race - the costliest U.S. congressional race in history - between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel as a political test for President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda.  If the Republican wins you'll get a rally on that because it means the Trump agenda has a better chance of passing than if the Democrat wins,  said Saut. The health index was the only gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors, with a rise of 0.5 percent. Nasdaq's biotechnology index was up 2 percent after a 2.5 percent jump in the previous day's session. The S&P; technology sector was down 0.5 percent, with big names such as Apple and Microsoft dragging on the S&P; and Nasdaq. The tech sector had finished up 1.7 percent the previous day after two straight weeks of losses on concerns about valuation. On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making. Chipotle fell 6.9 percent to $426.97 after the burrito chain said its operating costs in the second quarter will be slightly higher than the first quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 87 new lows.

U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov made the assessment in his second quarterly report to the 15-member council on the implementation of a Dec. 23 resolution adopted with 14 votes in favor and a U.S. abstention. Then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Israel had urged Washington to wield its veto.  The policy of continued illegal settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territory contravenes resolution 2334,  Mladenov said.   The large number of settlement-related activities documented during this period undermine the chances for the establishment of a viable, continuous Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution,  he said.   Israel for decades has pursued a policy of constructing Jewish settlements on territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. Most countries view Israeli settlement activity as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees. The Palestinians want an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. The December resolution calls on both parties to refrain from acts of provocation, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, and to condemn all acts of terrorism.  Regrettably, such calls continued to go unanswered,  Mladenov said.  Mladenov again warned the council that Gaza, controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement, was a  tinderbox.    Two million Palestinians in Gaza can no longer be held hostage by divisions,  he said.  For a decade they have lived under the control of Hamas. They have had to deal with crippling Israeli closures, Palestinian divisions and have lived through three devastating conflicts.  U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who has accused the Security Council of  bashing Israel,  called on the body to address the threat of Hamas.   Every ounce of what we do should be against Hamas. They are a dangerous actor who has no care for the Palestinians, no care for the Israelis, and they are determined to destroy everything in their path,  Haley said.  The United States traditionally shields Israel, Washington's long-time ally that receives more than $3 billion in annual U.S. military aid, from council action. The five council veto powers are the United States, Russia, France, Britain and China. The December resolution, put forward by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal a day after Egypt withdrew it under pressure from Israel and Trump, was the first adopted by on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years.

Last week, Boeing announced its defense business would cut about 50 executive positions as it removed a layer of management and reorganized into seven business units instead of five. Leanne Caret, the CEO of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security business, said in an interview at the Paris Airshow landing a big defense contract has been elusive for Boeing. Caret, who became the head of the unit in February 2016, said she was excited about competing in four franchise-making programs and work in the classified realm.  Specifically, Caret had her sights set on the next U.S. supersonic training jet competition, known as the T-X as well as the new intercontinental ballistic missile weapons system competition, known as the ground-based strategic deterrent (GBSD).  Boeing's defense unit is also competing for the U.S. Air Force's flying command and targeting center, the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). Caret also said Boeing was keen for a win in the MQ-25 project, an unmanned aircraft to assist U.S. Navy's carrier's with surveillance around the ship. Caret, a second-generation Boeing employee who said she  bleeds  Boeing blue , is looking at opportunities to work on several classified projects as well. Boeing's defense business accounted for nearly a third of the company's total revenue in 2016.

Otto Warmbier, 22, died at a hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio on Monday, a week after being released from North Korea in a coma. Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, speaking in his first interview since taking up the post in February, declined to comment specifically about Warmbier's case or the fate of other American, South Korean and Canadian detainees still held by his country. But he firmly rejected two statements issued last week by Tomas Ojea-Quintana, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, about detainees and stalled family reunions between Koreans on both sides of the divided peninsula.  His remarks are unacceptable and distorting realities,  Han told Reuters at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) diplomatic mission along Lake Geneva. Ojea-Quintana had called on Pyongyang on Friday to explain why Warmbier was in a coma when he was returned home after being  denied access to legal and consular services. The U.N. expert said his crime of stealing an item bearing a propaganda slogan seemed  disproportionate  to the 15-year prison term.

Ojea-Quintana said that  time is running out  for many elderly Koreans keen to see relatives separated since the 1950-53 war and backed Seoul's proposal to resume them in August. He said North Korea had demanded the return of 13 North Korean workers  resettled in Seoul , as a precondition to further talks on reunions, halted in Oct. 2015.  If the issue of the reunion of families is to be resolved properly, the one who is responsible for the unheard-of abduction of DPRK (North Korean) citizens should be brought to international justice...and the South Korean authorities should repatriate the DPRK women abductees to their parents without further delay.

Moon, who is scheduled to visit Washington next week for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, also told CBS in an interview that he hoped to draw North Korea into negotiations on its nuclear program by the end of the year, while talks with the United States about military options could wait. Dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the start of last year and Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland have put North Korea at the forefront of global security concerns. Moon's remarks on CBS's  This Morning  program came the day after the death of Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old American student who had been held prisoner in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier died at a Cincinnati hospital just days after North Korea released him from captivity in a coma. Moon said that while  we cannot know for sure that North Korea killed Mr. Warmbier ... I believe it is quite clear that they have a heavy responsibility in the process that led to Mr. Warmbier's death.   I believe we must now have the perception that North Korea is an irrational regime,  said Moon, who was elected in May.  Even today, there are many Korean nationals and American citizens who are detained in North Korea,  Moon said.  I also urge North Korea to return these people to their families.   North Korea has detained two Korean-American academics and a missionary, a Canadian pastor and three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work there. Japan says at least several dozen of its nationals are being held in the country.  Moon, who was elected on a plan to engage in talks with North Korea, said he agreed with Trump on being willing to participate in a dialogue with North Korea under certain conditions, given that sanctions and international pressure have not resolved the situation.  First we must vie for a freeze of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs,  Moon said.  And then, as a second phase, try to achieve the complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program. And I believe there are voices supporting such a step-by-step approach even within the United States.   Signaling a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump said earlier this year that he was willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.  He mentioned that it would be an honor to be able to meet Kim Jong Un,  Moon told CBS.  So I believe President Trump went much further than I did.  Conflicting Rhetoric Trump has delivered conflicting rhetoric on North Korea and its leader, whom he has called a  madman with nuclear weapons.  On Monday, he blamed the  brutality of the North Korean regime  for Warmbier's death. Warmbier was arrested while visiting North Korea as a tourist and accused of trying to steal a propaganda slogan, according to North Korean media. Doctors caring for him last week described him as having extensive brain damage that left him in a state of  unresponsive wakefulness.  North Korea said last month that it was its sovereign right to  ruthlessly punish  U.S. citizens it had detained for crimes against the state. Warmbier's death has shocked many Americans, making any direct U.S. contact with North Korea politically risky any time soon.  A Japanese diplomat said Warmbier's death showed that now was not the time to talk to North Korea and that allies must maintain unity in pressuring Pyongyang with sanctions.  We must not show them a weakness or a gap in our united front that they would exploit for their own purposes,  said the diplomat, who requested anonymity. North Korea will dominate Moon's June 29-30 summit with Trump. Pyongyang has continued to test-fire missiles since Moon took office, despite his pledges to engage in dialogue. Asked about the possibility of pre-emptive strikes against Pyongyang, Moon told CBS the issue could be raised at the summit with Trump, but such discussions were more likely to come later.      This is something we may be able to discuss at a later stage when the threat has become even more urgent,  he said, adding that the North Korea nuclear missile threat was a matter of life or death for the South Koreans who live next door. He said that if Trump could resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and overall greater security in northeastern Asia, it would probably be the U.S. president's greatest diplomatic achievement.

His family has said that Warmbier lapsed into a coma in March 2016, shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea. Physicians at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he died, said last Thursday that Warmbier showed no sign of understanding language or awareness of his surroundings, and had made no  purposeful movements or behaviors,  though he was breathing on his own. There was no immediate word from Warmbier's family on the cause of his death. The circumstances of his detention in North Korea and what medical treatment he may have received there remained a mystery, but relatives have said his condition suggested that he had been  physically abused by his captors.

Doctors who examined Otto Warmbier after his release said there was no sign of botulism in his system. Warmbier was freed after the U.S. State Department's special envoy on North Korea, Joseph Yun, traveled to Pyongyang and demanded the student's release on humanitarian grounds, capping a flurry of secret diplomatic contacts, a U.S. official said last week.

Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae, who spent two years in North Korean captivity before his release in 2014, expressed sadness at Warmbier's death, calling it an  outrage .  I cannot understand what the Warmbier family is feeling right now. But I mourn with them, and I pray for them,  Bae said in a statement. Young Pioneer Tours, the group with which Warmbier traveled to North Korea, will no longer be organizing tours for U.S. citizens to the isolated country, Troy Collings, a company director, said in a statement. Two of the other largest agencies to take Western tourists to North Korea also said they were reconsidering taking U.S. tourists. Uri Tours, which is based in New Jersey, said on its website it was “reviewing its position on DPRK travel for American citizens”. DPRK is short for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official title. Beijing-based Koryo Tours said it was also reviewing whether or not to take U.S. citizens on tours to North Korea. “This young man did not deserve the disproportionate sentence given to him,” the company said in a statement. “What followed was a disgrace, which we categorically condemn - from the paucity of information provided during his detention, and the worrying lack of consular visits, to the distressing and horrifying condition in which he was returned to his family.” Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by David Alexander and David Brunnstrom in Washington, and Christian Shepherd in Beijing, Ju-min Park and James Pearson in Seoul, Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago; and Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Toni Reinhold","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea-detainee-idUSKBN19A2TW"},

Last week, Boeing announced its defence business would cut about 50 executive positions as it removed a layer of management and reorganized into seven business units instead of five. Leanne Caret, the CEO of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security business, said in an interview at the Paris Airshow landing a big defence contract has been elusive for Boeing. Caret, who became the head of the unit in February 2016, said she was excited about competing in four franchise-making programmes and work in the classified realm. Specifically, Caret had her sights set on the next U.S. supersonic training jet competition, known as the T-X as well as the new intercontinental ballistic missile weapons system competition, known as the ground-based strategic deterrent (GBSD). Boeing's defence unit is also competing for the U.S. Air Force's flying command and targeting centre, the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). Caret also said Boeing was keen for a win in the MQ-25 project, an unmanned aircraft to assist U.S. Navy's carrier's with surveillance around the ship. Caret, a second-generation Boeing employee who said she bleeds  Boeing blue , is looking at opportunities to work on several classified projects as well. Boeing's defence business accounted for nearly a third of the company's total revenue in 2016. The reorganization, aimed at making Boeing more agile and responsive to customer needs will be effective on July 1.

Chief executive Andy Palmer said the decision was taken after a team of Aston Martin engineers went to China in May to investigate a problem that several customers there had been complaining about since 2014.  Normally (recalls) start in America. I don't think it is the only example, but it's interesting that it started from China and becomes a global recall,  Palmer told Reuters by telephone.  It demonstrates the importance of China, the sophistication of the customer and the diligence of the authority there.   The luxury carmaker, famous for making the car driven by secret agent James Bond, sold 3,259 cars globally last year, nearly 8 percent of them in China.     Aston Martin's plan was conveyed on Tuesday to Chinese regulatory agencies that had taken up the issue after dissatisfied customers complained. Formal documents would be submitted by the end of the European day, Palmer said. Chinese authorities did not respond to a request for comment. The global recall will be unwelcome publicity for a company that has said for years it wants to go public. It reported its first Q1 profit in a decade in May.  Palmer did not say how much the recall would cost, but knowledgeable people close to the company estimated the total cost at around 300,000 pounds ($380,760). The recall will cover 1,658 Vantage cars built between June 2010 and September 2013 with the Sportshift I and Sportshift II automated manual transmission gearboxes, including 113 that were sold in China. The Vantage is the only Aston Martin model with a semi-manual shift. Failure to Reset  Palmer said the problem occurred because some dealerships in China failed to reset the clutch position after software updates to the automatic transmission system. “In the normal course of events, when you make a software change, you have to re-teach the engagement position of the clutch. And most of our dealers around the world automatically did that,” he said.  If the clutch is not re-taught the biting point - the point when the clutch plate engages with the engine plate -  it's possible that a car could initially stall while in operation , he said. Aston Martin sent its engineers to China after it tried and failed to replicate the stalling problem in its own engineering laboratories. When they arrived, they discovered that some cars suffered unusual noise and vibration, and in worst cases an engine stall, after the new software was installed. The stalling caused a complete loss of power in some cases, shutting off the engine and power to the electrically-assisted steering and brakes, making it extremely difficult for a driver to guide the car safely to a stop.  The Aston Martin logo is seen at a car repair workshop in Beijing, China June 19, 2017.Thomas PeterGiven that dealers and customers in China may have less experience operating and maintaining supercars like Aston Martins, Palmer said the company should have spelt out to dealerships what they needed to do. “I blame us,” Palmer said. “Basically we should have explicitly said within the service action for the software that we should re-teach the clutch. We didn’t explicitly say that. Therefore we take responsibility for fixing it.” Palmer, who joined Aston Martin from Nissan Motor Co in late 2014, said the company knows of 21 instances of potential sudden engine stall, all in China. The fluid pipe connectors on the gearboxes would also be replaced during the recall, he said. Three years ago Aston Martin recalled most of the cars sold in China that had been built since 2007 after discovering a problem with defective throttle pedals, which it blamed on Chinese subcontractors using counterfeit plastic material.  Too Dangerous  Slideshow (6 Images)The Beijing branch of China's product quality watchdog - the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) - in January last year asked the company to investigate the issue and report back. AQSIQ's Defective Product Administrative Center opened its own investigation in April. Also in April, China's Consumers Association issued a statement saying that there were enough incidents of the Vantage stalling to warrant a recall. Carson Guo and his brother James lost their licensed dealership with Aston Martin in Beijing in December 2016 after fielding complaints from customers about stalling cars. Of the eight customers who complained, six had bought Vantages. Carson Guo told Reuters several customers waged a campaign against the British carmaker via Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, and at least two received a refund. One of the knowledgeable individuals close to Aston Martin said the Guos' contract was terminated due to a  significant reduction in sales through that outlet . Zhang Jia'ao, a 32-year-old partner at a Beijing-based venture capital firm, did not get a refund. He told Reuters he bought his Vantage S coupe from the Guo dealership for 2.35 million yuan ($344,287) in 2013, and sold it 11 months later to a used-car dealer for 1.23 million yuan ($180,201) after a series of stalls, some at high speed.  On one occasion, following a complete loss of power, Zhang  only managed to slow the car down by repeatedly bumping the tires against the kerb, he said.      It was too dangerous,  Zhang said. Asked about the problems Zhang encountered, Simon Sproule, chief marketing officer at Aston Martin Lagonda, said:  The recall will ensure that any issues with this car are fixed.

Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making.                  On Monday, New York Fed President William Dudley said halting the rate-hiking cycle now would imperil the economy, and unemployment at 4.3 percent now and inflation at 1.5 percent were  a pretty good place to be.”                  “The more the Fed beats in this relentlessly hawkish message, the more the yield curve just ends up flattening on it,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                flattened to 96 basis points on Tuesday, the lowest since December 2007.     The yield curve has flattened as the Fed’s hawkishness contrasts with weakening inflation.     Data last Wednesday showed that the so-called core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out food and energy costs, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year in May, the smallest rise since May 2015.                  That measure has fallen from a year-on-year rise of 2.2 percent in February.                  “The Fed has been talking much more hawkishly than the past in the context of the recent data,” said Kohli. “It’s not that the levels are disturbing, it’s that the trend is really disturbing.”     Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Tuesday that he is increasingly concerned about a recent softness in inflation and whether price pressures will reach the U.S. central bank's 2 percent objective.                  Five-year note yields           , which are among the most sensitive to Fed policy, have jumped to 1.76 percent from a six-month low of 1.67 percent on Wednesday, before the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the second time in three months.     Thirty-year bond yields            , which are most influenced by inflation expectations, by contrast have tumbled to 2.74 percent from 2.80 percent after the Fed’s rate hike last week.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were last up 8/32 in price to yield 2.16 percent, down from 2.19 percent late on Monday.

New York Fed President William Dudley said on Monday that labor market tightness should help drive up inflation, reinforcing the message that recent weak data was unlikely to derail plans to keep raising interest rates.                  The greenback        had a further lift on Tuesday following dovish comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.                  Also on Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere posed financial stability risks.                  And voting member Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he was concerned about recent softness in inflation.                   It (another U.S. rate hike) is not entirely unlikely. Gold from now to the end of the year could see slight drops, especially if (on top of Fed hikes) the European Central Bank starts tapering its bond buying program,  said Natixis analyst Bernard Dahdah.     Spot gold        was down 0.03 percent at $1,242.36 an ounce by 2:35 p.m. EDT (1835 GMT), after touching a low of $1,241, the weakest since May 17.     U.S. gold futures         settled down 0.3 percent at $1,243.50.      We're going to be living with interest rate increases for quite some time,  said George Milling-Stanley, head of Gold Strategy at State Street Global Advisors, adding that he expected  fairly regular  small rate hikes.      We haven't yet had a post-hike bounce but I believe we will have it.      Investors are pricing in a roughly 50 percent chance that rates will be raised again by the year-end, according to CME FedWatch. A strong dollar makes dollar-priced gold costlier for non-U.S. investors.        The market attributes considerable weight to Dudley's words, as he represents the majority opinion of the Federal Open Markets Committee,  said Commerzbank in a note.     In the wider markets, oil prices fell to seven-month lows and dragged global equities off all-time highs, limiting losses in gold which is seen as an alternative investment to volatile stocks.      The next key level of support sits around $1,240, with a broad extension to the 200-day moving average around $1,237,  MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note.

It includes the affirmation of Avon International Operations, Inc.'s IDR at 'B+', which was omitted from the original release. Fitch Ratings has affirmed Avon Products, Inc.'s (Avon) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak Operating Trends: Avon's operating results have been on a declining trajectory over the past five years. Two of the key metrics that demonstrate the health of a direct-selling organization, representative base and volume growth, have shown continued declines. Avon has taken some positive steps, targeting operating margin improvement through a three-year  Transformation Plan , and selling a majority stake in the low-margin, EBITDA-neutral North American business in 2016, which allows Avon to focus on more profitable geographies. Turnaround Visibility: Avon's recently reported first quarter showed a 2% increase in revenue (-1% constant currency). It was Avon's first quarter of positive growth since 3Q11 (including currency impact). Fitch notes that the growth is a result of higher price mix, as units sold continue to decline. Margins continue to be challenged as Avon invests back in advertising and contends with significantly higher bad-debt expense out of Brazil. The company does appear to be on track with its Transformation Plan which delivered $120 million in savings in 2016, ahead of expectations. FX, Emerging Markets Exposure: Avon is one of the most geographically diverse companies, selling to 57 countries and territories. Avon's top 10 markets, mostly Emerging Markets, account for 70% of revenue. Latin America represents 52% of revenue, with Brazil, the single largest market, contributing 21% of 2016's total revenue. Negative FX translation has had an outsized impact on Avon's financials as most of its cash flows and profits are generated outside the U.S.; economic and political volatility can also have a significant impact. Direct-Selling Model Challenge: The beauty industry is structurally attractive and tends to be a resilient category throughout economic cycles. Beauty & Personal Care categories reached $426 billion in annual sales globally and Direct Selling reached $131 billion in 2015. With the channel shift towards e-commerce and specialty stores, Avon, the world's #1 direct selling beauty company, is facing intensified competition from multi-national beauty giants who are implementing omni-channel strategies, as well as smaller, nimbler, fast-growing companies. Improved Financial Resiliency: The divestiture of the Liz Earle business in 2015, sale of preferred stock, and partial sale of the North American business in 2016 to Cerberus, enabled Avon to raise liquidity and improve its capital structure, by repaying its 2016 notes and extending its maturity profile. No long-term debt is due until March 2019. In 2016, Avon reduced debt by approximately $260 million. The Cerberus investment and dividend suspension provided Avon with incremental liquidity. Fitch expects Total Debt/EBITDA to remain within 4x-5x over the next three years. DERIVATION SUMMARY Avon's IDR reflects its sizable scale as a leading direct-selling beauty company with $5.7 billion revenue in 2016 and its well-recognized brand in the beauty industry. However, its operating results have been on a declining trajectory in recent years as the company faces challenges from its direct-selling model, emerging market exposure, and FX headwinds. The Negative Outlook continues to reflect the company's declining EBITDA trend, due to its challenged business model and exposure to weak markets such as Brazil and Russia. Fitch's recovery analysis assumes $400 million going-concern EBITDA, which represents approximately a 22% haircut to Avon's 2016 EBITDA of $510 million and a recovery multiple of 4x, driving an estimated enterprise value (EV) of $1.6 billion. The going-concern EBITDA reflects continued decline in Avon's key markets, deteriorating margin due to competitive pressure, and business model weakness. The recovery multiple of 4x EV/EBITDA multiple is at the low end of recent consumer products transactions but considers Avon's operating challenges. Avon is currently trading at 6x-7x EV/LTM EBITDA range. Avon International's senior secured revolver and senior secured notes are expected to have outstanding recovery prospects (91% - 100%) and as such are rated 'BB+/RR1' with 100% recovery prospect. The revolver and senior secured notes are secured by Avon International Operations, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Avon, and are guaranteed by Avon. Avon's senior unsecured notes are expected to have average recovery prospects (31% - 50%) and are rated 'B+/RR4' with a 39% recovery prospect. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue is expected to grow at very low-single-digit rates, primarily driven by pricing mix, barring further currency movements --EBITDA (Fitch adjusted), which was approximately $510 million in 2016, is projected to temporarily decline to approximately $470 million in 2017, due primarily to upfront investment in Avon's Transformational Plan. Fitch expects that the combination of modest revenue growth and expense management will drive EBITDA towards the mid-$500 million level by 2020. --FCF is expected to be slightly negative in 2017 and turn positive from 2018 onward given the completion of the Transformation Plan and its associated cash costs in 2017. Fitch assumes the company's dividend remains suspended throughout the forecast period. --Leverage, which was 4.2x in 2016, is expected to increase to mid-4x in 2017 on lower EBITDA, and improve toward 4.0x thereafter on EBITDA improvement and some debt paydown. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Stabilization of the Outlook is based on sustaining flat-to-modestly positive representative growth as well as low-single-digit organic growth; --While pricing may drive the bulk of organic growth in the near term, Fitch expects positive volume to also be a contributor. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Continued sales declines; --EBITDA sustained below $500 million after 2017; --Reduced confidence in positive FCF after 2017; --Sustained increases in leverage over 5x; --Currency challenges in significant markets such as Brazil and Russia. Avon's debt is dollar-based and cash flow for debt service is generated offshore. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: As of March 31, 2017, Avon had cash on the balance sheet of $560 million, and $356 million in revolver availability (after netting out $44 million outstanding letters of credit). The senior secured revolving credit facility (RCF)  has total capacity of $400 million and expires in June 2020, provided that it terminates on the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 6.50% notes due 2019 and the 4.60% notes due 2020, if on the 91st day, the applicable notes are not redeemed, repaid, discharged or otherwise refinanced in full. This facility is secured on a first-priority lien basis by substantially all of the assets of Avon International Operations (AIO, the wholly-owned domestic subsidiary) and the subsidiary guarantors. Capital Structure: As of March 31, 2017, Avon had total debt of $2.13 billion, including an undrawn revolver with capacity of $400 million, $500 million in senior secured bonds due 2022, $1.4 billion of senior unsecured bonds, and $450.4 million of preferred stock to which Fitch assigned 50% equity credit. AIO is the borrower for the revolving credit facility as well as the senior secured notes, whereas the senior unsecured notes are obligations of the parent, Avon Products Inc. The RCF contains a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio. Avon was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2017. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Avon Products, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'B+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'B+/RR4'. In addition, Fitch has withdrawn Avon Products, Inc.'s Short-Term IDR of 'B' as the company no longer has a commercial paper program. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Avon International Operations, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'B+'; --Senior secured revolver at 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured notes at 'BB+/RR1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and Daoist representatives met indigenous peoples in Oslo to explore moral and ethical arguments to shield forests that are under threat from logging and land clearance for farms. Organizers said the Oslo Interfaith Rainforest Initiative from June 19-21 was the first to gather religious and indigenous peoples to seek out common ground to protect forests. They hope to organize a summit in 2018.  Without the forests we don't have life,  said Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  If we continue to do this deforestation it's like suicide.  Din Syamsuddin, an Indonesian Muslim leader, called for new technologies and changes of lifestyles to protect forests.  A true believer should maintain the balance with nature,  he said. Norwegian Climate and Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen, a host of the talks, said forests were homes and a source of income to millions of people, as well as habitats for creatures from tigers to birds of paradise. He said rainforests were also a giant natural store of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas from burning fossil fuels. Trees release the gas when they rot or are burnt to make way for farms, such as for cattle or palm oil plantations.

Many countries have reaffirmed support for the 2015 Paris pact to phase out greenhouse gas emissions after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans on June 1 to pull out, saying he wants to promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry. Slideshow (5 Images)Many speakers noted that a  tree of life  is a part of many religious traditions.   Trees don't have only ecological value for us, but also cultural value for us. Every tree,  said Joseph Itongwa of Democratic Republic of Congo, a representative of indigenous peoples in Africa. The net extent of the world's forests shrank by 33,000 square km (12,700 square miles) a year from 2010-15, about the size of Belgium, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization says.  The rate is about half that of the 1990s. Mary Evelyn Tucker, director of Yale University's forum on Religion and Ecology, said religious groups such as the World Council of Churches were seeking ever more to restrict investments in areas that damage the environment.

Doubts persist whether it is possible due to the divides within the Republican party and its acrimony with Democrats, analysts said.  There might be tax reform this year,  said Stan Shipley, strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.  But that's a brave assumption.  The index that tracks the greenback versus six currencies was up 0.3 percent at 97.800 after touching 97.871 earlier Tuesday, which was the highest since May 18. The euro fell to a three-week low of $1.1117, while the dollar reached 111.86 yen, the highest since May 26, Reuters data showed. The dollar fared best against the British pound among major currencies. It gained after BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise UK interest rates. Last week three BoE policymakers had voted in favour of a rate hike.[GBP/] Carney warned of weak wage growth and a likely hit to incomes as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, sending sterling to a two-month low of $1.2603, down 0.9 percent.

New Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and newly appointed Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe have proposed the plans to free up spending for infrastructure projects in a country that remains one of the most indebted in the euro zone.  Investors are asking about Brexit, they are asking about Irish economic growth… but we're not getting questions on the debt reduction target,  Frank O'Connor told Reuters at the sidelines of a Euromoney event in London.  There is a debate in Ireland about our infrastructure needs and how you address that in an environment where you've come through a period of elevated debt.  But it is very early days for the new government, and it is not in the forefront of investors' minds. You will have to wait and see some policy before it will become a bigger topic.  Donohoe, who was promoted to the post of finance minister last week, told Reuters on Saturday that he would review the planned pace and start date of a contingency reserve or  rainy day fund  that is set to kick in from 2019. He also backed Varadkar's plans to free up additional resources by setting a less ambitious debt reduction target than the one set last year, a policy that was questioned by the chief economist in Donohoe's department this week. Ireland's economy has grown faster than any other in the European Union for the past three years but its capital spending remains among the lowest in the bloc after grinding to a near halt during a financial crisis that swelled the national debt.

Like its bulge-bracket rival, the investment bank run by Richard Handler seems to have steadied its bond-trading business. Its latest earnings, released on Tuesday, also got a boost from underwriting that should bode well for the rest of Wall Street. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman, though, has so far done a better job turning progress into profit. Both banks restructured their fixed-income divisions a couple of years back after some volatile quarterly swings in revenue. Jefferies, which had bulked up after the financial crisis left larger peers reeling, changed its unit’s management and dumped a futures business a year or so after buying it. Morgan Stanley, after several stalled attempts to get the unit on track, put equities chief Ted Pick in charge and slashed a quarter of the workforce. The two firms' top lines still jump around, but not by as much. Morgan Stanley, in fact, has often grown faster than rivals and in each of the past four quarters has handily beaten its target of generating $1 billion of revenue from fixed-income trading. The far smaller Jefferies, with just under $160 million of fixed-income trading revenue in its quarter to May, still has work to do as the top line for the segment fell by a third from the same period last year. As a result, the firm's overall trading revenue, excluding a gain on its stake in KCG, was almost 18 percent lower. That’s a bigger slump than the 10 to 15 percent drop for the three months to June that executives at Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan have foreshadowed in recent weeks – but not by much. Handler, though, still can’t crank out decent profitability, even with a near-threefold jump in bond underwriting fees last quarter. Jefferies' annualized return on equity was just 5 percent for the period. Morgan Stanley managed double that in the quarter to March, thus covering its cost of capital. Gorman, of course, has more levers to pull, not least in Morgan Stanley's wealth-management division. Accounting for just a quarter of parent Leucadia's overall revenue may give Jefferies some breathing room. But Handler needs to pick up the pace.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Novartis said the trials showed its RTH258 drug would reduce the injection burden for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Novartis shares were up 0.8 percent, with analysts saying the trial results gave RTH258 a competitive advantage over rival treatments. Head-to-head late-stage trials showed RTH258, which goes by the generic name brolucizumab, worked as well as Regeneron's Eylea, with just over half the patients needing doses every 12 weeks, rather than every eight weeks for Eylea. While the data appeared to be negative for Regeneron, its shares surprisingly surged 6.7 percent to $503.59, a level not seen since February 2016. Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges said the data removes an uncertainly for Regeneron investors who had been on the sidelines and were now looking to take advantage of the positive sales trajectory of Dupixent, the company's recently approved treatment for severe atopic dermatitis.  He added that it appeared the potential negative impact of Novartis data was already fully priced into the Regeneron stock. Still, analysts at Jefferies called the trial result  a significant differentiator and competitive advantage for RTH258.  Cutting the frequency of injections could also give RTH258 an edge over Lucentis, a best-selling eye drug that Roche sells in the United States and Novartis sells elsewhere. Lucentis patients generally receive doses every four weeks.  It exceeds our expectations and we're looking forward to filing in 2018  for regulatory approval, Vas Narasimhan, Novartis's drug development chief, said in an interview.   We had hoped to see 40 percent or greater  of patients responding positively to injections every 12 weeks, he said.  Now that we see it well into the 52 to 57 percent range, we feel very good about the result.  Novartis expects eventual annual sales to top $1 billion. Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said the data should help Novartis win back share in a highly lucrative market of 20 million to 25 million patients. Eylea, which was developed with Bayer, has powered much of Regeneron's growth since late 2011. However, the drug's sales growth has slowed, mainly due to competition from Lucentis.  Lucentis topped $3.2 billion in sales in 2016 for Roche and Novartis. Regeneron is betting on Dupixent and its also just approved Kevzara for rheumatoid arthritis, both with blockbuster potential, to reduce its reliance on Eylea, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of its revenue. Competition for nAMD patients is likely to grow even more intense, with data from trials on Abicipar, an investigational medicine being developed by Allergan (AGN.N) and Switzerland's Molecular Partners, set for release in 2018.

The depression symptoms also seem to be worse for men who have both apnea and insomnia compared to men with depression but without this combination of sleep problems, the authors report in the journal Respirology.  “Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are the two most common sleep disorders and can occur together in the same individual,” lead author Dr. Carol Lang, a researcher at the Basil Hetzel Institute at the University of Adelaide Queen Elizabeth Hospital Campus, told Reuters Health. “We know that each of these disorders is individually associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes in patients. However, we don’t know very much about if, or how, the two disorders interact with each other and the health outcomes when they coexist in the same individual,” Lang said in an email. A person with obstructive sleep apnea has their breathing interrupted multiple times during sleep by narrowed or blocked airways. The condition is often treated by wearing a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, mask to keep the airway open. Insomnia was defined in this study as the inability to fall or stay asleep together with feeling fatigued during the day.  Lang and her colleagues enrolled 700 mostly middle aged men in Adelaide with no diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. All of them underwent at-home sleep monitoring known as polysomnography and answered questions about their sleep habits, health conditions and possible depression symptoms.  Researchers found that more than half of the men had undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. In the entire group, 323 men had sleep apnea only, 37 had insomnia only and 47 had both conditions.  Of the men with both sleep apnea and insomnia, 43 percent also had depression, compared with 22 percent of the men who had insomnia alone and 8 percent of the men who had sleep apnea alone.  Sleep deprivation, which may occur in chronic insomnia, is known to adversely affect muscles involved in breathing and may contribute to the propensity and severity of sleep apnea, Lang noted. “There are also many biochemical signaling pathways in the body through which sleep apnea, insomnia, and depression may interact with each other,” she said. If one of the sleep disorders is suspected, primary care providers should consider the possibility of co-existing sleep apnea and insomnia as well as their patient’s mental health, said Lang. “Since some hypnotic medications could potentially be counter-productive, patients should be referred to sleep clinics, and if necessary mental health clinics, for further investigation so that the most appropriate treatment strategy can be implemented for them as an individual,” she said. Our sleep is important for our physical and mental health, Lang added, and a person who experiences sleep problems should talk to a medical practitioner to see if further investigation is necessary.

The vehicle swerved into the group of worshippers, mainly of North and West African origin, after they left prayers in Monday's early hours at the Muslim Welfare House and the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, one of the biggest in Britain. Eleven people were injured. Police said Muslims were clearly the target and Prime Minister Theresa May described it as a  sickening  terrorist attack. A 47-year-old man was restrained by locals at the scene and police later arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder and terrorism offences. He is still being questioned by detectives, and will be held for another three days, police said. Apart from 11 people injured, police were still looking into a possible link between the incident and one death at the scene. The suspect was named by British media as Darren Osborne, 47, a father of four, who lived in the Welsh capital Cardiff. In a statement given to local media on behalf of his family, his nephew Ellis Osborne said:   We are massively shocked; it's unbelievable, it still hasn't really sunk in.  We are devastated for the families, our hearts go out to the people who have been injured. It's madness. It is obviously sheer madness.  Rebecca NadenThe incident at Finsbury Park was the fourth attack in Britain since March and the third to involve a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians. The previous attacks had been blamed on Islamist extremists. The latest attack comes at a tumultuous time for the government with Britain starting complex divorce talks with the European Union and May negotiating with a small Northern Irish party to stay in power after losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election that backfired. An imam from the Muslim Welfare House who stepped in to protect the driver from the angry crowd after the incident was hailed as a hero in British newspapers on Tuesday.  We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him ... and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches,  Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters.  By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm.

Oil prices fell nearly 3 percent to seven-month lows after supply hikes by several key producers overshadowed compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers on a deal to cut global output. That slide weighed down energy stocks on Wall Street and in Europe. The S&P; energy index dropped 1.3 percent as the worst performing of the 11 major S&P; sectors and Europe's oil & gas sector slumped 2.2 percent.  Obviously you go back to the first part of 2016 when oil made a deep dip it dragged a lot of other things with it,  said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  We are starting to get into that area where people are thinking some of the shale exploration is going to go down. That explains weakness in energy stocks.  U.S. crude fell 2.31 percent to $43.18 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.93, down 2.09 percent.

The Dow and benchmark S&P; 500 had hit fresh records on Monday, buoyed by a rebound in the tech sector. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.66 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.54 percent. The U.S. dollar strengthened for a second day, hitting a one-month high of 97.871 against a basket of major currencies as Federal Reserve officials maintained a hawkish tone on hiking interest rates. On Monday, New York Fed President William Dudley said halting the rate-hiking cycle now would imperil the economy. That was followed by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said on Tuesday the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks. In addition, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said he was increasingly concerned that a recent softness in inflation is a sign the Fed will struggle to get price pressures back to its 2 percent objective. The dollar index, tracking the unit against other key world currencies, rose 0.26 percent, with the euro down 0.22 percent to $1.1124. The greenback is up nearly 1 percent for the month. Sterling was last trading at $1.2621, down 0.87 percent on the day. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney doused speculation that he might soon back higher interest rates, telling bankers on Tuesday that he first wanted to see how the economy coped with Brexit talks in coming months.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office charged Barclays Plc and four former executives on Tuesday over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during a 12 billion pound ($15 billion) emergency fundraising in 2008. The bank, whose top management has changed since then, said it is considering its position over the charges which add to pressure on Chief Executive Jes Staley less than three months after regulators put him under investigation. He has repeatedly described its legal cases as being 'legacy issues' that the bank is seeking to put behind it.  While it is not unusual for global banks to have an array of regulatory battles even as business shrinks, competitors, including Deutsche Bank, have been working their way through major cases, especially those from the crisis.   Barclays is facing 21 regulatory investigations and civil actions mainly in the United States and Britain, its 2016 annual report showed. These include major probes by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    It now appears that Barclays are fighting just about all the major regulators of the world,  said Edward Firth, analyst at KBW in a research note on Tuesday.  At some stage this must be a serious distraction to the management of the core business.  Barclays declined to comment on the business impact of the charges. Since Barclays' holding company has been charged rather than any of its subsidiaries its business operations should be shielded from any negative fallout if the holding company is convicted on any of the charges, lawyers said.  But the criminal charges, the first to be levied on a bank anywhere in the world for its conduct during the crisis, could lead to fines.  It could also mean lost business from governments that put a high premium on banks' behavior and which could temporarily halt or reduce business with a lender accused of fraud.   The accusation of fraud could impact Barclays' banking relationships with government and United Nations departments as well as the bank's ability to bid for business from those entities,  said a senior lawyer with expertise in white collar crime who did not wished to be named as his firm works with Barclays. Rivals Could Benefit     Probes by the DoJ and SEC over the Qatar payments are still pending, and center on whether the bank breached U.S. anti-bribery rules. Other major cases include an investigation by the SEC and DoJ into hiring practices in Asia; global probes over alleged manipulation of interest rates and foreign exchange markets; and the DoJ lawsuit alleging fraud over mis-selling of mortgage backed securities. Barclays also faces a civil action by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over alleged manipulation of energy markets in California, and is providing information to the DOJ and Commodity Futures Trading Commission about allegations of precious metals price manipulation.  Barclays now finds itself facing yet another regulatory battle...Skeletons seem to be jumping out of lots of closets at once for Barclays,  said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at online investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.      Rivals have also faced legal battles. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) , for example, is fighting cases with the U.S. DoJ, FHFA and New York State attorney as well as the Swiss Financial Market Authority, UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and an investigation by the Central Bank of Ireland. But others have started to move on. Deutsche Bank, waylaid for years by mounting litigation costs, has cleared several major legal cases in the past year, including settling charges with the DoJ for mis-selling mortgage securities. Swiss bank Credit Suisse(CSGN.S) in December cleared its biggest legal cloud by agreeing a $5.3 billion settlement over its own mortgage-backed securities mis-selling case.  Barclays by contrast is seeing its major legal cases mount. It adopted a more combative stance than its peers over the charges of mis-selling mortgage securities, with the bank contesting the DOJ's claims where rivals have settled. The UK fraud charges also come after the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority opened an investigation into Staley over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. The former JPMorgan banker took over the reins at Barclays in December 2015 and impressed investors by restructuring the bank to remove bad assets and reinvigorate investment banking.  But the investigation raised questions about the American, who put a premium on improving bankers' conduct with a stream of internal messages and training sessions about good behavior. Investors largely shrugged off the news of Tuesday's charges, with the bank's shares falling 2 percent by the end of trading against a 1 percent drop in the STOXX European banks index .SX7P.  Whilst broadly expected, we see this as negative for Barclays as it clearly implies that Barclays failed to reach a settlement (speculated at £100-£200m last week) and that the SFO are looking for a higher fine,  said Firth.

The world's largest brewer, which owns the Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, has sent out first information packages to prospective bidders and has asked for first bids before the summer break, the people said. The sources, who declined to be identified, said the two German brands could fetch as much as 200 million euros ($223 million). They said AB InBev was working with Deutsche Bank on the sale, which would follow its divestiture of SABMiller's European brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, to Japan's Asahi. An AB InBev spokesman confirmed the company was considering the future of the German brands, saying it continuously reviews its portfolio.  We are having discussions regarding the future development of the Diebels and Hasseroeder brands along with their two associated breweries with a limited number of investors that would be able to implement a more focused strategy for these brands,  the spokesman said in an email.  It is very early days and we have nothing further to share at this stage.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Hasseroeder and Diebels, which have combined sales of about 140 million euros, are sold primarily in Germany with little international business. The brands are well integrated into AB InBev's German activities and do not have standalone sales and marketing divisions, making an acquisition challenging for any potential buyer lacking a German presence, the sources said. German brewers such as Bitburger or Radeberger are expected to express interest in Hasseroeder, one of the best-selling brands in Eastern Germany, as well as for Diebels, which is famous for its top-fermented dark Altbier, drunk mainly in Duesseldorf and some neighbouring cities. The German beer market has grown increasingly competitive in recent years as consumer habits change and consumption slows, putting pressure on sales and profits.

Work began today on-site, as I promised, to establish the new settlement,  Netanyahu wrote on his Twitter feed, which included a photograph of mechanical equipment digging into a rocky field. He was referring to the construction of Amichai, which will house some 300 settlers evicted in February from the Amona outpost after Israel's Supreme Court ruled their homes had been built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land. By highlighting the earth-moving work - no date has been announced for actual housing construction - Netanyahu appeared to suggest he believed he had little to fear from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration over settlement building that has drawn Palestinian and international condemnation. During a meeting at the White House in February, Trump asked Netanyahu to  hold back on settlements for a little bit , a request seen as part of an effort to build trust with the Palestinians ahead of a renewed push for peace.      The White House said on Sunday that Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, would arrive in Israel on Wednesday. Jason Greenblatt, a top U.S. national security aide met with Netanyahu on Tuesday, a few hours after his announcement about work starting at the site of the new settlement. Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the ground-breaking  a grave escalation and an attempt to foil efforts by the American administration to revive negotiations , especially (before) the arrival of the U.S. envoys .

Something is happening, but I can't say peace is around the corner.      Slideshow (2 Images)Palestinians regard settlements, around 200 of which have been built over the past 50 years on occupied land that they seek for a state, as obstacles to a viable and contiguous country. Around 400,000 Israelis now live in West Bank settlements, among around 2.8 million Palestinians. When Trump visited Jerusalem on May 22-23, he studiously avoided any mention of settlements, at least in public.  Israel decided in March to build Amichai, which means  My People Live , and in recent weeks it has approved plans for more than 3,000 settler homes elsewhere in the West Bank. Most countries view settlements that Israel has built on land captured in the June 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes that, citing biblical, historical and political links to the West Bank, as well as security interests. The Palestinians want an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem, and also claim historical and political links to the land. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and the territory is now ruled by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office charged Barclays Plc and four former executives on Tuesday over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during a 12 billion pound ($15 billion) emergency fundraising in 2008. The bank, whose top management has changed since then, said it is considering its position over the charges which add to pressure on Chief Executive Jes Staley less than three months after regulators put him under investigation. He has repeatedly described its legal cases as being 'legacy issues' that the bank is seeking to put behind it.  While it is not unusual for global banks to have an array of regulatory battles even as business shrinks, competitors, including Deutsche Bank, have been working their way through major cases, especially those from the crisis.   Barclays is facing 21 regulatory investigations and civil actions mainly in the United States and Britain, its 2016 annual report showed. These include major probes by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    It now appears that Barclays are fighting just about all the major regulators of the world,  said Edward Firth, analyst at KBW in a research note on Tuesday.  At some stage this must be a serious distraction to the management of the core business.  Barclays declined to comment on the business impact of the charges. Since Barclays' holding company has been charged rather than any of its subsidiaries its business operations should be shielded from any negative fallout if the holding company is convicted on any of the charges, lawyers said.  But the criminal charges, the first to be levied on a bank anywhere in the world for its conduct during the crisis, could lead to fines.  It could also mean lost business from governments that put a high premium on banks' behavior and which could temporarily halt or reduce business with a lender accused of fraud.   The accusation of fraud could impact Barclays' banking relationships with government and United Nations departments as well as the bank's ability to bid for business from those entities,  said a senior lawyer with expertise in white collar crime who did not wished to be named as his firm works with Barclays. Rivals Could Benefit     Probes by the DoJ and SEC over the Qatar payments are still pending, and center on whether the bank breached U.S. anti-bribery rules. Other major cases include an investigation by the SEC and DoJ into hiring practices in Asia; global probes over alleged manipulation of interest rates and foreign exchange markets; and the DoJ lawsuit alleging fraud over mis-selling of mortgage backed securities. Barclays also faces a civil action by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over alleged manipulation of energy markets in California, and is providing information to the DOJ and Commodity Futures Trading Commission about allegations of precious metals price manipulation.  Barclays now finds itself facing yet another regulatory battle...Skeletons seem to be jumping out of lots of closets at once for Barclays,  said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at online investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.      Rivals have also faced legal battles. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) , for example, is fighting cases with the U.S. DoJ, FHFA and New York State attorney as well as the Swiss Financial Market Authority, UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and an investigation by the Central Bank of Ireland. But others have started to move on. Deutsche Bank, waylaid for years by mounting litigation costs, has cleared several major legal cases in the past year, including settling charges with the DoJ for mis-selling mortgage securities. Swiss bank Credit Suisse(CSGN.S) in December cleared its biggest legal cloud by agreeing a $5.3 billion settlement over its own mortgage-backed securities mis-selling case.  Barclays by contrast is seeing its major legal cases mount. It adopted a more combative stance than its peers over the charges of mis-selling mortgage securities, with the bank contesting the DOJ's claims where rivals have settled. The UK fraud charges also come after the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority opened an investigation into Staley over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. The former JPMorgan banker took over the reins at Barclays in December 2015 and impressed investors by restructuring the bank to remove bad assets and reinvigorate investment banking.  But the investigation raised questions about the American, who put a premium on improving bankers' conduct with a stream of internal messages and training sessions about good behavior. Investors largely shrugged off the news of Tuesday's charges, with the bank's shares falling 2 percent by the end of trading against a 1 percent drop in the STOXX European banks index .SX7P.  Whilst broadly expected, we see this as negative for Barclays as it clearly implies that Barclays failed to reach a settlement (speculated at £100-£200m last week) and that the SFO are looking for a higher fine,  said Firth.

The vehicle swerved into the group of worshippers, mainly of North and West African origin, after they left prayers in Monday's early hours at the Muslim Welfare House and the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, one of the biggest in Britain. Eleven people were injured. Police said Muslims were clearly the target and Prime Minister Theresa May described it as a  sickening  terrorist attack. A 47-year-old man was restrained by locals at the scene and police later arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder and terrorism offences. He is still being questioned by detectives, and will be held for another three days, police said. Apart from 11 people injured, police were still looking into a possible link between the incident and one death at the scene. The suspect was named by British media as Darren Osborne, 47, a father of four, who lived in the Welsh capital Cardiff. In a statement given to local media on behalf of his family, his nephew Ellis Osborne said:   We are massively shocked; it's unbelievable, it still hasn't really sunk in.  We are devastated for the families, our hearts go out to the people who have been injured. It's madness. It is obviously sheer madness.  Rebecca NadenThe incident at Finsbury Park was the fourth attack in Britain since March and the third to involve a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians. The previous attacks had been blamed on Islamist extremists. The latest attack comes at a tumultuous time for the government with Britain starting complex divorce talks with the European Union and May negotiating with a small Northern Irish party to stay in power after losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election that backfired. An imam from the Muslim Welfare House who stepped in to protect the driver from the angry crowd after the incident was hailed as a hero in British newspapers on Tuesday.  We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him ... and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches,  Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters.  By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm.  Security Minister Ben Wallace said the man was not known to the security services and police said they believed he was acting alone. They were carrying out searches of addresses in Cardiff where the vehicle hire firm that rented out the van was based.

Asked to clarify a remark he made after Monday's opening of talks about not making concessions to Britain, he played it down as a statement of the obvious not to concede arguments at the outset and all the more so because his meeting with Britain's David Davis in Brussels did not launch talks on substance.  My mandate is to defend the single market, defend the European Union, which the United Kingdom has decided to leave,  Barnier told reporters after briefing ministers from EU member states in Luxembourg.  I'm well aware that throughout the process there will be points of compromise.  The Union wanted a  fair deal , he said, renewing a vow not to punish Britain or take  revenge  for a withdrawal that has rocked the bloc and poses huge challenges for negotiators. EU officials and diplomats greeted the agreement of Brexit Secretary Davis to a format and sequencing of talks that had been proposed by Barnier as sign that British Prime Minister Theresa May's weakened and potentially divided government was bending to Brussels' insistence on how negotiations will work.  A very good day -- for us,  one senior EU figure said with a note of triumph after discussions finally began, nearly a year after the Brexit vote and with only 21 months to reach a deal. In public, EU negotiators have kept their satisfaction in check, however, and Barnier was at pains to sound conciliatory. Davis  Crumbled  But in Britain many media portrayed Davis, a veteran Brexit campaigner, as having climbed down from his insistence that the EU must immediately open talks on a future free trade agreement rather than limit negotiations, as they are now, to basic issues of the divorce, such as the rights of expatriate citizens.  Tory David Davis has crumbled on the very first day of Brexit negotiations, as he was forced to agree to the EU's timetable,  wrote the Daily Mirror, a left-leaning tabloid.  The Sun, which backed May's center-right Conservatives in a June 8 election that cost her her parliamentary majority, also noted Davis had gone along with Brussels' plans after saying he would make getting immediate trade talks  the fight of the summer . Germany's Europe minister, Michael Roth, said in Luxembourg that the opening of the negotiations had shown British leaders still needed a  reality check  on what they could achieve. He suggested that calls from some ministers for less of a break from EU markets could see them adjust their trade deal demands. Barnier made clear on Tuesday that while there must be a first phase that excludes trade discussions, he does hope that four weeks of monthly negotiating sessions can get him to the point where he can ask EU leaders in October to let him move on and discuss how the two sides can keep commerce open from 2019. At the same time, while it was a priority, he said, to show progress in averting difficulties for troubled Northern Ireland as a result of being on a new EU-UK border, agreement on how the border would work would depend on wider future trade ties. As a result, Barnier said, there would indeed be discussions on trade in parallel with the EU's other issues -- just not immediately.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY Bonds are senior unsecured obligations of the province to which the province's full faith and credit is pledged. Commercial paper notes are promissory notes ranking equally with Ontario's other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness. KEY RATING DRIVERS FISCAL CONSOLIDATION CONCLUDES: The tabled budget for fiscal 2018 completes the province's plan to eliminate its annual budget deficits by fiscal 2018. Despite some variations to the plan announced in the 2010 budget, the province has remained committed to this fiscal goal. STRONG FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: The province has demonstrated the ability to exert considerable expenditure restraint while instituting revenue changes to achieve its deficit reduction objectives. Maintaining restraint in future fiscal years will remain a key challenge for the province, in Fitch's view, as an elevated debt burden and limited contingency lines otherwise limit its flexibility to absorb a future economic slowdown without added borrowing. SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATED DEFICIT: The province estimates an accumulated deficit equal to 145% of operating revenues in fiscal 2017 (24% of gross domestic product) fueled by the past misalignment between annual revenues and expenditures. The province forecasts continued, gradual declines in the accumulated deficit as a proportion of GDP based on economic growth assumptions. SIZABLE, DIVERSE ECONOMY: The province's diverse economy includes Canada's largest business and financial hub and accounts for 39% of the country's population. Growth in trade, financial services, and education and health care services has expanded the economic base, with manufacturing now a much smaller share. The provincial economy remains heavily linked to that of the U.S. LARGE AND GROWING DEBT BURDEN: The province's debt burden measured by net direct debt to GDP is high, although debt service consumes a manageable 8% of annual revenues. Net debt is likely to grow in fiscals 2018 through 2020 in support of the province's robust infrastructure program, with the forecast decline in debt burden relying on continued economic growth. RATING SENSITIVITIES FISCAL PRUDENCE: The Stable Outlook at the current rating level assumes the province retains its focus on tabling balanced budgets and gradually lowering the burden of debt. The resumption of significant borrowing to support operating deficits would result in negative pressure on the rating. CREDIT PROFILE Ontario's 'AA-' rating is supported by its wealthy, diversified economy and generally sound financial management. The province has concluded its fiscal consolidation program first articulated in its 2010 budget, with a balanced budget tabled for fiscal 2018. Budget balance has been achieved through steady economic and revenue growth, expenditure restraint, introduction of new revenue measures, as well as the sale of provincial assets to fund components of the capital program. The most significant asset sales have occurred over the past year and a half, with approximately 50% of provincial ownership in Hydro One, the province's electricity transmission and distribution utility, sold through public offerings. The province has agreed to sell up to approximately 15 million shares in Hydro One to First Nations which, depending on their participation would reduce provincial ownership to 47.4%. The share sales have provided approximately C$5 billion toward payment of outstanding electricity sector debt and other payables and about C$4 billion toward the province's capital program. The province's asset strategy plan, which includes the sale of shares in Hydro One, is currently on track to net the province C$5.7 billion over time, with funds dedicated to its Trillium Trust. LARGE, DIVERSE ECONOMIC BASE The province is Canada's largest by population, and its diverse economy generates 39% of Canada's GDP. Provincial GDP gains have been steady since the recession. Improved U.S. demand and lower crude oil prices have helped support economic growth in Ontario, with GDP now exceeding national averages; in 2015 GDP rose 2.5% compared to Canada's 0.9%, while 2016 GDP increased by 2.7% compared to national 1.5% growth. In 2016 provincial employment rose 1.1% compared to Canada at 0.7%. Manufacturing, which was severely affected in the last recession, has become a much less significant driver of the province's economy. Other sectors have seen robust growth, including in trade and transportation, financial activities, and education and health services. The province continues to forecast steady economic growth in the medium term, with forecast real GDP rising 2.3% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018. The forecast is currently supported by a favorable export position and federal government stimulus while incorporating the province's recently adopted Fair Housing Plan; a multi-pronged approach to address escalating housing values and housing affordability in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Although some cooling from the plan is evident in recent real estate market data, the risk of a more severe housing market decline remains possible. Downside risks to the forecast remain; these include slower economic growth in the U.S., rising interest rates, pressured housing markets beyond that included in the current forecast, increases in crude oil prices, and financial sector exposure to the resource provinces. FINANCIAL BALANCE OBTAINED BUT SLIM CUSHIONS ARE FORECAST Ontario's fiscal 2010 ended with a C$19.3 billion operating deficit (20% of revenues) and an accumulated financial deficit of almost C$131 billion (136% of revenues). The province adopted a multiyear fiscal consolidation plan with the goal of reaching a balanced budget by fiscal 2018. Despite a setback in fiscal 2014, through fiscal 2017 the province has exceeded its targets. At the close of fiscal 2017, the annual operating deficit is estimated at C$1.5 billion while the accumulated deficit peaks at C$193.5 billion. Fiscal 2017 benefits from the sale of shares in Hydro One, strong performance in the housing market and government enterprises, and above-budget economic growth in 2016, slightly offset by slower economic growth in the first quarter of 2017. Fiscal 2017 expenditures increased modestly over those planned in the 2016 budget. The tabled budget for fiscal 2018 concludes the province's fiscal consolidation with a balanced budget forecast at year-end. Continued economic strength is expected to support core personal income and consumption taxes, with additional receipts from the province's new cap-and-trade program and from federal government infrastructure support. Overall 6.3% growth in operating revenues, inclusive of tax measures and adjustments, exceeds the 4.7% growth in expenditures, including expansive 10.4% growth in other programs that incorporates capital expenditures, programs under the province's new Fair Hydro Plan and climate change initiatives. Expenditures have been expanded to incorporate the Fair Hydro Plan, a multi-year program to reduce household electricity bills through two means: a rebate to residential customers equivalent to the 8% provincial portion of the harmonized sales tax on electricity bills and the refinancing of existing electricity infrastructure. Measures with a fiscal impact are estimated by the province to add $2.5 billion in annual expense over the next three fiscal years. Other program expansions include targeted increases in health care and education, including capital investments. Provincial reserves are expected to remain slim over the near term, with a modest C$600 million set aside in both fiscal years 2018 and 2019. While the province has exemplified significant expenditure controls to resolve budgetary shortfalls and the willingness to raise additional revenue, the slimness of the financial cushion is a credit weakness particularly when confronted by a future economic slowdown. SIGNIFICANT DEBT BURDEN AND ACCUMULATED DEFICIT Achieving its fiscal balance goal of fiscal 2018 has left the province with a sizable accumulated deficit, equal to C$193.5 billion in fiscal 2017, and a debt burden that has reached a substantial 37.8% of GDP. While the province's need to finance fiscal imbalances has dropped off with the fiscal 2018 budget, planned capital continues and outstanding debt is forecast to increase over the medium term. The fiscal 2018 budget provides target dates for achieving the province's long-stated goal of bringing debt-to-GDP to 27%; the budget sets an interim target at 35% in fiscal 2024 and 27% in fiscal 2030. This very slow decline relies almost completely on continued economic growth as total long-term borrowing for infrastructure is expected to escalate over the next few years. Total borrowing in fiscal 2018 is forecast at approximately C$26.4 billion, of which C$13.1 billion is for capital purposes, C$6 billion is to bolster the province's cash position and the remainder largely for repaying debt maturities. Interest on outstanding debt remains manageable, at 8% of expenditures in fiscal 2018.

Dublin launched its long-awaited stock market listing of AIB in May and last week set a price range of between 3.90 euros and 4.90 euros, planning to raise 2.6 billion to 3.3 billion euros from the sale of a 25 percent stake. Pricing was revised to 4.20 euros to 4.60 euros on Tuesday after books were subscribed multiple times within the initial range. The government will receive 3 billion to 3.1 billion euros if the stock prices in the upper half of the new range. As the deal also includes a greenshoe or over-allotment option, the size of the IPO could rise to 28.75 percent if demand proves higher than expected following AIB's debut and boost the state's coffers by around another 450 million euros. The government will use the funds to cut some 1.5 percent from a national debt that at 200 billion euros is still among the highest in the euro zone by most measures. The float will also be one of Europe's largest bank listings since the 2008 financial crisis and is the biggest test yet of investor demand for a banking sector that required the euro zone's most expensive state rescue less than a decade ago. One of Ireland's two dominant lenders, AIB needed a 21 billion euro taxpayer bailout to survive a spectacular property crash, the biggest bill for any Irish bank still trading. But like Ireland's economy, which is growing faster than any other in Europe, the bank has recovered strongly, posting a profit for each of the last three years and becoming the first domestically owned lender to restart dividend since the crash. Order books will close on Thursday with trading set to commence on Friday, the bookrunners said.

The House of Representatives reconvened on Tuesday. It will be in session for the next nine weekdays, along with the Senate, which reconvened on Monday. Both chambers will take a break from July 1-9, then return and work July 10-28. After that, Capitol Hill will be quiet through the annual August vacation. Trump set high expectations as a candidate and early in his presidency, promising to repeal and replace Obamacare, invest in infrastructure and work to cut taxes and regulations. These pledges have helped fuel a powerful stock market rally. Trump's only big domestic policy win, aside from killing a handful of Obama-era regulations, has been Senate approval 10 weeks ago of a new Supreme Court justice. The White House has not sent Congress a legislative proposal on any major issue. Trump has been swamped by investigations into possible ties between his campaign and alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In Congress, the House has approved an Obamacare rollback bill, but it has stalled in the Senate. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence predicted a Republican healthcare bill would be enacted by the end of summer. Competing tax reform plans have divided Republicans in both chambers. No firm infrastructure plan has emerged, and lawmakers have not yet formulated a budget plan for 2018. Urgent budget deadlines will follow the August break, and later in the year, lawmakers will begin focusing on the 2018 congressional elections. Here is a look at key dates coming up. June 20: Special House elections in Georgia and South Carolina. June 30: Congress starts Independence Day break. July 7-8: Trump attends G20 summit in Germany, his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. July 28: Congress adjourns for five-week summer recess. July-August: U.S. Treasury may no longer be able to postpone the federal debt limit, although this may not arrive until late 2017. Sept. 5: Congress reconvenes. Sept. 30: End of federal fiscal year 2017. Without congressional action, funding for many programs will expire. Oct. 1: Start of federal fiscal year 2018. Current federal spending deal expires.

That would pave the way for the German parliament to review and approve the proposed contract in 2018, the spokesman said. He said the future structure of the MDBA-Lockheed partnership was part of the negotiations about the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), which is to replace Germany's Patriot air and missile defense system. The ministry had told lawmakers in March that it remained committed to the program, but did not expect to complete work on the contract during the current legislative period. At the time, it said there was still work to do on the MBDA proposal, and how the overall project would be managed. The ministry spokesman said negotiations about the contract began on May 29.  The MEADS system would help Germany extend its defenses and enhance air and missile defenses from a range of threats at a time when fears of a greater military threat from Russia have prompted NATO to beef up its presence in eastern Europe. Germany selected MEADS in 2015 to replace its Patriot system but it has taken far longer than expected to move forward. Thomas Gottschild, managing director of MBDA Deutschland, confirmed negotiations had begun in late May.   We are aiming for a parliamentary review next year. I am optimistic that we will reach this mutual goal,  he said. The ministry has not given any details about the price of the system. In October, sources had said the proposal came in billions of euros higher than the previous estimate of 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) and lacked some critical details.

The world's largest brewer, which owns the Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, has sent out first information packages to prospective bidders and has asked for first bids before the summer break, the people said. The sources, who declined to be identified, said the two German brands could fetch as much as 200 million euros ($223 million). They said AB InBev was working with Deutsche Bank on the sale, which would follow its divestiture of SABMiller's European brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, to Japan's Asahi. An AB InBev spokesman confirmed the company was considering the future of the German brands, saying it continuously reviews its portfolio.  We are having discussions regarding the future development of the Diebels and Hasseroeder brands along with their two associated breweries with a limited number of investors that would be able to implement a more focused strategy for these brands,  the spokesman said in an email.  It is very early days and we have nothing further to share at this stage.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Hasseroeder and Diebels, which have combined sales of about 140 million euros, are sold primarily in Germany with little international business. The brands are well integrated into AB InBev's German activities and do not have standalone sales and marketing divisions, making an acquisition challenging for any potential buyer lacking a German presence, the sources said. German brewers such as Bitburger or Radeberger are expected to express interest in Hasseroeder, one of the best-selling brands in Eastern Germany, as well as for Diebels, which is famous for its top-fermented dark Altbier, drunk mainly in Duesseldorf and some neighbouring cities. The German beer market has grown increasingly competitive in recent years as consumer habits change and consumption slows, putting pressure on sales and profits.

A day after the launch of the 737 MAX 10 at the world's biggest air show in Paris, United said it would convert an order for 100 other 737 MAX planes to the new model. Gerry Laderman, United senior vice president, said the MAX 10 had  the best economics of the family , a boost for a plane Boeing designed to plug a gap in its range at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets, following runaway sales of the rival Airbus A321neo. The United deal brought the number of MAX 10s covered by air show order announcements to a higher than expected total of more than 320, though more than half were conversions and net new orders and commitments for Boeing stood closer to 160. Despite the interest in the MAX 10, analysts expect passenger jet orders at the Paris Airshow to fall short of recent boom years, as airlines digest a flood of deliveries and manufacturers focus on production targets. But over the longer term, Boeing sees an industry in rude health, forecasting 41,030 passenger and freight plane deliveries worth more than $6 trillion over the next two decades, up from 39,620 in a similar projection a year ago. Boeing's projection includes a 5 percent increase in the 20-year forecast for deliveries of single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, the cash cows of the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers. Boeing now expects 29,530 deliveries in the medium-haul single-aisle category, which is popular with low-cost airlines. In a sign of that interest, aircraft leasing company Avolon announced a provisional deal to buy 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s worth $8.4 billion at list prices and said it would have a  hard look  at possible orders for the MAX 10. Airbus agreed a provisional $5 billion deal with South American low-cost carrier Viva Air for 50 A320 jets, confirming a Reuters report. Boeing's head of airplane developments also said he was  very optimistic  about the chances of establishing the business case for a mid-market jet project to open up new routes from the middle of the next decade. Aviation Services Air travel has been on a sharp uptrend, led by emerging economies as China looks set to replace North America as the world's biggest transport market in the coming years. But China's economic expansion is slowing, even though it remains above 6 percent a year. Boeing trimmed its 20-year forecast for average global traffic growth to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent. Airbus took a similar step in its 20-year forecast earlier this month, though it raised its projection for total deliveries by 6 percent from last year to 34,899 aircraft. Boeing's overall tally is higher partly because it counts aircraft with 90 seats or more, whereas Airbus starts at 100. With demand for new jets cooling, planemakers are seeing greater opportunities in aviation services. Boeing forecast that market could be worth $8.5 trillion over 20 years, growing at an average 4 percent a year. Airbus launched a digital services platform on Tuesday, which it said could crunch data to help airlines improve maintenance, reduce fuel burn and optimise routes. Bigger Not Better? In a symbolic change likely to rankle with its European rival, Boeing ditched its forecast for very large four-engined airplanes such as the Airbus A380 and its own 747-8. For the first time, it lumped these models with large two-engined jets such as the Boeing 777 and the largest Airbus A350. Boeing has long argued that the  very large  category is on its way out as airlines switch to smaller twinjets. Both manufacturers have had to cut production of four-engined jumbos. Airbus insists the double-decker A380 has a future due to airport congestion and predicts 5 percent of aircraft delivered over the next 20 years will be in that category.  They would do that, the 747-8 isn't selling,  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said of Boeing's decision to ditch its separate forecast for the biggest planes.  We have no intention of sharing that market with them, albeit a smaller market than we might have thought.   Traffic is doubling,  he said.  (Boeing's) explanation is we'll fly more flights. I'm sorry, but you can't do it. You have to have bigger aircraft.

The heat wave, brought on by a high-pressure system camped over the Four Corners region, was expected to raise Tuesday's high temperature to a record 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 Celsius) in Phoenix, Arizona, the National Weather Service said.  This typically happens in June where you get a subtropical high (pressure system) that ends up shifting northward,  said meteorologist Bianca Hernandez of the National Weather Service office in Phoenix.  Today is the peak and then tomorrow will be a little bit cooler, but we're still expecting temperatures above 115 for Phoenix,  she said. At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, American Airlines canceled 43 inbound and outbound flights during the peak-heat hours of 3 p.m. through 6 p.m. local time, after cancelling seven on Monday. Passengers may rebook their flights or get full refunds, American said. The airline said it does not expect to cancel any Phoenix flights on Wednesday, but will reevaluate early in the day. The canceled flights are part of the airline's regional flight system, and are operated by other carriers that use Bombardier aircraft which are not permitted to fly when temperatures exceed 118 degrees, American said.  Smaller aircraft, such as those made by Bombardier, are more susceptible to heat, which makes air less dense and reduces lift, than larger, more powerful aircraft.  Phoenix, which tied a record high temperature on Tuesday at 118 degrees, is no stranger to extreme heat. The all-time high temperature for Sky Harbor Airport was 122 degrees on June 26, 1990. In Death Valley in eastern California and in the town of Needles near the Arizona border, the National Weather Service is forecasting high temperatures of 127 degrees Fahrenheit (52.8 Celsius) this week. The National Park Service cautioned tourists there about the  EXTREME SUMMER HEAT  in a warning on its website. It also issued an  Excessive Heat Warning  at the Grand Canyon in Arizona, urging hikers to hydrate themselves and eat salty snacks. Power grid operators and utility companies urged customers to conserve electricity at peak times to avoid the possibility of blackouts. The high pressure system stretched north to Alaska, where it was blamed for creating dry conditions that enabled lightning strikes to start forest fires.

Satellite imagery shows that the center of the disturbance is gradually becoming better defined, and it is likely that the system will become a tropical or subtropical cyclone later today,  the NHC said on Tuesday. The storm, currently designated as  Potential Tropical Cyclone Three,  could also cause tornados later on Tuesday from south-central Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle. Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable on Tuesday morning, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected refineries along the Gulf Coast to get hit with heavy rains, which may result in flooding.  Mars Sour crude was last discussed around a $1.60 a barrel discount to U.S. crude futures, little changed from Monday, while Louisiana Light Sweet crude, the light sweet benchmark, was unchanged at a $1.95 a barrel premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI).  Meanwhile, prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline traded at a 2 cents per gallon discount to the RBOB futures contract, its strongest level in four months.  Meanwhile, southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, tropical storm Bret is expected to begin weakening later Tuesday and dissipate on Thursday.  That storm, located about 315 miles (505 km) east of Curacao and packing maximum sustained winds of 45 miles (75 km) per hour is moving west-northwest and will continue to proceed across the southeastern Caribbean Sea, the hurricane center said. The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.  WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook issued by the company. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, and has an average of 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes every year. The median number of named storms between 1981 and 2010 was 12 per year, according to Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project.

Footage and photos from demonstrations on Monday showed at least three members of the National Guard - a military unit with public order responsibilities - aiming and firing pistols in clashes on a major Caracas highway.  A 17-year-old demonstrator was shot in the chest and died, while several others were injured.  You cannot keep killing people in the street!  opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa shouted during the early-morning protest in the middle-class El Paraiso zone of Caracas.  Who gave the order to shoot?  asked another lawmaker Jose Olivares as soldiers watched silently from inside their base. Venezuelan authorities said two National Guard members had been detained on Monday for what the interior minister called  presumed improper and disproportionate use of force  when thousands of protesters flooded the streets. And President Nicolas Maduro announced that the general in charge of the National Guard, Antonio Benavides, was being replaced by another military man, Sergio Rivero.  Win peace! That is our aim,  Maduro told Rivero, without giving reasons for the change. Opposition leaders accuse Rivero and other military leaders appointed by Maduro of human rights violations during the recent protests.  Generals and admirals that we denounced before the state prosecutors' office for committing atrocities against Venezuelans are being given honors and promotions,  wrote opposition legislator Gabriela Arellano via Twitter. The Defense Ministry and the Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue.

Prensa PJ Diputados/Handout via REUTERSAs well as the fatalities, thousands of people have been injured or arrested since Venezuela's opposition began its latest street campaign against Maduro's socialist government in early April. They accuse Hugo Chavez's successor of becoming a dictator and wrecking the once-prosperous OPEC member's economy, demanding a presidential election to end his rule.  Maduro, 54, narrowly won election in 2013 to replace Chavez after his death from cancer, but has seen his approval rating halve to just above 20 percent during four years of an economic crisis causing hunger and shortages. Victims on All Sides Maduro says  terrorists  and  fascists  are leading the protests in an effort to topple him by force as briefly happened to Chavez in 2002. Government supporters, bystanders and some members of the security forces have also been victims of the violence, with gunshot wounds the most common cause. Though thousands turned out on Monday, many grassroots opposition supporters feel intimidated by the daily violence in cities around Venezuela, where masked youths barricade streets and hurl stones and Molotov cocktails against security forces with tear gas and water cannons. Pro-government gangs with guns sometimes join the fray. There is also some exhaustion setting in within protester ranks after 80 days of what the opposition calls  resistance  and the government terms  armed insurrection . Opposition leaders have, however, vowed to step up tactics to increase pressure on Maduro. They are seeking to halt Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, a move they say is rigged to keep him in power. Chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega has been leading dissent against the plan from within government, earning her a barrage of accusations from officials ranging from corruption to insanity and promoting violence. The Supreme Court on Monday accepted a request by a ruling Socialist Party lawmaker to begin the process of taking her to trial for committing  serious offenses.  Before any trial could take place, the Supreme Court would first have to hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether a trial is warranted.

The heat wave, brought on by a high-pressure system camped over the Four Corners region, was expected to raise Tuesday's high temperature to a record 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 Celsius) in Phoenix, Arizona, the National Weather Service said.  This typically happens in June where you get a subtropical high (pressure system) that ends up shifting northward,  said meteorologist Bianca Hernandez of the National Weather Service office in Phoenix.  Today is the peak and then tomorrow will be a little bit cooler, but we're still expecting temperatures above 115 for Phoenix,  she said. At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, American Airlines canceled 43 inbound and outbound flights during the peak-heat hours of 3 p.m. through 6 p.m. local time, after cancelling seven on Monday. Passengers may rebook their flights or get full refunds, American said. The airline said it does not expect to cancel any Phoenix flights on Wednesday, but will reevaluate early in the day. The canceled flights are part of the airline's regional flight system, and are operated by other carriers that use Bombardier aircraft which are not permitted to fly when temperatures exceed 118 degrees, American said.  Smaller aircraft, such as those made by Bombardier, are more susceptible to heat, which makes air less dense and reduces lift, than larger, more powerful aircraft.  Phoenix, which tied a record high temperature on Tuesday at 118 degrees, is no stranger to extreme heat. The all-time high temperature for Sky Harbor Airport was 122 degrees on June 26, 1990. In Death Valley in eastern California and in the town of Needles near the Arizona border, the National Weather Service is forecasting high temperatures of 127 degrees Fahrenheit (52.8 Celsius) this week. The National Park Service cautioned tourists there about the  EXTREME SUMMER HEAT  in a warning on its website. It also issued an  Excessive Heat Warning  at the Grand Canyon in Arizona, urging hikers to hydrate themselves and eat salty snacks. Power grid operators and utility companies urged customers to conserve electricity at peak times to avoid the possibility of blackouts. The high pressure system stretched north to Alaska, where it was blamed for creating dry conditions that enabled lightning strikes to start forest fires.

Proceeds from the sale will bolster its liquidity and trim outstanding debt on a C$2 billion emergency facility it agreed with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) in April. The expensive bridge financing of C$2 billion provided by HOOPP came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down. That affected the company's ability to originate new mortgages since it could not afford to lend money at lower rates than its cost of borrowing.  Proceeds from the transaction are expected to have an immediate impact by enabling us to enhance our liquidity and reduce the outstanding debt under the company's $2 billion credit facility,  said Interim Chief Executive Bonita Then.  Home Capital said KingSett had agreed to purchase the portfolio for 99.61 percent of its outstanding value, less a share of future losses on the loans. It expects to receive an initial cash payment of C$1.16 billion in the third quarter, equivalent to 97 percent of the value the mortgages. The balance of the payment will depend upon the level of any future losses. Shares of Home Capital rose as much as 6.8 percent on Tuesday and were trading up 4.2 percent at 1325 EST.  We view the terms of this sale favorably and supportive of the high quality of Home Capital's mortgage book,  said Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan.  Home Capital said in April it was pursuing new financing and strategic options, including the possible sale of some assets. Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid.  The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital said last week it agreed a settlement with the OSC and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The company still faces significant hurdles, including securing new long-term funding, finding a permanent chief executive, rebuilding relationships with brokers, and winning back the support of depositors and borrowers.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain have taken measures to isolate Qatar, said the sanctions could last for years unless Doha accepted demands that the Arab powers plan to reveal in coming days. The Saudi-led alliance accused Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer, of  supporting terrorism  and working secretly with Iran, the arch-foe of Saudi Arabia. Qatar denies the accusations.  With what we have prepared, we can stay under the blockade forever, and our gas and oil industries will not be affected,   Qatar Petroleum CEO Saad al-Kaabi said in an interview aired by the Doha-based Al Jazeera satellite network.  We (still) import everything we need for our industries, maybe except some logistical needs, and UAE's port of Jebel Ali will be the biggest loser (in the dispute), not us.  Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land. But after the boycott was announced, Qatar secured deals with suppliers to ship directly to it instead of via Jebel Ali. Al-Kaabi said his small, peninsular country had found alternative ways to export directly from Doha, solving a halt in Qatari helium output. Qatar, the world's second largest helium producer, closed its two helium production plants, run by a subsidiary of state-owned Qatar Petroleum, last week.  Al-Kaabi also said Qatar was still importing whatever it needed despite the boycott, and investors had full confidence in the country, with foreign investments in Qatari oil and gas industries having reached 250 billion riyal ($66.67 billion). Earlier this year, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the world's biggest natural gas field, shared with Iran, in a move to see off an expected rise in competition.  The vast offshore gas field, which Doha calls the North Field and Iran calls South Pars, accounts for nearly all of Qatar's gas output and around 60 percent of its export revenue. The Qatar Petroleum CEO said his country would increase oil production by 10 percent, or 400,000 barrels per day, after boosting North Field GAS? output in the coming 5-7 years.  We are small in size but with big influence...Any disruption in our (gas) production will affect many countries at different levels,  Al-Kaabi said. Qatar has said it will not cut off gas to the UAE despite the diplomatic row and a  force majeure  clause in its contract.

Even after being rejected in the social affairs committee by 10 to 9 votes, the proposal moves to the constitutional and justice committee before its heads to the floor for a full vote, said Ricardo Ferraco, the senator drafting the bill. Ferraco said he expected the bill to be approved by late June.  The surprise setback shows corruption allegations against Temer have eroded congressional support to approve his austerity reforms which are considered key to pulling the economy out of its worst crisis in decades.    The labor reform can still be approved, but this defeat shows the government will have a really hard time to approve its landmark pension reform,  said Juan Jensen, a partner with Sao Paulo-based 4E Consultoria.  This reaffirms our vision that the pension reform will be rejected or diluted beyond recognition,  he added.  Brazilian assets tumbled after the reversal, revealing investors' concerns with Temer's capacity to plug a widening fiscal deficit that has cost Brazil its coveted investment-grade rating.   Temer, who took office last year after the impeachment of leftist Dilma Rousseff, is under investigation over allegations he took millions of dollars in bribes from the world's largest meatpacking company, JBS SA. Temer has denied any wrongdoing. His main ally in Congress, the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, has said they will break away from his coalition if Temer fails to approve the labor and pension reforms. Speaking to reporters in Russia, Temer downplayed the setback, saying he is confident the Senate floor will approve the proposal in coming weeks. For final approval, the labor reform just needs a simple majority on the Senate floor. On the other hand, the controversial pension proposal, which sets a minimum age of retirement and cuts retirement benefits, needs three-fifths of the votes in both the senate and the lower house to be approved.

Republican leaders are trying to move a bill replacing the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law known as Obamacare, to a vote on the Senate floor, possibly as soon as next week.

Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to millions of additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. The House of Representatives already has passed its version of an Obamacare repeal.

The finance ministry offered a two-tranche Eurobond worth $3 billion, it said in a statement. Order books had topped $6.6 billion, a market source familiar with deal details told Reuters  The deal - and investors' enthusiasm - comes just days after the U.S. Senate voted to impose new sanctions on Russia, extending curbs put in place in 2014 to punish Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis. But Russia is celebrating its victory over restrictive geopolitics by selling Eurobonds for the second year in a row. Foreign money managers, including U.S. investors, showed  big interest , Andrey Kostin, the head of Russian state-run bank VTB told reporters in London.  He described the bond as a  normal market deal  Itself under U.S. and European sanctions, VTB is acting as the sole book runner for the Eurobond issue.  So far the investment world has decided that (sanctions are) not a significant factor especially since it's fixed income and there should be significant returns,  Kostin said. There is huge investor demand for high-yielding securities.  Russia's bond comes a day after Argentina - with a credit rating well below Russia's - debuted on the so-called  century bond  market with $2.75 billion of 100-year debt, just over a year after emerging from its latest default.. Andrei Solovyov, head of debt capital markets at VTB Capital, lauded the issue a  success .  Those are the lowest coupon rates in the whole history of Russian sovereign eurobond issues,  he said, adding that the demand toppled $6 billion. He said the biggest part of the issue was bought by foreigners, with U.S. investors accounting for the bulk of it. Debt Levels  Raising $1 billion in a 10-year sovereign Eurobond issue, Russia set final yield guidance at 4.25 percent, nearly twice as high as 2.17 percent offered by 10-year U.S. Treasuries. Yield guidance on its 30-year bond was 5.25 percent Some investors reckon the sanctions may even have boosted the market for Russian Eurobonds, especially as economic sanctions kept Moscow out of international bond markets in 2014 and 2015 and reduced the supply of Russian hard currency debt. Russia's rock-bottom public debt levels are also attractive to investors.  We think the pricing is fair on both tranches, it's good timing for Russia to issue as despite low oil prices there is access to cheap financing. The market thinks their fiscal stance is sustainable,  said JC Sambor, deputy head of EM fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London. Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at Danske Bank said however:  Yields are interesting but not as attractive as they used to be two weeks ago amid fears of new sanctions.  With the sanction pattern generally unchanged from 2016, a Russian deal remains off-bounds for several Western banks and asset managers. In early 2016, some U.S. banks were advised not to help Russia launch the issue. A couple of U.S. banks did not reply to Reuters requests for comment, while a chief economist at one of the U.S. banks said he was not allowed to speak on the matter, even off-record. An investor at a German asset manager said by email his fund would not participate in the primary market.  The reason is more compliance related, since VTB as a sole book runner is a sanctioned entity in the EU, this will make an investment in the primary market a very complicated task,  the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  He said, however, that the fund may consider buying the Eurobonds on the secondary market once trading started.

The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital said last week it agreed a settlement with the OSC and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The company still faces significant hurdles, including securing new long-term funding, finding a permanent chief executive, rebuilding relationships with brokers, and winning back the support of depositors and borrowers.

May is due to launch her program for government on Wednesday but does not yet have the deal she needs to pass it through parliament next week. A snap election intended to strengthen her hand instead left her short of an outright majority and needing the DUP's support. Talks between the two parties, who are largely aligned on domestic issues and Brexit, have dragged on for nearly two weeks, fuelling deep political uncertainty as Britain begins talks on leaving the European Union.

A second DUP source confirmed the account. If May is unable to win a vote on the Queen's speech next Thursday it would be taken as a vote of no confidence and likely end her attempt to form a government to lead the country through two years of arduous negotiations on leaving the EU. Asked about the DUP comments, a Conservative source said the talks were still taking place.  Talks are ongoing with the DUP and we continue to work towards a confidence and supply arrangement,  the source said, adding that the parties had shared objectives on issues like Brexit, fighting terrorism and spreading prosperity.  While our discussions continue, it is important the government gets on with its business.  Earlier on Tuesday, British transport minister Chris Grayling said he was confident of reaching a 'sensible' agreement.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain have taken measures to isolate Qatar, said the sanctions could last for years unless Doha accepted demands that the Arab powers plan to reveal in coming days. The Saudi-led alliance accused Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer, of  supporting terrorism  and working secretly with Iran, the arch-foe of Saudi Arabia. Qatar denies the accusations.  With what we have prepared, we can stay under the blockade forever, and our gas and oil industries will not be affected,   Qatar Petroleum CEO Saad al-Kaabi said in an interview aired by the Doha-based Al Jazeera satellite network.  We (still) import everything we need for our industries, maybe except some logistical needs, and UAE's port of Jebel Ali will be the biggest loser (in the dispute), not us.  Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land. But after the boycott was announced, Qatar secured deals with suppliers to ship directly to it instead of via Jebel Ali. Al-Kaabi said his small, peninsular country had found alternative ways to export directly from Doha, solving a halt in Qatari helium output. Qatar, the world's second largest helium producer, closed its two helium production plants, run by a subsidiary of state-owned Qatar Petroleum, last week.  Al-Kaabi also said Qatar was still importing whatever it needed despite the boycott, and investors had full confidence in the country, with foreign investments in Qatari oil and gas industries having reached 250 billion riyal ($66.67 billion). Earlier this year, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the world's biggest natural gas field, shared with Iran, in a move to see off an expected rise in competition.  The vast offshore gas field, which Doha calls the North Field and Iran calls South Pars, accounts for nearly all of Qatar's gas output and around 60 percent of its export revenue. The Qatar Petroleum CEO said his country would increase oil production by 10 percent, or 400,000 barrels per day, after boosting North Field GAS? output in the coming 5-7 years.  We are small in size but with big influence...Any disruption in our (gas) production will affect many countries at different levels,  Al-Kaabi said. Qatar has said it will not cut off gas to the UAE despite the diplomatic row and a  force majeure  clause in its contract.

Even after being rejected in the social affairs committee by 10 to 9 votes, the proposal moves to the constitutional and justice committee before its heads to the floor for a full vote, said Ricardo Ferraco, the senator drafting the bill. Ferraco said he expected the bill to be approved by late June.  The surprise setback shows corruption allegations against Temer have eroded congressional support to approve his austerity reforms which are considered key to pulling the economy out of its worst crisis in decades.    The labor reform can still be approved, but this defeat shows the government will have a really hard time to approve its landmark pension reform,  said Juan Jensen, a partner with Sao Paulo-based 4E Consultoria.  This reaffirms our vision that the pension reform will be rejected or diluted beyond recognition,  he added.  Brazilian assets tumbled after the reversal, revealing investors' concerns with Temer's capacity to plug a widening fiscal deficit that has cost Brazil its coveted investment-grade rating.   Temer, who took office last year after the impeachment of leftist Dilma Rousseff, is under investigation over allegations he took millions of dollars in bribes from the world's largest meatpacking company, JBS SA. Temer has denied any wrongdoing. His main ally in Congress, the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, has said they will break away from his coalition if Temer fails to approve the labor and pension reforms. Speaking to reporters in Russia, Temer downplayed the setback, saying he is confident the Senate floor will approve the proposal in coming weeks. For final approval, the labor reform just needs a simple majority on the Senate floor. On the other hand, the controversial pension proposal, which sets a minimum age of retirement and cuts retirement benefits, needs three-fifths of the votes in both the senate and the lower house to be approved.

The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations early on Tuesday morning ahead of the storm, but said it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. [nFWN1JH0MO] Exxon Mobil Corp, Phillips 66, and Motiva Enterprises have said the potential storm has not yet impacted operations at its facilities. Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday said some offshore well operations had been suspended but production was currently unaffected. The weather system in the Gulf of Mexico has a 90 percent chance of becoming a tropical storm in the next day or two, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory. Currently located about 265 miles (430 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana, the weather system is expected to approach the southwest Louisiana coast late on Wednesday and move inland over western Louisiana and eastern Texas on Thursday, the hurricane center said. The storm could strengthen slightly before it reaches the coast, the NHC said. It extended warnings for the storm westward to High Island, Texas, and for heavy rainfall across most portions of the Gulf Coast. The weather system now has maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (65 kilometers per hour), the Miami-based forecaster said.  Satellite imagery shows that the center of the disturbance is gradually becoming better defined, and it is likely that the system will become a tropical or subtropical cyclone later today,  the NHC said on Tuesday. The storm, currently designated as  Potential Tropical Cyclone Three,  could also cause tornados later on Tuesday from south-central Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle. Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable on Tuesday morning, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected refineries along the Gulf Coast to get hit with heavy rains, which may result in flooding.  Mars Sour crude was last discussed around a $1.60 a barrel discount to U.S. crude futures, little changed from Monday, while Louisiana Light Sweet crude, the light sweet benchmark, was unchanged at a $1.95 a barrel premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI).  Meanwhile, prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline traded at a 2 cents per gallon discount to the RBOB futures contract, its strongest level in four months.  Meanwhile, southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, tropical storm Bret is expected to begin weakening later Tuesday and dissipate on Thursday.  That storm, located about 315 miles (505 km) east of Curacao and packing maximum sustained winds of 45 miles (75 km) per hour is moving west-northwest and will continue to proceed across the southeastern Caribbean Sea, the hurricane center said. The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.  WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook issued by the company.

We have big expectations with COMAC for this product,  UAC President Yury Slyusar said at the Paris Airshow, adding that he was hopeful about selling more than 600 of the planes over 20 years. UAC was established by a 2006 presidential decree that consolidated Russia's aviation assets and aimed to revive the fortunes of the nation's plane business. It owns Russian brands such as Tupolev, Ilyushin and MiG, as well as Sukhoi's commercial Superjet programme. Slyusar also called for the lifting of Western sanctions from Russia.  We are interested in eliminating, cancelling any sanctions, it would be very useful in the future,  he said in later comments to Reuters. The measures were imposed by the European Union and the United States after Moscow's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. A Russian official earlier said Russian industry had adapted to sanctions by, for instance, building an indigenous capacity to produce parts that had previously come from European firms.

A source close to the investigation said the 31-year-old assailant had sworn allegiance to Islamic State in a letter to his brother-in-law.  Investigators were compiling an inventory of the arms and equipment found in his home. The man, who died in the attack, was also carrying in his car an assault rifle, two pistols, ammunition and two large gas canisters when he rammed a police convoy on Monday.  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the individual first received a permit to possess a gun before he was flagged to intelligence agencies as a potential militant threat. At the time there was no reason to deny him the permit, Philippe said. Philippe said it was  quite possible  the license was active at the time the attacker was on a security watchlist. Three sources close to the investigation confirmed it was.      Nobody can be happy, and certainly not me, that someone who has been flagged to security agencies can continue to benefit from such an authorization,  Philippe told BFM TV. The man was placed on France's so called 'Fiche S' watchlist after he was found to belong to a radical Islamist movement, two police sources said.  Individuals on the list are placed under surveillance though the intensity of that surveillance varies depending on the perceived threat the individual poses. Interpol issued a search notice for the attacker in 2013 on the request of Tunisia but that was no longer active, one source said.  Members of the scientific police inspect a burned car at the scene of an incident in which a car rammed a gendarmerie van on the Champs-Elysees Avenue in Paris, France, June 19, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesArrests Philippe said draft legislation drawn up in May envisaged changes to allow officials who handle gun permits to check if individuals seeking licenses are on a watchlist.  But refusing permits in such cases had its drawbacks, he said.  If you revoke the authorization of someone who is under surveillance, they're going to know why.  On Monday, witnesses saw the man being pulled from the car as thick yellow smoke poured out. Police arrested four of his close relatives in a raid south of Paris late on Monday, a police source said. They included his father and brother. France has been on high alert after a wave of militant Islamist attacks over the past two years, including most recently an attack on police outside the Notre Dame Cathedral and an Islamic State-claimed attack on police on the Champs Elysees in April. In July last year, 86 people were killed when a truck plowed through a crowd in Nice, and similar incidents have occurred in other European cities. Philippe said the government would be presenting a draft law soon to toughen counter-terrorism legislation.  We need to find legal instruments that at once guarantee that we continue to live in a Fifth Republic which safeguards freedoms and ensure the security of French people,  Philippe said.

I think this is going to be an ushering in of the new guys,  four-times Olympic sprint medallist Ato Boldon told Reuters. Long the domain of Olympians Justin Gatlin, LaShawn Merritt and just a few others, U.S. men's sprinting is about to undergo a major change at the Thursday-Sunday meeting in steamy Sacramento, California.  There will be new guys in the 400, the 200 and in the 100,  said Trinidadian Boldon, an analyst for NBC television. Both he and Track & Field News' Dave Johnson say newcomers Christian Coleman (100), Noah Lyles (200) and Fred Kerley (400) are the men to beat in heat set to top 109 degrees Fahrenheit (42 Celsius).   The U.S. has found its next 100 meters star. And the good news, it has also found its next 200 meters star,  said Boldon of Coleman and Lyles. Sunday's 200 meters final could be the race of the meet, Boldon said, as Coleman, who is also running the 100, goes against Lyles, whose only event will be the 200. Coleman, 21, rocketed to the year's fastest 100 (9.82 seconds) during the U.S. collegiate championships and has the second-fastest 200 (19.85). Lyles, 19, ranks third-fastest at 200 meters after a record-breaking indoor season. Kerley, 22, also has come into his own with the three fastest 400 meters of the year, including a breakthrough 43.70 seconds. U.S. indoor champion Ronnie Baker, 23, is another who could challenge the 35-year-old Gatlin for a spot in the 100 meters. Gatlin, the Olympic silver medallist who has been hampered by injuries, must finish in the top three at the cut-throat championships to make the U.S. team for London. He told Reuters he is still the man to beat.  When it comes to trials and nationals I usually step up and am the dominant sprinter,  he said. Merritt is assured a London berth in the 400 meters as the Diamond League champion. He is entered in the 200 at Sacramento. More stability exists in the women's sprints as double Rio medallist Tori Bowie is having the kind of year that could produce double gold at the Aug. 4-13 competition. Collegiate record holder Kyra Jefferson, 22, also is a 200 meters contender. America's most decorated female sprinter, Allyson Felix, will run both the 100 meters and 200, her coach told Reuters. She has a wildcard to London in the 400 meters as world champion - one of eight Americans guaranteed slots as Diamond League or world champions. The United States dominated in Rio and gold medallists Matthew Centrowitz (1,500), Kerron Clement (400m hurdles), Jeff Henderson (long jump), Christian Taylor (triple jump), Ryan Crouser (shot put), Dalilan Muhammad (women's 400m hurdles), Tianna Bartoletta (women's long jump), Michelle Carter (women's shot put) will be in Sacramento.

In court papers filed with the justices, lawyers for the state of Hawaii and individual plaintiffs in Maryland made note of a June 14 memo by the administration amending the executive order to let the government conduct an internal review of vetting procedures for people entering the country. The order signed by Trump on March 6 called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States to give the government time to implement stronger vetting procedures.  This memorandum conclusively severs the already tenuous relationship between the bans and their ostensible rationale by making it clear that the order's travel and refugee restrictions may begin after the vetting reviews are complete,  Hawaii's lawyer, Neal Katyal, wrote. The administration has appealed lower court rulings blocking the travel ban to the Supreme Court and made an emergency request that the justices put the order into effect immediately while the legal battle over its legality continues. A decision by the justices on whether to take up the case and grant the emergency request could come as soon as this week.

Races in Germany and Hungary will also be held on July 22 and 29. The 2018 World Cup final will take place at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on July 15.  Every year there is always a unique thing we’re playing around and next year it has got this unique event, the World Cup final,  Carey said at an FIA Sport Conference in Geneva.  So part of the schedule of having three (races) in a row was because we did not think it was ideal for a promoter to have  an event (go) head-to-head with the World Cup final.  Carey said Formula One management had discussed the situation with promoters before deciding to hold the unprecedented triple-header.  We made sure with our partners that it was manageable,  he added.  I think everybody thought that was manageable and within that schedule (we) did preserve the four-week break in August.  The 2018 calendar has one more race than this year's due to the return of France, after a 10-year absence, and Germany while Malaysia departs. China and Singapore were both listed with asterisks against them, as subject to confirmation with the commercial rights holder, but Carey said there was no concern about those races not happening. He also did not expect the draft calendar to change, as was the case in past years when former supremo Bernie Ecclestone drew it up.  It's just the reality of having agreements that have come up. We're negotiating new agreements, we're having good, constructive discussions, and expect to get there,  Carey said of the two Asian races.  We don't expect it to be 19, we expect it to be 21.

The move by insurance companies to sell holdings in tobacco firms forms part of a drive to pressure governments and companies to do more to limit the damage tobacco can cause to public health. Aviva decided to sell its own holdings in tobacco companies in November and has been divesting since then though it is not selling tobacco investments made on behalf of third-party clients.  We have decided to stop investing in the tobacco sector and will divest over time,  an Aviva spokeswoman said.  We consider tobacco as 'harmful when used as intended', and have been reviewing our investment position for some time now.  The review began in early 2016, she said. Aviva joins French rival AXA (AXAF.PA) and reinsurer SCOR (SCOR.PA), both of which have pledged to divest over the last year, with AXA calling tobacco,  the biggest threat to public health in the world today . Other tobacco-free insurers include France's Covea and Dutch rival Achmea, though many others have yet to follow suit.  Aviva said most of its tobacco-related sales were either complete or underway though it was not possible to give a firm date for when the program would be completed. Most of the remaining assets were fixed-income securities that would either be sold or in some cases held until they matured, the spokeswoman said. FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians walk past an Aviva logo outside the company's head office in the city of London, Britain March 5, 2009.Stephen Hird/File PhotoAt the end of 2016, about 0.25 percent of Aviva's 450 billion pounds of managed assets, which included third-party investments, was in tobacco assets, the spokeswoman said. It was not clear how much money would remain invested in tobacco companies on behalf of third parties. The anti-tobacco campaign has prompted some big name firms to sell their investments, but its overall impact on the share prices of tobacco companies has been limited. In May, 50 leading finance firms representing $3.5 trillion in assets announced their public support for efforts to reduce tobacco use, which the World Health Organisation says costs the world economy $1 trillion a year. Among other high-profile supporters are Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the biggest in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets, the $300 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System and the Irish Sovereign Wealth Fund. Many investors remain reluctant to sell out, however, given the strong returns from the leading tobacco companies, including attractive dividends at a time of low bond yields, as well as the prospect for gains from consolidation in the sector. Shares in the four biggest tobacco companies - Philip Morris (PM.N), Imperial Brands (IMB.L), Japan Tobacco (2914.T) and British American Tobacco (BATS.L) - have risen between 93 percent and 185 percent since 2009, while Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index has climbed 69 percent. Norway's sovereign wealth fund said its decision not to invest in a range of industries had cost it $1.42 billion in returns between 2006 and 2016, with its tobacco divestment the most painful.

A member of the U.S. 4x100 meters relay team, Coleman said the experience motivated him to want to run with the best. Little did the world know how much. The 21-year-old has become not only the fastest collegian ever at 100 meters, but the fastest in the world this year. Only eight men have better times than his 9.82 seconds.  I think the U.S. has found its next 100 meters star,  NBC analyst Ato Boldon, a four-times Olympic medalist, said.  The way he is running he is the closest thing the U.S. has had in a long, long time,  he told Reuters. Coleman will have a chance to prove that this week at the U.S. nationals in Sacramento, California, where he is a solid favorite to make the American team for August's world championships in both the 100 and 200 meters. He not only ranks first in the world in the 100 meters this season, but second in the 200 with a time of 19.85 seconds.  He impresses me not because of his performances but because of his level of fortitude,  Olympic silver medalist Justin Gatlin said.  He is punching on the gas and not letting up.  Already his agents are in discussions with meet organizers for Coleman, who turned professional last week, to run in Europe after the U.S. championships.   He is not afraid of the moment,  said Boldon.         If I am Usain Bolt, I am very concerned about Coleman because I feel like he is not going to have the kind of reverence that a Gatlin, Tyson Gay or Mike Rodgers are going to have for Bolt because he was not around for peak Bolt.  Yet chances are slim the two men will meet outside August's world championships since Jamaican world record holder and Olympic champion Bolt will retire after the London event and is due to run only one race in Europe before that, in Ostrava. Sixth in the 100 meters at last year's U.S. Olympic trials, Coleman ran in the first round of the 4x100 relay in Rio. Back home, he became the only man other than Gatlin to win collegiate titles at both the 60 and 200 meters indoors and 100 and 200 outdoors the same year.  You are just seeing the result of him wanting to be the very best in the sport and deciding he is going to make the sacrifices to do that,  Tennessee sprint coach Tim Hall said. But the biggest buzz Coleman created involved a shorter distance. With constant talk of how quick American football players are, Tennessee officials decided to find out how quick their  fast  man was. The video went viral after Coleman, wearing track spikes, ripped off a 40-yard time of 4.12 seconds, faster than had ever been run at the National Football League combine, where the distance is a standard measure of speed.  Coming out of the blocks is one of my strengths so I figured I would put down a pretty fast time,  Coleman said. It is the same quick start that helps him in track meets.  Me being a shorter guy, I am pretty quick out of the blocks and can get up to top speed maybe a little faster than some guys,  said Coleman, who is 5 feet 9 inches (176 cm) tall.  My weakness might be that the guys with the longer legs can hold their top speed a little bit longer and might not slow down as fast at the end of the race.  He handles the first 60 meters of a race well, Hall said.  There is still so much room for improvement in minimizing that deceleration in the last 10 meters.  As good as Coleman is at 100 meters, he might be slightly better at 200 in the future, Boldon said.  My only concern for him for Sacramento is that it has been a long season for him,  he said of the grind Coleman faced indoors and out as a collegian. But Coleman said of his chances of burnout:  That's just nonsense to say that you get burned out.   I still think I have a whole lot left.

Late on Monday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump had selected Kaplan, a fellow Republican currently with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, to one of the board's five seats. After Trump officially names him, he must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The NLRB, which oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers, has been controlled by Democrats for nearly a decade, and they currently have a 2-1 majority with two vacancies. The board, when fully stocked, includes three members from the president's party and two from the opposing party. Under Trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former President Barack Obama. Chief among those was a 2015 decision that expanded the circumstances in which a company is considered a  joint employer  liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees. The NLRB is also expected to revisit new rules designed to speed up the union election process that business groups say favor unions, and decisions allowing workers to use company email accounts to organize and to picket on employers' private property. Kaplan, who did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, previously worked for Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives crafting employment-related legislation, including a bill that would undo the new union election rules. Business groups including the National Restaurant Association and International Franchise Association praised the nomination, saying Kaplan and a second nominee who Trump is expected to name this week would bring more balance to the board.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-labor-idUSL1N1JH18U"},

Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives pledged in the election manifesto to fold the independent investigator and prosecutor into the broader National Crime Agency to  strengthen Britain's response to white-collar crime . That proposal drew criticism from lawyers and anti-corruption group Transparency International, which called it an  ill-conceived manifesto one-liner  and said the SFO had enjoyed increasing success in recent years. The fraud charges brought by the agency on Tuesday were over undisclosed Barclays payments to Qatari investors during emergency fundraisings in 2008 that saved the bank from a state bailout.  Taking on Barclays, one of the largest banks in the world, and its most senior officials who literally were at the very top, sends a very strong message that the SFO is now fearless in terms of the companies and individuals it pursues,  said Sarah Wallace, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell. The U.S. Department of Justice has long had a tougher reputation for pursuing multinational companies and individuals to face justice in the United States, often targeting wrongdoing outside its borders. In contrast the SFO, which has a tight annual budget of around 35 million pounds ($44 million) and has to request extra funding from the government for its top cases, has been often criticised by lawmakers over its efforts to bring companies and senior individuals to book. Some lawyers have also criticised the agency for prosecuting junior traders in its high-profile investigations into the manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates - although SFO head David Green has said the agency merely follows the evidence. The Barclays prosecution could buy the agency more time, said Michael Potts, a lawyer at Byrne and Partners.  It certainly may make it more difficult for the government to abolish the SFO at a time when they are spearheading such a high-profile case,  he added.  Many will be surprised that they (the SFO) have sought to take on Barclays and no doubt an army of defence lawyers but it is indicative of a more emboldened SFO that they have sought to take on such a high-profile and possibly difficult case.  A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office, which supports the Prime Minister and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the government, declined to comment when asked whether the Barclays charges had altered May's plans for the SFO. The government's Queen's Speech, in which it traditionally spells out legislative programme, has been delayed after May lost her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election. It is now due on Wednesday. 'Betting the Farm' Green, who is due to step down next April after a six-year stint running the SFO, was forced in 2015 to scrap his first corporate prosecution - that of Olympus Corp over a $1.7 billion accounting scandal - because judges ruled the SFO's criminal charge could not be brought against a company. The corruption trial of British Canadian businessman Victor Dahdaleh collapsed in 2013 and the acquittal of eight former bankers over the last 15 months, charged with manipulating Libor, also dealt a blow to the agency. But a series of recent deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with companies such as retailer Tesco and engineering group Rolls-Royce, and combined fines of around 630 million pounds, have been welcomed in parliament. Some lawyers are questioning if it is in the public interest to prosecute a bank over conduct a decade ago, leaving current shareholders and employees to pick up the tab.  Who does it punish and what purpose does it serve?  asked Jonathan Pickworth, partner at law firm White & Case. But Green has talked tough throughout the five-year Barclays investigation. Barclays was not offered a DPA, a deal under which a company can be fined but avoids criminal prosecution if a judge agrees the terms are fair and the interests of justice served. Green has repeatedly stressed that companies need to fully cooperate with investigators to qualify. The bank locked horns with investigators over documentary evidence that it argued was protected by legal professional privilege, before deciding to relinquish the cache. This, lawyers say, is likely to have cost it a settlement. Professional legal privilege ensures the advice lawyers give clients remains confidential. The SFO's challenge now will be to show they can bring a tricky case to trial.  David Green accepted in 2012 that the SFO would be judged on the performance of its Libor prosecutions. The SFO now seems to be betting the farm and possibly its future on a highly complex and very prominent prosecution of Barclays,  said Ben Rose, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/barclays-qatar-sfo-idUSL1N1JH18B"},

Oil prices nosedived to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply by several key producers, a trend that has undermined attempts by OPEC and other producers to support the market through reduced output. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 1.5 percent and were among the biggest drags on the Dow and the S&P; 500. The S&P; energy sector's 1.7 percent fall led the decliners.

If oil prices collapse, the message the oil market is sending is that demand is drying up and global economic growth is waning.  At 12:49 p.m. ET (1649 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.44 points, or 0.16 percent, at 21,495.55, the S&P; 500 was down 12.05 points, or 0.49 percent, at 2,441.41. The Nasdaq Composite was down 36.55 points, or 0.59 percent, at 6,202.46. A recovery in technology stocks also appeared to have lost momentum, adding to the overall weakness.  Investors are hunting for value and while the 'buy-the-dip' crowd showed up when tech stocks fell, we are seeing a mini-rotation among sectors where underperforming sectors such as healthcare and biotech stocks are being snapped up right now,  said Sarhan. The health index was the only gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors, with a rise of 0.62 percent. The S&P; technology sector was down 0.5 percent, with big tech names such as Apple and Microsoft dragging on the S&P; and Nasdaq. The sector had posted two straight weeks of losses on concerns regarding valuation and a move into defensive sectors in a rising interest rate environment. On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making. Among stocks, Lennar rose 1.8 percent to $53.66 after the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. D.R. Horton was up 1.3 percent, while Pultegroup rose 0.7 percent. Chipotle fell 6.3 percent to $429.86 after the burrito chain said its operating costs in the second quarter will be slightly higher than the first quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,095 to 736. On the Nasdaq, 1,948 issues fell and 862 advanced.

Large corporations often use the ratings, the cyber equivalent of a FICO credit score, to assess how prepared the companies they work with are to withstand cyber attacks. Insurers also look at the ratings when they make underwriting decisions on cyber liability. The group includes big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley , as well as non-financial companies like coffee retailer Starbucks Corp, health insurer Aetna Inc and home improvement chain Home Depot Inc. They are organizing the effort through the Chamber of Commerce, a broad trade group for corporate America. The move comes in response to the emergence of such startups as BitSight Technologies, RiskRecon and SecurityScorecard that collect and analyze large swaths of data to rate companies on cyber security. As these startups have gained prominence and venture capital funding, the companies they rate have complained of a lack of transparency.  The challenge is that their (startups') methodologies are proprietary and there hasn’t been transparency on how they go about creating the ratings,  JPMorgan Global Chief Information Security Officer Rohan Amin said in an interview. The financial services industry is among the most vulnerable to cyber crime because of the massive amount of money and valuable data that banks, brokerages and investment firms process each day. Several technology companies, including Microsoft Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, also support the principles being developed, as do the cyber ratings firms, the Chamber of Commerce said. Ratings issued by those companies could help guide the standards being set by U.S. corporations. BitSight, for example, rates companies on a scale of 250 to 900 with a higher rating indicating better security performance.  For organizations to use your platform you have to demonstrate trustworthiness and reliability,  said Jake Olcott, BitSight's vice president of strategic partnerships.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-cyber-idUSL1N1JH17B"},

That followed an announcement late on Monday that Richard Ferrand, an aide to President Emmanuel Macron and minister for territorial planning, facing a separate judicial probe, would leave government for a job as leader of his party in parliament. Macron is preparing a cabinet reshuffle before embarking on far-reaching economic and social reforms after his centrist Republic On the Move (LREM) party won a commanding majority in a parliamentary election on Sunday. The ministers' departure gives Macron, who promised to clean up French politics, a chance to reshape his government without including names who could prove awkward. Conservative party The Republicans, seeking to put pressure on Macron, said the investigation into Modem should force the departure of its chief, Francois Bayrou, who is justice minister, and European Affairs Minister Marielle de Sarnez. De Sarnez said all options were open regarding her future. That could mean that a reshuffle initially meant to be a formality after LREM's win on Sunday will be more far-reaching than expected. It is set to be announced Wednesday, with conservative Prime Minister Edouard Philippe staying on.  French Minister of the Armed Forces Sylvie Goulard (C) attends the ceremony to mark the 77th anniversary of late French General Charles de Gaulle's resistance call of June 18, 1940, at the Mont Valerien memorial in Suresnes, near Paris, France, June 18, 2017.Bertrand Guay/PoolLREM's solid majority means Macron does not need Modem's votes to get legislation through parliament, giving him more flexibility when deciding whether to keep them in a government that includes members of several parties. However, if he does purge the Modem ministers from his cabinet he may have to replace them with politicians from the Republicans to maintain his left-right balance. That could give ammunition to leftist opponents who call him a right-winger in disguise. French President Emmanuel Macron attends a meeting with Gerard Rameix (not seen), President of the Autorite des marches financiers (AMF), France's market regulatory authority, at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, June 20, 2017.Julien de Rosa/PoolIn a sign of how Macron's election victories have dynamited France's political landscape, Republicans lawmaker Laure de la Raudiere said she and a group of about 40 MPs would form their own grouping within the party that would support Macron on a case-by-case basis.  Others in the Republicans staunchly oppose Macron. Goulard is a member of the Modem party that allied itself with Republic on the Move in the presidential and legislative elections. Since June 9, Modem has been the subject of an investigation into allegations of misuse of public funds.    Defense is a demanding portfolio. The honor of our armies, that of the men and women who serve and who put their lives in danger, should not be mixed up with controversies that have nothing to do with them,  Goulard said in a statement. Being a target of a preliminary investigation in France is not an indication of guilt. Prosecutors can decide to either drop it or proceed to a full-fledged investigation.

A brief Vatican statement on Tuesday gave no reason for the resignation of Libero Milone, saying merely that he had presented it on Monday to Pope Francis and that the pontiff had accepted it. But a Vatican source with knowledge of the events that led to Milone's resignation told Reuters,  It's a pretty ugly situation and I hope it does not get worse.  When Milone was appointed in 2015, Cardinal George Pell, head of the Vatican's Secretariat for the Economy, said he would be autonomous, answerable only to the pope and free to  go anywhere and everywhere  in the Vatican to review the finances and management of any department. But the Vatican source said there had been a  clash of operational styles  between Milone and the departments his office audited, especially the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA). APSA manages the Vatican's real estate holdings in Rome and elsewhere in Italy, pays salaries of Vatican employees, acts as a purchasing office and human resources department, and manages the Vatican's financial and stock portfolio. The Vatican statement said Milone's relationship with the Holy See, where he had been expected to serve until 2020, had been concluded  by mutual accord . A search for a new auditor-general will begin soon. Milone, a 68-year-old Italian who is a former chairman and CEO of the global auditing firm Deloitte in Italy, could not be immediately reached for comment. Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has enacted a series of reforms to clean up the Vatican's sometimes opaque finances. As a result, the Vatican bank, which had been embroiled in numerous scandals in the past, has enacted a wide-ranging drive to tighten financial governance and eliminate abuse. The bank, formally known as the Institute for Religious Works (IOR), has toughened regulatory standards and closed thousands of accounts that were either inactive or deemed not to meet new standards required of clients. Reforming the IOR and other Vatican departments that deal with Church finances has been one of the most sensitive issues facing the pope as he seeks to overhaul the complex Vatican administration called the Curia.

The world's largest coffee chain said it would hire the refugees at its European stores starting in eight countries over the next five years and had already started recruitment. The move is part of the Seattle-based company's plan, unveiled in January, to add 10,000 refugees in 75 countries to its workforce.   The company faced backlash soon after, with several people using the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks on social media to urge customers to stay away from its stores. But there appeared to be no similar reaction on Tuesday with only a handful of people on Twitter voicing their disapproval or support of the Europe hires. Starbucks will roll out the initiative in Britain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. The refugees will represent about 8 percent of more than 30,000 people currently employed by Starbucks in Europe, data provided by the company showed. A wave of refugee and migrants landing on Europe's shores in recent years has contributed to a rise of populist nationalist movements. Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have arrived in the European Union since 2014. Refugees have come in large part from war-torn Syria and Iraq as well as Afghanistan and African countries including Eritrea, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Starbucks' commitment was  proving that businesses like ours can use its scale to make a positive impact in people's lives,  said Martin Brok, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa in a statement. Earlier this year, Starbucks said that its global hiring plan also included employing at least 1,000 refugees over the next five years in Canada. Other U.S. companies have taken a pro-refugee stance after the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama called on the private sector to assist refugees. They include Accenture, Airbnb, Chobani, Coursera, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and LinkedIn. And more than 100 companies, including most of high-tech's biggest names, joined a legal brief opposing a January executive order by current U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily put a hold on allowing refugees into the United States. The temporary ban has since been stayed in court.

A brief Vatican statement on Tuesday gave no reason for the resignation of Libero Milone, saying merely that he had presented it on Monday to Pope Francis and that the pontiff had accepted it. But a Vatican source with knowledge of the events that led to Milone's resignation told Reuters,  It's a pretty ugly situation and I hope it does not get worse.  When Milone was appointed in 2015, Cardinal George Pell, head of the Vatican's Secretariat for the Economy, said he would be autonomous, answerable only to the pope and free to  go anywhere and everywhere  in the Vatican to review the finances and management of any department. But the Vatican source said there had been a  clash of operational styles  between Milone and the departments his office audited, especially the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA). APSA manages the Vatican's real estate holdings in Rome and elsewhere in Italy, pays salaries of Vatican employees, acts as a purchasing office and human resources department, and manages the Vatican's financial and stock portfolio. The Vatican statement said Milone's relationship with the Holy See, where he had been expected to serve until 2020, had been concluded  by mutual accord . A search for a new auditor-general will begin soon. Milone, a 68-year-old Italian who is a former chairman and CEO of the global auditing firm Deloitte in Italy, could not be immediately reached for comment. Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has enacted a series of reforms to clean up the Vatican's sometimes opaque finances. As a result, the Vatican bank, which had been embroiled in numerous scandals in the past, has enacted a wide-ranging drive to tighten financial governance and eliminate abuse. The bank, formally known as the Institute for Religious Works (IOR), has toughened regulatory standards and closed thousands of accounts that were either inactive or deemed not to meet new standards required of clients. Reforming the IOR and other Vatican departments that deal with Church finances has been one of the most sensitive issues facing the pope as he seeks to overhaul the complex Vatican administration called the Curia.

Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives pledged in the election manifesto to fold the independent investigator and prosecutor into the broader National Crime Agency to  strengthen Britain's response to white-collar crime . That proposal drew criticism from lawyers and anti-corruption group Transparency International, which called it an  ill-conceived manifesto one-liner  and said the SFO had enjoyed increasing success in recent years. The fraud charges brought by the agency on Tuesday were over undisclosed Barclays payments to Qatari investors during emergency fundraisings in 2008 that saved the bank from a state bailout.  Taking on Barclays, one of the largest banks in the world, and its most senior officials who literally were at the very top, sends a very strong message that the SFO is now fearless in terms of the companies and individuals it pursues,  said Sarah Wallace, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell. The U.S. Department of Justice has long had a tougher reputation for pursuing multinational companies and individuals to face justice in the United States, often targeting wrongdoing outside its borders. In contrast the SFO, which has a tight annual budget of around 35 million pounds ($44 million) and has to request extra funding from the government for its top cases, has been often criticised by lawmakers over its efforts to bring companies and senior individuals to book. Some lawyers have also criticised the agency for prosecuting junior traders in its high-profile investigations into the manipulation of Libor benchmark interest rates - although SFO head David Green has said the agency merely follows the evidence. The Barclays prosecution could buy the agency more time, said Michael Potts, a lawyer at Byrne and Partners.  It certainly may make it more difficult for the government to abolish the SFO at a time when they are spearheading such a high-profile case,  he added.  Many will be surprised that they (the SFO) have sought to take on Barclays and no doubt an army of defence lawyers but it is indicative of a more emboldened SFO that they have sought to take on such a high-profile and possibly difficult case.  A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office, which supports the Prime Minister and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the government, declined to comment when asked whether the Barclays charges had altered May's plans for the SFO. The government's Queen's Speech, in which it traditionally spells out legislative programme, has been delayed after May lost her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election. It is now due on Wednesday. 'Betting the Farm' Green, who is due to step down next April after a six-year stint running the SFO, was forced in 2015 to scrap his first corporate prosecution - that of Olympus Corp over a $1.7 billion accounting scandal - because judges ruled the SFO's criminal charge could not be brought against a company. The corruption trial of British Canadian businessman Victor Dahdaleh collapsed in 2013 and the acquittal of eight former bankers over the last 15 months, charged with manipulating Libor, also dealt a blow to the agency. But a series of recent deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with companies such as retailer Tesco and engineering group Rolls-Royce, and combined fines of around 630 million pounds, have been welcomed in parliament. Some lawyers are questioning if it is in the public interest to prosecute a bank over conduct a decade ago, leaving current shareholders and employees to pick up the tab.  Who does it punish and what purpose does it serve?  asked Jonathan Pickworth, partner at law firm White & Case. But Green has talked tough throughout the five-year Barclays investigation. Barclays was not offered a DPA, a deal under which a company can be fined but avoids criminal prosecution if a judge agrees the terms are fair and the interests of justice served. Green has repeatedly stressed that companies need to fully cooperate with investigators to qualify. The bank locked horns with investigators over documentary evidence that it argued was protected by legal professional privilege, before deciding to relinquish the cache. This, lawyers say, is likely to have cost it a settlement. Professional legal privilege ensures the advice lawyers give clients remains confidential. The SFO's challenge now will be to show they can bring a tricky case to trial.  David Green accepted in 2012 that the SFO would be judged on the performance of its Libor prosecutions. The SFO now seems to be betting the farm and possibly its future on a highly complex and very prominent prosecution of Barclays,  said Ben Rose, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose. $1 = 0.7890 pounds Reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Pravin Char","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/barclays-qatar-sfo-idUSL8N1JH3VY"},

The move is part of the Seattle-based company's plan, unveiled in January, to add 10,000 refugees in 75 countries to its workforce.   The company faced backlash soon after, with several people using the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks on social media to urge customers to stay away from its stores. But there appeared to be no similar reaction on Tuesday with only a handful of people on Twitter voicing their disapproval or support of the Europe hires. Starbucks will roll out the initiative in Britain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. The refugees will represent about 8 percent of more than 30,000 people currently employed by Starbucks in Europe, data provided by the company showed. A wave of refugee and migrants landing on Europe's shores in recent years has contributed to a rise of populist nationalist movements. Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have arrived in the European Union since 2014. Refugees have come in large part from war-torn Syria and Iraq as well as Afghanistan and African countries including Eritrea, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Starbucks' commitment was  proving that businesses like ours can use its scale to make a positive impact in people's lives,  said Martin Brok, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa in a statement. Earlier this year, Starbucks said that its global hiring plan also included employing at least 1,000 refugees over the next five years in Canada. Other U.S. companies have taken a pro-refugee stance after the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama called on the private sector to assist refugees. They include Accenture, Airbnb, Chobani, Coursera, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and LinkedIn. And more than 100 companies, including most of high-tech's biggest names, joined a legal brief opposing a January executive order by current U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily put a hold on allowing refugees into the United States. The temporary ban has since been stayed in court.

Vitamin D helps the body use calcium to support bone health. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D for most adults is 600 IU (international units), or 800 IU after age 70.  For the study, researchers examined nationally representative survey data collected for 39,243 adults from 1999 to 2014 to see how many people took daily doses of more than 1,000 IU and how many were taking more than 4,000 IU, which is the maximum recommended amount to avoid dangerous side effects.  The proportion of people taking more than 1,000 IU daily surged from just 0.3 percent in the first survey in 1999-2000 to 18 percent in the last survey in 2013-2014, researchers report in JAMA. Over that same period, the proportion of adults talking 4,000 IU daily or more climbed from 0.1 percent to 3.2 percent.  “Vitamin D is essential for bone metabolism, as it helps the body absorb calcium and maintain appropriate concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the blood,” said senior study author Pamela Lutsey, a public health researcher at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.  “Excessive intake of vitamin D can, however, be harmful, as it can cause overabsorption of calcium,” Lutsey said by email. “Excess blood calcium can, in turn, lead to detrimental deposition of calcium in soft tissues, such as the heart and kidneys.” High doses of vitamin D were most common among women, the elderly and white people, the study found.  In 2013 and 2014, 6.6 percent of people age 70 and older were taking at least 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily, while none were in 2007. About 6.6 percent of people aged 60 to 69 were also taking this much vitamin D by the end of the study, as were 4.2 percent of all women and 3.9 percent of all white participants.  Previous research links high doses of vitamin D supplements to an increased risk of serious side effects, particularly when it’s used in combination with calcium supplements, the authors note. Some studies suggest high doses may be associated with an elevated risk of prostate and pancreatic cancers, and deaths from all causes.  The study wasn’t, however, a controlled experiment designed to examine the risks and benefits of varying amounts of vitamin D supplementation.  Another limitation of the study is that participants had to accurately recall and report on their use of vitamin D supplements, the authors note. People were asked to bring in their pill bottles to aid in accurate reporting.  Some people take vitamin D because it isn’t in many foods, though it can be found in beef liver, canned salmon or sardines, cheese and egg yolks as well as fortified milk and orange juice. Most milk sold in the U.S., for example, contains 100 IU of vitamin D per cup. Daily multivitamins typically contain only about 400 IU, and people consuming more than this are usually intentionally trying to boost this specific vitamin, the researchers point out. Supplements are particularly important to consider for people over 50, or who are younger but don’t get much sun, individuals with dark pigmentation and people who live at higher latitudes, said Dr. Matthew Drake, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Generally younger or otherwise healthy people with adequate sun exposure are less likely to have low vitamin D levels,” Drake said by email. However, sunscreen blocks vitamin D production in the skin, he added. “For most people, 1000-2000 IU of vitamin D daily is a very safe level of supplementation which will keep the vast majority of people in an optimal range,” Drake said.  The study suggests that many Americans are taking more vitamin D than they should, noted Dr. Karen Hansen, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison who wasn’t involved in the research.  “Too much is not always better,” Hansen said by email.

The proposal, rejected in the social affairs committee by 10 to 9 votes, now moves to the constitutional and justice committee before its heads to the floor for a full vote.     The Brazilian real weakened as much as 1.7 percent to a one-month low to 3.34 to the greenback, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index dropped 1.5 percent.     Five-year Brazilian credit default swaps reached 242 basis points, the highest since May 22.     Traders feared a political scandal may have driven some lawmakers to reconsider their support for other reforms, including a proposal to cut pension spending seen as critical to balance the government budget.     The news drove investors away from Brazilian assets, adding to falling prices of commodities from iron ore to crude that weighed on assets from wider emerging markets earlier on Tuesday.     News of increased supply by several key oil producers hammered crude futures to a seven-month low, extending a trend that has undermined attempts by OPEC and others to support prices by cutting output.     Currencies of oil exporters led the declines in Latin American foreign exchange markets, with the Colombian peso  slipping 2.2 percent to its weakest in a year. The Mexican peso was down 1 percent.     Shares of oil companies tumbled, weighing on stock markets in the region. Losses in shares of Brazilian state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA subtracted the most points from the Bovespa index, while shares of Colombia's Ecopetrol  dropped 3.3 percent.     Brazilian miner Vale SA also fell as concerns over Chinese demand for steel and global oversupply dragged iron ore futures lower.

With a fragile one-seat lead, the government set to be formed by a New Democrat-Green alliance could be sunk by a single lawmaker missing a crucial confidence vote due to unforeseen events. The political limbo has created uncertainty for business in Canada's third-most-populous province, notably for oil and gas projects such as Kinder Morgan Inc's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which the New Democrats (NDP) and Greens oppose.  People are starting to clue in to the fact that this is quite likely an unworkable legislature,  said Hamish Telford, a political science professor at the University of the Fraser Valley. The requirement for a neutral parliamentary speaker, who is likely to come from the alliance, could also endanger the fledgling government as it would reduce its seat count to a 43-43 tie with the Liberals. Premier Christy Clark, whose Liberal Party lost its majority in a knife-edge election on May 9, has recalled the province's legislature for this Thursday. Her government is expected to be defeated next Thursday in a no-confidence vote.  It will be very tough to make (the government) last four years just from the serious probability of random events. All it takes is one by-election, one death in office,  said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia. The Greens, with three seats, agreed last month to back the NDP government on all confidence measures, ousting the Liberals, who have governed British Columbia for 16 years. The provincial Liberals are unrelated to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's party of the same name. Liberal government house leader Michael de Jong told CBC Television on Monday that his party would not put up a speaker to  prop up the other guys.  The speaker is allowed to vote to break a tie, but repeated votes in favor of one party would undermine the impartiality of the role. Rather than risk throwing the legislature into disrepute, the province's lieutenant-governor could call another election. At least two confidence votes, one on the Throne Speech, the party's agenda for the parliamentary session, and another on a provincial budget, are to occur soon after an NDP government is installed.

The pound got a slight boost last week after two more policymakers on the Bank of England's eight-strong rate-setting committee joined outgoing Kristin Forbes in voting for a rate rise. But in a speech to London's banking community alongside Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, Carney cited weak wage growth and mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment as reasons for not moving to raise interest rates at the moment. Sterling sank to a one-week low of $1.2669 from $1.2758 after the text of Carney's Mansion House speech was released. It was last trading at $1.2691. It also fell over half a percent to a five-day low of 88.04 pence per euro. Ten-year yields on British government bonds fell below 1 percent after the text was released and last stood at 1.001 percent down 3 basis points on the day. Short sterling interest rate futures <0#FSS:> also rose strongly, especially for the late 2018 and early 2019 contracts, as the market priced in a shallower path of interest rate hikes in future years.    The FTSE 100 stocks index, whose externally-focused companies often benefits from a weaker pound, was up 0.24 percent, slightly outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. Consumer stocks were among the top FTSE gainers, helped by the prospect of lower interest rates for longer.  Carney doesn't want to be seen as reacting too quickly (to Brexit) - he's also fully aware the UK hasn't left the EU yet and he wants to keep his monetary policy loose on the off chance that the UK doesn't get an amazing deal,  said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets. Sterling investors also kept a wary eye on politics, with the dual uncertainty of having no government at home 12 days after a parliamentary election and talks, which began on Monday, on Britain's exit from the European Union adding to pressure on the pound. Prime Minister Theresa May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to form a government after her gamble on a snap election backfired, eroding her majority in parliament. Sterling sank nearly 3 percent after the election produced a parliament with no clear majority for any party and  disappointed investors who had earlier bet on a landslide victory for May. Data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed speculators took bets against the pound to the highest since early May in the week up to last Tuesday, the first reading of positioning since the election result.

In a complaint filed on Monday in Los Angeles federal court, Denise Daniels said the animated film, featuring color-coded characters representing individual human emotions, mirrors a children's program called  The Moodsters  that she conceived and pitched to Disney every year from 2005 to 2009. Daniels, who lives in Minnesota's Twin Cities area and has appeared on TV shows including  Today  and  Oprah,  said she had an  implied-in-fact  contract with Disney requiring that she be paid from box office, DVD, Blu-Ray, iTunes and merchandise revenue from  Inside Out.  The film has grossed more than $850 million worldwide since its June 2015 release. Daniels said this  extreme success  was not possible without her work, and that Disney should pay her because it is  custom and common in the entertainment industry.  Disney did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Ronald Schutz, a lawyer for Daniels declined to comment. Daniels, in her early 60s, was unavailable to comment. The lawsuit is at least the second in three months accusing Disney of stealing a concept for a blockbuster film. In March, the Hollywood screenwriter Gary Goldman, whose credits include the Arnold Schwarzenegger film  Total Recall,  sued Disney for allegedly copying its Oscar-winning animated film  Zootopia  from his work.  Inside Out  follows 11-year-old Riley, voiced by Kaitlyn Dias, as she tries to cope with her family's move to San Francisco from Minnesota. It also shows her dealing with personifications of five emotions: Joy (yellow), Sadness (blue), Fear (purple), Anger (red) and Disgust (green), voiced by Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling. Daniels said this resembled  The Moodsters,  in which characters also had assigned colors: Happiness (yellow), Sadness (blue), Fear (green), Anger (red) and Love (pink). According to her complaint,  Inside Out  director Pete Docter, former Disney Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs and several other Disney executives  had access  to her pitch. No individuals were named as defendants. In the  Zootopia  case, Disney has denied wrongdoing and asked a federal judge to dismiss Goldman's complaint. The Daniels case is Daniels v. Walt Disney Co et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 17-04527. The Goldman case is Esplanade Productions Inc v. Walt Disney Co et al in the same court, No. 17-02185.

Despite the high political dimension, we are committed to ensuring a successful outcome and hence the unity among the EU 27 remains our priority,  said Malta's Helena Dalli, who chaired a meeting of EU ministers on the issue. But the ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, failed to agree on  procedure for choosing the new sites for the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which together employ more than 1,000 people.  Germany and Ireland are among states to have already said they will apply to host both bodies, though diplomats say both will not go to one single country. The newer member states in former communist eastern Europe, which have joined since 2004, complain they host fewer common EU bodies and want this disparity addressed. The EU's executive European Commission will propose a set of criteria to choose the new locations, including logistical support, infrastructure, and access to the labor market and medical care for the employees' relatives. Eastern bloc members say these criteria favor the wealthier west and say a geographical spread of sites should also be taken into account.  Italy withheld its consent on Tuesday, saying the Commission should go further and shortlist several of the most eligible sites. The Netherlands also had reservations, diplomats said. Unity of 27  This is a difficult discussion because for the first time since the Brexit decision, this theme is actually dividing the 27 whereas so far our strength in facing Brexit has been in our unity,  one senior EU diplomat said.   Eventually it will be a political decision with a lot of horse-trading behind the scenes.   EU leaders meeting for a summit in Brussels on Thursday are due to finalize the process and member states will have until the end of July to propose cities. A final decision is expected in October after the EU states vote, first on the medical, then on the banking authority. Barcelona, Milan, Copenhagen and Dublin have all started campaigning to host the EMA, which has an annual budget of $360 million. Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Lyon and Strasbourg are among the cities wanting the EBA, whose 160 London-based employees write and coordinate banking rules across the bloc.   The agencies are really a joke,  one senior EU official said of the relatively small budgets at stake for national governments.  They don't matter themselves but the stakes are high because it's about the unity of the 27.

Glencore offered $2.55 billion cash this month for Rio's coal mines in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, beating a previous offer from Yancoal, which is based in Australia and owned by China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Company. Glencore has long sought Rio's high-quality thermal coal assets in the Hunter Valley.

Rio said Yancoal's offer could be completed in a more timely manner than Glencore's bid, adding that Glencore had not secured clearance from various jurisdictions, including the Australian, Chinese, South Korean and Taiwanese authorities. Glencore said it had received clearance from Japan, which would be the destination for much of the coal involved. In 2014, Glencore made an unsuccessful approach to merge its Australian coal mines with Rio Tinto's, arguing a deal could save hundreds of millions of dollars in operational and transport costs and other synergies.   Rio Tinto shareholder meetings have been convened for June 27 in London and June 29 in Sydney to vote on the Yancoal sale, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter.

Footage and photos from demonstrations on Monday showed at least three members of the National Guard - a military unit with public order responsibilities - aiming and firing pistols in clashes on a major Caracas highway. Seventeen year-old demonstrator Fabian Urbina was shot in the chest and died, and several others were injured.  You cannot keep killing people in the street!  opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa shouted, as the group harangued National Guard members during the early-morning protest in the middle-class El Paraiso zone of Caracas.  Who gave the order to shoot?  asked another lawmaker Jose Olivares as soldiers watched silently from inside their base. Venezuelan authorities said two National Guard members had been detained on Monday for what the interior minister called  presumed improper and disproportionate use of force  when thousands of protesters flooded the streets. As well as the fatalities, there have also been thousands of injuries and arrests since Venezuela's opposition began its latest street campaign against President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government in early April. They accuse Hugo Chavez's successor of becoming a dictator and wrecking the once-prosperous OPEC member's economy, and are demanding a presidential election to end his rule. Maduro says  terrorists  and  fascists  are leading the protests in an effort to topple him by force as briefly happened to Chavez in 2002. Government supporters, bystanders and some members of the security forces have also been victims of the violence, with gunshot wounds the most common cause. Many grassroots opposition supporters feel intimidated by the daily violence in cities around Venezuela, where masked youths barricade streets and hurl stones and Molotov cocktails against security forces with tear gas and water cannons. There is also some exhaustion setting in after 80 days of what the opposition denominates  resistance . But opposition leaders have vowed to step up tactics shortly to ramp up the pressure on Maduro, and called a news conference for Tuesday afternoon. They are seeking to halt Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, a move the opposition says is rigged to keep him in power.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), will provide average discounts of 25 percent for passengers whose direct trains into Manhattan's Penn Station are diverted to two stations in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Other LIRR riders will also get discounts, and all passengers during the morning rush will get free transfers to New York City subways at the two stations, Atlantic Terminal in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and Hunterspoint Avenue in the borough of Queens. The MTA also runs the city's subway system. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday urged transit officials to provide discounts during what he has called the  summer of agony.  Amtrak will take three key tracks out of service, throwing commutes across the region into disarray. Amtrak's plan to repair Penn Station's aging infrastructure, from July 10 through Sept. 1, will disrupt schedules and routes for NJ Transit from New Jersey as well as the LIRR because they both rent tracks and station space from Amtrak. New York officials originally said their alternate plans were focused on providing extra services for riders, while NJ Transit offered discounted fares along with alternate routes. The work was originally scheduled to take years but was expedited after recent derailments and other problems left hundreds of thousands of commuters delayed throughout the greater New York area because of decaying infrastructure. Veronique  Ronnie  Hakim, interim MTA director, said on Tuesday the agency believes the fare cuts  will mitigate the inconvenience that our customers may experience, and have the added benefit of drawing customers away from Penn Station while Amtrak performs repair work.

Many cash-strapped Maasai have become landless after subdividing and selling swathes of land to the south of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, where they used to roam with their cattle.  Years of neglect and abuse is forcing them to trade in their birthright for survival,  opposition presidential candidate Raila Odinga told a news conference on Monday.  Jubilee has refused to enact proper laws to protect these community lands,  he said, referring to the ruling party of President Uhuru Kenyatta who hopes to retain power in elections on Aug. 8.  Last week, he called on non-Maasai communities to  remain  on their own land rather than buying up Maasai ancestral land around Kajiado, 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital, Nairobi.     Land has been one of the main drivers of conflict in Kenya since independence in 1963, with politicians whipping up historic grievances over land loss to incite their supporters to move away voters opposed to them, experts say.   Dozens have been killed and injured in Kenya's Laikipia region over the last year as armed herders searching for pasture have driven tens of thousands of cattle onto private farms and ranches from overgrazed communal land.  We urge the politicians to stop making disturbing comments on land,  Stephen Ambani, chairman of the Institution of Surveyors of Kenya, told a news conference on Tuesday.   Our history has shown us how dangerous it can be in rekindling anxiety, hatred, hostility and conflict among communities.       Privatization Much of Maasai-dominated Narok and Kajiado counties was made into group ranches, with shared title deeds, in the 1960s in an effort to better manage nomads' grazing lands. But mismanagement by elected committees, who often proved corrupt, led to the subdivision of land into individual title deeds, which have then been sold on, often to other ethnic groups.  The overemphasis on privatization of land, in the long term, it's going to be very bad,  said Hillary Ogina of the Kenya Land Alliance advocacy network.  Pastoralism, as a way of livelihood, is also valid,  he said, adding that herders require large, communally owned land to give the animals enough grazing.  With increasingly frequent droughts and population growth, it is becoming harder for nomads to continue their traditional way of life. Many young, educated Maasai are keen to sell their land and invest in businesses like hotels, Johnson Mali ole Kaunga, a Maasai activist told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  They end up buying vehicles, investing in things which don't last,  he said in a phone interview.   The best thing would actually be to maintain land as communal but if the community themselves are pushing for subdivision into private (titles), then it becomes a challenge.  Leaders should help the Maasai find alternatives to livestock as a source of income, he said. Odinga criticized the government for delays in implementing the 2016 Community Lands Act which lays out the steps for communities to acquire titles to their ancestral land. Around two-thirds of Kenya's land is customarily owned without formal title deeds, making it easy for some individuals to sell it without other community members' knowledge.      The government finalised the regulations to roll out the law last week and they should be approved by parliament in a couple of months, Peter Kahuho, secretary of the lands ministry, told a news conference on Monday.

Two years into his job at a construction site in Saudi Arabia, his sponsor demanded money to renew his work permit or to get back his passport to return home. But Rajamarian, who had left his home in the coastal district of Kanyakumari in south India in 1994, didn't have the money to buy his freedom. More than 20 years after he was stranded in Saudi Arabia with an expired work permit, no pay, little food and no means to fly back, Rajamarian came home to India last week under an amnesty scheme offered by the Saudi government.  For the last one year, I survived only on black tea and dry chappati,  said the 61-year-old.  I kept trying to come back, but people kept saying I needed to get documents from my sponsor, which was impossible. So I stayed on, doing odd jobs to survive.  There are an estimated six million Indian migrants in the six Gulf states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Oman, many of them trafficked and exploited, campaigners say. Under the kafala sponsorship system, foreign workers are required to have an in-country sponsor, who is usually their employer and is responsible for their visa and legal status. As many employers taking away passports, the system encourages exploitation of workers, human rights campaigners say. Rajamarian's account of his life as an illegal migrant in the Saudi city of Al Baha, doing odd jobs and chasing officials is a familiar story for thousands of migrant workers, they add. Rajamarian left home when he was in his late thirties, to save money for the weddings of his four daughters.   I was not earning enough at home and also tended to spend a lot on drinking,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I saw a better opportunity and decided to go for it.  For two years, the decision to migrate to Saudi Arabia seemed like a good one and he got a job on a construction site. But sometime in 1996, two years into the job, Rajamarian's sponsor demanded more money to renew his residence and work permits.  I didn't have enough saving to pay for it, so I requested them to give me an exit visa and return my passport,  he said.  They asked for 5,000 riyals ($1,300). I bargained hard and they brought it down to 1,000. But I had only 350 in my pocket.  Stuck, with no work and little money, he went to the police to lodge a complaint. They sent him to some labor officials who sent him back to the sponsor.  I tried very hard but didn't have enough money to even reach the Indian embassy in Riyadh,  he said.  I called home a couple of times but decided against telling them about my situation. They would have just worried and not known what to do.  Rajamarian started looking for odd jobs, to survive and send home money every few months. When he couldn't afford his rent, he convinced the landlady to let him live in a goat shelter. Unaware of his ordeal, his family put the money he sent home into a savings scheme. Three daughters were married in their father's absence. The fourth graduated from a commerce college in Kanyakumari. Rajamarian says a lot has changed in his village, the houses are bigger, the road less bumpy.  I still have a daughter to marry so I will continue working,  he said.  But this time at a construction site closer home.

The digital platform called  Virtual Volunteer  was unveiled on World Refugee Day as new data showed the number of refugees globally reached a record 22.5 million in 2016.  People moving are often caught in a fog of poor information,  said Jagan Chapagain, head of programs and operations at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  They don't always know what services are available to them. This is a tool that will help give them a clearer view so that they can make informed decisions,  he said in a statement. Italy is on the frontline in the European migrant crisis which has seen hundreds of thousands of people arrive in the continent by land and sea after fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Nearly 70,000 have arrived in Italy so far this year, mostly migrants from West Africa and Bangladesh, according to the International Organization for Migration. Virtual Volunteer uses geolocation to show users on a map where to access everything from shelters, food banks, canteens, and showers to clothes distribution points, maternal health centers, free legal assistance, dentists and language schools. Refugees and migrants can also find advice on how to protect themselves from traffickers and can access information to help them locate family members if they have become separated. The app - developed by the IFRC and tech giant IBM – has already been rolled out in Greece and Sweden where it has been used by 30,000 people.  Information saves lives. Ensuring that people can access unbiased, factual information has a big impact,  Italian Red Cross President Francesco Rocca said in a statement. Virtual Volunteer, also accessible as a website, offers information in multiple languages depending on what is most needed in each country. Languages in Italy include French, Arabic and Tigrinya, reflecting the high number of Eritrean arrivals, while those in Greece include Arabic, Farsi and Dari. The IFRC plans to role out the service in other countries affected by migration including the Philippines and countries in West Africa.

Using high temperatures and pressure, Statkraft's  hydro thermal liquefaction  process turns wood and organic waste into diesel, producing what it says is a second-generation biofuel that is carbon neutral. It emits the same amount of carbon when burned that was originally absorbed by the organic feedstock. By using wood and other waste, Statkraft may avoid criticism directed at other biofuels that rely on vast tracts of farmland. The firm also says it wants to create a green fuel for aviation and other areas where a liquid is needed, rather than focus on cars where diesel's emissions are increasingly scrutinized. Statkraft and Swedish forestry group Sodra have formed a joint venture called Silva Green Fuel, which will make an investment decision this year on a 50 million-70 million euro  ($56 million-$78 million) pilot plant in Tofte, south of Oslo.  Statkraft CEO Christian Rynning-Toennesen said up to 7 percent of the new fuel, whose energy density is similar to fossil-derived diesel, could be mixed into diesel fuel and used for any vehicle without modification. With small adjustments, a diesel engine could run solely on the fuel, he said.  This could be revolutionary, it could have the same widespread impact as wind turbines or solar photovoltaics. Mankind needs liquid fuels, just not fossil liquid fuels,  he told Reuters at the Eurelectric utilities industry conference. The biofuels industry has seen a string of failures due to technological issues, changes to subsidies and problems with obtaining sufficient feedstock, particularly in the European Union, which puts limits on how much farmland can be switched from food production to making biofuels, such as ethanol. However, Statkraft's procedure would use wood chippings and offcuts that have no other use, alongside other waste.  We know the technology works, but there are now also good market reasons for why this procedure has a chance of success,  said Jeremy Tomkinson, CEO of bioeconomy consultants NNFCC. Rynning-Toennesen said the new product was not primarily aimed at passenger cars, as cities worldwide are trying to phase out diesel to boost air quality and favor electric cars.  Instead, the focus was mainly on planes, shipping and trucking, which are likely to require high-energy liquid fuels for the foreseeable future.  Statkraft's pilot plant was expected to produce diesel  by the truckload, not the shipload  for a few years, the CEO said.  A full-scale plant would cost several 100 million euros and was at least five years away, Rynning-Toennesen said, adding that six large-scale plants could supply 15 percent of Norway's diesel demand using only forestry waste products.  If you add what can be produced from algae or food waste, there is no limitation on raw materials. We can take any solid organic material, even plastic,  Rynning-Toennesen said.  For now, the firm's calculations show the new fuel is cost-competitive with regular diesel because of higher taxes on fossil-derived fuels.   The big question for these kind of investment projects is whether this tax advantage will last long enough,  said Arij van Berkel, a biofuels specialist at Lux Research. After converting waste into an energy-rich liquid, the process separates out the water, then adds hydrogen to produce diesel in a process similar to oil refining.   What we are doing is the same as what nature has done over billions of years,  Rynning-Toennesen said.

The army's 9th armored division seized al-Shifaa district, which includes the city's main hospitals, alongside the western bank of the Tigris river, a military statement said. The fall of Shifaa means the Old City in the eastern half of Mosul is now surrounded by U.S.-backed government forces, deployed north, west, south and east, across the river. The battle for the Old City is becoming the deadliest in the eight-month old U.S.-backed offensive to capture Mosul, Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq and the largest city the group came to control in the country. A mine explosion on Monday at the Old City frontline killed two journalists, Stephane Villeneuve from France and Bakhtiar Haddad from Iraq, and wounded two other French reporters, according to foreign ministry and diplomatic sources in Paris. Aid organizations are expressing alarm at the situation of more than 100,000 civilians, of whom half are children, trapped in its old fragile houses with little food, water and medicine and no electricity. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday  sick and wounded civilians escaping through Islamic State lines were dying in  high numbers .  The militants are moving stealthily in the Old City's maze of alleyways and narrow streets, through holes dug between houses, fighting back the advancing troops with sniper and mortar fire, booby traps and suicide bombers. They have also covered many streets with cloths to obstruct air surveillance, making it difficult for the advancing troops to hit them without a risk to civilians. The Iraqi army estimates the number of Islamic State  fighters at no more than 300, down from nearly 6,000 in the city when the battle of Mosul started on Oct. 17.

Al-Khateeb was denounced by residents, it said.  Ground Support An Iraqi Air Force military helicopter fires towards the Islamic State militants positions in the Old City in western Mosul, Iraq June 18, 2017.Erik De CastroThe fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared three years ago and which once covered swathes of Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi government initially hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the campaign took longer as militants reinforced positions in civilian areas to fight back. The militants are also retreating in Syria, mainly in the face of a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition. Its capital there, Raqqa, is under siege.  About 850,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of the northern Iraqi city, have fled, seeking refuge with relatives or in camps, according to aid groups. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi headed on Tuesday to Iran, the second leg of a Middle East tour after Saudi Arabia to pursue efforts to foster regional reconciliation and coordination against terrorism. Iraq and Saudi Arabia agreed to set up a coordination council to upgrade strategic ties, a joint statement said on Tuesday at the end his talks with Saudi King Salman a day earlier. After Iran, he will visit Kuwait. Iraq lies on the fault line between Shi'ite Iran and the mostly-Sunni Arab world. Deep-running animosity and distrust between the two sides is fuelled by sectarian divides.

Baker,Makiko Yamazaki,Stephen D. Milligan,Taiga Uranaka,TOSHIBA,ACCOUNTING/ (UPDATE 4,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Embattled Toshiba Corp will pick a Japanese government-led group of Japanese, U.S. and South Korean firms and funds to buy the conglomerate's semiconductor business, two people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. The consortium, whose bid clears Toshiba's 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) minimum, has been seen as one of the strongest suitors for the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - as it would automatically have the government's stamp of approval, other sources have told Reuters. Toshiba needs to sell the prized chips unit to cover billions of dollars of losses from its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit. The three-country group has been fighting to counter a 2.2 trillion yen offer from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake, which sources have said Toshiba management favours. The group includes the state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan, the government's Development Bank of Japan, and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital. South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc are to provide financing under the consortium's proposal, sources have said. Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said Toshiba's board will vote on a preferred bidder on Wednesday and announce the result through the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A Toshiba spokeswoman said the company cannot comment on specifics of the sale process. The Japan-U.S.-Korea bid has been orchestrated in large part by Japan's trade ministry, which wants to keep the valuable chip unit under domestic control. But Toshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover massive cost overruns at its Westinghouse Electric Co nuclear unit, which went bankrupt in March, and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. The conglomerate wants to reach a definitive agreement on a buyer by its June 28 annual shareholders meeting. The consortium had told Toshiba it needs to resolve a legal dispute with Toshiba's U.S. chip-venture partner Western Digital Corp before it will invest in the firm's chip unit, sources briefed on the matter said before the decision. Western Digital has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent its partner from selling the chip business without the U.S. firm's consent. Chief Executive Steve Milligan said this month that Toshiba was violating contractual rights and had left the U.S. firm no choice but to pursue legal action. A condition that Western Digital, which has proposed its own bid, essentially drop its legal action could pave the way for the California-based firm to join the government-led consortium.  The ball is now in Western Digital's court,  a source said. But Western Digital is reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that sensitive technologies belonging to its joint venture with Toshiba could be leaked to rival SK Hynix, sources said. It regards their technology in NAND semiconductors, which provide long-term data storage, as on par with that of industry leader Samsung Electronics. By contrast, SK Hynix is weak in NAND although strong in DRAM chips, which help electronic devices perform multiple tasks at once. Western Digital declined to comment. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, is also a suitor. Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry , the Taiwanese firm is leading a consortium that includes Apple Inc and computing giant Dell Inc.

Despite the high political dimension, we are committed to ensuring a successful outcome and hence the unity among the EU 27 remains our priority,  said Malta's Helena Dalli, who chaired a meeting of EU ministers on the issue. But the ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, failed to agree on  procedure for choosing the new sites for the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which together employ more than 1,000 people.  Germany and Ireland are among states to have already said they will apply to host both bodies, though diplomats say both will not go to one single country. The newer member states in former communist eastern Europe, which have joined since 2004, complain they host fewer common EU bodies and want this disparity addressed. The EU's executive European Commission will propose a set of criteria to choose the new locations, including logistical support, infrastructure, and access to the labor market and medical care for the employees' relatives. Eastern bloc members say these criteria favor the wealthier west and say a geographical spread of sites should also be taken into account.  Italy withheld its consent on Tuesday, saying the Commission should go further and shortlist several of the most eligible sites. The Netherlands also had reservations, diplomats said. Unity of 27  This is a difficult discussion because for the first time since the Brexit decision, this theme is actually dividing the 27 whereas so far our strength in facing Brexit has been in our unity,  one senior EU diplomat said.   Eventually it will be a political decision with a lot of horse-trading behind the scenes.   EU leaders meeting for a summit in Brussels on Thursday are due to finalize the process and member states will have until the end of July to propose cities. A final decision is expected in October after the EU states vote, first on the medical, then on the banking authority. Barcelona, Milan, Copenhagen and Dublin have all started campaigning to host the EMA, which has an annual budget of $360 million. Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Lyon and Strasbourg are among the cities wanting the EBA, whose 160 London-based employees write and coordinate banking rules across the bloc.   The agencies are really a joke,  one senior EU official said of the relatively small budgets at stake for national governments.  They don't matter themselves but the stakes are high because it's about the unity of the 27.

The consortium, whose bid clears Toshiba's 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) minimum, has been seen as one of the strongest suitors for the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - as it would automatically have the government's stamp of approval, other sources have told Reuters. Toshiba needs to sell the prized chips unit to cover billions of dollars of losses from its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit. The three-country group has been fighting to counter a 2.2 trillion yen offer from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake, which sources have said Toshiba management favors. The group includes the state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan, the government's Development Bank of Japan, and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital.

Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said Toshiba's board will vote on a preferred bidder on Wednesday and announce the result through the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Related CoverageToshiba to decide on sale of its chips business to government-led consortium: NHKA Toshiba spokeswoman said the company cannot comment on specifics of the sale process. The Japan-U.S.-Korea bid has been orchestrated in large part by Japan's trade ministry, which wants to keep the valuable chip unit under domestic control. But Toshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover massive cost overruns at its Westinghouse Electric Co nuclear unit, which went bankrupt in March, and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. The conglomerate wants to reach a definitive agreement on a buyer by its June 28 annual shareholders meeting. The consortium had told Toshiba it needs to resolve a legal dispute with Toshiba's U.S. chip-venture partner Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) before it will invest in the firm's chip unit, sources briefed on the matter said before the decision. Western Digital has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent its partner from selling the chip business without the U.S. firm's consent. Chief Executive Steve Milligan said this month that Toshiba was violating contractual rights and had left the U.S. firm no choice but to pursue legal action. A condition that Western Digital, which has proposed its own bid, essentially drop its legal action could pave the way for the California-based firm to join the government-led consortium.  The ball is now in Western Digital's court,  a source said. But Western Digital is reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that sensitive technologies belonging to its joint venture with Toshiba could be leaked to rival SK Hynix, sources said. It regards their technology in NAND semiconductors, which provide long-term data storage, as on par with that of industry leader Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). By contrast, SK Hynix is weak in NAND although strong in DRAM chips, which help electronic devices perform multiple tasks at once. Western Digital declined to comment.

The storm could strengthen slightly before it reaches the coast, the hurricane center said. It extended warnings for the storm westward to High Island, Texas, and of heavy rainfall across most portions of the Gulf Coast.

The greenback grinded higher in the aftermath of comments from New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday who said further improvement in the U.S. labor market would kindle inflation, which has shown signs of flagging in recent months. This would leave the door open for the possibility of another rate hike by year-end after two hikes so far this year.     The U.S. central bank as expected raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent last Wednesday.      We had a hawkish Fed last week. We seemed to have had a delayed reaction as the dollar had been oversold,  said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Since last week's Fed meeting, a few policy-makers expressed caution about another rate increase in the coming months due to a recent string of disappointing inflation data.     Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise interest rates again.      Bill Dudley commonly represents the majority view on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) - this is the main reason why the dollar is appreciating,  said Commerzbank strategist Thu Lan Nguyen, in Frankfurt.  Evans was more dovish but he's known to be dovish.      The index that tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen and four other currencies was up 0.3 percent at 97.811 after touching 97.871 earlier Tuesday, which was the highest since May 18.     The dollar fared best against the British pound among the group of currencies. It gained more than a cent against the pound after BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise U.K. interest rates. Last week three BoE policymakers had voted in favor of a rate hike.     But Carney warned of weak wage growth and a likely hit to incomes as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, sending sterling to a two-month low of $1.2603. ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 11:56AM (1556 GMT)  Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid                                               Previous                   Change                                                                Session                                             Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1122        $1.1148     -0.23%         +5.79%      +1.1165     +1.1121  Dollar/Yen       JPY=        111.5100       111.5100    +0.00%         -4.59%      +111.7800   +111.3200  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     124.02         124.31      -0.23%         +0.71%      +124.6300   +124.0500  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9760         0.9754      +0.06%         -4.11%      +0.9764     +0.9726  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.2623         1.2732      -0.86%         +2.33%      +1.2757     +1.2603  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.3269         1.3216      +0.40%         -1.20%      +1.3284     +1.3205  Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7571         0.7594      -0.30%         +4.93%      +0.7623     +0.7573  ar                                                                                               Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.0857         1.0874      -0.16%         +1.31%      +1.0881     +1.0852  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8809         0.8751      +0.66%         +3.42%      +0.8834     +0.8739  NZ               NZD=        0.7235         0.7230      +0.07%         +4.24%      +0.7267     +0.7221  Dollar/Dollar                                                                                    Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.5610         8.4999      +0.72%         -0.88%      +8.5656     +8.4634  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     9.5259         9.4776      +0.51%         +4.84%      +9.5335     +9.4414  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.7897         8.7414      +0.37%         -3.49%      +8.7988     +8.7257  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     9.7786         9.7427      +0.37%         +2.07%      +9.7934     +9.7344                  (Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in Paris; Masayuki Kitano in Singapore; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Chris Reese)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JH4CT"},

Euro zone blue chips closed 0.4 percent lower and the regional STOXX index fell 0.6 percent, retreating from a two-week high and giving up most of the gains made in the previous session. Europe's oil and gas companies fell more than 2 percent with Royal Dutch Shell down 2.3 percent and BP down 2.6 percent after oil prices hit seven-month lows . Mining shares fell more than 3 percent.  People are once more paying attention (to) the fundamentals and the heavy oversupply that we're seeing on the oil market, and that's really causing some downside pressure,  said Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments. Britain's FTSE 100 index, the worst-performing major benchmark in Europe this year, fell 0.7 percent, hit by its heavy weighting in commodities stocks.  Investors across Europe are taking cue from the downside we're seeing in London and, looking at the quite heavily overbought conditions that we're seeing in Europe, are taking that as a cue to take some money off the table,  Charles Hanover Investments' Roy added. Aside from the slide in oil-related stocks, Germany's Prosiebensat 1 was a bright spot, after it sold its online travel agency Etraveli to CVC. Germany's benchmark DAX index touched a fresh record high before retreating 0.6 percent.  We are slightly surprised that the company did not sell a group of travel assets, but management suggests the rest of the travel portfolio remains under review,  they added. Among the stocks falling the most was Groupe Eurotunnel , which runs Eurostar trains; the shares fell 6 percent after the second broker downgrade in as many weeks. Barclays cut the company to  sell , citing slowing traffic and recent militant attacks, which could weigh on tourism. Broker action also took Domino's Pizza shares to fall 6.5 percent to 16-month lows. Investec began its coverage of the stock with a  sell  rating, saying that it expects like-for-like growth to slow. Shares in British services office provider IWG were the biggest fallers, down more than 7 percent after founder and CEO Mark Dixon sold down his stake.

We don't want to confront passers-by but to encourage reflection,  said Teresa Mulet, 46, a designer who joined a recent flash protest in a Caracas boulevard, lying with two dozen people as if dead before jumping up to deliver their message. At the event, lasting just minutes, some shouted phrases lauding peaceful resistance, while others held letters of the alphabet drawn on cardboard which, when joined, spelled a line from a Venezuelan poem:  Those who kill in reality have not lived.  Such surprise demonstrations are organized by a group of intellectuals and artistic creators - from historians to film directors - meeting discreetly since May, sometimes in bookshops, to design different strategies of protests to the traditional street marches.   The organizers break into small groups and appear suddenly at opposition marches or public spaces, including some areas dominated by government supporters, to leave messages that later go viral on social networks. Near-daily opposition rallies have brought chaos to Venezuelan streets since April as protesters demand elections, solutions to an economic crisis and a suspension of leftist President Nicolas Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution. Many have descended into battles between masked youths and security forces, with thousands of injuries and arrests on top of the fatalities. Maduro says the protesters are seeking a violent coup with U.S. encouragement. Seeking to create arresting images, artists have sometimes turned to gargantuan projects.

Sometimes, peaceful protesters have been holding up signs, like  Ceasefire!  or  No To Violence!,  just meters (yards) from where young men hurl stones and Molotov cocktails against National Guard soldiers using tear gas and water cannons.  At times, the security forces have fired tear gas canisters directly at the peaceful art-themed protest gatherings.

All of us, with our gifts and talents, can build a better Venezuela,  said Olivares, some of whose images have been featured on the makeshift shields of young demonstrators.   I'm happy to know my art can provide hope and protection.  The artists, some of whom draw inspiration from Spain's anti-austerity protesters known as  Indignados  ( The Indignant Ones ), are convinced their methods will be more successful than violent protests.

The Ramadan Sharing Fridge initiative was the brainchild of Australian Sumayyah Sayed, who left the first fridge outside her house and stocked it with food and drinks for the city's poor. Around 25,000 ordinary members of the public have donated to the scheme, helping to boost the numbers of fridges this year, with approximately 400 people making use of the service each day at one fridge that Reuters visited, organizers said.   Every day we have 10 to 15 donors who come individually on their own and they give us some dry items, Labans (milk), they give us biscuits, fruits and juices. So we make packs of these individually and we hand it over,  fridge manager Swathi Santhosh told Reuters. The fridges around the city are marked on a digital map and promoted on social media channels. They are located everywhere from car parks, to construction sites to private residences. They are mostly concentrated in the downtown area of the city. A queue of construction workers were seen at one location that Reuters visited.  Those in charge of distributing food from the fridges are volunteers, dressed in regular street clothes and without affiliation to any organization.

Using high temperatures and pressure, Statkraft's  hydro thermal liquefaction  process turns wood and organic waste into diesel, producing what it says is a second-generation biofuel that is carbon neutral. It emits the same amount of carbon when burned that was originally absorbed by the organic feedstock. By using wood and other waste, Statkraft may avoid criticism directed at other biofuels that rely on vast tracts of farmland. The firm also says it wants to create a green fuel for aviation and other areas where a liquid is needed, rather than focus on cars where diesel's emissions are increasingly scrutinized. Statkraft and Swedish forestry group Sodra have formed a joint venture called Silva Green Fuel, which will make an investment decision this year on a 50 million-70 million euro  ($56 million-$78 million) pilot plant in Tofte, south of Oslo.  Statkraft CEO Christian Rynning-Toennesen said up to 7 percent of the new fuel, whose energy density is similar to fossil-derived diesel, could be mixed into diesel fuel and used for any vehicle without modification. With small adjustments, a diesel engine could run solely on the fuel, he said.  This could be revolutionary, it could have the same widespread impact as wind turbines or solar photovoltaics. Mankind needs liquid fuels, just not fossil liquid fuels,  he told Reuters at the Eurelectric utilities industry conference. The biofuels industry has seen a string of failures due to technological issues, changes to subsidies and problems with obtaining sufficient feedstock, particularly in the European Union, which puts limits on how much farmland can be switched from food production to making biofuels, such as ethanol. However, Statkraft's procedure would use wood chippings and offcuts that have no other use, alongside other waste.  We know the technology works, but there are now also good market reasons for why this procedure has a chance of success,  said Jeremy Tomkinson, CEO of bioeconomy consultants NNFCC. Rynning-Toennesen said the new product was not primarily aimed at passenger cars, as cities worldwide are trying to phase out diesel to boost air quality and favor electric cars.  Instead, the focus was mainly on planes, shipping and trucking, which are likely to require high-energy liquid fuels for the foreseeable future.  Statkraft's pilot plant was expected to produce diesel  by the truckload, not the shipload  for a few years, the CEO said.  A full-scale plant would cost several 100 million euros and was at least five years away, Rynning-Toennesen said, adding that six large-scale plants could supply 15 percent of Norway's diesel demand using only forestry waste products.  If you add what can be produced from algae or food waste, there is no limitation on raw materials. We can take any solid organic material, even plastic,  Rynning-Toennesen said.  For now, the firm's calculations show the new fuel is cost-competitive with regular diesel because of higher taxes on fossil-derived fuels.   The big question for these kind of investment projects is whether this tax advantage will last long enough,  said Arij van Berkel, a biofuels specialist at Lux Research. After converting waste into an energy-rich liquid, the process separates out the water, then adds hydrogen to produce diesel in a process similar to oil refining.   What we are doing is the same as what nature has done over billions of years,  Rynning-Toennesen said.

Trump sat down in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for talks on the same day the U.S. Treasury Department added two Russian officials and 36 other individuals and entities to its list of those facing sanctions over Moscow's activities in Ukraine. Trump's meeting with Poroshenko was officially called a  drop-by  visit after the Ukrainian leader's separate session with Vice President Mike Pence. With TV cameras rolling, Trump said  a lot of progress has been made  between the two countries and that the pair had  very, very good discussions.  The sanctions target Ukrainian and Russian officials and companies that U.S. authorities accuse of helping Russia tighten its grip on the Crimean peninsula, a part of Ukraine annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move Western leaders denounced as illegal. Poroshenko called Trump, whose first five months in office have been dogged by a controversy over whether his presidential campaign team last year colluded with Russia,  one of the most reliable supporters  and  strategic partners  for Ukraine. In a statement issued after Trump's meeting, the White House said the discussion centered on  support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and President Poroshenko's reform agenda and anti-corruption efforts.  A separate White House statement issued after Pence met with Poroshenko said the vice president highlighted continuing U.S. support for implementing the Minsk agreement, the 2015 accord aimed at ending Russian support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States could back away from that agreement to avoid being  handcuffed  by the policy. Trump did not mention the accord. Before Trump's meeting with Poroshenko, the Treasury Department made its announcement about sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine that were being taken to keep pressure on Moscow to reach a diplomatic solution in Ukraine. A Treasury Department statement said,  U.S. sanctions related to Crimea will not be lifted until Russia ends its occupation of the peninsula.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement   there should be no sanctions relief until Russia meets its obligations under the Minsk agreements.  Lavrov Cites u.s. 'Russophobia' Speaking at a joint news briefing in Moscow with his French counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the new sanctions  regrettable  and said that  Russophobia  in the United States was raging  beyond all bounds.  U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 20, 2017.Jonathan ErnstOn Monday, Russia threatened to shoot down U.S. warplanes over Syria after a U.S. Navy fighter shot down a Syrian warplane. Poroshenko, speaking to reporters after his session with Trump, said he came away pleased with what he called a  full, detailed meeting.  He also held talks with Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.  We received strong support from the U.S. side, support in terms of sovereignty, territorial integrity and the independence of our state,  Poroshenko said. Slideshow (7 Images)At the Pentagon, Mattis noted the  severe casualties  Ukraine has suffered in its conflict with Russian-backed separatists.  The United States stands with you. We support you in the face of threats to sovereignty, to international law or to the international order,  Mattis said.  Poroshenko expressed hope for expanded U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation but did not directly answer a question about whether it was time for the United States to start providing lethal arms to Ukraine. The somewhat neutral body language between Trump and Poroshenko contrasted with chummy photos that emerged from the U.S. president's meeting last month at the White House with Lavrov and the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. Trump has said he wants better relations with Russia, but his goal has been complicated by tensions between the two countries over Syria and by opposition among many of his fellow Republicans in Congress to warmer ties with Moscow. The U.S. Senate passed legislation last week that would impose new measures against Russia and limit Trump's ability to roll back sanctions against that country in the future. In a little more than two weeks, Trump is due to hold his first meeting as president with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Trump has found himself on the defensive politically over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. His former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, previously worked on behalf of the political party of Viktor Yanukovich, the former Kremlin-backed leader of Ukraine.

A steady stream of news has encouraged the bulls recently, including a talk of a market deficit, an expected strike in major producer Peru and declining inventories. But monetary tightening in China has stoked worries about the appetite for industrial metals in its biggest market.  You've got some news with a bullish tone, so that's supporting the market, but I don't know how sustainable all this will be,  said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, Partner at consultancy T-Commodity in Milan when zinc was firmer during morning trade.  We have a small long, but we're not married to this position because the general outlook is still not really bullish. Monetary tightening in China is still taking place.  * ZINC: Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange closed 0.04 percent down at $2,555 a tonne, retreating from an intraday peak of $2,581.50, the highest since June 1.  Potential weakness of zinc prices in the upcoming months may stem from tepid demand for galvanised steel,  Citi analyst Nell Agate said in a note. The biggest use for zinc is to galvanise steel. * NICKEL: LME nickel shed 2.1 percent to end at $8,820 a tonne. Prices received a fillip on Monday from news that about a dozen newly constructed nickel smelters in Indonesia have stopped operations because of a plunge in prices. * ALUMINIUM: LME aluminium finished unchanged at $1,886.50 a tonne, supported by continued concern about a crackdown by the Chinese government on illegal and polluting smelters.

Wind and solar advocates have said the government study's outcome appeared to be pre-determined to favor fossil fuel industries. The new report, commissioned by the American Wind Energy Association and Advanced Energy Economy, says cheap natural gas is behind most of the decline in the numbers of U.S. coal-fired power plants in recent years, not government subsidies that have bolstered the growth of wind and solar power. It also said there is no evidence to show that wind and solar energy are threatening the reliability of the electric grid. The groups commissioned the report shortly after Energy Secretary Rick Perry in April ordered a 60-day study of the reliability of the grid and said Obama-era policies offering incentives for the deployment of renewable energy had come at the expense of energy sources like coal and nuclear. With the 60-day deadline for the DOE study looming this month, AWEA and AEE released their own analysis of the issue performed by economic consulting firm Analysis Group. The authors of the analysis found that the rapid growth of renewable energy and related policies were  a distant second to market fundamentals in causing financial pressure  on coal plants without long-term contracts. Market forces such as new, more-efficient efficient natural gas plants, low natural gas prices and flat electricity demand are the biggest contributor to coal plants' inability to compete, the report found. The analysis also found that greater diversity of technologies made the system more reliable.   There are lots of different technologies that fill different pieces of the reliability puzzle,  said Susan Tierney, one of the report's authors.  That led us to believe that there is not a problem on the horizon for reliability.  The DOE's grid study is expected to be released later this month.

Mexico's 2018 budget is likely to see a lower  adjustment  to public finances than in previous budgets, finance minister Jose Antonio Meade said in an interview on local radio. He said Mexico would still meet a deficit target of 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2018. The collapse in global oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 in late 2014 forced Mexico to make sizeable cuts to the federal budget in the past couple of years, and Wall Street credit rating agencies last year warned they could cut Mexico's debt rating. Mexico's government had previously relied on oil sales by state-run Pemex to fund around a third of its budget, but lower prices and a slump in production have pushed oil income to less than one-fifth of the government's revenue. Meade also said the ministry was unlikely to receive a surplus transfer next year from the central bank, noting the peso would have to weaken back past 20.50 per dollar MXN= by the close of 2017 in order for that to happen.  That, today, does not seem to be the central scenario,  the minister said. The peso, which suffered a significant slump last year, has been the best performing major currency this year, gaining over 15 percent in 2017. It is now trading just above 18 per dollar as fears have eased that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump will slap tariffs on Mexican-made goods. The central bank books a surplus from reserve assets when the peso weakens against the dollar during the year. In March, the central bank transferred 321.7 billion pesos ($18 billion) of its 2016 surplus to the federal government.

Next Insurance, which raised $29 million in May from investors led by reinsurer Munich Re's HSB Ventures, said on Tuesday that American Express's venture capital arm has joined the investor group. Next Insurance will use the new cash injection, which brings the investment round to $35 million, to expand the products it offers and target new business sectors, the company said. It is in early discussions with American Express on a possible partnership, given the credit card company's large customer base of U.S. businesses, Next Insurance chief operating officer Sofya Pogreb said in an interview.  Founded in 2016, Next Insurance collects and analyzes data to sell customized insurance to U.S. small business owners who were previously disregarded by large insurers, including personal trainers, photographers and contractors. It is part of a growing group of young companies so-called 'insurtech' startups that are looking to modernize the insurance sector by taking advantage of digital technologies, to make better customized underwriting decisions and offer cheaper products.   Small business insurance is one of the most promising areas for young technology companies, according to a recent report by Willis Towers Watson Plc (WLTW.O) and data provider CB Insights, which estimated 25 percent of small business premiums in the United States could be underwritten digitally by 2020.   Finding the right insurance is often a time-consuming, complicated process for small-business owners,  Harshul Sanghi, managing partner at American Express Ventures, said in a statement. Next Insurance has simplified the process through its easy-to-use website and analytics, he added.  While Next Insurance helps customize the policies and sells the insurance, it relies on large insurers as partners for underwriting and for some of the regulatory requirements. For example, its insurance for photographers is offered with Munich Re, which has been an active investor and partner of young technology startups, over the past year. Next Insurance has 5,000 customers and has passed $1 million in total underwritten premium, Pogreb said.

In May, overseas investors bought a net 19.8 billion yuan  ($2.90 billion) of mainland shares via the  Connect  schemes that link the Hong Kong and China markets, pushing up volumes by  56 percent from the previous month.   We believe this was due to foreign investors' expectation that MSCI will announce the inclusion of A-shares this week,  said UBS strategist Gao Ting, noting that northbound investors have mostly chosen shares in the consumer and pharmaceutical sectors over the past month. Net inflows so far this month have reached nearly 15 billion yuan.               The flows into Chinese firms such as Midea Group (000333.SZ) and Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) came ahead of MSCI's decision on whether to open up its Emerging Markets Index (EMI) .MSCIEF to mainland-listed China shares. The announcement is due shortly after 4.30 pm New York time on Tuesday, June 20 (4.30am Wednesday in Hong Kong).  If China A shares were to be included, consumer and real estate stocks in particular would see their weighting increase - at the expense of financials - under MSCI's new methodology unveiled in March, which will cut the number of constituents to 169 from 448.  MSCI has previously declined to include China in the EMI three times amid investor complaints about curbs on repatriating capital from China and concerns over the country's large number of suspended stocks. The newly adopted methodology is designed to address these issues and make inclusion more likely, analysts said.       China's securities regulator said on Friday that it hopes MSCI can open its index to China shares, but if not, Chinese capital market reform will not be derailed. All the Chinese stocks set to be included are big-caps and can be easily accessed by foreigners through the  Connect  trading link between mainland and Hong Kong markets. Morgan Stanley sees a more than 50 percent chance of a  Yes  decision, expecting a 0.5-1 percent rise in the Shanghai Composite Index on a positive result, although it noted that actual implementation would not take place until June, 2018. Eligible Chinese stocks would represent a weighting of only 0.5 percent in the MSCI EM index.   In the case of a 'No' decision: The A-share market might first react with a minor decline of 1.0 percent,  Morgan Stanley said in a recent report.  FILE PHOTO: A man looks at an electronic board at a brokerage house in Shanghai August 31, 2009.Aly Song/File PhotoAsset managers have noted that inclusion in the index after the three previous rejections is likely this time, with the weight of money flowing into Chinese A shares evidence of that conviction. Over the past two weeks, an average of 1.2 billion yuan has flowed into Chinese shares via the Connect each day, nearly 30 percent more than the average during the Jan-May period.  Shenzhen-listed Chinese home appliance maker Midea Group Co (000333.SZ) - potentially a heavyweight in the EMI - has witnessed a surge in foreign interest since MSCI in March unveiled its new methodology for China inclusion.  Overseas holdings in Midea via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect doubled to 4.16 percent, from 1.94 percent three months ago, with about 230 million shares acquired by foreign investors during the period. Slideshow (2 Images)Founder Securities (601901.SS), another potential EMI constituent, has seen foreign holdings in the brokerage under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect surge to 17.2 percent, from just 10 percent three months ago. In another sign of rising foreign interest in Chinese big-caps ahead of the MSCI decision, qualified foreign institutional investors have visited a total of 29 Chinese listed companies so far this month, 23 of which have stocks in the Connect schemes, the Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday.  However, some investors appear retreating just ahead of the MSCI announcement, exchange-traded fund (ETF) data suggests.     ETFs tracking China stock indices saw 14.5 million euro  ($16.17 million) of outflows on Friday, reversing a trend of steady inflows seen since the beginning of this month, according to independent ETF selection platform TrackInsight. That suggests some investors are thinking again about the likelihood of inclusion in the index, TrackInsight said.

Producers churned out 143 million tonnes of crude steel in May versus 140 million tonnes a year ago, according to the World Steel Association (Worldsteel). Output in China, which accounts for half of global steel production and a quarter of global steel exports, rose 1.8 percent to 72.3 million tonnes, said Worldsteel, whose members jointly account for 85 percent of global steel production. The ramp-up in Chinese steel output has been spurred by high margins due to tighter supplies of construction steel after Beijing vowed to crack down on low-quality furnaces by the end of this month. China cut some 65 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2016 and aims to cut another 50 million tonnes of outdated capacity this year, not including low-quality steel - spurring soaring steel margins and high production.

Fitch simultaneously affirmed VIVAT's IDR at 'BBB' and senior notes at 'BBB-', and VIVAT Insurance's IFS ratings at 'BBB+'. The Negative Outlook follows Fitch's assessment that the credit profile of VIVAT's parent, China-based Anbang Insurance Group Co. Ltd (Anbang), has weakened, and that further widening in the relative credit strength would be credit-negative for VIVAT, as a result of uncertainties that could arise regarding VIVAT's future strategic direction. However, the affirmation of the ratings reflects our view that the credit profile of VIVAT as a standalone Dutch insurer is not directly affected by the credit profile of Anbang. Anbang's weaker credit profile reflects a sharp decline in Anbang Life Insurance Co. Ltd's (Anbang Life's) comprehensive solvency ratio computed under China's Risk Oriented Solvency System (C-ROSS) framework. Fitch believes the announcement by Anbang that its chairman was unable to fulfil his role for personal reasons could impair the brand name and reputation of the group and its insurance subsidiaries. This may result in further credit weakness for Anbang, in Fitch's opinion. KEY RATING DRIVERS Under Fitch's criteria for assessing the impact of ownership, we view Anbang's current credit profile as neutral to VIVAT's ratings. We believe that the regulatory and governance framework under which VIVAT operates ring-fences its capitalisation and protects policyholders through restrictions on the minimum capital position and dividend payments. VIVAT's ratings reflect the group's strong capitalisation, low investment risk and stable presence in the Dutch insurance market. The ratings also benefit from a sharpened strategic focus under the ownership of Anbang, and our expectation that VIVAT will remain profitable. VIVAT's capital position is supportive of the group's ratings with a Prism factor-based capital model (FBM) score of  Very Strong  at end-2015. VIVAT reported an improved Solvency II ratio at 175% at end-2016 (end-2015: 161%). The group's financial leverage ratio (FLR) was broadly stable at 21% at end-2016; however, we expect FLR to increase to around 30% on a pro forma basis following VIVAT's EUR650 million senior debt issue in May 2017. The higher FLR remains in line with the group's ratings. VIVAT Insurance's presence in the Dutch insurance market has remained stable, notably in life and pensions. SRLEV N.V. ranks third among Dutch life insurers, with a market share of around 15%. REAAL Schadeverzekeringen is a significant, albeit smaller, non-life player, with a 5% market share. VIVAT reported improved net income of EUR159 million in 2016 (2015: EUR109 million). Fitch expects VIVAT's profitability to improve from the current low base but remain under pressure in the medium term from low interest rates and fierce competition in the Dutch insurance market. RATING SENSITIVITIES Further deterioration in Fitch's assessment of Anbang's credit profile could lead to a downgrade of VIVAT's ratings. An adverse change in our perception of the strength of the ring-fencing provided by the regulatory and governance framework under which VIVAT operates could also lead to a downgrade. VIVAT's ratings may also be downgraded if the company fails to maintain profitability, as measured by net income return on equity (ROE) of at least 3% (2016: 4%), or if its Prism FBM score falls to the low end of the 'Strong' category, or financial leverage increases to more than 35% for a sustained period.

A lawyer for Michael McCarthy, 37, in his closing argument on Tuesday, said McCarthy's former girlfriend, Rachelle Bond, killed 2-1/2-year-old Bella Bond, saying his client was unaware of the child's death until he was accused by police. Both sides focused on Bond's credibility, with defense lawyer Jonathan Shapiro noting that she had repeatedly lied to friends about her child's whereabouts in the months between the time a woman found the child's badly decomposed remains, sparking the search for  Baby Doe's  identity, and the couple's arrest in September 2015. Shapiro noted that no forensic evidence tied McCarthy to the killing, with prosecutors leaning on Bond's testimony to prove that McCarthy punched the child to death and dumped her body in a channel on Massachusetts Bay. That testimony was untrue, Shapiro said.  The story she told was clearly made up to cover her own guilt. It was a web of lies and a changing web of lies,  Shapiro said. Bond had told friends, neighbors and McCarthy that the girl had been taken by state authorities. McCarthy believed that assertion, Shapiro said.  She explained to everyone that Bella was somewhere else,  Shapiro said.  She lied to everyone and there is no doubt that her lies and her cover-up were convincing.  He noted that Bond gave varying accounts of the killing to police, changing the timing on when it occurred and whether she saw McCarthy hit the child. McCarthy did not testify during his trial.  Assistant District Attorney David Deakin stood by Bond's testimony and noted that a friend of McCarthy's, Michael Sprinsky, testified that he had warned Bond about her boyfriend's temperament.  The defense counsel threw out a challenge to say where's the evidence that he would do anything to harm a child? I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, ask Michael Sprinsky,  Deakin recalled.  He said, 'You have to get away from him. He's crazy.'  Bond, 41, pleaded guilty in February to being an accessory to murder after the fact and testified under a plea deal with prosecutors. If found guilty of the most serious charge, first-degree murder, McCarthy will be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was also looking at the reasons for pricing differences in premiums quoted by insurers. The consultation is part of a wider look at problems some consumers can face when trying to buy insurance. The FCA said insurance markets were becoming more segmented with the use of  big data  - or very detailed information about which customers pose the highest risk to insurers. Such customers may have to  navigate an increasingly complex and confusing market  to find insurers willing to cover them.  These issues are particularly apparent for those with, or recovering from, cancer,  the FCA said. The Association of British Insurers, an industry body, said travel insurance is widely available for people who have long-term and serious health conditions, including people who have cancer. But the Travel Insurance Facilities Group (tifgroup), which sells travel insurance, said customers with medical conditions have faced  eye watering premiums  or have had to buy cover with exclusions applied to specific conditions.  We are hopeful that the FCA's work will address some of the key insurance issues faced by those affected by illness and that the travel insurance industry adopts a more individual and inclusive approach to assessing the actual risk that these people actually present,  Richard Smith, managing director of tifgroup, said.

Long-standing tensions between the company's founders - former brothers-in-law - first became public during a court hearing on March 7.  Businessman Eduard Zanen, who provided seed capital for the company, had become frustrated after co-founder and inventor Max Barenbrug continued to influence strategic direction after agreeing to a design role. Zanen invoked a 2012 agreement that either could trigger the sale of the company to a third party. That disagreement was settled without a ruling, a spokeswoman for the Amsterdam District Court said. But Het Financieele Dagblad first reported on Thursday that the partners have now agreed to a sale. Zanen and Barenbrug's sister divorced a decade earlier, the paper said. Founded in 1999, Bugaboo's breakthrough came after one of its strollers was shown on in an episode of hit TV series  Sex and The City  in 2002, when the character Miranda had a baby. The strollers, which can cost more than $1,000, have been snapped up by celebrities including Gwynneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham, and Elton John.  Designers Viktor & Rolf, Bas Kosters and the Andy Warhol Foundation, among others, have crafted limited edition designs, and the company recently made a foray into luggage. The company made a pretax profit of 16.8 million euros  ($18.75 million)on sales of 95 million euros in 2015, according to its most recent filing with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.  Lieke der Kinderen walks her newborn in her Bugaboo stroller in Dordrecht Monday, June 19, 2017.Michael KoorenJelena Sokolova, analyst at Morningstar, said Bugaboo could be valued against luggage makers Samsonite (1910.HK) and Rimowa, recently acquired by LVMH (LVMH.PA), which both trade at 2 times sales. Rabobank, which has been given the commission to sell the company, will approach both strategic and private equity buyers for Bugaboo. Slideshow (4 Images) Selling is the wisest decision in a situation like this: when the owners start to fight, that can be the beginning of the end for a lifestyle brand,  said Dutch marketing specialist Paul Moers. Moers noted that while Bugaboo's image of sturdy quality and versatility has spawned many imitators, its reputation is still solid and the market is fragmented.  It's not too late for Bugaboo, not by any means,  he said.  Find a buyer with knowledge of sales and marketing and the power to invest behind advertising and you can grab market share, become a much bigger player.  Competitors and possible buyers for Bugaboo include Britax, owned by Nordic Capital, Stokke, owned by Korean investment firm MXMH, Quinny, owned by Canada's Dorel Industries, Graco, owned by U.S. firm Newell Brands, and LVMH, among others.

The uptake is driven by a combination of both demand pull and supply push factors that are unlikely to dissipate in the short-term and will continue to effect credit profiles through cost and revenue factors. Increasing broadband speeds have been core to this growth, enabling effective use of content and data applications over multiple devices. Western European incumbent operators are well placed to exploit the opportunities that convergence brings, due to existing ownership of both national mobile and fixed network infrastructures and scaled operations. Bundling is enabling incumbents to grow revenue per customer while differentiating on product quality and value. The role of content in the bundled offer is still evolving and will differ by market. Its importance in some markets where pay TV is prevalent is likely to increase. However, unlike some cable and satellite operators, many incumbent operators do not have a legacy pay TV base to protect from the arrival of on-line subscription based platforms such as Netflix and Amazon. This has enabled them to retain a position of aggregation and distribution in the value chain and facilitate access to the online channels. The approach reduces the risk from content price inflation that is prevalent in some European markets like the UK. Current benefits from convergence and bundling have largely been related to revenue enhancement and churn reduction. However, the gradual integration of fixed and mobile network architectures could extend this to reducing costs and improving services. The extent and pace of this is currently not clear but likely to build as the penetration of converged products in a market matures. The need to fund content investments and new delivery platforms while maintaining margins will be key points of motivation for management teams. The evolution of these savings could put pressure on the business models of alternative operators that do not own both mobile and fixed networks with significant implications for market structure.

Late on Monday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump had selected Kaplan, a fellow Republican currently with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, to one of the board's five seats. After Trump officially names him, he must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  The NLRB, which oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers, has been controlled by Democrats for nearly a decade, and they currently have a 2-1 majority with two vacancies. The board, when fully stocked, includes three members from the president's party and two from the opposing party. Under Trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former President Barack Obama.  Chief among those was a 2015 decision that expanded the circumstances in which a company is considered a  joint employer  liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees.  The NLRB is also expected to revisit new rules designed to speed up the union election process that business groups say favor unions, and decisions allowing workers to use company email accounts to organize and to picket on employers' private property. Kaplan, who did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, previously worked for Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives crafting employment-related legislation, including a bill that would undo the new union election rules. Business groups including the National Restaurant Association and International Franchise Association praised the nomination, saying Kaplan and a second nominee who Trump is expected to name this week would bring more balance to the board.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was also looking at the reasons for pricing differences in premiums quoted by insurers. The consultation is part of a wider look at problems some consumers can face when trying to buy insurance. The FCA said insurance markets were becoming more segmented with the use of  big data  - or very detailed information about which customers pose the highest risk to insurers. Such customers may have to  navigate an increasingly complex and confusing market  to find insurers willing to cover them.  These issues are particularly apparent for those with, or recovering from, cancer,  the FCA said. The Association of British Insurers, an industry body, said travel insurance is widely available for people who have long-term and serious health conditions, including people who have cancer. But the Travel Insurance Facilities Group (tifgroup), which sells travel insurance, said customers with medical conditions have faced  eye watering premiums  or have had to buy cover with exclusions applied to specific conditions.  We are hopeful that the FCA's work will address some of the key insurance issues faced by those affected by illness and that the travel insurance industry adopts a more individual and inclusive approach to assessing the actual risk that these people actually present,  Richard Smith, managing director of tifgroup, said.

The finance ministry offered a two-tranche Eurobond worth $3 billion and order books had topped $6.6 billion, a market source familiar with deal details told Reuters. The official release is due later on Tuesday. The deal - and investors' enthusiasm - comes just days after the U.S. Senate voted to impose new sanctions on Russia, extending curbs put in place in 2014 to punish Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis. But Russia is celebrating its victory over restrictive geopolitics by selling Eurobonds for the second year in a row. Foreign money managers, including U.S. investors, showed  big interest , Andrey Kostin, the head of Russian state-run bank VTB told reporters in London. He described the bond as a  normal market deal  Itself under U.S. and European sanctions, VTB is acting as the sole book runner for the Eurobond issue.  So far the investment world has decided that (sanctions are) not a significant factor especially since it's fixed income and there should be significant returns,  Kostin said. There is huge investor demand for high-yielding securities. Russia's bond comes a day after Argentina - with a credit rating well below Russia's - debuted on the so-called  century bond  market with $2.75 billion of 100-year debt, just over a year after emerging from its latest default.. Debt Levels Raising $1 billion in a 10-year sovereign Eurobond issue, Russia set final yield guidance at 4.25 percent, nearly twice as high as 2.17 percent offered by 10-year U.S. Treasuries. Yield guidance on its 30-year bond was 5.25 percent Some investors reckon the sanctions may even have boosted the market for Russian Eurobonds, especially as economic sanctions kept Moscow out of international bond markets in 2014 and 2015 and reduced the supply of Russian hard currency debt. Russia's rock-bottom public debt levels are also attractive to investors.  We think the pricing is fair on both tranches, it's good timing for Russia to issue as despite low oil prices there is access to cheap financing. The market thinks their fiscal stance is sustainable,  said JC Sambor, deputy head of EM fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London. Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at Danske Bank said however:  Yields are interesting but not as attractive as they used to be two weeks ago amid fears of new sanctions.  With the sanction pattern generally unchanged from 2016, a Russian deal remains off-bounds for several Western banks and asset managers. In early 2016, some U.S. banks were advised not to help Russia launch the issue. A couple of U.S. banks did not reply to Reuters requests for comment, while a chief economist at one of the U.S. banks said he was not allowed to speak on the matter, even off-record. An investor at a German asset manager said by email his fund would not participate in the primary market.  The reason is more compliance related, since VTB as a sole book runner is a sanctioned entity in the EU, this will make an investment in the primary market a very complicated task,  the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said, however, that the fund may consider buying the Eurobonds on the secondary market once trading started.

The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS and VR AND SENIOR DEBT The bank's IDRs, VR and senior debt rating reflect the modest regional franchise of Desio, Fitch's view that its profitability is vulnerable to the interest rate and economic cycles as well as its stable, albeit undiversified, funding. The ratings also reflect the bank's weak asset quality after the acquisition of Banca Popolare di Spoleto (BPSpoleto) in 2014, and Fitch's view that the high level of unreserved impaired loans puts pressure on the bank's capitalisation. Fitch believes that the bank's fairly undiversified business model will remain vulnerable to the economic and interest rate cycles. Desio has been unable to generate satisfactory returns, which remain below global industry averages. Operating performance in 2016 and in 1Q17 suffered from low interest rates and intense competition in the areas Desio operates in, which puts pressure on net interest income. The drop in loan impairment charges since 2015 has allowed the bank to partially offset declining revenue and one-off costs for staff redundancy incentives. Regulatory capital ratios are comfortably above minimum requirements, but in our view capitalisation is not fully commensurate with risk as unreserved impaired loans at end-1Q17 were equal to almost 94% of Fitch Core Capital (FCC), which is high by international standards. Gross impaired loans were above 14% of total loans at end-1Q17, which is high by international standards but in line with other domestic banks'. The extension of Desio' prudent underwriting standards to BPSpoleto resulted in a stabilisation of impaired loans as new inflows have slowed down over the past two years. Fitch expects that the bank should start to benefit from its efforts to address its non-performing loans (NPLs) more actively than in the past through a combination of sales and strengthened workout processes. Desio's funding relies primarily on customer funding as deposits and bonds placed through the branch network account for 85% of total financial liabilities. Since the bank does not access wholesale funding, its funding structure is fairly undiversified. Liquidity is sound, with liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios well above 100%. Contingent access to ECB facilities underpins the bank's funding and liquidity. ECB funding rose to 15% of total assets in March 2017, following Desio's participation in the last TLTRO 2 auction. SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that a bank becomes nonviable. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism for eurozone banks provide a framework for resolving banks that require senior creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The bank's IDRs and VR are primarily sensitive to changes in asset quality. The ratings could benefit from a material decline in impaired loans, in absolute terms and in relation to capital, as a result of the bank successfully implementing its NPL management strategy and the strengthening of its profitability. Conversely, a further increase in net impaired loans relative to FCC beyond 100% or signs that the bank's efforts to reduce impaired loans are not successful would put pressure on ratings. Weaker profitability and signs that the bank's franchise is suffering, which could be the result of the intense competition in Desio's home market, would also put ratings under pressure. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade of the SR and upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support the bank. In Fitch's view this is highly unlikely, although not impossible.

You couldn't make it up,  said a team spokesman after video footage circulated online of the incident late on Saturday night. The images showed French driver Vincent Capillaire, helmeted and about to change shifts, running across to the leading Toyota as it waited for a red light to change at the pit lane exit. Capillaire gave Toyota driver Kamui Kobayashi a thumbs-up sign, which the Japanese interpreted as a signal to go despite the light still being red.  Drivers are told you must at all times follow the marshals,  said the Toyota spokesman, who explained that Kobayashi had mistaken Capillaire for one of the officials who also wear helmets and overalls in the pitlane. With the team shouting at him to stop and not go out on track, Kobayashi stopped and started the car several times in the confusion. In the process, he burned out the car's clutch which led to retirement shortly afterwards.  It would not have happened without that stop-start. He put more stress on the clutch than it would normally have encountered and destroyed it,  said the spokesman.  I don't think he (Capillaire) did it on purpose but it triggered a chain of events.  The Frenchman, who was part of the second tier Algarve Pro Racing LMP2 team, gave his version of events on his facebook page.  I wanted to show my encouragement to the leader car, stopped at red light a few meters in front of my box,  he said.  It was a spontaneous encouragement mark as it happens between pilots.  I was fined by stewards for this gesture and I admit it was inopportune. I regret that.  Porsche ultimately won the race with their second car that had spent well over an hour in the garage for repairs and rejoined on Saturday some 22 laps behind Kobayashi. Toyota had another car retire after a collision while their third TS050 hybrid came home in eighth place after a long period in the garage with mechanics working on the front motor and battery. Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991. Toyota have been five times runners-up and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years in pursuit of victory at the French endurance classic.

In a series of floor motions, inquiries and lengthy speeches, Democrats criticized the closed-door meetings that Republicans have been holding to craft a replacement for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. They called for open committee hearings and more time to consider the bill before a Senate vote, which Republicans say could come in the next two weeks, although a draft bill has yet to emerge publicly. Lacking the votes to derail or change the Republican process, the maneuvers by the Democratic minority seemed more aimed at highlighting Republican efforts on a controversial issue. Polls have said that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Obamacare replacement that has passed the House of Representatives and that Senate Republicans are now considering. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that the closed-door Republican meetings on healthcare amounted to  the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen.    Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,  Schumer charged. The resulting legislation would likely throw millions out of health insurance, he said, while granting  a big fat tax break for the wealthiest among us.

Several Democrats moved for the healthcare legislation to be referred to Senate committees for hearings, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused. McConnell said all Republican senators have been involved to some degree in healthcare meetings and that Democrats would have a chance to amend the legislation they produce, once it is brought to the Senate floor.  We're going to have a meeting on the Senate floor, all hundred of us, with an unlimited amendment process,  McConnell said.  So there will be no failure of opportunity.  Senate Republican leaders would like a vote on healthcare legislation in July, before the July 4 recess if possible. But Republicans have struggled to coalesce around a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions. Senate Republicans also face pressure from the right. In the House, conservatives have written to McConnell to express concern about reports that say the Senate may water down the House bill.

OPEC compliance with the output curbs in May was 108 percent, while non-OPEC compliance was 100 percent, the source said. Another source confirmed compliance by all producers in May was 106 percent.  This is the highest compliance since the beginning of the deal,  one of the sources said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed to cut supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) starting in January to get rid of a supply glut. A technical committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers met in Vienna on Tuesday to monitor compliance with the pact. The producers agreed at a May 25 meeting to extend the accord until March 2018. But oil has declined sharply since then, with Brent crude falling to a seven-month low near $45 a barrel on Tuesday on persistent over-supply concerns.  With recovering production from Nigeria and Libya - OPEC members exempted from supply cuts due to losses caused by unrest - adding to supplies, some OPEC delegates are questioning whether the agreement is enough. But oil ministers, including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, are of the view that the market is heading in the right direction and needs time to rebalance. The panel, which met at OPEC's Vienna headquarters, is the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) established in January to monitor adherence to supply cuts.  Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia is also a member of the JTC in its capacity as 2017 OPEC president.

The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND VR The downgrade primarily reflects Fitch's view that Sondrio's strategy will ultimately fail to achieve a meaningful reduction in impaired loans over the medium term. Unreserved impaired loans will continue to weigh on its capitalisation, such that it is not fully commensurate with risks. The IDRs and VR also reflect Sondrio's sound liquidity, resilient customer funding, and robust cost management mitigating the pressure on profitability from low interest rates. At end-1Q17, gross impaired loans accounted for over 15% of gross loans, which is high by international standards but still compares adequately with Sondrio's domestic peers. Gross impaired loans continued to increase during 2016 (8% yoy) and 1Q17 (2% qoq) although at a slower pace than in previous years. The bank's 2017-2021 strategic plan includes a strategy to manage impaired loans through a series of actions, which however in our view fail to reduce the stock of impaired loans in a meaningful manner. Fitch views this aspect as a weakness in the bank's strategy and expects Sondrio's asset quality to remain weak in the medium term. This means that unreserved impaired loans will continue to weigh significantly on capital. Although Sondrio's reserve coverage of impaired loans at 53% of gross impaired loans at end-1Q17 was one of the highest among rated Italian banks, unreserved impaired loans accounted for a high 72% of Fitch Core Capital (FCC), up from 65% at end-2015. Capital ratios are acceptable with an 11.4% FCC to risk-weighted assets (RWA) ratio at end-2016 and a 10.8% end-1Q17 phased-in CET1 ratio and comfortably above regulatory requirements. However, the high level of unreserved impaired loans means that, in our opinion, the bank's capitalisation is not fully commensurate with risks. Sondrio's profitability has been volatile and sensitive to interest rates cycles. In Fitch's view the bank's small size, which limits its pricing power outside the home province, constrains the bank's profitability. Operating profit fell 22% in 2016 as net interest income declined 11% despite tight cost management and a 35% drop in loan impairment charges. Funding and liquidity are ample and have proven stable to date. Customer deposits have been resilient and benefit from strong client relationships, especially in its home region. Utilisation of central bank funding is reasonable and funding sources are more diversified than in the past due to increased issuance of covered bonds to institutional investors. SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that a bank becomes non-viable. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism for eurozone banks provide a framework for resolving banks that require senior creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND VR Sondrio's ratings are primarily sensitive to a further deterioration in asset quality, particularly if this puts additional pressure on capitalisation through a rise in unreserved impaired loans. The bank's ratings would also come under pressure if Sondrio is unable to generate sustainable and adequate profitability from its core businesses. An upgrade would require a sustainable improvement in asset quality while maintaining adequate capitalisation. A material reduction in the stock of outstanding impaired loans and an improvement in operating profitability are necessary for a rating upgrade. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade of the SR and upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support the bank. While not impossible, in Fitch's view this is highly unlikely.

Indeed, butter and beef drippings have less saturated fat that raise levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad kind of cholesterol that can build up in blood vessels and lead to clots and heart attacks, according to new AHA dietary recommendations. Coconut oil is 82 percent saturated fat, compared with 63 percent for butter and 50 percent for beef fat.  Instead of coconut oil, people should cook with so-called polyunsaturated fats like corn, soybean and peanut oils, the AHA advises.  “Replacing saturated with polyunsaturated has a two-fold effect because a fat that causes heart disease is lowered and a fat that prevents heart disease is increased,” lead author of the advisory Dr. Frank Sacks, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, said by email.  Coconut oil raised LDL about as much as other oils high in fat like butter, beef and palm oil in seven out of seven studies reviewed by the AHA for its advisory published in the journal Circulation.  Replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent, the AHA concludes from its review of trials that used the scientific gold standard for research - randomly assigning some participants to get the intervention being tested and others to receive an alternative or no treatment. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 17.3 million fatalities a year, researchers note in the advisory.   Studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease. For optimal heart health, the AHA recommends the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet. Both diets emphasize unsaturated vegetable oils, nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry and both limit red meat, as well as foods and drinks high in added sugars and salt. Even eating like this some of the time may help, said Dr. John Potter of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.  “Small changes may be relevant,” Potter, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  These might include cutting saturated fat with one meatless dinner a week, reducing sugar by eating one less cookie or drinking one less can of soda, having one less glass of alcohol or getting a few extra minutes of exercise every day, Potter suggested.  Portions also matter, said Dr. Lennert Veerman of the Cancer Council NSW in Sydney, Australia. “Baking with coconut oil may not raise heart disease risks as much as, for example, a generous amount of butter on a 12-ounce steak, not to speak of the steak itself,” Veerman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But then again, a small reduction of risk every day adds up, so replacing coconut oil with olive oil may be an easy way to reduce risk a bit.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2s9il2Z Circulation, online June 15, 2017.

The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. Fitch has assigned a 'BBB(dcr)' Derivative Counterparty Rating (DCR) to Credem as part of its roll-out of DCRs to significant derivative counterparties in western Europe and the US as the bank is a swap counterparty to Fitch-rated transactions. DCRs are issuer ratings and express Fitch's view of banks' relative vulnerability to default under derivative contracts with third-party, non-government counterparties. KEY RATING DRIVERS VR, IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND DCR The IDRs, VR, senior debt rating and DCR of Credem reflect its diversified and stable business model, which has to date resulted in a more resilient profitability and healthier asset quality than its Italian peers. Credem's company profile has helped the bank to generate stable fees and commissions, with income from its wealth management and insurance businesses providing a cushion to protect the bank from the impact of current low interest rates on profitability. Strong underwriting standards and a low risk appetite have also helped to keep loan impairment charges low and stable during a time of high loan impairments in the Italian banking sector and have helped support profitability. Operating costs, however, are high at Credem, both as a proportion of revenues and of assets, and have been affected by the bank's highly centralised loan approval process, investments in IT systems, controls, compliance structures and expansion of its sales network. Credem's resilient profitability has kept internal capital generation sound. We view capitalisation as being in line with the bank's risk profile, with a strong buffer maintained between the bank's 13.7% end-2016 phased-in CET1 capital ratio and minimum regulatory requirements. Fitch believes that maintaining capitalisation higher than minimum requirements is justified at Credem due to unreserved impaired loans moderately weighing on capitalisation (at end-2016 these were equal to about 38% of Fitch Core Capital). Credem's asset quality is healthy, particularly in light of the high level of non-performing loans in Italy. Credem reported a gross impaired loans/ gross loans ratio of about 5.6% at end-2016, and we believe that this has been achieved by strong underwriting standards towards domestic SMEs and by avoiding single-name and industry concentrations. The bank has been able to reduce impaired loans through small amounts of write-offs and sales every year, which, however, has resulted in below-average impairment reserve coverage. Sales have generally been achieved at book value. We view Credem's funding as stable. Funding benefits from a solid core customer deposit base and deposits have benefited recently from inflows from distressed Italian banks. Funding is undiversified and apart from deposits consists largely of covered bonds and funding from the ECB's Targeted Long-term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). The bank has some outstanding retail bonds but is no longer issuing these. Its liquidity is supported by good access to central bank facilities. The bank's 'F2' Short-Term IDR is the higher of the two possibilities for a 'BBB' Long-Term IDR to reflect the strength of the bank's short-term liquidity. The DCR is at the same level as the Long-Term IDR because in Italy derivative counterparties have no preferential legal status over other senior obligations. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The bank's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign if a bank becomes non-viable. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism for eurozone banks provide a framework for resolving banks that require senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Credem's subordinated Tier 2 debt is rated one notch below the bank's VR for loss severity to reflect below-average recovery prospects. No notching is applied for incremental non-performance risk because write-down of the notes will only occur once the point of non-viability is reached and there is no coupon flexibility prior to non-viability. RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND DCR Credem's ratings are primarily sensitive to a material deterioration in asset quality, which could be the result of an unexpected weakening of underwriting standards, or to a further deterioration of the domestic economy. Ratings could also be downgraded if capitalisation falls as a result of strong loan growth or if the bank increases its risk appetite. Given the bank's purely domestic focus, the bank ratings are sensitive to deterioration in the operating environment in Italy and to Italy's sovereign rating. Any upgrade of the ratings would require an upgrade of Italy's sovereign rating. Credem's Short-Term IDR would be downgraded if the bank's liquidity declines or if, for example it is unable to successfully manage the tapering of ECB's bond buying programme and replace central bank funding with market funding. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade of the SR and upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support Credem. While not impossible, in Fitch's view this is highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt are sensitive to a change in the bank's VR. The rating is also sensitive to a change in notching if Fitch revises its assessment of loss severity or incremental non-performance risk.

An Islamist insurgency in the rugged, thinly populated Sinai Peninsula has gained pace since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. The air strikes  resulted in the killing of 12 highly dangerous ... leaders of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis , the military said in a statement. It did not say when the aerial bombing took place.  Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Egypt's most active militant group, swore allegiance to Islamic State in 2014 and adopted the name Sinai Province. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen in attacks since then. The group has turned its guns on Egyptian Christians in recent months, killing around 100 in bombings at Coptic churches. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi carried out air strikes on militants in Libya in response to a deadly attack on Coptic Christians last month that left at least 29 dead. Egypt's military says it has killed thousands of militants in operations in Sinai. Residents of Sinai say the high death rates include civilians. Three other militants were killed on Tuesday in Egypt's second city Alexandria.  Police raided an apartment in the Mediterranean coastal city based on intelligence that wanted members of the Hasam militant group were hiding there, the Interior Ministry said. Police attempted to arrest the militants, the ministry said in a statement, but they shot at the force leading to a firefight. All three were killed. Hasam, a recently emerged group which is active in Cairo and other cities and is separate from Islamic State, claimed responsibility for a roadside bomb that killed a policeman on Sunday. Egypt says Hasam is the armed wing of the Muslim Brotherhood but the Brotherhood, the world's oldest Islamist movement, denies any connection to Hasam and says it is peaceful.

Next Insurance, which raised $29 million in May from investors led by reinsurer Munich Re's HSB Ventures, said on Tuesday that American Express's venture capital arm has joined the investor group. Next Insurance will use the new cash injection, which brings the investment round to $35 million, to expand the products it offers and target new business sectors, the company said. It is in early discussions with American Express on a possible partnership, given the credit card company's large customer base of U.S. businesses, Next Insurance chief operating officer Sofya Pogreb said in an interview.  Founded in 2016, Next Insurance collects and analyzes data to sell customized insurance to U.S. small business owners who were previously disregarded by large insurers, including personal trainers, photographers and contractors. It is part of a growing group of young companies so-called 'insurtech' startups that are looking to modernize the insurance sector by taking advantage of digital technologies, to make better customized underwriting decisions and offer cheaper products.   Small business insurance is one of the most promising areas for young technology companies, according to a recent report by Willis Towers Watson Plc (WLTW.O) and data provider CB Insights, which estimated 25 percent of small business premiums in the United States could be underwritten digitally by 2020.   Finding the right insurance is often a time-consuming, complicated process for small-business owners,  Harshul Sanghi, managing partner at American Express Ventures, said in a statement. Next Insurance has simplified the process through its easy-to-use website and analytics, he added.  While Next Insurance helps customize the policies and sells the insurance, it relies on large insurers as partners for underwriting and for some of the regulatory requirements. For example, its insurance for photographers is offered with Munich Re, which has been an active investor and partner of young technology startups, over the past year. Next Insurance has 5,000 customers and has passed $1 million in total underwritten premium, Pogreb said.

Bush,George Shultz,James Baker,USA,CARBON/TAX,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Major oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP Plc have thrown their support behind a carbon tax plan proposed by a group of elder Republican statesmen, according to an advertisement published in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The corporate support for the plan, which would impose a $40 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide produced, follows a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact that fights climate change by slashing emissions from burning fossil fuels.  This plan would achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than all current and prior climate regulations, while helping America's businesses and workers get ahead,  according to the advertisement from the Climate Leadership Council. The ad bore the corporate symbols of companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell, Total, GM, Johnson & Johnson, and PepsiCo. The Climate Leadership Council proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The proposed $40 per ton tax on carbon would rise in price over time, and revenues would be paid into the Social Security Administration. While the plan echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change, it could be a non-starter. Trump has expressed doubt over the existence of climate change and has said efforts to fight it put the United States at a competitive disadvantage. A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration has previously said a carbon tax is not under consideration. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels drives global climate change, has raised sea levels and triggered more frequent and powerful storms. Oil giants like Exxon and BP have been criticized for their roles in contributing to climate change through the production and marketing of fossil fuels. Still, in recent years, they have supported government efforts to regulate emissions, including through the Paris climate deal agreed by nearly 200 nations in 2015. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods had repeatedly urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris deal, saying the country's abundant reserves of low-carbon natural gas made it well-placed to perform within the agreement.

News of increased supply by several key oil producers hammered crude futures to a seven-month low, extending a trend that has undermined attempts by OPEC and others to support prices by cutting output.     Currencies of oil exporters led the declines in Latin American foreign exchange markets, with the Colombian peso  slipping 2.2 percent to its weakest in a year. The Mexican peso was down 0.9 percent.     Shares of oil companies tumbled, weighing on stock markets in the region. Losses in shares of Brazilian state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA subtracted the most points from Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index, while shares of Colombia's Ecopetrol dropped nearly 3 percent.     Brazilian miner Vale SA also fell as concerns over Chinese demand for steel and global oversupply dragged iron ore futures lower.

The latest dip in Italian yields came as the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said its plan to hold a referendum on Italy's euro membership was  a negotiating tool . Earlier this year, government bond yields in southern Europe rose due to uncertainty over how French elections in May would play out, the possibility of a snap vote in Italy and speculation of the European Central Bank beginning to wind down its extraordinary monetary stimulus. Since then, however, the ECB has indicated it is in no hurry to end its programme, centrist Emmanuel Macron beat anti-euro far-right leader Marine Le Pen to become French president, and fears have faded of Italy facing a potentially disruptive election.  The perception in the market is that the main political risks that were the dominating factors (in euro zone bond markets) are now behind us,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  Investors are now happy to take some carry into the summer months.  The Italian-German bond yield spread, closely watched as a key indicator of political risk in the bloc, tightened to 165 basis points, its narrowest level since early January. Italian 10-year yields fell late on Tuesday to as little as 1.914 percent, a five-month low and down 3.8 bps on the day. The 5-Star movement's plan for a referendum on whether Italy should remain in the euro was Plan B, a leading deputy said.  Big investors and markets should be able to distinguish it from the real intentions of a 5-Star government on the subject of the euro,  Carla Ruocco told Reuters. However, the fall in yields prompted a note of caution from the world's largest bond investor.  You need to be generous to fund Italy at 2 percent given a wide range of risks that are coming,  Andrew Balls, chief investment officer for global fixed income at PIMCO, told a Euromoney conference in London. Italy will face elections in 2018, with 5-Star riding high in opinion polls. There is also the possibility of a state bailout to support some of its ailing banks at a time when the debt-to-GDP ratio is over 130 percent. Spanish 10-year yields also fell, down 5 bps on the day to 1.393 percent, their lowest in about a week. The promise of continued monetary stimulus is also positive for lower-rated bonds in the bloc, and indications are that central bankers in major developed countries are all hesitating to tighten monetary policy. On Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise interest rates.

Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein called for an international investigation, saying the Kinshasa government had not done enough to look into the atrocities. Congo's human rights minister dismissed that statement. Zeid told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva he had reports the Bana Mura militia was backing the government in its fight against insurgents in the central Kasai region, and had focused attacks on two ethnic groups, the Luba and Lulua.  Refugees from multiple villages in the Kamonya territory  indicated that the Bana Mura have in the past two months shot dead, hacked or burned to death, and mutilated, hundreds of villagers, as well as destroying entire villages,  Zeid said. Congo's government has been fighting insurgents in Kasai since last August, triggering fears of a wider conflict in the large central African country, which is a tinderbox of ethnic rivalry and competing claims over mineral resources. Wars at the turn of the century killed millions and involved more than a half-dozen neighboring countries. Violence has increased since December, when President Joseph Kabila decided to stay in power beyond the end of his two-term mandate on the grounds that more time was needed to prepare for elections. Kasai is an opposition stronghold. Congo's Human Rights Minister Marie Ange Mushobekwa told the council her government was investigating the reports of atrocities and had nothing to hide, suggesting the accusations were politically motivated.  Some countries ... should not try to use the Human Rights Council – such a respectable institution – to settle scores with states whose leaders they don't like,  she said. Mass Graves She dismissed earlier reports from Zeid's team of the discovery of mass graves in the territory, saying one site had turned out to contain just a rifle and another a motorcycle.   The sad truth is that they are looking for mass graves everywhere except where they may actually exist,  she told the council.     Zeid said U.N. investigators had seen children as young as two whose limbs had been chopped off and babies had machete wounds and severe burns.  One two-month-old baby seen by my team had been hit by two bullets four hours after birth; the mother was also wounded. At least two pregnant women were sliced open and their foetuses mutilated,  he added. He asked the rights council to authorize an international investigation as progress in Congolese investigations  has clearly been insufficient in view of the massive scale and horrific nature of the crimes that have taken place and, sadly, continue . Security forces and the Kamuina Nsapu militia have killed at least 3,383 people in Kasai since October, the Catholic church said on Tuesday, citing its own sources in the remote territory bordering Angola. The report said the army destroyed 10 villages as it sought to stamp out an insurrection and accused the militia of killing hundreds of people, destroying four villages and attacking church property in a campaign to drive out government troops. No one was immediately available to comment from the militia or the army, which has dismissed previous accusations of abuses. But the report will carry considerable weight in a country where about 40 percent of the population identifies as Catholic. Fighting surged in Kasai in August when the army killed a chief who had been calling for central government forces to quit the region, saying it should be left to local leaders. The U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva is due to decide this week whether to authorize an investigation into the Kasai violence. U.N. investigators say they have discovered 42 mass graves.

Separately, Boeing and Bombardier said the airline had also ordered aircraft from them. The A350-900s will be deployed on Ethiopian's long haul routes connecting Addis Ababa with destinations in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Chief Executive Tewolde GebreMariam said in a statement. The state-owned carrier is ranked the largest in Africa by revenue and profit by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global industry body. Boeing said Ethiopian had signed a commitment to buy two 777 freighters in an order valued at $651.4 million at list prices. It added the airline had also ordered another 10 737 MAX 8 planes, exercising options from a 2014 order, bringing Ethiopian's total orders for 737 MAX 8s to 30. Bombardier, meanwhile, said Ethiopian had signed a purchase agreement for an additional five of its Q400 turboprop aircraft. In February, Tewolde told Reuters that Ethiopian's revenue rose 10.3 percent to 54.5 billion birr ($2.43 billion) in the 2015/16 fiscal year, while passenger numbers climbed 18 percent to 7.6 million. Net profit was up 70 percent at 6 billion birr. Ethiopian wants to increase revenue to $10 billion by 2025 and expand its fleet to 140 aircraft from less than 90 now, with sights set on Asia.

Oil prices nosedived to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply by several key producers, a trend that has undermined attempts by OPEC and other producers to support the market through reduced output. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 1.5 percent and were among the biggest drags on the Dow and S&P.; The S&P; energy sector's 2.2 percent fall led the decliners, putting the sector on track for its biggest one-day percentage loss since early March. Both oil benchmarks - U.S. crude and Brent - are down more than 15 percent since late May, raising concerns that prices could fall further in the near-term.  Oil prices are now approaching bear market territory and that, psychologically, has a big impact on Wall Street,  said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments in Florida.  If oil prices collapse, the message the oil market is sending is that demand is drying up and global economic growth is waning.  At 11:04 a.m. ET (1504 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.8 points, or 0.02 percent, at 21,525.19, the S&P; 500 was down 6.96 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,446.5. The Nasdaq Composite was down 10.57 points, or 0.17 percent, at 6,228.45. A recovery in technology stocks also appeared to have lost momentum, adding to the overall weakness.  Investors are hunting for value and while the 'buy-the-dip' crowd showed up when tech stocks fell, we are seeing a mini-rotation among sectors where underperforming sectors such as healthcare and biotech stocks are being snapped up right now,  said Sarhan. The S&P; technology sector was down 0.3 percent. It had posted two straight weeks of losses on concerns regarding valuation and a move into defensive sectors in a rising interest rate environment. On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making. Among stocks, Lennar rose 4.2 percent to $54.91 after the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. D.R. Horton was up 2.3 percent, while Pultegroup rose 1.9 percent. Chipotle fell 6.7 percent to $428.58 after the burrito chain said its operating costs in the second quarter will be slightly higher than the first quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,015 to 766. On the Nasdaq, 1,685 issues fell and 973 advanced.

Brent crude touched its lowest level since April 2016 and WTI hit its lowest since February 2016 following news of increases in supply by several key producers. That slide weighed down energy stocks on Wall Street and in Europe. The S&P; energy index dropped 1.9 percent as the worst performing of the 11 major S&P; sectors and Europe's oil & gas sector slumped 2.1 percent.  What is amazing about this market is that we have been able to make new all-time highs with energy basically back to what it was doing in 2014 and 2015,  said Marc Chaikin, chief executive of Chaikin Analytics in Philadelphia. The Dow and benchmark S&P; 500 had hit fresh records on Monday, buoyed by a rebound in the tech sector. Chaikin sees the 2,450 level on the S&P; 500 as a strong resistance point the market is having difficulty climbing over,  given that earnings season is over and we are just sort of wavering between various stimuli.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 points, or 0.01 percent, to 21,526.89, the S&P; 500 lost 7.26 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,446.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.97 points, or 0.22 percent, to 6,225.05. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.43 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.44 percent. U.S. crude fell 2.99 percent to $42.88 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.67, down 2.64 percent. The U.S. dollar strengthened for a second day as Federal Reserve officials maintained a hawkish tone on hiking interest rates. On Monday, New York Fed President William Dudley said halting the rate-hiking cycle now would imperil the economy. That was followed by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said on Tuesday the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks. The dollar index, tracking the unit against other key world currencies, rose 0.31 percent, with the euro down 0.22 percent to $1.1124. The greenback is up nearly 1 percent for the month. Sterling was last trading at $1.261, down 0.96 percent on the day. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney doused speculation that he might soon back higher interest rates, telling bankers on Tuesday that he first wanted to see how the economy coped with Brexit talks in coming months. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.1687 percent, from 2.188 percent late on Monday.

Mounting concerns about the impact on crops of a heatwave in France, the European Union's biggest wheat grower and exporter,  sent Euronext wheat futures rocketing to near one-year highs on Tuesday. [GRA/EU]  It's clear that the very hot temperatures are degrading crop potential in Europe but it is too early to say by how much,  the head of French consultancy Agritel Michel Portier said. Analysts have lowered grain crop estimates in recent weeks, with Strategie Grains cutting its EU soft wheat crop estimate by 1.1 million tonnes last week to 141.6 million. Agritel lowered its French soft wheat crop forecast to 36-37 million tonnes from 37.1 million seen last week, because of scalding damage, Portier said, adding that the forecast would need to be fine-tuned, depending partly on next week's weather. Forecaster Meteo France currently sees temperatures falling back to average levels from the end of this week. France last year harvested its lowest crop in decades at 28 million tonnes after poor spring weather, tumbling from a record 41 million in 2015.  In Spain, this year's extreme weather – from the frosts over the winter to recent record high temperatures – will mean a soft wheat crop of 3.7 million tonnes, down from 7.2 million last year, farmers association Cooperativas Agro-alimentarias said. FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows a farmer in his tractor making bales of straw after wheat harvest in his field in northern France, July 21, 2015.Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoNorthern Europe Better Off In the EU's second largest producer Germany, wheat is developing well after a rainy June helped crop development after an unusually dry start to the spring.  Overall the picture is satisfactory and Germany is on course for a good, average crop this summer as we have not had the weather extremes seen in other parts of Europe,  one German grains analyst said.   The next 2-3 weeks will be critical for yields and a mix of sunshine and rain is needed.  Germany's 2017 wheat crop will increase 3 percent on the year to 25.20 million tonnes, the country's cooperatives association estimated on June 14. This was up from 24.98 million tonnes the association had estimated in May. In the fourth largest producer Poland, crops also benefited from recent rain, said Wojtek Sabaranski of analysts Sparks Polska, which estimates the country will harvest 11.3 million tonnes in 2017, up 1 percent on the year. Britain's wheat crop appears in good condition with scope for a modest increase in production this year.     Trade estimates for this year's UK wheat crop range from around 14.5 million to 15.0 million tonnes, up slightly from last season's 14.38 million.      Over the last two or three weeks, estimates have gradually begun to creep upwards,  analyst Jack Watts of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board <AHDB) said.

Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox has offered $14.8 billion to buy the 61 percent of Britain's Sky it does not already own, reigniting a row in the country over whether the Australian-born businessman has too much influence. On Tuesday two regulators submitted their findings to the government after being asked to look into whether Fox would have too much control of the media, and whether it would be committed to upholding broadcasting standards if the deal went ahead. Media regulator Ofcom has also examined whether executives at Fox are  fit and proper  to hold a broadcasting licence. The reports will be made public when the British government makes its statement. The government will now decide whether to approve the deal, whether to refer it to the Competition and Markets Authority for a longer investigation or whether to engage with both parties to find solutions to their concerns. Media Secretary Karen Bradley said she would make an initial statement by June 29.  There will then be an opportunity for representations to be made before I take a final decision,  she said. Murdoch and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to drop the bid. Wary of the political fallout from the last attempt, when a public inquiry exposed close ties between Murdoch's newspapers and leading politicians, the British government has asked its regulators to assess the impact. Fox, which owns cable, film and pay-TV assets around the world, says the media market has changed dramatically in recent years as broadcasters face new challenges from streaming services like Netflix. The Murdoch family has split its newspaper businesses, which own the Times and Sun papers in Britain, from its television and film assets in a move that helped pave the way for another tilt at Sky.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sky-ma-twenty-first-fox-idUSL1N1JH0Y4"},

I will say that the most recent inflation data made me a little nervous about that. I think it's much more challenging from here on out,  Evans said in an interview with broadcaster CNBC. Evans, who is a voter this year on the central bank's rate-setting committee, said that global forces, not just specific one-off reasons, could be behind a retreat in inflation over the past three months. In a news conference following the Fed's decision to raise interest rates last week for the second time in three months, Fed Chair Janet Yellen largely blamed temporary factors for the inflation shortfall.  In a world of global competition and new technology, I think competition is coming from new places. New partners are choosing to merge and sort of changing the marketplace, and (there's) more competitive pressure potentially on price margins,  Evans said. If inflation remains in a slump, the Fed may require a shallower path of rate rises, he added. The Chicago Fed chief also reiterated his belief that given the lack of clarity on inflation, the central bank could wait until December before deciding whether to raise rates again. Asked about the timing of the Fed's plans to begin reducing its balance sheet, Evans said it was  pretty close.

The Bosniak and Croat students succeeded in their year-long fight against the regional government, forcing it to reverse its decision to divide them into two separate, ethnically based schools in the town of Jajce. Emboldened by their victory, the young people gathered on Tuesday before the government building in Travnik to request the abolition of other schools in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzeovina where Bosniak and Croats attend separate classes in the same building. They held placards reading  Friendship under Embargo  and  Death to Politics, Freedom to Education . Following the war of the 1990s, Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks represent so-called constituent people in Bosnia. In schools, each group has its own national curriculum and each is taught in the Serb, Croat or Bosnian language, although linguists say they are essentially one language.   We have fought and will continue to fight against fascism at schools, divisions and segregation,  said Nikolas Rimac, a Croat student who led the fight against divisions in Jajce.

In Bosnia, where Bosniak, Croat and Serb nationalist parties base their power on distrust of each others, all attempts to unify education have failed so far.

Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations, along with allegations of Libor manipulation before and during the crisis, has resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced funds' demand for bank debt, so Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions. As a result, bankers and regulators in the United States, Britain, Europe and Japan are developing alternative benchmark interest rates.   Getting a rate that’s supported, that’s well built and robust, is very important because they need to move a lot of the swaps market off of Libor,” said Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford University who chaired a committee of market participants that advised the Financial Stability Board on reference rate reform. The two alternative rates under proposal in the United States are the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, an unsecured bank lending rate based on transactions in the fed funds and eurodollar markets, and a rate based on overnight lending in the U.S. Treasury collateralized repurchase agreement, or  repo , market. Over time, the new benchmark may be used as a reference rate for corporate loans, residential mortgages and credit cards. “The hope is that whatever rate emerges can be the basis of a liquid enough market that it can be used for many different purposes, just as Libor is,” Duffie said. Related CoverageFactbox: Why do regulators want a Libor alternative?However, the process of building trading volumes around the new benchmark is likely to be slow. Asset managers, corporations and other swaps users are unlikely to trade any contracts based on the new rate until liquidity has been established. Private and exchange-traded derivatives have by far the largest exposures to U.S. dollar Libor, at around $150 trillion.    To regulators including the Federal Reserve, the size of the derivatives exposures creates systemic risks for financial markets if liquidity in Libor falls further.   Fed data shows that interbank lending activity at U.S. commercial banks is at its lowest levels since the 1970s.  At a meeting last year of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), which is developing the new benchmark, Fed Governor Jerome Powell warned that “benchmarks sometimes come to a halt.  ICE Benchmark Administration, which took over administration of Libor from the British Bankers' Association in 2014, said last year that only around 30 percent of three-month U.S.-dollar Libor submissions were transaction-based in 2015. ICE declined to comment on the vote for the new rate. A Slow Transition The process of moving to a new benchmark rate is likely to be slow, but over time it may reshape financial markets. “Any movement away from Libor for United States dollar transactions, however its stage and whatever the scope of that transition, will undoubtedly have profound implications for financial markets throughout the world,” said David Duffee, a finance partner at law firm Mayer Brown in New York. One issue is that both rates under consideration are for overnight loans, and there is not yet a market for term loans such as one and three months, as in Libor. “There are a lot of questions about how they will be replacing three-month Libor contracts. My guess is that the market will continue to use Libor until the time that a term market in the new index develops,” said Sam Priyadarshi, head of portfolio risk and derivatives at Vanguard in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Three-month Libor contracts are used as the reference rate for most interest rate derivatives. Banks also rely heavily on the CME Group’s (CME.O) Eurodollar futures market, which is Libor-based, to hedge swap transactions, so liquidity in similar futures contracts based on the new benchmark will likely be needed to boost trading in swaps contracts based on the new rate. The ARRC indicated in its interim report in 2016 that clearinghouses that guarantee swap trades should begin by offering banks and other participants an option for payments based on the interest rate swaps daily value using the new rate. That is expected to help build liquidity around the new rate before trading begins. The creation of a new market to trade the basis between Libor-based swaps and contracts based on the new rate is also envisioned.

The two rates under proposal are the Overnight Bank Funding Rate and a rate based on overnight lending in the U.S. Treasury collateral-based repurchase agreement market. The following are some facts about why an alternative rate is being created: What is Libor? The London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) began in the 1970s in London as the rate that U.S. banks would lend to each other, and was used as a reference rate for corporate bank loans. In the 1980s the rate began being published as an average rate of a group of banks. The growth of interest rate derivatives since the 1980s made it easier to hedge Libor-based loans, helping spread the use of the rate to products ranging from student loans to credit cards. The rate underpins more than $3 trillion in syndicated loans, around $1.5 trillion in commercial mortgages and $1.44 trillion in residential mortgages, and another $2.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, according to a report by the Financial Stability Board's Market Participants Group in 2013.  The largest exposures, however, are in derivatives. Libor is used as a reference rate in around $111 trillion privately traded derivatives and an additional $30 trillion in exchange-traded derivatives. Why do they want an alternative? Libor lost credibility as a benchmark after banks including Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS were, since 2012, fined by U.S. and British authorities for manipulating Libor submissions, in many cases to boost profits on their derivatives positions. ICE Benchmark Administration, which took over administration of Libor from the British Bankers' Association in 2014, has implemented reforms to shore up the rate and reduce its susceptibility to manipulation. Libor is still viewed as fragile, however, as regulatory reforms since the 2007-2009 financial crisis have resulted in banks making fewer short-term loans to each other. Money fund reform has also reduced demand for short-term bank debt. That means the rates are often estimated and not transaction based. Data by ICE shows that only around 30 percent of U.S. dollar based three-month Libor submissions are based on actual transactions. Is the United States the only country looking for an alternative rate? No. Regulators have pushed internationally to find alternatives to Libor and its equivalents. A British committee has selected SONIA, an unsecured overnight lending rate, as an alternative to sterling-based Libor and Japan last year selected TONAR as an alternative to yen Libor, also an unsecured rate. A group in Switzerland in May selected SARON, a collateralized rate based on the Swiss repo market, as a Libor alternative. The European Central Bank said in May it is ready to work on its own index of bank-to-bank lending after an industry-led revamp of Euribor failed. Will the new rate immediately replace Libor? No. Regulators and market participants expect a very slow transition to the new interest rate and it is likely to take years to develop liquidity in markets referencing the new rate. What are the differences between the two proposed rates? The Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR) is an unsecured rate, meaning that there is no collateral exchanged to back the loan. The rate is a volume-weighted median of overnight fed funds and Eurodollar transactions. Around $70 billion fed funds transactions are made per day and around $240 billion Eurodollar trades are made overnight. The overnight repurchase market is secured, with borrowers pledging Treasuries to back the loans. The so-called repo market is estimated to have more than $600 billion in trades made overnight. What are the pros and cons of each? Analysts at TD Securities note that an advantage of using the OBFR is that interest rate swaps currently use the Effective Fed Funds Rate (EFFR), which is based on fed funds transactions, to value payments and the OBFR and EFFR rates are very similar. A swaps market referencing the EFFR, the overnight index swap (OIS) market, also already exists. Disadvantages are that volumes in the OBFR market have been declining and volumes drop significantly around quarter- and year-end, TD said. The advantages of using a repo rate is that the market is more liquid. Disadvantages, however, are that the exact rate that would be used does not yet exist, which could potentially make for a longer and more complicated transition, the TD analysts said.

I will say that the most recent inflation data made me a little nervous about that. I think it's much more challenging from here on out,  Evans said in an interview with broadcaster CNBC. Evans, who is a voter this year on the central bank's rate-setting committee, said that global forces, not just specific one-off reasons, could be behind a retreat in inflation over the past three months. In a news conference following the Fed's decision to raise interest rates last week for the second time in three months, Fed Chair Janet Yellen largely blamed temporary factors for the inflation shortfall.  In a world of global competition and new technology, I think competition is coming from new places. New partners are choosing to merge and sort of changing the marketplace, and (there's) more competitive pressure potentially on price margins,  Evans said. If inflation remains in a slump, the Fed may require a shallower path of rate rises, he added. The Chicago Fed chief also reiterated his belief that given the lack of clarity on inflation, the central bank could wait until December before deciding whether to raise rates again. Asked about the timing of the Fed's plans to begin reducing its balance sheet, Evans said it was  pretty close.

Around 90 percent of euro-denominated derivatives are cleared in London. A European Commission draft law would give Brussels the power to deny recognition to a clearing house if it poses excessive risks or to require it to move to the EU.  I believe that such an approach will be justified in case EU authorities are unable to adequately control risks and fulfill their mandates through other means,  Coeure said in a speech. Clearing houses, like the London Stock Exchange's LCH.Clearnet, and UK officials argue that forced relocation would split markets, increase trading costs and diminish the status of the euro. Coeure said that the current framework, guided by EU law, giving the ECB some oversight and providing the European Court of Justice with jurisdiction, is appropriate. But giving European courts oversight once Britain leaves the EU is a contentious issues and an eventual agreement is far from certain.  The safety and soundness of central counterparties (CCPs) matters for central banks, and it matters a lot,  Coeure said.  What concerns us today in the context of Brexit is that the current EU regime regarding third-country CCPs was never designed to cope with major systemic CCPs operating from outside the EU.  Indeed, this regime relies to a large extent on local supervision, and provides EU authorities with very limited tools for obtaining information and taking action in the event of a crisis.  Current rules also require the ECB to be part of supervisory colleges scrutinizing clearing activities and to endorse supervisory decisions taken by national authorities. Coeure added that the ECB would issue an opinion on clearing in the coming months but argued that the ECB needs to have a strong role. Under the Commission proposal, if the European Securities and Markets Authority decides that a non-EU clearer is handling systemically important volumes of euro-denominated business, enhanced supervision would be required. If such enhanced supervision is still inadequate, the activity would have to be moved, as a last resort.

Daimler said in February that it will invest more than 250 million euros ($279 million) in the factory, contrasting with widespread wariness among international investors after a prolonged downturn brought on by sanctions and a collapse in global oil prices. But Russia's economy has recently shown signs of recovery, while its car market is returning to growth after four years of decline. Speaking at a ceremony to lay the factory's first stone, Markus Schaefer, a member of the divisional board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, said Daimler had made the decision after a  very, very successful conversation  with the Russian government. Moscow Regional Governor Andrey Vorobyov said President Vladimir Putin had personally signed off on the deal, allowing the regional government to offer unspecified conditions previously not available to foreign investors.

We are confident in the long-term potential of Russia.  Slideshow (3 Images)Global automakers had viewed Russia as a promising growth market until the 2014 sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine and the economic downturn prompted companies to put projects on hold. Car sales have more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million a year and U.S. auto giant General Motors (GM.N) quitthe market in 2015.  Though Mercedes' Russian car sales dropped 11 percent last year to 36,888, according to the Association of European Business (AEB) lobby group, Schaefer said he expects numbers to show an increase in 2017 and continue growing after the new plant opens in 2019. The company's Russian car sales in May jumped 8 percent year on year. The factory will employ more than 1,000 people working across a 85-hectare site to produce more than 20,000 Mercedes-Benz cars and SUVs a year. Hoping to benefit from a future rebound in Russian car sales, some international manufacturers have recently started to strengthen their presence in Russia.

Mike Delaney, general manager of airplane developments at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the final decision would be for Boeing's top leadership but that design, production and cost characteristics were all pointing in the right direction. Speaking to Reuters, Delaney confirmed for the first time publicly that the proposed new aircraft would have a composite fuselage, a key decision likely to boost suppliers such as Boeing's sole composites contractor Toray of Japan. In a separate briefing at the Paris Airshow, Delaney said the jet would make  extensive use  of composites and confirmed it would have a  hybrid  cross-section, apparently referring to the need for a large cabin and slimmed-down cargo space.  Delaney's keenly awaited annual briefing at the world's largest air show gave fresh clues on how the U.S. planemaker's newest airplane might be designed. The idea is to carve out a new market between medium-haul single-aisle planes like the 737 and Airbus A320 family and the smallest long-haul jets like the A330 and Boeing 787. Boeing faces a difficult puzzle as it tries to square conflicting airline demands for a wide twin-aisle cabin with the low operating costs of the 737 category. Delaney said airlines consulted by Boeing had stressed that what counts most is being able to carry the right number of passengers for the routes for which the jet is designed. Based on Boeing market forecasts that is likely to be 220 to 270. They are less worried about carrying cargo. That is the opposite of what airlines had said when Boeing was developing larger planes like the 787 and 777, Delaney said.  In those cases, engineers had designed the fuselage around the cargo containers and then adjusted the rest of the fuselage and therefore the seating capacity around that. Design Clues Delaney's statements give important clues about what is expected to be an unconventional fuselage for the mid-market plane, which in turn may determine whether Boeing can square that circle of wide cabins and low operating cost. Industry sources have said the fuselage will have a somewhat elliptical shape when seen from the front because the bottom of the plane will be flattened to get rid of unnecessary cargo space. Usually a pressurized fuselage is round to avoid stress points. Building the fuselage out of tough lightweight composites allows less conventional shapes. In turn, stripping away unnecessary space reduces drag and makes the plane cheaper to fly. Delaney declined to talk in detail about the design except to say the fuselage would have a  hybrid  cross-section.  It is a geometry that supports twin-aisle comfort and single-aisle economics,  he said. Another Boeing executive recently said it had considered options from  mild to wild  for the new jet. The new jet is expected to enter service in 2025, if Boeing decides to go ahead and develop it.

The Refugees Bill, which recently went through its third and final reading in parliament, will become law once the president assents to it, Agostinho Neto, the member of parliament behind the bill, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday.  We hope that the bill will provide a durable solution to the problems facing refugees in our country,  he said.  This is a progressive law that is forward-looking and will help manage future refugee populations.  Legally, all refugees in Kenya must live in camps and cannot work, even though some arrived three decades ago.  Food rations for refugees in Kenya, mainly from war-torn neighboring South Sudan and Somalia, have been cut repeatedly due to funding shortages.  Kenya joins a number of organizations, such as the United Nations and World Bank, that are shifting their approach to offer longer-term help for refugees to become more self-sufficient. Nearly 66 million people globally have fled their homes because of violence, oppression or drought..  Some of the key elements in the bill include the access to land and work permits, which are a great step in ensuring self-reliance and integration of refugees,  said Imaana Koome, program officer at the Refugee Consortium of Kenya. Work permits will only be granted to refugees with certain skills, he said, and they will not be allowed to sell land. There have been tensions between poor locals living around the Dadaab and Kakuma camps, who often suffer drought and hunger, and the refugees who receive free food, healthcare and education.  Hospitals, schools and water points set up within the camps for exclusive use by refugees created feelings of marginalization amongst the host communities,  Neto said.   We hope the bill will address all these.  Kenyans will be allowed to use services in the camps, he said, and funds will be raised to address environmental degradation caused by refugees felling trees for firewood.     Kenya has tried to shut Dadaab, once the world's largest camp, which it says was being used by Islamist militants from Somalia as a recruiting ground for attacks on Kenyan soil.  It has repatriated more than 60,000 refugees to Somalia since December 2014, the U.N. says.

Soros used Quantum Fund in 1992 to bet successfully that sterling was over-valued against the Deutsche Mark, forcing then-Prime Minister John Major to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Soros, who was born in Hungary but made his way to London as Communists consolidated power in Budapest, said economic reality was starting to catch up with a United Kingdom that voted 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum.  The moment of truth is fast approaching,  Soros said in an article emailed to reporters.  The fact is that Brexit is a lose-lose proposition, harmful both to Britain and the European Union. It cannot be undone, but people can change their minds.  Britain's $2.5 trillion economy has shown resilience since last year's referendum although sterling fell 25 cents against the dollar in the hours immediately after the shock vote. But Britain went from being one of the fastest-growing economies of the Group of Seven leading economic nations in 2016 to the slowest in early 2017, as the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum pushed up inflation and hit consumer spending. The combination of rising prices and slowing wage growth represents a challenge for the Bank of England and its top policymakers, three of whom voted last week to raise interest rates to head off the acceleration of inflation. Soros said the Bank had underestimated the impact of inflation and was now catching up.  Households will realize that their living standards are falling and they will have to adjust their spending habits,  Soros said.  To make matters worse, they will also realize that they have become over-indebted and they will have to pay back their debts.  Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth-largest global economy. Soros said that if Prime Minister Theresa May wanted to stay in power, she would have to change her approach and take account of young people who he said wanted to find well-paying jobs. She should, Soros said, seek to keep Britain in the EU's single market as Britain tried to extract itself.  The divorce process would take at least five years to complete, and during that time new elections would take place,  Soros said.  If all went well, the two parties may want to remarry even before they have divorced.  Editing by Hugh Lawson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-soros-idUSKBN19B1J3"},

But one policy pledge hangs around its neck like a millstone: its plan for a referendum on Italy's membership of the euro currency. If it backtracks on the referendum plan before the election, its rivals, and possibly voters, will pillory it for broken promises. If it doesn't, it has little chance of obtaining the international and market acceptance it craves. 5-Star, Italy's most popular party according to many opinion polls, appears to be aware of the predicament. Carla Ruocco, a prominent 5-Star deputy, told Reuters the referendum was  a negotiating tool  and said:  Big investors and markets should be able to distinguish it from the real intentions of a 5-Star government on the subject of the euro.  The party wants several changes to the euro zone's economic rules to help its more sluggish economies, like Italy. These include stripping public investment from budget deficits under the EU's Stability Pact and creating a European  bad bank  to deal with euro zone lenders' bad loans.  If you sit down to negotiate you have to have a plan B, and the euro referendum is our plan B,  said Ruocco. A 5-Star insider who asked not to be named said the party, which started out in 2009 on an environmentalist rather than a eurosceptic platform, planned to make as little reference as possible to the referendum from now on. Ironically, if the party were to backtrack on its referendum pledge, its own voters may not be disappointed: A survey this month by the Washington-based Pew research center found 58 percent of 5-Star supporters took a positive view of the EU.      Very Pro-Europe      The change in tone is striking, however.  Only two years ago 5-Star gathered the signatures needed to pave the way for a referendum that it said was vital to restore Italy's fiscal and monetary sovereignty. Now it is hitting the brakes on the idea. Luigi Di Maio, the deputy widely tipped to be 5-Star's candidate for prime minister at a general election due by May 2018, has said the euro referendum could not be held for at least a year after the vote. The highly complicated process would be unlikely to be completed even in a full five-year term of office, as Italy's constitution bans referendums on matters governed by international treaties. It may therefore first be necessary to hold a referendum on whether the euro referendum could go ahead. Even if it did, the result would not be binding. Last week Di Maio met ambassadors from 28 European countries in Rome to reassure them about 5-Star's fitness for government.  He was very pro-Europe, talking about reforming EU institutions from within,  said one ambassador who asked not to be named.  I got the impression he regretted the euro referendum commitment.   Even in the 2013 election when it made its stunning breakthrough by winning a quarter of the vote, a referendum on the euro was not among 5-Star's policies. Its hand was forced by growing competition from the right-wing, eurosceptic Northern League, whose support was surging as it tapped mounting anti-euro sentiment among Italians who blamed the single currency and its fiscal rules for a stagnant economy and falling living standards.  In 2014, when 5-Star promised a non-binding, consultative referendum on the euro, it seemed a good way of not handing anti-euro votes to the League while respecting its own credo of direct democracy. Now the idea has come back to haunt it. Outside Italy it is 5-Star's best-known policy, and any risk of an  Italexit  from the currency bloc is a sign for markets to dump Italian assets.  If 5-Star wins it will take between two and five seconds of the first exit poll for Italian interest rates to shoot up to crisis levels,  London-based think-tank Eurointelligence wrote in a recent report.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) charged Barclays Plc, former chief executive John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath with conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance in its first criminal prosecution of a bank and senior managers over events during the credit crisis. Barclays said it was considering its position and awaiting further information about the charges, which follow a five-year inquiry into how it avoided the fate of Lloyds (LLOY.L) and RBS (RBS.L) by averting a state bailout. The SFO charged Varley, Jenkins, the ex-chairman of its Middle East investment banking arm, Kalaris, a former CEO of the bank's wealth division and Boath, a former European head of financial institutions, after investigating a two-part fundraising that included a $3 billion loan to Qatar. A lawyer for Jenkins said he would  vigorously defend  himself, adding his client had received both internal and external legal advice at the time. Boath said he had no case to answer as he had repeatedly raised concerns about decisions taken by the bank at the time with both senior management and senior lawyers and had been reassured the decisions were lawful.  The SFO's decision to charge me is based on a false understanding of my role and the facts. I was not a decision-maker and had no control over what the bank did in 2008,  he said in a statement.  The evidence I have supplied is very clear: there is no case for me to answer.  Related CoverageEx Barclays executive Jenkins to 'vigorously defend' himself against chargesEx-Barclays executive Boath SFO charges based on false understandingA lawyer representing Varley, who resigned as a Rio Tinto (RIO.L) senior independent director with immediate effect following the SFO charges, declined to comment. A lawyer for Kalaris could not immediately be reached for comment. Each offence of fraud by false representation carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years. Barclays faces a fine. The men have been told to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on July 3. Charged The case centers on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors during two fundraisings in June and October 2008.

Authorities have examined whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as around 322 million pounds in  advisory services agreements  (ASA), alongside the $3 billion loan, were honest and properly disclosed. Varley and Jenkins have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation during the June 2008 capital raising as well as the November 2008 fundraising. They also face a charge of unlawful financial assistance. Kalaris and Boath have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation during the June capital raising, the SFO said.

The criminal charge is a reputational blow to Barclays, which is grappling with a string of other legal problems. In a separate case, it is contesting a $1.0 billion civil lawsuit from businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who arranged an investment in Barclays from Abu Dhabi investors during the financial crisis.  In 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority proposed a 50 million pound fine over how Barclays made disclosures about its dealings with Qatar in an investigation that has been on hold pending the outcome of the SFO's probe.   We are pleased that this matter, which led to the stay of our own case, is now in the public domain. We welcome a fair and transparent hearing on the basis of the charges set out today by the SFO,  it said in a statement. Away from Qatar, Barclays current CEO Jes Staley, who joined the bank in late 2015, is under investigation for attempting to unmask an internal whistleblower.

Mounting concerns about the impact on crops of a heatwave in France, the European Union's biggest wheat grower and exporter,  sent Euronext wheat futures rocketing to near one-year highs on Tuesday. [GRA/EU]  It's clear that the very hot temperatures are degrading crop potential in Europe but it is too early to say by how much,  the head of French consultancy Agritel Michel Portier said. Analysts have lowered grain crop estimates in recent weeks, with Strategie Grains cutting its EU soft wheat crop estimate by 1.1 million tonnes last week to 141.6 million. Agritel lowered its French soft wheat crop forecast to 36-37 million tonnes from 37.1 million seen last week, because of scalding damage, Portier said, adding that the forecast would need to be fine-tuned, depending partly on next week's weather. Forecaster Meteo France currently sees temperatures falling back to average levels from the end of this week. France last year harvested its lowest crop in decades at 28 million tonnes after poor spring weather, tumbling from a record 41 million in 2015.  In Spain, this year's extreme weather – from the frosts over the winter to recent record high temperatures – will mean a soft wheat crop of 3.7 million tonnes, down from 7.2 million last year, farmers association Cooperativas Agro-alimentarias said. FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows a farmer in his tractor making bales of straw after wheat harvest in his field in northern France, July 21, 2015.Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoNorthern Europe Better Off In the EU's second largest producer Germany, wheat is developing well after a rainy June helped crop development after an unusually dry start to the spring.  Overall the picture is satisfactory and Germany is on course for a good, average crop this summer as we have not had the weather extremes seen in other parts of Europe,  one German grains analyst said.   The next 2-3 weeks will be critical for yields and a mix of sunshine and rain is needed.  Germany's 2017 wheat crop will increase 3 percent on the year to 25.20 million tonnes, the country's cooperatives association estimated on June 14. This was up from 24.98 million tonnes the association had estimated in May. In the fourth largest producer Poland, crops also benefited from recent rain, said Wojtek Sabaranski of analysts Sparks Polska, which estimates the country will harvest 11.3 million tonnes in 2017, up 1 percent on the year. Britain's wheat crop appears in good condition with scope for a modest increase in production this year.     Trade estimates for this year's UK wheat crop range from around 14.5 million to 15.0 million tonnes, up slightly from last season's 14.38 million.      Over the last two or three weeks, estimates have gradually begun to creep upwards,  analyst Jack Watts of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board <AHDB) said.

The U.S. Treasury last week unveiled plans to upend the country's financial regulatory framework in a 150-page report that suggested more than 100 changes, some of which could affect rules previously agreed with international partners.  The signal we are sending to the U.S. authorities is that we expect continuous adherence to globally agreed standards and rules,  Valdis Dombrovskis told lawmakers in the European Parliament. The U.S. Treasury has called for a delay in implementing a globally agreed rule on bank liquidity which requires banks to cover long-term funding needs from January, 2018. Washington also wants to delay a fundamental review of banks' trading books, which was agreed globally through the Basel Committee of international regulators. Answering EU lawmakers' questions, Dombrovskis referred directly to the two recommended reforms as examples of internationally-agreed rules that needed to be respected. The trading book review represented a major overhaul of how banks set aside capital to cover risks from stocks, bonds and other instruments kept in their trading businesses. Dombrovskis, who has sided with EU banks in tweaking other banking reforms on capital requirements agreed by global regulators, stressed that the U.S. plans at the moment are mere recommendations which need to be translated into concrete legislative proposals.  We must see what practical steps will be taken,  Dombrovskis said. He argued that a reform of the U.S. regulatory framework did not pose a problem as long as it did not encourage deregulation.

The move is part of a new plan by the Rome government that envisages the effective liquidation of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca with the help of state money to reduce losses for the lenders' private investors. Rome is scrambling to prevent the two banks from being wound down under European banking rules that would impose losses on senior bondholders and large depositors before taxpayer money can be used -- a politically unpalatable prospect ahead of national elections next year. Instead the government is working on a hybrid plan that would split the two lenders' assets into  bad  and  good  banks. The bad bank would take on their soured debts and be financed partly with state money, with junior bondholders and shareholders also taking a hit, two sources said. Pressure has been mounting on Italy to resolve the Veneto banks problem, particularly since Spain's Banco Popular was rescued by Santander this month. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's top retail bank, is considering buying the healthier parts of the two Veneto banks. However, Intesa wants to pay as little as possible to avoid having to launch a capital increase or backtrack on its dividend policy, said two other sources close to the matter. The Iccrea group of cooperative lenders is also looking at the assets but is seen as a less likely candidate, while UniCredit has ruled itself out, these sources said. Details of the scheme remain sketchy and it is not clear whether the European Commission, which must authorise the use of state aid, would allow the plan to proceed. The Italian treasury, Rothschild and the Commission declined to comment. Loophole Rome is hoping to take advantage of a loophole in European rules that allows the use of routine insolvency proceedings with banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the member state rather than the banks being wound down by EU authorities. The two Veneto banks have a combined market share of only 3 percent at the national level, with loans totalling about 40 billion euros. They had planned to merge, creating Italy's eighth-biggest bank by assets.  There will not be a (European) resolution because the process will be managed at the national level,  said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.  State money will be used to help fund the asset management company that will take on the bad assets of the two banks. The good assets will be sold in an auction.  An announcement should be made this week or next, the source added. A second source confirmed that the plan involved the sale of some assets and the use of state money.  What is certain is that there won't be a bail-in. That is to say senior bondholders and depositors will not be hit.  The two banks had initially asked for a state bailout to plug a capital gap of 6.4 billion euros ($7.13 billion) under a European scheme known as precautionary recapitalisation, which allows the temporary use of taxpayer money to rescue lenders that are deemed viable. But that plan floundered because the European Commission demanded that private investors pump 1.25 billion euros into the two banks before state aid could be disbursed. With no willing investors, Rome had to come up with an alternative solution to avoid the risk of European authorities pulling the plug on the two banks on their own terms.

But one policy pledge hangs around its neck like a millstone: its plan for a referendum on Italy's membership of the euro currency. If it backtracks on the referendum plan before the election, its rivals, and possibly voters, will pillory it for broken promises. If it doesn't, it has little chance of obtaining the international and market acceptance it craves. 5-Star, Italy's most popular party according to many opinion polls, appears to be aware of the predicament. Carla Ruocco, a prominent 5-Star deputy, told Reuters the referendum was  a negotiating tool  and said:  Big investors and markets should be able to distinguish it from the real intentions of a 5-Star government on the subject of the euro.  The party wants several changes to the euro zone's economic rules to help its more sluggish economies, like Italy. These include stripping public investment from budget deficits under the EU's Stability Pact and creating a European  bad bank  to deal with euro zone lenders' bad loans.  If you sit down to negotiate you have to have a plan B, and the euro referendum is our plan B,  said Ruocco. A 5-Star insider who asked not to be named said the party, which started out in 2009 on an environmentalist rather than a eurosceptic platform, planned to make as little reference as possible to the referendum from now on. Ironically, if the party were to backtrack on its referendum pledge, its own voters may not be disappointed: A survey this month by the Washington-based Pew research center found 58 percent of 5-Star supporters took a positive view of the EU.      Very Pro-Europe      The change in tone is striking, however.  Only two years ago 5-Star gathered the signatures needed to pave the way for a referendum that it said was vital to restore Italy's fiscal and monetary sovereignty. Now it is hitting the brakes on the idea. Luigi Di Maio, the deputy widely tipped to be 5-Star's candidate for prime minister at a general election due by May 2018, has said the euro referendum could not be held for at least a year after the vote. The highly complicated process would be unlikely to be completed even in a full five-year term of office, as Italy's constitution bans referendums on matters governed by international treaties. It may therefore first be necessary to hold a referendum on whether the euro referendum could go ahead. Even if it did, the result would not be binding. Last week Di Maio met ambassadors from 28 European countries in Rome to reassure them about 5-Star's fitness for government.  He was very pro-Europe, talking about reforming EU institutions from within,  said one ambassador who asked not to be named.  I got the impression he regretted the euro referendum commitment.   Even in the 2013 election when it made its stunning breakthrough by winning a quarter of the vote, a referendum on the euro was not among 5-Star's policies. Its hand was forced by growing competition from the right-wing, eurosceptic Northern League, whose support was surging as it tapped mounting anti-euro sentiment among Italians who blamed the single currency and its fiscal rules for a stagnant economy and falling living standards.  In 2014, when 5-Star promised a non-binding, consultative referendum on the euro, it seemed a good way of not handing anti-euro votes to the League while respecting its own credo of direct democracy. Now the idea has come back to haunt it. Outside Italy it is 5-Star's best-known policy, and any risk of an  Italexit  from the currency bloc is a sign for markets to dump Italian assets.  If 5-Star wins it will take between two and five seconds of the first exit poll for Italian interest rates to shoot up to crisis levels,  London-based think-tank Eurointelligence wrote in a recent report.

In a speech to London's banking community a day after Brexit talks started, Carney dashed any prospect that he might be close to joining the three BoE policymakers who last week unexpectedly voted to raise rates from their record low of 0.25 percent. Sterling plunged by three quarters of a cent against the dollar GBP= after Carney's remarks, and 10-year gilt yields GB10YT=RR dipped below 1 percent.  The BoE is juggling the tricky combination of rising prices caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since the June 2016 vote to leave the bloc, and slowing wage growth as the economy loses much of last year's impetus. The uncertain outcome of the Brexit talks is also expected to weigh on consumers and companies. Finance minister Philip Hammond told the same Mansion House audience that it was important to avoid a  cliff edge  when Britain quits the EU in 2019 and to have a transitional deal on trade before a full agreement is reached.  Carney said that if there was insufficient progress on this, businesses in Britain and other EU countries might soon start to activate their own Brexit contingency plans.  Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption,  he said. Stefan Wermuth Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU.  Before becoming Britain's foreign minister, Boris Johnson had dismissed the idea of trade-offs in the EU divorce process by saying his  policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it . Sterling dropped more than 10 percent after last summer's referendum vote, which Carney said reflected financial markets' dim view of Brexit's likely effect on the economy.

Carney's concerns about the economic impact of Brexit added to  mixed signals  on consumer spending and business investment, as well as wage growth that remained  anemic  even with unemployment at its lowest for more than 40 years. A rate rise was not yet appropriate, Carney said.  Now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment,  he said.     In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to ... the reality of Brexit negotiations.  Carney underlined the importance of free trade - especially in financial services - and said the EU it would face greater costs if it tried to remove activities such as clearing euro-denominated derivatives from London. He also said that whether Britain's large current account deficit was sustainable remained an open question,  one whose answer depends crucially on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations .

Russia expects to send LNG to Europe by the end of 2017 from its distant Arctic peninsula of Yamal but a plant on its Baltic coast could establish the country as a more immediate supplier of LNG in a region already dependent on piped Russian gas. The company will build a floating LNG plant off the port of Gorskaya, not far from Saint Petersburg, which will be fed by a 12 km pipeline from Gazprom. The LNG will then be shipped to seven Baltic ports outside Russia using three tankers already on order from Russia's United Shipbuilding Corporation. LNG Gorskaya's CEO Kirill Lyats told Reuters the company had agreed to build floating bunkering stations and storage facilities at the Baltic ports that will be able to supply LNG-fueled vessels with mostly Russian LNG by 2020. The company said it had the acquired the necessary gas export permits from Gazprom.  The bunkering stations in Lubeck (Germany) and Montu (Estonia) will be built by summer next year ... contracts have been signed,  Lyats said in an interview. The project means LNG Gorskaya could deliver the Baltic's first large-scale, locally produced Russian LNG three years ahead of Gazprom's Baltic LNG project, a much delayed plan the state-owned gas giant now expects to be running by 2023. LNG Gorskaya's initial annual LNG output will be 0.42 million tonnes, which could triple within three years. Yamal LNG's peak production is expected to be 16.5 million tonnes, with much of that going to Asian customers. Russia already produces some LNG near the Baltic, at Pskov near Estonia. The 23,000 tonnes of LNG produced there each year are delivered by road to Estonian gas company Eesti Gaas. Besides Lubeck and Montu, LNG Gorskaya has also signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) with the ports of Parnu in Estonia, Grenaa in Denmark, Piteo in Sweden, Kotka-Hamina in Finland and Liepaja in Latvia, to build bunkering stations scheduled to be ready by May 2019.  In total, the budget for the Russian part including the pipeline, the floating plant and three vessels will be around 200 million euros,  Lyats said. For the European infrastructure, LNG Gorskaya Overseas OU, a legally independent Estonian firm with some common shareholders, will cover the cost of about 140 million euros. That amount includes the LNG storage facilities the company will build and the seven refueling vessels, which Poland's Remontowa shipyard will be commissioned to build. Lyats said the company had also signed MoUs with shipping companies mainly from Sweden, Finland and Germany to buy its LNG though he declined to name individual clients. While Lyats did not rule out supplying LNG directly to countries in the event of large-scale demand, he said the,  margin from bunker operations will be more efficient than direct selling .

After years of booming orders driven by increased air travel and more fuel-efficient planes, passenger jet manufacturers are bracing for a slowdown in demand while they focus on meeting tight delivery schedules and ambitious production targets. In a sign of their more modest expectations, some companies have cut back on staffing and catering at this year's Paris show and made less space available for the media. But Boeing generated a burst of activity on the opening day by launching the 737 MAX 10 to plug a gap in its portfolio at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets, following runaway sales of the rival Airbus (AIR.PA) A321neo. The U.S. planemaker said it had more than 240 orders and commitments from at least 10 customers for the new 737, which can carry up to 230 people in a single-class configuration.  Many airports are running out of capacity and for those airports this is a perfect aircraft,  said Ajay Singh, the chairman of low-cost Indian airline SpiceJet (SPJT.BO), as his company signed a provisional deal to buy 40 MAX 10s.  However, Airbus immediately hit back with an order for 100 of its popular A320neo planes from leasing company GECAS, as well as a deal for 12 A321neos with Air Lease Corporation. Airbus sales chief John Leahy brushed off the latest Boeing challenge, saying that much of the interest in the MAX 10 was from existing Boeing customers switching orders from other models.  Related CoverageQatar Airways CEO sees no need for Boeing mid-market jetGECAS orders 100 Airbus A320neo aircraftQatar Airways firms up order for 20 737 jets, further options dependent on Italy, India We think the 737 MAX 10 is a competitor to the (MAX) 9 and that's why a lot of people are converting,  he said. Twenty of SpiceJet's provisional order for 40 MAX 10s were conversions from an existing order for other 737 models.  GECAS also converted an existing 737 order for 20 planes to the new model and Europe's largest tour operator TUI Group (TUIGn.DE) did likewise for 18 aircraft. Boeing did announce provisional new orders for 90 MAX 10s including 50 from Indonesia's Lion Air. It also won a boost from leasing giant AerCap (AER.N) for its 787 Dreamliner long-range jet, which sits in a category for which demand has been fragile over the past year. A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flyng display at the first day of the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, France June 19, 2017.Pascal RossignolIndustry sources said that Airbus would soon announce an order for 10 of its A350-900 wide-body jets from Ethiopian Airways, while it also looked set to clinch a $5 billion deal with low-cost carrier Viva Air Peru. Providing reassurance for planemakers, Qatar Airways said it was sticking with plans to increase its fleet and routes despite a diplomatic rift with four Arab nations that have closed their airspace to the company.  We have had a lot of cancellations, especially to the four countries that did this illegal blockade, but we have found new markets and this is our growth strategy,  Chief Executive Akbar al Baker told Reuters. F-35 Debut Slideshow (6 Images)While demand for passenger jets may be ebbing, there are signs that interest in military aircraft is picking up after years in the doldrums because of government budget cuts and weak economic growth. Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) is in the final stages of negotiating a $37 billion-plus deal to sell 440 F-35 fighter jets to a group of 11 nations including the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. That would be the biggest deal yet for the stealth warplane, which is making its Paris debut this week. President Macron flew into the show aboard an Airbus A400M military transporter in his first official engagement since winning a parliamentary majority in elections on Sunday. His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world's largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, with France's aerobatic team. The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by difficulties: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. Airbus said on Sunday that it was working on an A380 upgrade -- dubbed A380plus -- with fuel-saving wingtips, confirming plans reported by Reuters in March. Airbus chief Fabrice Bregier said on Monday that the company was in talks with several potential customers for the upgraded plane. But it would only be put into production if it received  a large order , he said, without elaborating. Four-engined, double-decker superjumbos such as the A380 and Boeing's 747 were once viewed as the future of air travel between international hubs, but interest has waned as airlines have preferred cheaper, more nimble aircraft.

Moritz Kraemer, S&P;'s chief of sovereign ratings, told the Global Markets Forum on Tuesday that geopolitical risk and ensuing sanctions regimes imposed on Russia played an important role in the country's previously lower ratings and were still key factors to watch. He also shared his ratings outlook for other regions. Here are excerpts from the conversation: Q: Russia is the only country you rate with a BBB- rating and positive outlook. Has the threat of new U.S. sanctions on Russia altered your view at all? A: Any renewed deepening of geopolitical risks could diminish the chances of an upgrade. This is because the consequences of a tightening sanctions regime might choke off the recovery of the Russian economy with fiscal but also potential political risks. Q: The oil price has stumbled back again too, so if we put it all together is the positive outlook still justified there? A: Yes, we think the positive outlook on Russia remains justified. What we have observed is an economic recovery that is surpassing our expectations and we have also seen progressive improvement in the Russian financial system strengthening the intermediation and effectiveness of monetary policy. Q: With the rising tensions in the Middle East, are there risks of a few downgrades there? A: The Middle East has been one of the weakest regions in recent years as far as sovereign ratings are concerned. Much is explained by terms of trade shock with weaker oil prices but you also have increasing pressure on public finances in a number of GCC sovereigns which require uncomfortable choices for policymakers. This can put pressure on the social contract and lead to broader instability. Q: Is there a risk of another wave of rating cuts? A: We do not see a wave of downgrades in the Middle East, but there are individual countries with a negative rating outlook. Among them is Qatar but also sovereigns like Oman, which we already lowered to non-investment grade, similar to Bahrain.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) charged Barclays Plc, former chief executive John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath with conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance in its first criminal prosecution of a bank and senior managers over events during the credit crisis. Barclays said it was considering its position and awaiting further information about the charges, which follow a five-year inquiry into how it avoided the fate of Lloyds (LLOY.L) and RBS (RBS.L) by averting a state bailout. The SFO charged Varley, Jenkins, the ex-chairman of its Middle East investment banking arm, Kalaris, a former CEO of the bank's wealth division and Boath, a former European head of financial institutions, after investigating a two-part fundraising that included a $3 billion loan to Qatar. A lawyer for Jenkins said he would  vigorously defend  himself, adding his client had received both internal and external legal advice at the time. Boath said he had no case to answer as he had repeatedly raised concerns about decisions taken by the bank at the time with both senior management and senior lawyers and had been reassured the decisions were lawful.  The SFO's decision to charge me is based on a false understanding of my role and the facts. I was not a decision-maker and had no control over what the bank did in 2008,  he said in a statement.  The evidence I have supplied is very clear: there is no case for me to answer.  Related CoverageEx Barclays executive Jenkins to 'vigorously defend' himself against chargesEx-Barclays executive Boath SFO charges based on false understandingA lawyer representing Varley, who resigned as a Rio Tinto (RIO.L) senior independent director with immediate effect following the SFO charges, declined to comment. A lawyer for Kalaris could not immediately be reached for comment. Each offence of fraud by false representation carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years. Barclays faces a fine. The men have been told to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on July 3. Charged The case centers on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors during two fundraisings in June and October 2008.

Authorities have examined whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as around 322 million pounds in  advisory services agreements  (ASA), alongside the $3 billion loan, were honest and properly disclosed. Varley and Jenkins have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation during the June 2008 capital raising as well as the November 2008 fundraising. They also face a charge of unlawful financial assistance. Kalaris and Boath have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation during the June capital raising, the SFO said.

The criminal charge is a reputational blow to Barclays, which is grappling with a string of other legal problems. In a separate case, it is contesting a $1.0 billion civil lawsuit from businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who arranged an investment in Barclays from Abu Dhabi investors during the financial crisis.  In 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority proposed a 50 million pound fine over how Barclays made disclosures about its dealings with Qatar in an investigation that has been on hold pending the outcome of the SFO's probe.   We are pleased that this matter, which led to the stay of our own case, is now in the public domain. We welcome a fair and transparent hearing on the basis of the charges set out today by the SFO,  it said in a statement. Away from Qatar, Barclays current CEO Jes Staley, who joined the bank in late 2015, is under investigation for attempting to unmask an internal whistleblower.  Qatar, meanwhile, has made a healthy profit from its investment and remains Barclays' biggest shareholder, with a stake of around six percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

More than 50,000 people have been jailed and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs.  I will always be on the side of justice. If someone tells me my rights are a favor, I will speak of his dictatorship. I say you (Erdogan) are a dictator,  Kilicdaroglu said in a speech after stopping at a national park near Camlidere, a rural area about 100 km outside of Ankara. His comments were an apparent response to criticism from Erdogan over the weekend in which the president said justice should be sought in parliament and the CHP was only being allowed to march as a favor from the government. Erdogan has likened the protesters who came out in support of Kilicdaroglu in Ankara and Istanbul to those who carried out the attempted coup, and said,  You should not be surprised if you receive an invitation from the judiciary.  Kilicdaroglu responded on Tuesday by accusing the president of attempting to influence the judiciary.  If I prove that your government sends notices to the courts and gives them orders, will you resign your post like an honorable man?  he said. Rights groups and government critics, including members of Kilicdaroglu's CHP, say Turkey has been sliding toward authoritarianism since the coup bid. The government says its crackdown is necessary given vast security threats it is facing.   I have been participating in the march since the beginning,  said one woman, 59, who declined to give her name.  We want justice for our children. This is the only reason we are marching.  The slight, bespectacled Kilicdaroglu has so far clocked up a little more than 100 km, trudging along a highway westwards from Ankara and at times carrying a sign that says  Justice . CHP officials said he was eating only soup in the morning and over the course of the day the same food given to the roughly 1,000 other supporters marching with him. He alternates between two pairs of trainers and at night massages his feet with salt to soothe the swelling. He sleeps overnight in a caravan specially prepared for him. Kilicdaroglu, who aims to march to the jail where Berberoglu is being held, on Tuesday condemned the government's purges, naming academics he said had been stripped of their posts for no reason and asking why journalists were being jailed. Some 160 journalists are imprisoned in Turkey, according to the journalists union, and authorities have shut down 130 media outlets since the failed coup.   Shoulder-to-shoulder against fascism,  and  justice, justice  chanted the crowd of around 1,000 on a hillside who listened to his speech. Some carried a banner that said:  You'll never walk alone . The march is expected to last around 25 days, with participants walking some 16-20 km daily.

At over 30 years old, the Rough facility accounts for about 70 percent of UK storage capacity and a lack of new-build to replace it will increase dependency on imports over the next few years, boosting wholesale gas market volatility and prices, analysts and traders said.  Seasonal gas storage provides security and flexibility of supply. At times of low demand and therefore low gas prices in the summer, gas is injected into storage to be kept for when demand rises in the winter. Rough could cover a tenth of Britain's peak winter demand.   Due to the age and condition of Rough we can no longer safely inject gas into the reservoir and build up the pressure in the well,  a Centrica spokesman said.  Falling demand for gas storage facilities would have forced Centrica to close Rough regardless of the investment needed to refurbish its ageing wells, he added.  European utilities are losing billions of euros from gas storage facilities, triggering site closures and divestments in a market suffering from oversupply and weak demand. In a statement, Centrica said it intends to file applications to permanently end Rough's status as a storage facility but aims to produce all recoverable gas from the field, which is estimated at 183 billion cubic feet (bcf). Selling off the so-called cushion gas, used to maintain minimum reservoir pressure for the site to operate, would likely take several years, a Centrica spokesman said. Centrica is assessing how much gas could be available for sale.  Concerns about the integrity of wells at the site prompted Centrica in April to put off any further gas injections until at least April 2018. Without Rough, Britain would be more vulnerable to winter price shocks. Wholesale prices would have to rise to attract more gas from Norway, Europe or liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, with a knock-on effect on consumer prices.  The market will be more exposed to international price fluctuations as more imports will be required to balance Britain's gas market when cold,  Katrina Oldham, an energy trader at Inenco. Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski said the shutdown of Rough would lift British wholesale gas prices above continental gas hubs in winter and make them trade at a discount in summer, given that demand for injecting gas into storage would be less in summer months without Rough.  The effects could be compounded by potential changes to energy supply terms with EU countries if Britain leaves the internal energy market when it quits the European Union. Britain has seven other gas storage sites but they offer shorter injection and withdrawal times and less stock. Other storage operators are also struggling to cover their capital costs due to unfavorable market returns. In 2015, utility SSE decided to mothball a third of the withdrawal capacity at its Hornsea site.

The document gave the first indications of policy for Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune along with new ministers in the key portfolios of finance, commerce and energy. He was named by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika last month. The North African OPEC member has seen its energy revenues, which account for 60 percent of the budget, more than halved due to the slide in crude oil prices, forcing the government to cut spending, look for new revenue and announce economic reforms. Tebboune's government will  prepare the regulatory and legal framework relating to participatory funding ... and to issue sovereign bonds for participatory funding,  according to its action plan, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Tebboune is expected to present his plan to lawmakers in parliament later on Tuesday. Participatory funding is generally a reference to Islamic financing tools. It was one of the first times the government has so openly discussed such financing options, though authorities have said they plan a local bond that is interest-free, complying with sharia law which forbids interest payments. Authorities in Algeria are cautious about changes to an economic system still largely state run. Many Algerians are also wary about changes that upset social peace following a 1990s war with Islamist militants that killed more than 200,000 people. The government has in the past largely failed to diversify the economy away from oil and gas, which make up 94 percent of total exports revenue. But it is under growing pressure to speed up reforms and adapt to the new circumstances. Tapping into money from the country's informal, parallel market, estimated by some at around $90 billion, is among the government's aims in opting for sharia-compliant funding.  The government plans encouraging and facilitating work in order to integrate activities of the parallel market into the formal sphere,  its action plan said. Welfare Reform Tebboune's government also plans to reform the country's vast subsidy system as part of efforts to cut spending, a change to a system that in the past has helped maintain social peace. Subsidy accounts for about $30 billion in state spending a year in Algeria, where the government subsidies everything from basic foodstuffs and gasoline to medicine, housing and education. Algeria will remain committed to social welfare policy, but there are plans to  set up new mechanisms gradually so as to identify categories eligible for state aid in an efficient way,  the government said in its action plan. It aims for a  gradual adaptation of social transfers policy,  it said. To achieve that goal, the government, named just weeks ago after last month's legislative election, will launch consultation with parliament, political parties and civil society to help smooth the changes. Algeria has increased the prices of subsidised products including electricity, gasoline and diesel for the first time in years, but experts say the price rise is insufficient to cover production costs for those products. Authorities also started restricting imports, which will decline in 2017 by $15 billion from last year's $46 billion, according to the government. Financial pressure has forced Algeria to cut spending for this year by 14 percent after a 9 percent reduction in 2016, with foreign exchange reserves falling to $114 billion at the end of 2016 from $144.1 billion in December 2015 and $178 billion the previous year.

Snam, controlled by state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, is looking to buy Edison's 7.3 percent stake in Terminale LNG Adriatico and the gas pipeline that connects it to Italy's gas transmission backbone, the sources said. Adriatic LNG, which has a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres per year, is 70.7 percent owned by ExxonMobil and 22 percent by Qatar Petroleum. Exxon and Qatar have a pre-emption right on Edison's stake. Snam said it did not comment on market speculation. Edison said in June talks were under way to sell the stake and pipeline as well as two offices in Milan hosting its headquarters.  The idea is to wrap up the sale in the first half of July, though some slippage can't be ruled out,  one of the sources said, adding Banca IMI was advising Edison on the deal. Snam, which makes most of its money from gas transmission, is looking to play a leading role in integrating Europe's grids and making Italy a European gas hub. In its March business plan it said it would be looking at opportunities to grow its LNG infrastructure business. According to Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Edison's stake in the Adriatic LNG platform has a book value of 159 million euros ($177 million) while the pipeline has a book value of 32 million euros.

Large corporations often use the ratings, the cyber equivalent of a FICO credit score, to assess how prepared the companies they work with are to withstand cyber attacks. Insurers also look at the ratings when they make underwriting decisions on cyber liability. The group includes big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), as well as non-financial companies like coffee retailer Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) and home improvement chain Home Depot Inc (HD.N). They are organizing the effort through the Chamber of Commerce, a broad trade group for corporate America.  The move comes in response to the emergence of such startups as BitSight Technologies, RiskRecon and SecurityScorecard that collect and analyze large swaths of data to rate companies on cyber security.   As these startups have gained prominence and venture capital funding, the companies they rate have complained of a lack of transparency.  The challenge is that their (startups') methodologies are proprietary and there hasn’t been transparency on how they go about creating the ratings,  JPMorgan Global Chief Information Security Officer Rohan Amin said in an interview.  The financial services industry is among the most vulnerable to cyber crime because of the massive amount of money and valuable data that banks, brokerages and investment firms process each day. Several technology companies, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), also support the principles being developed, as do the cyber ratings firms, the Chamber of Commerce said.       Ratings issued by those companies could help guide the standards being set by U.S. corporations. BitSight, for example, rates companies on a scale of 250 to 900 with a higher rating indicating better security performance.      For organizations to use your platform you have to demonstrate trustworthiness and reliability,  said Jake Olcott, BitSight's vice president of strategic partnerships.

Morgan's latest Treasury client survey showed on Tuesday.     Investors scaled back their bearish bond bets as the recent softening in inflation data has raised doubts whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again by year-end after it raised them last week, analysts said.     Short investors, or those who said they were holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, outnumbered long investors who said they were holding more longer-dated bonds than their benchmarks by 7 points on June 19. This resulted in the fewest net shorts since April 17, J.P. Morgan said.     Last week, net shorts totaled 18 points, which was the most  since Dec. 12, 2016, J.P. Morgan said.     On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was 2.177 percent, down from 2.207 percent a week ago, according to Reuters data.     The drop in longer-dated yield followed the Fed's widely expected increase of key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent last Wednesday, marking the fourth rate hike since December 2015.

Three months before an election, some lawmakers from the SPD, the junior partner in Angela Merkel's coalition, are seeking a full parliamentary debate on the 8.5 billion euro loan to Greece - which would expose sharp divisions within Merkel's conservative parliamentary group. The budget committee, which had been expected to meet on Wednesday, has to decide if the full house has to approve the disbursement of a fresh tranche that was agreed to by euro zone finance ministers last week.  The budget committee will only address the latest decision of the Eurogroup in its next weekly sitting,  the SPD's budget policy spokesman Johannes Kahrs said.  It is clearly uncomfortable for the (conservative) fraction that the IMF is not involved ... even though (German finance minister Wolfgang) Schaeuble promised it would be.  The IMF has said it would like to see some of Greece's debts being written off in return for its participation in the bail-out deal, a move that would be unpopular in Germany. Earlier, Merkel ally Michael Grosse-Broemer had said that no parliamentary vote would be needed, suggesting that the budget committee could nod the new deal through. Some of Merkel's own conservatives have in the past opposed aid to Greece. Sixty-three of the 309 members of her conservative parliamentary group voted against the third bailout for Greece in August 2015. There were three abstentions. Schaeuble has said a full debate on the credit lifeline in the lower house could lead to market uncertainty.

All other content is as of the original publication date. France's National Assembly election has provided new president Emmanuel Macron with parliamentary backing to enact his reform programme, Fitch Ratings says. Implementing the programme would be positive for growth and hence for France's public finances, but it may still face opposition outside parliament. The two-round election has given Macron's La Republique En Marche! (EM) party a large majority with 308 out of 577 seats (53.4%), and another 42 seats for the centrist EM ally Democratic Movement party, giving the president 350 seats (60.7%). It underscores the breakdown of traditional party politics, with the previously dominant Socialist and Republican parties winning a combined total of 142 seats, down from 474 in the previous parliament. EM's large majority ensures parliamentary backing for the president's centrist programme, which features labour market reforms, a EUR50 billion investment plan, and some tax cuts, including a reduction in corporate tax to 25% from 33%. However, as in the presidential election, a high abstention rate (of 57% in the second-round relative to an average of 37% since 1993) suggests that the outcome may overstate the level of public endorsement of Macron's proposals. An early test of the new administration's ability to deliver will be its labour market reforms. Proposed measures include allowing negotiations to be conducted in-house and directly with employers rather than negotiations with unions at national or branch level, capping severance packages in cases of unfair dismissal, reducing employee and employer contributions, and cutting labour costs through incentives for permanent contract hiring. We think these would contribute to a reduction of France's 9.6% unemployment rate (versus a ratings peer median of around 4%). However, some attempts by previous governments to pass similar reforms have been met with strong resistance from labour unions and the general public, and have triggered protests and strikes that have resulted in some measures being abandoned or watered down. The president has been in consultation with labour unions since May and is expected to issue detailed proposals reflecting these consultations in the coming weeks. Civil opposition groups and unions, including the French Democratic Confederation of Labour, have said they will hold protests against Macron's proposals, if their counter-proposals and interests are ignored. Macron's plans for stronger eurozone integration could also face popular resistance, after 48% of first-round presidential election voters supported anti-EU candidates in May. Stronger growth would be positive for France's sovereign credit profile because it would improve the public finances, which remain a major weakness in France's 'AA'/Stable rating. Budget deficits spurred by high government spending have resulted in general government debt reaching 96% of GDP in 2016, limiting France's ability to deal with shocks. France's economy has underperformed the eurozone in the last two years, but growth momentum has improved as the temporary, terror-and-weather related weakness of mid-2016 fades (GDP increased by 0.4% qoq in 1Q17, following 0.5% in 4Q16). France should also benefit from the broader recovery in the eurozone. President Macron's stated commitment to reducing the budget deficit to below 3% of GDP suggests that he will strive to meet the European Commission deadline for closing the  excessive deficit  this year. Macron's fiscal plans, which will be revealed in more detail in the 2018 budget, include a reduction in household and business taxes worth at least EUR20 billion per year (around 1% of GDP), lower corporate tax, expenditure savings of up to EUR60 billion (2.5% of GDP), and a reduction in civil service posts. Our next scheduled review of France's sovereign rating is on 28 July.

The Iranian oil ministry's official website SHANA reported Eni had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for studies on the Kish gas field and the third phase of the Darkhovin oil field in southern Iran. Eni has six months to present the results of its studies.  The agreement with NIOC does not include any commitment to invest,  an Eni spokesman said on Tuesday. State-controlled Eni, which entered Iran in the 1950s, was involved in the development of the Darkhovin field and the offshore South Pars gas field before U.S.-led sanctions stopped oil majors investing. Eni was given a special dispensation to recoup investments in the country by taking Iranian oil by way of payment.  The (Tuesday) agreement sets out conditions for recouping outstanding payments of $280 million still owed Eni for previous investments,  the Eni spokesman said. Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi has previously said the group would  start working again in Iran when investments were repaid and the type of contracts offered by Tehran known. An Iranian oil official said this month that Eni was also interested in the tender for development of the Azadegan oil field in southern Iran. Tehran needs billions of dollars of investment from foreign energy corporations to boost crude production and natural gas capacity in the country.

We fought wars over camels,  said Magareh.  It's one of our traditions. Not having camels in Qatar is like being a cowboy who has no cows.  He blamed leaders in the Gulf for falling victim to political bickering.  What can I say? Even if they have differences in politics, we are the people. Don't push us into your fight,  he said.

Moller-Maersk, said it will cut 160 staff at its Gothenburg terminal in Sweden, the largest in Scandinavia, as labour disruptions had caused container volumes to drop by 25 percent over the past year.  We have lost about 70,000 containers in revenue over the past year,  Henrik Kristensen, head of APM Terminals in Gothenburg, told Reuters on Tuesday. Around half of all Swedish container traffic moves through the terminal in which APM Terminals invested 800 million Danish crowns ($120 million) in 2012-16, and is currently investing a further 250 million crowns.  This has been a very difficult but necessary decision caused by the Swedish Dockworkers' Union's consecutive blockades and nine strikes for over a year resulting in several shipping lines no longer calling (at) Gothenburg,  Kristensen said in a separate statement, referring to the planned job cuts. The strike is about the Swedish Dockworkers' Union's (SDU) right to represent its members in negotiations with the company, union spokesman Anders Moller said. Around 85 percent of employees at the port are members of the union. The company, which employs 450 people in Gothenburg, wants to secure a no-strike agreement with workers, Moller said.  If we are going to give away our right to strike, we have to have a reasonable ability to represent our members, to take part in negotiations, to pick safety foremen,  he said. Since May 19, the company has locked out SDU members from working the night shift and refuses to hold direct talks with the union, he said, adding that the big drop in production had been since the lockout.

The Iranian oil ministry's official website SHANA reported Eni had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for studies on the Kish gas field and the third phase of the Darkhovin oil field in southern Iran. Eni has six months to present the results of its studies.  The agreement with NIOC does not include any commitment to invest,  an Eni spokesman said on Tuesday. State-controlled Eni, which entered Iran in the 1950s, was involved in the development of the Darkhovin field and the offshore South Pars gas field before U.S.-led sanctions stopped oil majors investing. Eni was given a special dispensation to recoup investments in the country by taking Iranian oil by way of payment.  The (Tuesday) agreement sets out conditions for recouping outstanding payments of $280 million still owed Eni for previous investments,  the Eni spokesman said. Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi has previously said the group would  start working again in Iran when investments were repaid and the type of contracts offered by Tehran known. An Iranian oil official said this month that Eni was also interested in the tender for development of the Azadegan oil field in southern Iran.

Large corporations often use the ratings, the cyber equivalent of a FICO credit score, to assess how prepared the companies they work with are to withstand cyber attacks. Insurers also look at the ratings when they make underwriting decisions on cyber liability. The group includes big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), as well as non-financial companies like coffee retailer Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) and home improvement chain Home Depot Inc (HD.N). They are organizing the effort through the Chamber of Commerce, a broad trade group for corporate America.  The move comes in response to the emergence of such startups as BitSight Technologies, RiskRecon and SecurityScorecard that collect and analyze large swaths of data to rate companies on cyber security.   As these startups have gained prominence and venture capital funding, the companies they rate have complained of a lack of transparency.  The challenge is that their (startups') methodologies are proprietary and there hasn’t been transparency on how they go about creating the ratings,  JPMorgan Global Chief Information Security Officer Rohan Amin said in an interview.  The financial services industry is among the most vulnerable to cyber crime because of the massive amount of money and valuable data that banks, brokerages and investment firms process each day. Several technology companies, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), also support the principles being developed, as do the cyber ratings firms, the Chamber of Commerce said.       Ratings issued by those companies could help guide the standards being set by U.S. corporations. BitSight, for example, rates companies on a scale of 250 to 900 with a higher rating indicating better security performance.      For organizations to use your platform you have to demonstrate trustworthiness and reliability,  said Jake Olcott, BitSight's vice president of strategic partnerships.

Mike Delaney, general manager of airplane developments at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the final decision would be for Boeing's top leadership but that design, production and cost characteristics were all pointing in the right direction. Speaking to Reuters, Delaney confirmed for the first time publicly that the proposed new aircraft would have a composite fuselage, a key decision likely to boost suppliers such as Boeing's sole composites contractor Toray of Japan. In a separate briefing at the Paris Airshow, Delaney said the jet would make  extensive use  of composites and confirmed it would have a  hybrid  cross-section, apparently referring to the need for a large cabin and slimmed-down cargo space. Delaney's keenly awaited annual briefing at the world's largest air show gave fresh clues on how the U.S. planemaker's newest airplane might be designed. The idea is to carve out a new market between medium-haul single-aisle planes like the 737 and Airbus A320 family and the smallest long-haul jets like the A330 and Boeing 787. Boeing faces a difficult puzzle as it tries to square conflicting airline demands for a wide twin-aisle cabin with the low operating costs of the 737 category. Delaney said airlines consulted by Boeing had stressed that what counts most is being able to carry the right number of passengers for the routes for which the jet is designed. Based on Boeing market forecasts that is likely to be 220 to 270. They are less worried about carrying cargo. That is the opposite of what airlines had said when Boeing was developing larger planes like the 787 and 777, Delaney said. In those cases, engineers had designed the fuselage around the cargo containers and then adjusted the rest of the fuselage and therefore the seating capacity around that. Design Clues Delaney's statements give important clues about what is expected to be an unconventional fuselage for the mid-market plane, which in turn may determine whether Boeing can square that circle of wide cabins and low operating cost. Industry sources have said the fuselage will have a somewhat elliptical shape when seen from the front because the bottom of the plane will be flattened to get rid of unnecessary cargo space. Usually a pressurised fuselage is round to avoid stress points. Building the fuselage out of tough lightweight composites allows less conventional shapes. In turn, stripping away unnecessary space reduces drag and makes the plane cheaper to fly. Delaney declined to talk in detail about the design except to say the fuselage would have a  hybrid  cross-section.  It is a geometry that supports twin-aisle comfort and single-aisle economics,  he said. Another Boeing executive recently said it had considered options from  mild to wild  for the new jet. The new jet is expected to enter service in 2025, if Boeing decides to go ahead and develop it.

MSCI was due after the close on Tuesday to announce whether it will launch a review of Saudi Arabia for possible inclusion in its emerging market index; inclusion would bring tens of billions of dollars of fresh foreign money. The Saudi index surged 2.4 percent on Monday after Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, vice chairman of the Capital Market Authority, was quoted as saying by the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that he expected inclusion by the end of 2018. On Tuesday, the index rose as much as 0.6 percent early on but closed 1.3 percent lower in thin trade. The three top losers were banks which had surged in the past week because of a belief that foreign funds would flow into them in the event of a positive MSCI decision. Saudi British Bank, for example, pulled back 4.7 percent to 24.30 riyals after jumping 14 percent in the past four days. Petrochemical blue chip Saudi Basic Industries, which would be a key Saudi component of MSCI's emerging market index if the upgrade happens, fell 0.8 percent. Though fund managers agree MSCI inclusion would be bullish for the Saudi market, many think fundamentals are not very attractive at present, with valuations significantly above those of the MSCI emerging market average, and Saudi Arabia's introduction of a sales tax looming next year. So the market may have little room to rally in coming months. Dubai's index fell 0.2 percent as builder Drake & Scull, the most heavily traded stock, slid 3.0 percent after saying it had obtained regulatory approval to start a capital restructuring after heavy losses. National Central Cooling Co (Tabreed) rose 3.8 percent to 2.20 dirhams but came far off the day's high of 2.37 dirhams. It soared its 15 percent daily limit on Monday, when France's Engie said it had agreed to buy 40 percent of Tabreed for 2.8 billion dirhams ($763 million) from Mubadala. Abu Dhabi's index dropped 0.8 percent as Dana Gas pulled back 4.4 percent. It had gained 66 percent this month on what some brokers said was buying by a strategic investor; late on Monday Goldilocks Investment Co, part of Abu Dhabi Financial Group, said it had bought 5 percent of the firm. Qatar's index slipped 1.5 percent to 8,934 points, its lowest finish since January 2016. It remains depressed by economic sanctions against Doha announced by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states on June 5, and has now lost 10 percent since then. Some investors have been hoping for a diplomatic resolution but a top United Arab Emirates official said on Monday that Qatar's isolation could last for years. Many banks dropped; Doha Bank fell 2.1 percent. Qatari banks have been weak because of concern about increases in their funding costs after other Gulf countries imposed sanctions on Qatar early this month, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Egypt's index fell 0.7 percent; Orascom Telecom Media, the most heavily traded stock, plunged 15 percent as it went ex-dividend.

The bank also said it expected to achieve its 3 percent inflation target in a sustainable manner only from early 2019, half a year later than it previously anticipated. It added that downside risks to inflation have increased. It decided to lower its cap on three-month deposits to 300 billion forints ($1.08 billion) by the end of September from 500 billion at the end of June, cutting it below analysts' forecast for a 350 billion forint new cap. The bank said the aim of the new limit was  to maintain the loose monetary conditions achieved.   If inflation remains persistently below the target, the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional, targeted instruments,  the Monetary Council also said in a statement. The National Bank of Hungary's (NBH) decision to hold its base rate at a record-low 0.9 percent was anticipated by all analysts in a Reuters poll that forecast no change until the second quarter of 2019. The forint traded at 308.70 versus the euro, compared with 308.60 before the rate announcement. The NBH ended its cycle of base rate cuts a year ago. Since then it has boosted liquidity to keep money market interest rates low, by accepting less money in three-month deposits and providing commercial banks with hundreds of billions of forints through forex swap tenders. Analysts at brokerage Equilor said the shift in the achievability of the inflation goal to early 2019 from mid-2018 was an important signal from the NBH.  Accordingly, the current loose monetary policy can remain in place for longer than earlier expected, and this could weaken the forint in the short term,  Equilor said in a note. Despite a jump in annual economic growth to 4.2 percent in the first quarter, inflation remains moderate. Running at 2.1 percent in annual terms in May, it is below the bank's 3 percent target which has a one percentage point tolerance either side.

Oil prices dropped after news of increases in supply by several key producers, a trend which has undermined attempts by OPEC and other producers to support the market through reduced output. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 1 percent, with the S&P; energy sector's 1.3 percent fall leading the decliners. The S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Monday with tech stocks finding favor again as investors regained confidence in the economy after upbeat comments from Federal Reserve officials. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise rates again. New York Fed head William Dudley said inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve. On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.71 points, or 0.24 percent, at 6,224.30. The S&P; technology sector, which fell for two straight weeks on worries about the sector's valuation, was little changed in early trading. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's rally this year. Among stocks, Lennar rose 3.2 percent to $54.40 after the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.

Boeing launched the new version of its best-selling 737 aircraft on Monday amid a flurry of deals. United Airlines, which will become the largest single 737 MAX 10 customer in the world, said it expected the delivery of the first of the planes in late 2020. Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Kevin McAllister said the order was an  endorsement  for the MAX 10. Asked why the latest deal was a conversion a previous order, rather than a new one, United Airlines executive Gerry Laderman told Reuters:  We have a very healthy order book ... and it is very customary for us to place an order to have a certain timeline, and closer to the time we pick which model we want.  Laderman said that United Airlines already had a large MAX order, so there was no need for an incremental one. He added the group had picked the MAX 10 model because it considered it to be  the one with the best economics of the family,  in terms of seat per mile cost. The executive said the U.S carrier had not finalised the seating configuration for the airplanes but that they would be used as domestic aircraft. United also announced an order for four additional Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, lifting the total to 18. Laderman added three would start service from next summer, while the fourth one would be delivered at the end of next year.

The Outlook remains Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions follow KF's announcement that it has agreed with the Austrian state (AA+/Stable/F1+) a long-term refinancing plan covering most of the bank's funding needs with state funds until the completion of KF's accelerated run-off plan. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) AND SENIOR DEBT The upgrade of KF's IDRs, Support Rating, SRF and senior debt ratings reflects Fitch's assessment that the bank's state funding and accelerated wind-down plans have positive implications for the bank's senior creditors. On 9 June 2017, KF signed a framework agreement with the state-owned Abbaumanagement-gesellschaft des Bundes (ABBAG), which holds participations in run-off Austrian institutions on behalf of the government. Under this agreement, almost all of KF's market funding without any direct state support, which formed about 60% of the bank's total funding at end-2016 and included covered bonds, repos and European Central Bank tenders, will be replaced as it matures by mostly long-term funding from the state via ABBAG. As part of the agreement with ABBAG, KF has also applied for approval from the banking regulator, the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA), to revoke its banking licence and change its status to a run-off institution pursuant to section 162 of the Austrian Bank Recovery and Resolution Act, which implements the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in Austria. KF foresees a completion of the wind-down by end-2026, well ahead of the current 2040 target. As a run-off institution, KF will remain within the scope of the BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). As a result, resolution measures affecting senior unsecured creditor bail-in cannot be formally excluded if unexpected losses over the course of KF's accelerated wind-down trigger the need for sovereign support measures beyond those included in the new agreement. However, we view this as extremely unlikely. We believe that, once approved by the FMA, KF's status as a non-bank run-off institution will considerably reduce the risk of bail-in being imposed by the resolution authorities, even if large unexpected wind-down losses make significant additional state support necessary beyond the new state funding foreseen under the agreement. This is because the non-bank run-off status will exempt KF from the minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements to which it has been subject as a regulated bank and which create a strong incentive for resolution authorities to impose bail-in when they deem an institution to be failing or likely to fail. In addition, we believe that the planned refinancing structure would made creditor bail-in highly ineffective, thus considerably reducing the probability of bail-in being imposed on KF's non-state creditors. This is because bail-in would predominantly affect the state in its capacity as KF's owner and (once the refinancing plan is implemented) dominant creditor. We believe that the accelerated wind-down plan and refinancing agreement offer sufficient flexibility to absorb unexpected losses or calls on KF's liquidity in realistic stress scenarios in the course of its wind-down without necessitating additional state support. We judge that the refinancing agreement significantly increases the likelihood of state support. This is because the state will become KF's dominant creditor and intends to remain the sole shareholder until the wind-down is completed, thus increasing the state's incentive to support. The accelerated wind-down plan and refinancing agreement confirm our view that Austria's approach to KF's wind-down plan was clearly formulated at an early stage and has been consistently implemented. Our view of Austria's strong ability to support is derived from the state's high degree of financial flexibility reflected in the sovereign's Long-Term IDRs. Although FMA's formal approval is not expected before the autumn 2017, we view a rejection or potential amendments to the agreement that would materially affect the position of non-state senior creditors as extremely unlikely. The refinancing agreement does not affect our opinion that, due to its wind-down status, KF would not be viable without state support. For this reason, we do not assign a Viability Rating to KF as we cannot meaningfully assess its standalone profile. The upgrade of the Short-Term IDR and non-guaranteed senior unsecured short-term debt reflects our view that the refinancing agreement significantly improves KF's liquidity profile by replacing its large stock of short-term market funding (essentially commercial papers) with long-term state funding, whose maturity matches KF's wind-down horizon. We believe that the agreement also provides KF with a sufficient liquidity buffer in the form of undrawn committed facilities. SUBORDINATED DEBT In the absence of a VR or alternative anchor rating, the rating of the subordinated Tier 2 notes maturing between 2021 and 2031 has thus far reflected our view that, while performing, the notes have been exposed to significant bail-in risk due to the high reliance on state support inherent in KF's wind-down business model. The Rating Watch Positive (RWP) reflects our expectation that, similar to senior debt, the planned refinancing will significantly reduce the exposure of these instruments to bail-in risk. The extent to which KF's new funding mix will reduce the risks of non-performance and loss severity for the Tier 2 instruments relative to the new funds to be provided by the state will determine the extent of the upgrade. We expect to assess these relative risks upon FMA's final approval of the new funding structure. STATE-GUARANTEED DEBT The ratings of the EUR1 billion senior unsecured notes and EUR3.5 billion commercial paper (CP) programme reflect their respective state guarantees as we believe that Austria has an extremely high incentive to honour its guarantees in full even in a scenario in which a resolution of KF would trigger a bail-in of senior unsecured creditors. We understand from management that KF will discontinue its CP programme in the next few months and rely on ABBAG refinancing lines for liquidity management. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AND SENIOR DEBT The ratings are primarily sensitive to Austria's propensity and ability to provide support. The latter is unlikely to diminish materially as long as the sovereign rating remains in the 'AA' category. Given the state's position as KF's sole owner and dominant long-term creditor once the refinancing plans are implemented, we expect the propensity of support to remain extremely high until the wind-down is completed and all third-party liabilities have been repaid. A downgrade could result from a rejection by FMA of KF's transformation into a non-bank run-off institution or FMA imposing material changes to the agreement that we deem detrimental to non-state senior unsecured creditors. We could upgrade the Long-Term IDR and the long-term ratings of the senior unsecured notes (and of the programme under which they have been issued) if, during the course of the accelerated wind-down plan, the stock of outstanding senior debt held by third parties becomes so immaterial that it further reduces bail-in risk. A downgrade of KF's Short-Term IDR and non-guaranteed senior unsecured short-term debt would most likely result from a downgrade of the Long-Term IDR. SUBORDINATED DEBT We expect to upgrade the subordinated Tier 2 notes upon FMA's final approval of the new funding structure. STATE-GUARANTEED DEBT The ratings of the state-guaranteed senior notes and CP programme are sensitive to the same factors as the sovereign's IDRs. The rating actions are as follows: KA Finanz AG Long-Term IDR: upgraded to 'A+' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR: upgraded to 'F1+' from 'F2' Support Rating: upgraded to '1' from '2' Support Rating Floor: revised to 'A+' from BBB+' Long-term senior unsecured notes: upgraded to 'A+' from 'BBB+' State-guaranteed long-term senior unsecured note (XS1270771006): affirmed at 'AA+' State-guaranteed commercial paper programme: affirmed at 'F1+' Debt issuance programme: upgraded to 'A+'/'F1+' from 'BBB+'/'F2' Non-guaranteed CP programme: upgraded to 'F1+' from 'F2' Subordinated Tier 2 debt (XS0257275098, AT0000441209, XS0185015541, XS0144772927 and XS0255270380): 'B' placed on RWP Contact: Primary Analyst Maria Shishkina Associate Director +44 203 350 1379 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Christian Schindler Associate Director +44 203 530 1323 Committee Chairperson Patrick Rioual Senior Director +49 69 76 80 76 123 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

More than 70 people, including 13 firefighters, were taken to hospital on Monday with burns and injuries as the fires ravaged the central districts of Leiria and Castelo Branco. Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who on Sunday visited the affected a mountainous area about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Lisbon, called it the biggest human tragedy in Portugal in living memory. Despite government assurances that the first response by the emergency services was swift and adequate, media and residents questioned its efficiency and the strategic planning in a country which is used to wooded areas burning every year.  So what failed this Saturday? Everything, as it has failed for decades,  read a headline in the newspaper Publico. It blamed a lack of coordination between services in charge of fire prevention and firefighting and poor forestry reserve planning. Related CoveragePortuguese shocked at deadly forest fires, struggle to understandXavier Viegas, an expert on forest fires, said the blaze spread too quickly and violently for firefighters to respond in some villages, but the deaths have mainly shown shortcomings in communications to evacuate people in time. At least half the victims died in their cars as they tried to flee along a local motorway. Many other bodies were found next to the road, suggesting they had abandoned their vehicles in panic. The firefighter who died on Monday had been helping people out of their cars when he was badly burned.  It's still hard to identify what failed, but it's a bit of everything,  Viegas said.  Obviously, certain things that should have been done had not been done - especially in communicating with the population, telling them about the danger levels, areas to be avoided.  Firefighters work to put out a forest fire near Bouca.Rafael MarchanteAn online public petition demanding an investigation into possible failures by the authorities has gathered 440 signatures. Some local residents said they had been without the support of firefighters for hours as their homes burned. Many blamed depopulation of villages that left wooded areas untended. Other countries prone to forest fires have systems in place to warn people of danger. Australia, for example, revised its fire warning system after fires killed 173 people in 2009 and now uses text messages and emergency broadcasts to warn people. Slideshow (19 Images) There's an urgent need to organize that kind of alerting,  Viegas said.  Here, at best, someone from the parish council goes knocking on doors telling people to leave.  Armindo Antonio, 67, was evacuated with his family on Sunday evening by civil protection workers who came to his village. He has no idea when he can go back and said he had received no information from authorities.  All of this is so difficult to understand,  said Antonio, whose five family members had been housed in a packed old-age home with other evacuees.  It could have been our village.  Civil protection commander Elisio Oliveira said the firefighting efforts were progressing well, but the fire was not yet under control. Water planes, including French and Spanish aircraft, flew overhead. Two army battalions were helping the emergency services.  There is still a lot of forest that can burn,  said Rui Barreto, deputy chief firefighter at the makeshift emergency services headquarters in Pedrogao Grande, where the blaze began on Saturday. Police said a lightning strike on a tree probably caused the blaze, in a region hit by an intense heat wave and dry, gusty winds that fanned the flames. However, the regional prosecutor still ordered a criminal investigation into the causes. Many forest fires in Portugal are caused by arson or carelessness.

Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making.                  On Monday, New York Fed President William Dudley said halting the rate-hiking cycle now would imperil the economy, and unemployment at 4.3 percent now and inflation at 1.5 percent were  a pretty good place to be.”                  “The more the Fed beats in this relentlessly hawkish message, the more the yield curve just ends up flattening on it,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                flattened to 107 basis points, the lowest since December 2007.     The yield curve has flattened as the Fed’s hawkishness contrasts with weakening inflation.     Data last Wednesday showed that the so-called core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out food and energy costs, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year in May, the smallest rise since May 2015.                  That measure has fallen from a year-on-year rise of 2.2 percent in February.                  “The Fed has been talking much more hawkishly than the past in the context of the recent data,” said Kohli. “It’s not that the levels are disturbing, it’s that the trend is really disturbing.”     Five-year note yields           , which are among the most sensitive to Fed policy, have jumped to 1.80 percent from a six-month low of 1.67 percent on Wednesday, before the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the second time in three months.     Thirty-year bond yields          , which are most influenced by inflation expectations, by contrast have tumbled to 2.76 percent from 2.80 percent after the Fed’s rate hike last week.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were last up 3/32 in price to yield 2.18 percent, down from 2.19 percent late on Monday.

Christina Kramer, currently executive vice president, retail distribution and channel strategy, was promoted to group head, personal and small business banking and will oversee the bank's retail operations. Jon Hountalas, who runs the bank's commercial banking business, will also assume responsibility for wealth management in an expanded role as group head, commercial banking and wealth management. In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said the changes were a  natural evolution.   What it does is allow us to provide an opportunity for the next generation of leadership to take on that role,  he said.  We have two senior executives who have been with us almost the better part of a decade. They now have an opportunity to put their feet up for a while.  Dodig said the bank was also moving 40 junior executives into different roles to enhance their experience. Asked if the changes could create a path for his eventual successor, Dodig, 52, said:  It’s always a duel opportunity. You’ve got to create enough bandwidth in the organization that if something were to happen in the short term to me there will be others who could step in. But in the medium term there will be more that can step into the role.  Harry Culham will continue to run the bank's capital markets business while Larry Richman, CEO of PrivateBancorp, which CIBC is in the process of acquiring, will become group head, US region, when the deal closes on June 23. Williamson, who had been a contender to become CEO of the bank before Victor Dodig was appointed CEO in 2014, will leave the bank in the first quarter of 2018. Geist will leave at the end of the year. CIBC also said Deepak Khandelwal, who has worked for management consultancy McKinsey, Google and Rogers , will join the bank in August with a remit to include running its digital banking and call center operations. CIBC, Canada's fifth biggest lender, last month reported second-quarter earnings that beat market expectations, benefiting from growth across its businesses.

If successful, Apple's attack would undermine a core tenet of Qualcomm's business model. Apple sued San Diego-based Qualcomm in January, saying the chip maker improperly withheld $1 billion in rebates because Apple helped Korean regulators investigate Qualcomm. Apple's initial lawsuit was a relatively narrow one focused on whether it violated a contract with Qualcomm by helping regulators that were investigating Qualcomm's business practices. But the new filing expands Apple's claims and seeks to stop Qualcomm's longstanding business model using a legal theory based on a ruling last month. The U.S. Supreme Court made it harder for manufacturers and drug companies to control how their products are used or resold, ruling in May against printer company Lexmark International Inc in a patent dispute over another company's resale of its used ink cartridges. In a Tuesday brief seen by Reuters, Apple took aim at Qualcomm's practice of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before purchasing chips, known in the industry as  no license, no chips . FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is pictured at one of its many campus buildings in San Diego, California, U.S. April 18, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoThe license allows Qualcomm to take a percentage of the overall selling price for iPhone in exchange for supplying the modem chips that let phones connect to cellular data networks. Apple argued that the ruling involving Lexmark showed that Qualcomm was entitled to only  one reward  for its intellectual property and products.  Qualcomm should be allowed to charge for either a patent license or a chip, but not both, Apple argued. Apple wants to be able to buy chips without signing the license agreement that forces it to pay a part of the overall iPhone sale price. Apple also asked the court to stop lawsuits that Qualcomm had filed against Foxconn Technology Group and three other contract makers that assemble the iPhone on Apple's behalf and are the formal buyers of Qualcomm's chip, as is standard in the electronics industry. Apple argued that the court fight should be between Apple and Qualcomm.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-qualcomm-licenses-idUSL1N1JH0LY"},

A day after the start of Brexit talks, Hammond sought to soften the more confrontational tone towards the bloc taken by Prime Minister Theresa May - a role he has re-adopted since her election flop earlier this month.  Our departure from the EU is under way. But ensuring that it happens via a smooth pathway to a deep and special future partnership with our EU neighbors, one that protects jobs, prosperity, and living standards in Britain will require every ounce of skill and diplomacy,  he said in a speech.  ...Yesterday was a positive start. It will get tougher. But we are ready for the challenge.  Almost a year to the day since British voters decided to leave the EU, the Brexit strategy debate within the government has been opened up again by May's unexpected failure to win a parliamentary majority in the June 8 ballot.  She had raised concerns among many businesses in Britain by saying that no deal with the EU was better than a bad deal, raising the prospect of an abrupt Brexit. Hammond had looked set to lose his job until May's election flop.  He has now re-emerged as big business' leading proponent in the government, a role he reinforced on Tuesday by emphasizing the need for  mutually beneficial transitional arrangements to avoid unnecessary disruption and dangerous cliff edges.  In his speech, Hammond also reiterated he planned to stick to the government's target of turning Britain's budget deficit into a surplus by the mid-2020s, despite pressure from the resurgent opposition Labour Party for more public spending.  Crusade  for Services In his annual Mansion House speech, Hammond said Britain would almost certainly need an implementation period as it left the EU's single market and its customs union  with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, speaking after Hammond, said companies might soon start to activate contingency plans if a transitional deal did not appear likely. Hammond said he wanted Britain to lead a  crusade  for the opening up of services markets around the world as it leaves the EU, reflecting the importance of a sector that accounts for around 80 percent of Britain's economic output. Speaking to an audience packed with banking executives, he  took a swipe at recent moves by the EU to try to shift some of Britain's financial services to the bloc.   We are already hearing protectionist agendas being advanced, disguised as arguments about regulatory competence, financial stability, and supervisory oversight,  he said.  We can have no truck with that approach.  The EU's executive said last week it planned to give itself powers to move euro clearing business away from London's financial sector to the EU after Brexit. However, Hammond made a point of acknowledging the concerns of other EU countries about their oversight of financial markets which are vital to their economies but will be outside the bloc.  Hammond also reiterated his calls for Britain to remain open to skilled workers, reflecting a key concern among businesses which are worried that they might face big hurdles to hiring EU workers after Brexit.

Britain, the EU's biggest financial market, is leaving the bloc in 2019, raising the prospect of an abrupt cut in cross-border links without a new trade deal. Rival financial centers, including Frankfurt, Paris and Luxembourg, are vying to benefit.  Hammond said Britain's Brexit negotiations with the EU would take a  pragmatic approach  to financial services and how they are supervised.   Fragmentation of financial services would result in poorer quality, higher priced products for everyone concerned,  Hammond told a financial audience in London. At present, banks and insurers in London serve the EU market from a single base, but this  passporting  is set to end after Brexit without new arrangements.  First, we will need a new process for establishing regulatory requirements for cross-border business between the UK and EU. It must be evidence-based, symmetrical and transparent.  And it must reflect international standards,  Hammond said.  Second, cooperation arrangements must be reciprocal, reliable, and prioritize financial stability. Crucially they must enable timely and coordinated risk management on both sides.   Related CoverageUK's Hammond says challenge to avoid 'cliff-edge' Brexit Third, these arrangements must be permanent and reliable for the businesses regulated under these regimes,  Hammond said. Without passporting, banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain would only be allowed to access the bloc's single market if they set up costly subsidiaries in the EU, which some are planning, or by using the EU's  equivalence  regime. Brussels allows market access to foreign firms whose home rules are  equivalent  to those in the bloc, but this can be withdrawn at short notice. Last week the bloc proposed toughening  equivalence  for foreign central counterparties (CCPs) or clearing houses used by EU customers, seen by London's financial sector as a land grab. Under the proposals, a foreign CCP that clears large amounts of euro-denominated business must be directly supervised by EU regulators and, if necessary, the business moved to the bloc to safeguard financial stability. Genuine Concerns Hammond said  protectionist agendas  were being advanced, disguised as arguments about financial stability and supervisory oversight. But in a broad hint that Britain would accept some loss of regulatory sovereignty after Brexit to avoid loss of market share, he said the bloc has  genuine and reasonable  concerns about financial markets outside its jurisdiction.  We saw such a concern articulated in the EU's proposal on supervision of CCPs last week. We must, and we will, engage with all genuine concerns,  Hammond said. London-based LCH (LSE.L) dominates euro clearing, and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who spoke alongside Hammond, said fragmentation of the business was in nobody's interest and could actually damage financial stability.  Any development which prevented EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else,  Carney said. Authorities should instead build on current models to develop  a new form of regulatory and supervisory cooperation .  The European Commission’s proposals announced last week recognize the importance of effective cooperation arrangements between the relevant EU authorities and their overseas counterparts,  Carney said.   The Bank welcomes this.  Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alison Williams and Andrew Heavens","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-banks-idUSKBN19B0NB"},

A row over the South African Reserve Bank has escalated this week after the head of the country's constitutionally-mandated anti-graft watchdog called for the bank to focus on growth more than maintaining currency and price stability.  We would consider it critical that the operational independence of the reserve bank remains untouched lest we would see weakening policy flexibility in monetary affairs,  S&P;'s top sovereign analyst, Moritz Kraemer, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum chatroom.  Depending on the severity of the changes (to the central bank's independence), a rating action could indeed be one consequence.  S&P; stripped South Africa of its coveted investment grade rating back in April after the sacking of internationally respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan. It currently has a BB+ rating with a negative outlook on its foreign currency debt, although it does still have an investment grade BBB- on its domestic currency debt, which may have prevented a larger scale sell-off of its bonds. New Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has said the country is committed to the fiscal consolidation plans laid out in his predecessor Gordhan's 2017 budget. The government's debt is currently just below 50 percent of gross domestic product, at around 2.2 trillion rand ($168.40 billion) while the cost of servicing that debt has been one of the fastest growing budget expenditures in recent years. S&P; has also warned that jostling for leadership positions ahead of the ruling African National Congress party's conference at the end of the year, was likely to distract the government from implementing economic reforms. Unemployment is at a 14-year high, key sectors of the economy are struggling as the country reels in recession. Rival rating firm Fitch also warned this week that new rules on mine ownership introduced last week could deter investment.  We consider the reserve bank as the pillar of institutional strength which supports the South Africa sovereign rating at its current level,  Kraemer said on Tuesday.  Any weakening of the status and independence would in our view risk weakening the monetary flexibility which remains a key rating strength.  $1 = 13.0640 rand Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by Karin Strohecker/Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/southafrica-rating-cenbank-idUSL8N1JH3RW"},

As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The Outlooks have been revised following the revision of the Bahraini sovereign Outlook to Negative due to a widening government deficit, high and rising debt, the lack of a medium-term fiscal framework combined with high oil dependence and domestic political tensions that hamper fiscal adjustment (see 'Fitch Revises Bahrain's Outlook to Negative; Affirms IDR 'BB+'' dated 12 June 2017 on www.fitchratings.com). KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, SRs AND SRFs NBB's and BBK's IDRs are driven by standalone strength of the individual banks, as reflected by their respective Viability Ratings (VRs). They are also underpinned by potential sovereign support, as reflected by their respective Support Rating Floors (SRFs). NBB's and BBK's Support Ratings (SRs) and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation of a moderate probability of support from the Bahraini authorities, if required. Our view of support is based on the systemic importance of NBB and BBK as major retail and corporate banks in Bahrain, and the Bahraini authorities' high propensity to support domestic commercial banks, albeit with a weakening ability to do so. The Bahraini government holds significant stakes in both banks - 32% in BBK and 44.2% in NBB via Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co (the investment arm of the Government of Bahrain) - which is also a factor in Fitch's view on sovereign support. AUB's IDRs and SR reflect a high probability of institutional support from the bank's core shareholder, the Public Institute for Social Security (PIFSS), an arm of the State of Kuwait (AA/Stable), which holds an 18.7% stake in the bank. The strong links between PIFSS and AUB include PIFSS's strong interest as shareholder in both AUB and its Kuwaiti subsidiary (in which PIFSS holds a 12% stake). However, support from PIFSS is constrained by Bahrain's Country Ceiling of 'BBB+' and the Negative Outlook reflects that on the Bahraini sovereign rating. VRs NBB's and BBK's VRs are capped by the operating environment in Bahrain, and more specifically by the Bahrain sovereign rating. Both NBB and BBK are predominantly domestic banks with significant exposure to the sovereign and the domestic operating environment. NBB's VR also reflects the bank's solid capital ratios (albeit only appropriate in the context of a weakening operating environment, lower risk-weighted assets due to high government exposure and a concentrated balance sheet), strong domestic franchise, consistent and solid profitability, generally adequate asset quality despite a fairly high headline impaired loan ratio, and sound liquidity. However, NBB's VR also factors in the bank's reliance on a small and competitive domestic environment and concentrations in both loans and deposits, which although comparing well with GCC peers, still give rise to event risk. BBK's VR takes into consideration the bank's satisfactory and resilient financial performance despite the weakening operating environment in Bahrain. BBK has maintained solid margins and consistent profitability through its well-established franchise. Funding and liquidity indicators remain satisfactory and are important rating drivers. Asset quality metrics are sound. However, BBK's VR also reflects the bank's loan book concentration, which while well below the levels of peers still gives rise to event risk. We also take into account the bank's dependence on the undiversified Bahraini market. In light of the weakening operating environment, Fitch views capital as only adequate despite capital-raising in 2Q16. AUB's VR is not capped by the Bahraini operating environment and sovereign rating, but at this rating level the deteriorating Bahraini operating environment is putting pressure on the bank's VR. AUB's VR benefits from the bank's diversified franchise, with operations across the GCC, specifically in Kuwait, sound asset quality despite exposure to the higher-risk Middle East/North Africa (MENA) markets, such as Egypt, and solid operating profitability. Risk appetite is conservative compared with many peers in the region and asset quality metrics are consistently sound and compare well with peers. AUB's VR also takes into account loan book concentrations, which however is somewhat mitigated at group level by geographic and sector diversification. The rating also reflects capitalisation ratios that although adequate for the bank's operations, are low compared with domestic and regional peers. SENIOR DEBT Senior debt ratings are aligned with the respective banks' IDRs. SUBORDINATED DEBT BBK's subordinated debt is rated one notch below the bank's Long-Term IDRs, reflecting below-average recoveries. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SRs AND SRFs NBB's and BBK's Long-Term IDRs would only be downgraded if both their VRs and SRFs are downgraded and revised downward respectively. A downgrade of the Bahraini sovereign by one notch would result in a downward revision of NBB's and BBK's SRFs by one notch, reflecting the weakening ability of the sovereign to support its domestic banks. AUB's IDRs are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of PIFSS's ability or propensity to provide support or to changes in Bahrain's Country Ceiling. The IDRs would be downgraded if Bahrain's Country Ceiling is downgraded or if Fitch believes that PIFSS's ability or willingness to support has diminished. In turn, Bahrain's Country Ceiling is sensitive to a change in Bahrain's sovereign rating, which is on Negative Outlook. VR Downward pressure on NBB's, BBK's and AUB's VRs could arise from a further material worsening of the Bahraini operating environment. The three VRs would be downgraded by one notch if the sovereign rating is downgraded by one notch. Downside risk to NBB's VR may also arise from further deterioration in asset quality. Downside risk to BBK's VR could also arise if asset quality or capitalisation considerably weakens from current levels. AUB's VR is also sensitive to asset quality or liquidity deterioration or if the bank's Fitch core capital ratio is severely eroded. SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT The senior and subordinated debt ratings are sensitive to the same considerations that might affect each of the bank's Long-Term IDRs. The rating actions are as follows: AUB: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook Revised to Negative from Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'BBB+'/'F2' BBK: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Revised to Negative from Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'BB+' Subordinated debt affirmed at 'BB' NBB: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Revised to Negative from Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Contact: Primary Analyst Redmond Ramsdale Senior Director +44 20 3530 1836 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Zeinab Abdalla Associate Director +971 4 424 1210 Committee Chairperson Eric Dupont Senior Director +33 1 44 29 9131 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

Industry participants warn that the €85trn euro swap market could splinter into onshore and offshore pools as a result of forced EU relocation after the UK's departure from the bloc, similar to Japan where a pricing basis has emerged between domestic clearinghouse JSCC and London-based provider LCH in yen swaps. Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned this morning that attempts to split clearinghouses could fragment the global market and reduce the liquidity and cost benefits of central clearing. “Any development which prevented EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else,” he said in his Mansion House speech. “Fragmentation is in no one’s economic interest. Nor is it necessary for financial stability. Indeed it can damage it. Fragmenting clearing would lead to smaller liquidity pools in CCPs, reducing the ability to diversify risks and diminishing resilience.” Costly to issuers Proposals published last week by the European Commission aim to enhance supervision of third-country clearinghouses and leave the door open for the EU to force the most systemically important euro swaps clearinghouses to be located within the bloc. That could prove costly for end-users based on evidence from Japan. Without regulatory recognition of international yen swap clearinghouses, domestic firms must clear their contracts in the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, part of the Japan Exchange Group. International entities, meanwhile, use LCH's SwapClear, which clears 18 currencies and handles over 90% of the global cleared interest rate swaps market. The basis between the two providers is typically around 1bp–3bp but is extremely volatile but has been as high as 5bp. According to one clearing head at a European house, that means bond issuers could end up paying an additional €10m to hedge €1bn over a 20-year maturity. “We would be concerned about a small European CCP being subject to similar pricing differentials we see in Japan as although an additional 0.05% cost might not seem like very much, it actually turns out to be quite substantial for issuers,” said a clearing head at a European bank. “With a smaller local CCP in euros, you might also worry about the level of mutualisation and resources available.” While clearing in yen swaps is relatively well balanced between Tokyo and London, euro swaps clearing is heavily skewed towards non-EU based counterparties. Euro contacts constitute just under 30% of LCH's total cleared interest rate swaps, but only a quarter of that portion represents activity from EU-based firms. In his Mansion House address, Carney also acknowledged wider concerns around the tens of trillions of euros of existing interest rate swaps traded by EU firms that could become trapped in a clearinghouse no longer recognised by the European Commission. “Those EU firms would face capital charges as much as 10 times higher than today unless they could move them,” he warned. More Cooperation Carney stressed the need for greater supervisory cooperation following Brexit. He said that similar concerns were raised during his time as governor of the Bank of Canada and ultimately addressed through common standards and cooperative oversight, enabling Canadian dollar clearing to move to a more efficient and resilient London hub. “The Bank of England also must concern itself with the resilience of CCPs in other European and non-European jurisdictions that are used by firms that we supervise,” he said. “These CCPs must be subject to robust regulatory standards and deep reciprocal supervisory cooperation.” While the Commission’s proposals keep the door ajar for the EU to grab clearing activity from London, such action would only be considered for clearinghouses deemed to be the most systemically important by the European Securities & Markets Authority and in conjunction with the European Central Bank. The key focus of the proposed rules, however, is to set out a framework for enhanced supervisory oversight of third-country clearinghouses, with input from the ECB, which was largely omitted from the regime in original EMIR text. “The Commission proposals acknowledge the fact that EMIR in its existing state didn’t provide the tools to challenge that risk. What the proposals do is increase the number and nuance of tools in the toolbox to look at this challenge,  said the clearing head.  The ultimate option is still there through non-recognition approach, but the real concern is that it would have much more impact on European members than anyone outside of Europe.” (Reporting by Helen Bartholomew)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/derivatives-bond-issuers-face-rising-cos-idUSL8N1JH3WF"},

The digital platform called  Virtual Volunteer  was unveiled on World Refugee Day as new data showed the number of refugees globally reached a record 22.5 million in 2016.  People moving are often caught in a fog of poor information,  said Jagan Chapagain, head of programs and operations at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  They don't always know what services are available to them. This is a tool that will help give them a clearer view so that they can make informed decisions,  he said in a statement. Italy is on the frontline in the European migrant crisis which has seen hundreds of thousands of people arrive in the continent by land and sea after fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Nearly 70,000 have arrived in Italy so far this year, mostly migrants from West Africa and Bangladesh, according to the International Organization for Migration. Virtual Volunteer uses geolocation to show users on a map where to access everything from shelters, food banks, canteens, and showers to clothes distribution points, maternal health centers, free legal assistance, dentists and language schools. Refugees and migrants can also find advice on how to protect themselves from traffickers and can access information to help them locate family members if they have become separated. The app - developed by the IFRC and tech giant IBM – has already been rolled out in Greece and Sweden where it has been used by 30,000 people.  Information saves lives. Ensuring that people can access unbiased, factual information has a big impact,  Italian Red Cross President Francesco Rocca said in a statement. Virtual Volunteer, also accessible as a website, offers information in multiple languages depending on what is most needed in each country. Languages in Italy include French, Arabic and Tigrinya, reflecting the high number of Eritrean arrivals, while those in Greece include Arabic, Farsi and Dari. The IFRC plans to role out the service in other countries affected by migration including the Philippines and countries in West Africa.

The move follows similar decisions in various districts of the city state, and could mark a departure for a city known as a party town that has long traded on an association with the licentiousness of its avant-garde 1920s. The Social Democrat, Green and far-left Die Linke parties in the city state's government have said they intend to proceed with the measure in their coalition agreement despite objections from opposition parties who say it infringes free speech.  The coalition will establish an expert committee to examine and prevent discriminatory advertising,  the parties said in their coalition agreement from last year. Already, advertisers are being prevented from placing discriminatory adverts on city-owned hoardings. A committee of experts will decide whether individual adverts are sexist or degrading in nature. The Linke in one Berlin district have suggested that adverts that present women as beautiful but also as  weak, hysterical, stupid, non compos mentis or naive  or as objects of lust should be regarded as sexist, the Tagesspiegel reported. Opposition parties have criticized the proposal, however, with Merkel's Christian Democrats saying that politics had  no right to intervene in the free advertising market , while the liberal Free Democrats worried that the measure was a constraint on freedom of expression. Others have argued that sexist advertising is rarer today than in the past, meaning a ban is unnecessary. But Petra Koch-Knoebel, the equality commissioner for the borough of Friedrichshain disagreed, saying that the fact that it was rarer meant people had become  sensitised  to excessive advertising. From 2019, the city-wide government will assume the power to regulate public advertising from the boroughs with whom it currently resides, meaning the planned ban is likely to go into effect from then.

S&P; stripped Britain of its coveted triple-A rating after the Brexit vote last June, downgrading it by two notches to AA and assigning a negative outlook. A year on, inconclusive national elections have raised the prospect of another ballot in 2017, which S&P;'s sovereign ratings chief Moritz Kraemer said would be negative for the rating if it delayed Brexit negotiations.  There is no time to be wasted,  said Kraemer.  If we have another hiatus with Brussels because of an election campaign going on, then that in itself would, all other things being equal, be negative.  Brexit negotiations started this week and need to be wrapped up before the formal divorce in March 2019. Asked if S&P; would wait until the end of the Brexit negotiations to take another ratings action on Britain, Kraemer said:  No, we don't have to wait.   We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation... and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status.  Kraemer, speaking on the sidelines of a Euromoney conference in London, said the next rating action would most likely be a cut because of the negative outlook. Kraemer earlier told an audience that  the stakes are extremely high  for Brexit and the the risks  more tangible than we see in Europe or the U.S . No Deal The Brexit strategy debate within Britain's government has been opened up again by Prime Minister Theresa May's unexpected failure to win a parliamentary majority in the June 8 ballot. Some analysts have argued a likely tie-up between her Conservatives and the DUP could ensure a softer stance because the small northern Irish party will not support a deal that creates a hard border with its Republic of Ireland neighbours. But Kraemer said this uncertainty over the government's stance only raised the prospect for negotiations finishing with no deal - the most economically damaging outcome.  With dependence on the DUP, a customs union is becoming a bit more likely...But if we have a customs union then that means Britain cannot strike trade deals with other countries and that might create controversy with some in the Conservative party.  It might just come to nothing, that is the risk. That is how a hard Brexit would come about and we think that would be very detrimental for the UK economy.

The growing use of carbon composites in aircraft has eroded aluminium's dominance as the material of choice for planemakers. This has left aerospace demand for aluminium trailing behind booming use of the metal in the car industry, where aluminium supplied by the likes of Arconic, Aleris International and Constellium has played the challenger to steel. Constellium projects aluminium demand from aerospace will grow by an average 2 percent over the next five years, about half of what it has seen historically. That compares with the 10-20 percent annual growth rate it anticipates from the car sector in the coming years. The group is  not hoping for  a return to all-aluminium plane bodies, after composites established their role, but sees much to play for as planemakers study options for jets that will take to the skies in the 2030s, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Germain said.  I think like everything in life there is a moment of excitement about composites, justifiably so, but sometimes the pendulum will swing as well,  he said in an interview coinciding with the Paris Airshow. Composites have clearly shown their attractiveness in wing strength. But design setbacks in some parts of the plane have already let aluminium claw back share in recent jet programmes, Germain said, declining to give specific details. The tried-and-tested qualities of aluminium have been talked up by metal suppliers as planemakers focus on meeting tight delivery schedules and ambitious production targets. But aluminium is not just a fallback option, according to Germain, who said developments in lighter alloys and combining of different materials would keep metals in the running as planemakers draw up new designs. At Constellium's research centre in Voreppe, located in what was the heartland of the French aluminium industry in the Alps, test projects range from combining fine layers of metal and glass fibre, to gluing aluminium parts together with resin to dispense with rivets that weigh more. Lighter alloys have already earned Constellium and its peers market share on recent jet programmes by narrowing the weight gap with lightweight composites. But they also cost more, eroding aluminium's price advantage over composites, while plastic materials continue to benefit from innovations. A new single-aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation boasts composite wings made using a cheaper manufacturing process that could help open up the middle of the jet market to composite-driven designs.

The move follows similar decisions in various districts of the city state, and could mark a departure for a city known as a party town that has long traded on an association with the licentiousness of its avant-garde 1920s. The Social Democrat, Green and far-left Die Linke parties in the city state's government have said they intend to proceed with the measure in their coalition agreement despite objections from opposition parties who say it infringes free speech.  The coalition will establish an expert committee to examine and prevent discriminatory advertising,  the parties said in their coalition agreement from last year. Already, advertisers are being prevented from placing discriminatory adverts on city-owned hoardings. A committee of experts will decide whether individual adverts are sexist or degrading in nature. The Linke in one Berlin district have suggested that adverts that present women as beautiful but also as  weak, hysterical, stupid, non compos mentis or naive  or as objects of lust should be regarded as sexist, the Tagesspiegel reported. Opposition parties have criticized the proposal, however, with Merkel's Christian Democrats saying that politics had  no right to intervene in the free advertising market , while the liberal Free Democrats worried that the measure was a constraint on freedom of expression. Others have argued that sexist advertising is rarer today than in the past, meaning a ban is unnecessary. But Petra Koch-Knoebel, the equality commissioner for the borough of Friedrichshain disagreed, saying that the fact that it was rarer meant people had become  sensitised  to excessive advertising. From 2019, the city-wide government will assume the power to regulate public advertising from the boroughs with whom it currently resides, meaning the planned ban is likely to go into effect from then.

BlackRock, which manages $5.4 trillion across a range of actively managed and index-tracking funds, led a 30 million euro ($33.6 million) funding round for Scalable alongside its two existing German venture capital backers, a joint statement said. The funding will help Scalable expand its robo-advice business - which uses low-cost exchange-based funds and online distribution - with financial institutions and corporates to help grow assets past the 250 million euros raised in the 16 months since launch from more than 6,000 retail clients. The expansion of BlackRock's digital efforts comes as fund and wealth managers globally look to overhaul their distribution models amid tougher regulation, pressure on fees and the changing investment needs of a younger generation. Patrick Olson, BlackRock's chief operating officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and who will join Scalable's supervisory board, said the decision to invest came as investors increasingly wanted to access their holdings using technology.  This trend is prompting strong demand from European financial institutions – including banks, insurers, wealth managers and advisory firms – for high-quality technology-enabled investment solutions,  Olsen said. Scalable Capital, founded in 2014 and based in Munich and London, uses exchange-traded funds from BlackRock and others to build low-cost portfolios for clients and is actively looking to expand into other European countries. As well as Britain and Germany, it is also active in Austria. New European rules aimed at improving transparency, value for money and protections for investors meant traditional asset and wealth managers would need to use technology to help design, manage and distribute investments, the companies said.  Technology is not just a competitive advantage but a requirement for wealth management businesses to be successful in the future,  Adam French, co-founder and co-CEO at Scalable Capital, said. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the third quarter. The companies declined to specify the size of the equity stake taken by BlackRock or its growth targets. Fintech Stable The deal for Scalable comes several months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up its technology and investment expertise. It also follows the purchase in 2015 of U.S.-based robo-adviser FutureAdvisor which, like Scalable, uses exchange-traded funds to build portfolios for clients and began serving retail customers. Since then, FutureAdvisor has put more emphasis on licensing its service to big wealth management companies to offer through their own advisers, typically to lower-tier clients who they might otherwise not retain. BlackRock is keen to win more market share with those wealth management firms, which are already a primary distributor of its funds to the general public. FutureAdvisor disclosed having $969 million in assets under management and 13,751 accounts in a February filing with U.S. regulators, up from $232 million and 3,460 accounts around when the BlackRock deal was announced in 2015. As well as FutureAdvisor, BlackRock's digital wealth management business includes Aladdin Risk for Wealth, iRetire and iCapital, all of which are solely for U.S.-based clients. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company's Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. It is also exploring how computer models can improve stock picking while reducing costs and in March announced plans to bolster an internal team known for data-driven approaches to picking stocks.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell to seven-month lows on news of boosted supply by several key producers.       U.S. crude        prices shed 2.56 percent to $43.07 a barrel.      Wholesale trade rose 1.0 percent in April from March, led by higher sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector, Statistics Canada said. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast a 0.5 percent increase.                   Another day, another positive for the Canadian outlook ... April (gross domestic product) is shaping up to remain in positive territory after an extremely strong March,  said Nick Exarhos, economist at CIBC Capital Markets in a research note.     At 9:03 a.m. ET (1303 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3263 against the greenback, or 75.40 U.S. cents, down 0.3 percent.     The loonie traded in a range of C$1.3205 to C$1.3284. Last week, it touched its strongest in 3-1/2 months at C$1.3165.     The strength of recent data has triggered a more hawkish stance from the Bank of Canada. The central bank's top two officials said last week that rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates need to be kept at near-record lows.                  Chances of a rate hike as early as next month have climbed to 35 percent, from nearly zero earlier this month, while a rate hike has been fully priced in by December, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                The U.S. dollar        reached a three-week high against a basket of major currencies, boosted by comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve bolstering expectations that it would keep raising interest rates.                  Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve, with the two-year            up 2.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.929 percent and the 10-year             rising 9 Canadian cents to yield 1.532 percent.     Canada's 2-year yield fell 1.9 basis points further below its U.S. equivalent to a spread of -44.0 basis points. On Monday it had touched its smallest gap in nearly four months at -42.1 basis points.     Canadian retail sales data for April is due out on Thursday, while inflation data for May is due on Friday.

Viehweg has chaired the board of Deutsche in Russia since November 2015 and her role was expanded last year to include chief country officer in Russia after Pavel Teplukhin stepped down and the bank cut back its presence in the country. The source said that Tuesday was Viehweg's last working day at Deutsche in Russia as she was leaving to become head of Sberbank's subsidiary in Switzerland.

The offensive came amid worry that rebel reinforcements could arrive in the city after Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Fighting in Marawi City has entered a fifth week, and nearly 350 people have been killed, according to an official count. Fleeing residents have said they have seen scores of bodies in the debris of homes destroyed in bombing and cross-fire.  We are aiming to clear Marawi by the end of Ramadan,  said military spokesman Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla, as army and police commanders met in nearby Cagayan de Oro city to reassess strategy and operations against the militants, who claim allegiance to Islamic State. But he added:  We are not setting any deadlines knowing the complexity of the battle. We are doing our best to expedite the liberation of Marawi at the soonest time possible.  The seizure of Marawi and the dogged fight to regain control of it has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear Islamic State - on a backfoot in Iraq and Syria - is trying to set up a stronghold in the Muslim south of the mainly Roman Catholic Philippines that could threaten the whole region. President Rodrigo Duterte visited a school where people who fled from Marawi are being housed and apologized for their plight, especially since it was Ramadan. Related CoveragePhilippine police check for any Manila attack plan but say nothing confirmed I will help you, I will rehabilitate Marawi, it will be a beautiful city again,  he said at the school in Iligan City, about 40 km (25 miles) from the battle zone. Padilla said the military aimed to prevent the conflict from escalating after Ramadan ends.  We are closely watching certain groups and we hope they will not join the fight,  Padilla said. Some Muslim residents of Marawi said other groups could join the fighting after Ramadan. A joint group of police and military forces on positions while conducting a house to house search as part of clearing operations in different sections of Marawi city.Stringer As devout Muslims, we are forbidden to fight during Ramadan so afterwards, there may be new groups coming in,  said Faisal Amir, who has stayed on in the city despite the battle. 'Gaining Ground' Fighting was intense early on Tuesday as security forces made a push to drive the militants, entrenched in Marawi's commercial district, south toward a lake on the edge of the city. Planes flew overhead dropping bombs while on the ground, automatic gunfire was sustained with occasional blasts from artillery. Armored vehicles fired volleys of shells while the militants responded with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades. Slideshow (11 Images)Fighting later died down as heavy rain fell but had resumed by evening. Military sources said troops were attacking the militants from three sides and trying to box them toward the lake.  We’re gaining ground and we’re expanding our vantage positions,  said Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera, another military spokesman, although he declined to comment on specifics.  We are moving toward the center of gravity,  he added, referring to the militants' command and communications center. An army corporal near the front line told Reuters soldiers were tagging houses and buildings that had been cleared.   We still have to clear more than 1,000 structures,  he said, adding infantry units were left behind at  cleared  areas to prevent militants from recapturing lost ground. As of Tuesday, the military said 258 militants, 65 security personnel and 26 civilians had been killed. Hundreds of people are unaccounted for, with many believed to be hiding in the basements of the city.

On course for record output by 2020, Britain's automotive industry has been one of the country's great success stories in recent years, employing over 800,000 people in the sector to produce for the likes of Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Mini.  The greatest threat to that progress is Brexit,  said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) on Tuesday.  To leave in 2019 without a deal would put the industry in peril, defaulting to WTO tariffs and customs barriers would damage our industry permanently,  he said, referring to the two-year talks which are under way between London and Brussels. The sector has consistently warned that the imposition of tariffs and a loss of access to its biggest export market following Britain's departure from its EU could hurt investment and threaten the viability of the huge car plants. British Prime Minister Theresa May had proposed a clean break from the EU: leaving its single market, which enshrines free movement of people, goods, services and capital, and giving up full access to the customs union in favour of a bespoke deal. But her failure to win an outright majority in a snap election on June 8 has weakened her authority and reignited debate within the cabinet and her party over what kind of deal Britain should pursue as it leaves the bloc. Government Listening? For the car industry, which has refined the management of its supply chains so that parts arrive on site just hours before they are used, any delay at the border would be hugely damaging. On Tuesday, Honda, which builds around 8 percent of Britain's 1.7 million cars at it southern English plant, said it had discovered more complexity and cost the further it delved into the details of what an exit from the customs union would mean.  Put very simply the supply chain will start to seize up with obvious impacts on our ability to manufacture vehicles efficiently,  Honda Europe Senior Vice President Ian Howells said. Howells told Reuters it remained to be seen whether politicians were listening to the needs of business, in a sign of the pressure politicians are facing from a range of sectors. Top of the list for the industry is a desire to see a longer transitional deal agreed with the EU, to give the industry time to prepare for the historic move out of the EU. The SMMT said it also wants Britain to still be able to approve vehicles for the European market, maintain passporting rights for automotive finance firms and have access to EU trade deals with nations such as Japan. Only 44 pct of parts in UK made car come from Britain, compared to common global rules for more than half in many free trade agreements. That level is even lower when taking into account cross-border work before final installation.

The problem, for many workers here, is one of quality, not quantity. That’s the case with Brandon Seitz. The rail-thin 32-year-old worked for 12 years on an assembly line at one of the local recreational-vehicle factories that have made Elkhart the RV Capital of the World. The job, Seitz says, nearly wrecked his health. His pay, as for assembly workers at most RV factories, was a combination of a low hourly wage and a large production bonus, referred to as the “piece rate.” The frantic rush to meet output targets — and thus earn bonuses — made it easier for accidents to happen, he says. During his first year, he tore tendons in his knee when a steel frame hit him. And then there was the heat. Most RV factories lack air conditioning. “I was constantly sweating,” he says. “There were days in summer when I drank two-and-a-half gallons of water and was still dehydrated.” In 2014, surgeons cut into his back and used a laser to break up and remove a large kidney stone that they said was caused by dehydration. That’s when Seitz vowed never to work on an RV production line again. “The money is good,” he says, but “it’s just so hard on your body.” A manufacturing revival was well under way in Elkhart by the time Trump began promising one during last year’s presidential campaign. During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the local unemployment rate hit 20 percent, among the highest in the country. It has since recovered to a seasonally unadjusted 1.9 percent, its lowest in nearly two decades and far better than the national rate, an adjusted 4.3 percent. The RV industry accounts for a big chunk of that improvement. Local officials estimate that half of jobs here are related to manufacturing and that half of those are linked to RVs. Today, Elkhart County and the surrounding region produce 85 percent of U.S.-made RVs. Unit sales last year were the highest since the 1970s. Judging by such numbers, times are good in Elkhart — not the sort of place to find those white, working-class voters who, feeling forgotten by the political class, helped propel Trump to the presidency. Trump Stronghold Yet, people here voted two-to-one for Trump, more so than even in deeply Republican Indiana as a whole. And a few months into the new administration, despite the investigations into alleged Russian involvement in the election, and despite the president’s failure so far to get much of the agenda he ran on enacted, support for Trump is strong among local workers, including many Reuters interviewed who stayed away from the polls last November. Seitz is one of the more recent converts. He didn’t vote in the November election. He says he wasn’t sure whom to believe. Now, he says, he would probably vote for Trump in the future. “He’s already living up this promise to bring work back from Mexico,” Seitz says. He and many other workers interviewed for this article don’t want more jobs like the ones readily available in Elkhart. They want jobs with steady, predictable pay for the long haul – the kinds of jobs that decades ago helped build and sustain a solid middle class in Elkhart and across the industrial Midwest. And they blame immigration and the forces of globalization for reshaping the work that is available. “I really think (Trump) can make America great again,” says Mary Swihart, 28, who voted for Trump. She works in an RV factory here owned by Thor Industries Inc (THO.N), the nation’s largest RV maker, where she earns about $15 an hour stringing wires into harnesses that go into the vehicles. She especially likes Trump’s pledges to halt illegal immigration and speed up deportations. Like many workers here, she believes that immigrants are willing to work for less than native-born workers and don’t complain as readily about bad conditions. “If we sent them back, it would mean more jobs for legal Americans,” she says. Elkhart County’s population is about 75 percent non-Hispanic white. About 30,000 Hispanics live in the county, according to Census data, forming a small but fast-growing community. Robert Warren, a former Census Bureau demographer who is now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies in New York, has estimated the number illegal immigrants in states and counties across the U.S. By his calculation, about 9,400 illegal immigrants, mostly from Mexico, live in Elkhart County, and of those illegal immigrants who work, 67 percent have some type of factory or production job. Officials at Thor and other local RV makers say they don’t pay immigrants less and don’t hire undocumented workers. “There’s no difference in pay,” says Jeffery Tryka, a Thor spokesman. “Every one of our workers is required to provide documentation that they’re here legally — so they’re all paid the same.” Water for Workers As for the work, Thor and other producers say their plants are safe, despite the hectic pace. “There’s no question it’s a physically demanding job,” Tryka says. Ken Julian, Thor’s vice president of administration and human resources, says the industry is constantly improving the ergonomics of assembly line jobs to make tasks easier and safer for employees of any age. To deal with the heat, he says, they also keep water or other drinks on hand, and “if we see a 100-degree heat index, we’ll shut the plant.” Industry executives say the bonus system is popular with workers, since it allows them to earn more money in less time. Attractive or not, jobs in the RV industry are emblematic of the kind of work that is increasingly the best option for blue-collar workers. The industry is prone to booms and busts, as wells as shorter-term fluctuations throughout the year, which can mean frequent layoffs, though that hasn’t been a problem amid the current production boom. The frenetic pace of piece work means many people stay at the best-paying assembly line jobs only for as long as they can stand it or until their health or stamina falters. When they no longer can, these workers often move into lower-paying jobs. That’s what Seitz did after his kidney-stone surgery. He now works in the service department at Jayco, an RV maker recently acquired by Thor. He figures he puts in about 48 hours a week, compared to the 35 hours he averaged on the assembly lines — and his weekly take-home pay is $500 less. But he much prefers working at his own pace and interacting with customers. His former employer, Forest River Inc, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Workers jump from job to job in search of better conditions or to maximize their earnings before the next downturn. At many RV factories, the annual turnover rate is 100% or higher – meaning a number equal to the total workforce or more is replaced each year. Much of the churn occurs as the companies struggle to fill the same lower-end, entry positions over and over again. Better Times RV workers are among the “anxiously employed,” says Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics in Fort Wayne.  Trump appealed to these workers by saying that “You’re working hard, but you’re still not doing as well as you’d like” and that there was a time in the past when their lives — and the jobs available to them — were better. That message resonated in Elkhart, once home to a more diverse industrial base that provided steady middle-class paychecks. Before it was the RV capital, Elkhart was known as the Band Instrument Capital of the World for the dozens of musical-instrument factories that operated here. Most of that work has moved to China. Elkhart also had a huge pharmaceuticals company. Miles Laboratories Inc invented the diabetic test strip here and once had Elkhart factories churning out everything from Flintstones vitamins to Alka-Seltzer tablets. Germany’s Bayer AG bought Miles in 1978 and eventually moved everything away. All that’s left is a roadside marker honoring the test strip. Stacy Curtis who use to work for Bincent Bach for twenty years making brass trombone slides poses for a portrait at her home in Elkhart, Indiana, U.S. June 13, 2017. Picture taken June 13, 2017.Joshua LottWhat’s happened in Elkhart has occurred across industrial America. The average wage on U.S. factory floors dropped below the average for all private-sector workers in 2006, and the gap has widened since. Manufacturing workers now earn an average of $20.79 an hour, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, below the $22 an hour for all workers. Service workers, meanwhile, pushed ahead of their factory-floor counterparts in 2008 and now earn an average of $21.79 an hour. A 2016 study by the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that a third of production workers in the U.S. earn so little that they qualify for some form of government assistance, such as food stamps. Many of these workers weren’t putting in enough hours to earn more, the study found, but about a third worked at least 35 hours a week. Stacy Curtis says she voted for Trump because she liked what he said about bringing back “good” jobs and for taking a hard line on immigration. Curtis dropped out of school at age 16 to work in a van-customization shop. She later landed a sought-after job at one of the town’s musical-instrument factories. It was a union job, with good pay, and it was prestigious for the skills needed to fashion thin metal into trumpets and trombones. In 2006, workers at Curtis’s factory went out on strike after the company, the Vincent Bach division of Conn-Selmer Inc, demanded changes in work rules that would allow it to pay lower wages to compete with Chinese rivals. The strike ended after three years, when workers severed their links to the United Auto Workers and accepted the company’s offer. Curtis didn’t go back to making trombones. 'You Hardly See Any Whites' As she sought factory jobs in recent years, always at far lower pay, she says she felt at a disadvantage because of her background. “You go look in these factories today and you hardly see any whites or Americans—they’re all Mexicans,” says Curtis, 54. Now unemployed, Curtis has applied for Social Security disability benefits, citing fibromyalgia and lupus. Sour attitudes about immigrants are part of a broader hostility to the forces of globalization that Trump’s campaign tapped into. And in the eyes of some people, comments like Curtis’s reflect a distinctly racial component to the Trump phenomenon in the Elkhart area. Tracy DeGraffreed, 48, is an African-American. He voted for Clinton in November. He has spent most his career in the RV business — many years for suppliers and, since 2015, running his own business as a trucker, towing RVs to dealerships. He says he understands why many of his white neighbors support Trump. “As an African-American, we’ve always been struggling,” he says. “But the Caucasians have always had what they wanted. Now they’re feeling the pain the others have always felt.” Slideshow (12 Images)That “pain,” he says, is the struggle for well-paid, secure jobs that were once relatively plentiful in Elkhart. “That’s why Trump won here.” Voters’ frustration was fueled in the middle of the campaign last year when two manufacturers with deep roots in Elkhart announced they were moving work abroad. CTS Corp, a maker of auto electronics that began here in 1896 as the Chicago Telephone Supply Co, said it was moving all of its Elkhart production abroad to “simplify” operations, cutting 230 jobs here and elsewhere in the U.S. Crown Audio, a subsidiary of Harman International Industries Inc that makes amplifiers, said it was moving 125 production jobs to Mexico and California in order to stay competitive. Over time, moves like that have left the local economy increasingly reliant on RV manufacturing. Each factory is typically dedicated to a handful of models. The result is a proliferation of workplaces. Thor, which had sales last year of $4.6 billion, operates 190 plants, most of them in or around Elkhart. The company’s complex on the outskirts of Goshen, down the road from Elkhart, has 30 separate plants sprawling out in a grid of metal buildings and parking lots. The factory buildings are more like workshops than the high-tech assembly lines used in the auto and other modern industries. The process is similar to home construction; workers hoist walls and install sinks as the RVs inch along while others crawl over, under and inside the vehicles. None of the plants are unionized and never have been. Nearly all of them pay by piece rate — something most other industries have abandoned. Workers receive a low base, about $10 an hour, and earn bonuses for hitting production targets.  At assembly plants that make the most expensive or in-demand models, workers can earn more than $60,000 a year when operations are humming. Less Tiring, Lower Pay Kirsten Southern, a 34-year-old mother of three, was paid by piece rate in successive jobs on RV production lines at two different companies. The work “tears your body down after a while,” she says. “A lot of bad things happen when piece rate comes into play, because you’re trying to rush to get things done,” she says. She was never injured on the job, she says, but she was constantly exhausted. She now works for lower pay as a receiving supervisor at an LCI Industries (LCII.N) plant in Goshen, making sure deliveries are accounted for and moved to the production line when needed. She has a fixed schedule, and she says she’s generally treated better. Had she voted last fall, she says, she would have voted for Trump. “I know Trump is for bringing the jobs back,” she says, “and I agree with that.” Piece rate pay fuels the hectic pace in the factories. That, workers say, has given rise to increased numbers of “speeders,” people who take methamphetamines and other stimulants on the job. Manufacturers say they enforce strict drug-free policies. Thor requires drug tests of job applicants and tests workers after accidents if drug use is suspected, says Julian, the Thor executive. Southern’s employer, LCI, is one of the industry players taking steps to try to make the work more appealing. Nick Fletcher, chief human resources officer, says when he arrived four years ago, turnover at the company was over 100 percent. It’s now less than 40 percent, and he expects it to continue falling. Fletcher has been on a campaign to end the piece rate system, which “doesn’t incentivize workers to be safe or produce high quality,” he says. More than 75 percent of the company’s workers are now on fixed hourly pay, averaging about $17.50, he says. Safety has improved, too. Fletcher points to a chart on his computer screen showing that the number of “recordable incidents” has fallen to 3.84 now from 6.22 in 2013. (Recordable incidents, a measure used by federal safety regulators, is the number of workplace injuries or illnesses that require more than basic first aid multiplied by 200,000 and then divided by number of hours worked.) The improvement is especially notable, Fletcher says, because it happened as LCI added 3,000 workers, for a total of 8,000. For the majority of RV factory workers, though, conditions remain much as they have been for years. Cassidy Davies jumped from one RV job to another earlier in his career, he says, because the atmosphere in many plants was unbearable. “I’ve seen people get into fist fights because somebody else used their power-drill battery,” says the 29-year-old. “And the money is constantly going up and down” as production rises and falls. He now works in a large Thor factory, which he says he likes better than any of the other places he worked. That doesn’t mean he thinks it’s the sort of job on which he can build a career. “I really don’t know how long I can do it,” he says, “because you’re beating the crap out of yourself every day.” Davies says he has never voted. “I don’t like the way Trump talks to people, the way he treats people,” he says. “But I do agree with some of the things he’s doing,” including Trump’s talk of bringing back good manufacturing jobs.

A new survey released June 20 from financial website LearnVest.com says that Americans take an average of six months to recover financially from a vacation. Additionally, 66 percent of the 1,000 people who responded to the survey in May said they spend more than on one month's rent or mortgage on a week-long vacation, a finding especially troubling to Alexa von Tobel, the founder and chief executive officer of LearnVest. Survey participants shelled out 10 percent of their annual income on vacations, on average. In fact, some 74 percent admitted to going into debt to pay for a vacation - with the average hole for a trip coming in at $1,108. Pushing reality aside and taking on more debt to go on a trip is a bad idea because it can impact the biggest vacation of all - retirement.   We all need a break, but there are much bigger things that matter,  says von Tobel, who is also a certified financial planner.  There are ways to avoid lingering debt from a vacation, starting with this four-step plan: 1. Pick the right card  Getting a new credit card might not sound like the recipe for smart spending, but strategizing your rewards forces you to plan months ahead for a trip.  If you start four or more months out, you could snag a travel rewards card with a hefty bonus of 50,000 miles, says Jill Gonzalez, senior analyst at Wallethub.com, a credit card information site. While you may not be able to use those miles for your summer trip because of black-out dates, you can store them for a future trip and benefit from other features of the card - such as no foreign transaction fees.  If you have existing debt, you can find balance transfer cards that offer a zero percent interest rate for up to 21 months. It is not the best financial scenario, Gonzalez admits, but  that buys you several more months.   2. Save ahead of time A view of the cove made famous in the movie  From here to Eternity  as seen from U.S. President Barack Obama's motorcade as it returns from Hanauma Bay, where he went snorkeling with family and friends, during his annual Christmas holiday vacation in Kailua, Hawaii, December 29, 2015.Hugh GentryIt should go without saying, but financing debt after the fact is a lot more costly than saving up ahead of time. Yet, given the number of people who go into debt to travel, the message does not seem to be getting through.  Tanner Callais, 32, makes sure he has the money in the bank before he sets sail. Callais and his wife, who run the cruise web site Cruzely.com, put money away each month in a separate savings account and do not plan trips until they have enough saved up.   Once I set it aside, it's set in stone,  Callais says.  Then I spend it, enjoy it, and it's on to think about the next one.  Von Tobel adds this pro tip: Automatically transfer out the excess in your checking account each month instead of  accidentally  saving by just leaving it in your main account.  3. Spend less on your trip Summer is a high-priced season, so you might want to consider shifting your schedule to an off-season to get discounts.  This is what Callais and his wife do for now, although school schedules loom since they have a one-year-old child.  When they go on a cruise, Callais also chooses the least luxurious accommodations, operating under the theory the room does not matter since most of the time is spent outside of it. He also chooses smaller ports like Galveston, Texas, with the big advantage going to departure points within driving distance.  4. Pay off debt smartly If you incur debt, try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Pay all the minimums at all times and then pay down the most expensive debt first, von Tobel advises.  Make a second payment in the middle of the month when you get a paycheck because credit card interest compounds daily and not monthly, von Tobel says.   It may only save you $10 or $15, but the point is that is extra money back in your pocket,  she adds.

Dmitry Shugaev, director of Russia's FSMTC agency, which oversees arms exports and imports, told reporters at the Paris Airshow that Russia saw continued demand for military aircraft, which account for 40 to 50 percent of its annual arms exports of around $15 billion. He said he expected Russia to maintain its spot as the second largest arms seller in the world behind the United States.  We are quite positive about the future,  Shugaev told reporters, speaking through an interpreter, although he said his agency did not foresee any major increases in arms exports in the next two to five years. Shugaev said Russia was focused on continuing to make its arms sales offerings more competitive by developing new technologies, adding more servicing and logistics contracts, and looking for opportunities for joint development projects. He said Russia was watching developments on the global market, where its traditional customers like India and Vietnam have become increasingly open to dealing with the United States.  We're living in the real world. We've witnessed the new trend,  Shugaev said.  We're taking it all into account, but we don't think there is a substantial shift in those markets.  China, Vietnam and other countries remained key strategic partners, despite their increasing interest in partnerships with other regions, Shugaev said. Asked if Russia's increased military presence in the Middle East opened up potential new markets there, Shugaev said Russia had long had business deals in the Middle East, including with the United Arab Emirates. He said Russian industry had adapted to sanctions imposed after Moscow's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 by, for instance, building an indigenous capacity to produce parts that had previously come from European firms. But he said European partners had told him privately that they were  really tired  of sanctions and they believed  it's not in our common interest that sanctions continue.  Despite that, he said Russian industry was continuing to export at a high level.  We are optimistic. It was not we who burned the bridges.

Germany's DAX hit a fresh record high on Tuesday, bolstered by another day of gains for tech and retail sectors. But euro zone blue chips eased to trade 0.1 percent lower while the regional STOXX index was down 0.3 percent, retreating from a two-week high. Europe's oil & gas sector fell nearly 2 percent with heavyweight majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP down 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively after oil price hit seven-month lows. The related mining sector also dropped 2.3 percent.  What we are starting to see is the enthusiasm in the oil price that was bred by the OPEC cuts ... diminish, and as that diminishes, people are once more paying attention (to) the fundamentals and the heavy oversupply that we're seeing on the oil market, and that's really causing some downside pressure,  Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments, said. Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index, the worst-performing major benchmark in Europe this year, fell 0.2 percent, hit by its heavy weighting on commodities stocks.  Investors across Europe are taking cue from the downside we're seeing in London and, looking at the quite heavily overbought conditions that we're seeing in Europe, are taking that as a cue to take some money off the table,  Charles Hanover Investments' Roy added. Aside from the slide in oil-related stocks, Germany's Prosiebensat 1 was a bright spot, after it sold its online travel agency Etraveli to CVC. Germany's benchmark DAX index touched a fresh record high before retreating 0.1 percent.  We are slightly surprised that the company did not sell a group of travel assets, but management suggests the rest of the travel portfolio remains under review,  they added. Groupe Eurotunnel, which runs Eurostar trains, fell more than 6 percent after suffering its second broker downgrade in as many weeks. Barclays cut the firm to a 'sell', citing slowing traffic and recent UK attacks which could impact tourism appetite. A downgrade from Credit Suisse sent business support services group DKSH down 3.8 percent. The Swiss broker said it expected the firm's growth rate to slow with downside risks including political uncertainty and demographic headwinds in Thailand weighing. Swedish real estate company Castellum fell 3.9 percent after pension fund AP2 sold the majority of its stake.

A new survey released June 20 from financial website LearnVest.com says that Americans take an average of six months to recover financially from a vacation. Additionally, 66 percent of the 1,000 people who responded to the survey in May said they spend more than on one month's rent or mortgage on a week-long vacation, a finding especially troubling to Alexa von Tobel, the founder and chief executive officer of LearnVest. Survey participants shelled out 10 percent of their annual income on vacations, on average. In fact, some 74 percent admitted to going into debt to pay for a vacation - with the average hole for a trip coming in at $1,108. Pushing reality aside and taking on more debt to go on a trip is a bad idea because it can impact the biggest vacation of all - retirement.   We all need a break, but there are much bigger things that matter,  says von Tobel, who is also a certified financial planner.  There are ways to avoid lingering debt from a vacation, starting with this four-step plan: 1. Pick the right card  Getting a new credit card might not sound like the recipe for smart spending, but strategizing your rewards forces you to plan months ahead for a trip.  If you start four or more months out, you could snag a travel rewards card with a hefty bonus of 50,000 miles, says Jill Gonzalez, senior analyst at Wallethub.com, a credit card information site. While you may not be able to use those miles for your summer trip because of black-out dates, you can store them for a future trip and benefit from other features of the card - such as no foreign transaction fees.  If you have existing debt, you can find balance transfer cards that offer a zero percent interest rate for up to 21 months. It is not the best financial scenario, Gonzalez admits, but  that buys you several more months.   2. Save ahead of time A view of the cove made famous in the movie  From here to Eternity  as seen from U.S. President Barack Obama's motorcade as it returns from Hanauma Bay, where he went snorkeling with family and friends, during his annual Christmas holiday vacation in Kailua, Hawaii, December 29, 2015.Hugh GentryIt should go without saying, but financing debt after the fact is a lot more costly than saving up ahead of time. Yet, given the number of people who go into debt to travel, the message does not seem to be getting through.  Tanner Callais, 32, makes sure he has the money in the bank before he sets sail. Callais and his wife, who run the cruise web site Cruzely.com, put money away each month in a separate savings account and do not plan trips until they have enough saved up.   Once I set it aside, it's set in stone,  Callais says.  Then I spend it, enjoy it, and it's on to think about the next one.  Von Tobel adds this pro tip: Automatically transfer out the excess in your checking account each month instead of  accidentally  saving by just leaving it in your main account.  3. Spend less on your trip Summer is a high-priced season, so you might want to consider shifting your schedule to an off-season to get discounts.  This is what Callais and his wife do for now, although school schedules loom since they have a one-year-old child.  When they go on a cruise, Callais also chooses the least luxurious accommodations, operating under the theory the room does not matter since most of the time is spent outside of it. He also chooses smaller ports like Galveston, Texas, with the big advantage going to departure points within driving distance.  4. Pay off debt smartly If you incur debt, try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Pay all the minimums at all times and then pay down the most expensive debt first, von Tobel advises.  Make a second payment in the middle of the month when you get a paycheck because credit card interest compounds daily and not monthly, von Tobel says.   It may only save you $10 or $15, but the point is that is extra money back in your pocket,  she adds.

Oil prices dropped after news of increases in supply by several key producers, a trend which has undermined attempts by OPEC and other producers to support the market through reduced output. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 1 percent in premarket trading. The S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Monday with tech stocks finding favor as investors appeared to regain confidence in the economy after upbeat comments from Federal Reserve officials. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise rates again. New York Fed head William Dudley said inflation was a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve. On Tuesday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making. Dow e-minis were down 5 points, or 0.02 percent, with 21,218 contracts changing hands at 8:41 a.m. ET (1241 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were down 2.25 points, or 0.09 percent, with 119,331 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 1.5 points, or 0.03 percent, on volume of 26,182 contracts. The S&P; technology sector is coming off two straight weeks of losses on worries about the sector's valuation and a move into more defensive sectors. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's 9.6 percent rally this year.  The sector which was held responsible for the pullback in equities in the last two weeks is driving indices to record highs,  said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM said.  Suddenly valuations are no longer a worrying factor, and Fed tightening is less of a concern. It seems like bargain hunters were waiting for the opportunity to dive in.  Among stocks, Lennar rose 2.9 percent to $54.30 after the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Chipotle fell 4.1 percent to $441.90 after the burrito chain said its operating costs in the second quarter will be slightly higher than the first quarter.

Japan's Nikkei had jumped to a near two-year high in Asian trading and European shares built on their biggest one-day gain in two months after a bounce in tech stocks drove Wall Street to record highs on Monday. But the dive in crude helped take the shine off those moves and left the main U.S. markets set to open roughly flat. Japan's yen, a refuge for investors whenever appetite for risk cools, recovered all of the day's losses to trade higher against the dollar and euro in response. Russia's rouble sank 1.5 percent.  The oil thing is big and it is feeding a little bit into the yen and is certainly being felt in the Russian rouble,  said head of Saxo Bank FX strategy John Hardy.  I think we are just waking up to risk appetite (being very elevated) at these levels.  After jitters on hi-tech stocks this month, investors are fairly confident that major central banks will not be tightening the flow of cash that has kept markets rising for eight years, at a time when growth globally looks solid. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, days after a meeting at which three colleagues on the bank's policy committee voted for higher rates, knocked half a percent off Britain's pound by saying now was  not the time  to hike borrowing costs. Similarly, in a speech late on Monday, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise rates again. That helped the Nikkei rack up gains of almost 1 percent and drove minimal gains for continental Europe's main indices. .  Companies are in aggregate in robust health, and with all the cash from quantitative easing still washing around the system, there is a lack of alternatives for investors to put their money in,  said Andy Sullivan, portfolio manager with GL Asset Management UK in London. Monday's rebound also cooled nerves over the technology sector after a second week of falls last week.  Hi-tech shares just went through a correction,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities.  Valuation is not that expensive, standing far below their levels at the peak of the dot-com bubble ... Given that their profits are expected to see exponential growth in coming years, it is premature to say the rally in hi-tech shares is over.

Francesca Bellettini, president and chief executive of the fashion house since September 2013, said the goal was to lift sales from 1.2 billion euros in 2016 to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the mid-term and 3 billion euros in the longer term. YSL also aims to raise its operating margin from 22 percent in 2016 to 25 percent mid-term, and 27 percent long-term.  This company was really a Ferrari. So we gave it the engine of a Ferrari and not the engine of a Cinquecento and now it will go as a Ferrari should go,  Bellettini told reporters at Yves Saint Laurent Investor Day. The company expects higher sales which will be spurred from a variety of measures including opening more stores, developing its eyewear, silk and jewelry categories, as well as more investment in digital businesses and travel retail. Other key moves have included giving more autonomy to the chief operating officers in each YSL division, and looking to focus more on local clients, who now make over 60 percent of the YSL brand's clientbase. Bellettini said YSL aimed to continue to outperform the broader luxury goods market, which Bain & Co expects will grow at an annual growth rate of 3-4 percent to reach 280 billion-290 billion euros in sales by 2020.

Belgian designer Anthony Vaccarello joined in April 2016, and he has sought to build on the success achieved under his predecessor, star designer Hedi Slimane. The YSL logo is seen on a Yves Saint Laurent product displayed at a perfume shop in Paris, November 15, 2013. For fashion houses, getting into skin care is more challenging than launching fragrances and make-up. Yves Saint Laurent's beauty business, owned by L'Oreal since 2008, launched an anti-ageing product last year which has had an encouraging start. The skin care line now makes up 8 percent of the brand's global beauty sales, which include perfume and make-up, according to Stephan Bezy, head of Yves Saint Laurent beauty products at L'Oreal.

To match Analysis LUXURY-SKINCARE/Christian Hartmann (FRANCE - Tags: BUSINESS FASHION HEALTH LOGO) - RTX15I8XSlimane, who had been at the brand's creative helm since 2012, had injected a more 'grungey' aesthetic to great commercial success to the iconic brand founded in 1961. Last year, YSL's revenues rose 25.5 percent on a comparable basis - its sixth consecutive year of above 20 percent growth - while recurring operating income jumped 59.3 percent. Western Europe acccounted for 38 percent of sales last year, Asia Pacific and North America 23 percent each, and Japan 9 percent. Bellettini said the plan was to increase the stores network to 200 from 159, opening 20 stores per year. In China alone, the number of stores could rise to 25-30 from 18. Overall, the YSL brand planned to spend 5 percent of its revenue on capital expenditures each year, said Bellettini, who added that YSL would also step up its E-Commerce push in order to capture more tech-savvy  Millennial  customers.

In a speech to London's banking community a day after Brexit talks started, Carney dashed any prospect that he might be close to joining the three BoE policymakers who last week unexpectedly voted to raise rates from their record low of 0.25 percent. Sterling plunged by three quarters of a cent against the dollar GBP= after Carney's remarks, and 10-year gilt yields GB10YT=RR dipped below 1 percent.  The BoE is juggling the tricky combination of rising prices caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since the June 2016 vote to leave the bloc, and slowing wage growth as the economy loses much of last year's impetus. The uncertain outcome of the Brexit talks is also expected to weigh on consumers and companies. Finance minister Philip Hammond told the same Mansion House audience that it was important to avoid a  cliff edge  when Britain quits the EU in 2019 and to have a transitional deal on trade before a full agreement is reached.  Carney said that if there was insufficient progress on this, businesses in Britain and other EU countries might soon start to activate their own Brexit contingency plans.  Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption,  he said. Stefan Wermuth Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU.  Before becoming Britain's foreign minister, Boris Johnson had dismissed the idea of trade-offs in the EU divorce process by saying his  policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it . Sterling dropped more than 10 percent after last summer's referendum vote, which Carney said reflected financial markets' dim view of Brexit's likely effect on the economy. Slideshow (3 Images)Sterling's weakness been a factor in consumer price inflation reaching its highest in nearly four years, contributing to a slowdown in consumer spending and lackluster first-quarter growth. Carney's concerns about the economic impact of Brexit added to  mixed signals  on consumer spending and business investment, as well as wage growth that remained  anemic  even with unemployment at its lowest for more than 40 years. A rate rise was not yet appropriate, Carney said.  Now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment,  he said.     In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to ... the reality of Brexit negotiations.  Carney underlined the importance of free trade - especially in financial services - and said the EU it would face greater costs if it tried to remove activities such as clearing euro-denominated derivatives from London. He also said that whether Britain's large current account deficit was sustainable remained an open question,  one whose answer depends crucially on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations .

His menu features hummus and moutabal - a smoky eggplant salad - and lamb and chicken dishes typically offered to guests at home, about 2,000 km away in war-torn Syria.  For one night this week, the young Syrian Kurd, who fled to Greece a year ago, showcased his cooking talent alongside a Greek chef in a packed Athens restaurant to mark World Refugee Day on June 20. Beyond giving diners in 13 European cities a taste of Middle Eastern and African cuisine, the French-born Refugee Food Festival, backed by the United Nations refugee agency, is hoping to promote integration.  In sweltering conditions, Younes and Greek head chef Fotis Fotinoglou barely have any room to move around as they frantically prepare a menu of 14 Greek and Syrian dishes in the cramped 1 meter x 2 meters kitchen. The menu includes dakos - a Greek barley rusk salad - tomato and zucchini fritters, Syrian freekeh - roasted durum wheat - as well as slow-cooked lamb shank and bulgur with chicken marinated in tahini, yoghurt, spices, and cumin.  There's cumin in everything!  Fotinoglou says.  You want garlic? Or onion? You want water?  he asks Younes, a gawky 25-year-old with slicked back hair who stared at him blankly.  They end up communicating with elaborate hand gestures to get by.    Syrian Kurd cook, Barshank Haj Younes 25, prepares a traditional Syrian dish during the Refugee Food Festival in Athens, Greece June 19, 2017.Beyond offering a brief respite from the daily grind of refugee life in Greece, Younes hopes the food will draw attention to the plight of the tens of thousands of refugees and migrants stranded in Greece.  (I want to) remind them that there are refugees here, there are still Syrians here,  Younes said.  And I want them to remember that there are Syrians everywhere who are in need.  Younes, who studied computer engineering, began experimenting in the kitchen five years ago, driven by necessity rather than a passion for food.  Slideshow (8 Images)In the early years of Syria's civil war, he fled the mainly Kurdish northeastern town of Amuda for Iraq, where he hoped to make enough money to pay for his journey to Europe. In hotels he worked first as a waiter, then as a cook. He arrived by boat from Turkey in March last year, a week after the European Union and Ankara enforced a deal to stem the refugee flight to Europe, cutting short his plans to travel north to Switzerland or the Netherlands.   At times I don't want to leave, because I really like the people here, they are very kind,  he said.  At other times I want to.  Whatever the future may bring, the message Fotinoglou wants to bring home is clear.   The circumstances which forced (the refugees) to leave behind their homeland, their home, their families, their birthplace -- it could happen to any one of us,  Fotinoglou said.  We're here today to say that in cooking, in the kitchen, there are no differences. We're all the same, we're all human,  he said.

Fitch has also affirmed Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited's (L&G; Re) IFS rating at 'A+.' Fitch has simultaneously affirmed L&G;'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'. The agency has also affirmed the senior unsecured debt issued by Legal & General Finance PLC and guaranteed by L&G; at 'A', and L&G;'s subordinated debt ratings at 'BBB+'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDR and IFS Ratings are Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect L&G;'s strong capitalisation, operational scale and market position as one of the leading UK life insurers. However, its concentration in the UK market is an offsetting factor, as is its high financial leverage. The company's diversification benefit from other markets is limited relative to peers in the 'AA' category. L&G;'s high capital buffer is a major positive rating factor, allowing the group to withstand volatile investment markets. The group's score on Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model (Prism FBM) is 'extremely strong' on end-2016 results and IFRS with-profits surplus of GBP0.7 billion (2015: GBP0.9 billion). We believe L&G; will be resilient to the negative effects of recent pension reforms on the UK annuity market, as it is a large group with a diverse product range. In particular, it has a market-leading bulk-purchase annuity business and the capability to take on more bulk annuities to fill the gap from reduced individual annuity sales. L&G;'s bulk annuity business is already larger than the group's individual annuity business and the company entered into a number of significant bulk deals during 2016, taking on business from Aegon and the Vickers Group pension scheme. Bulk annuities accounted for GBP6.6 billion of the GBP8.5 billion annuity premiums written by the group in 2016. L&G;'s earnings are well diversified by product type in the group's main market. In addition, L&G; owns one of the UK's leading asset managers, Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which adds to the group's earnings diversification and cash generation. In 2016, 19% of L&G;'s operating profit came from LGIM. L&G; generates around 11% of its profit internationally, predominantly in the US. L&G;'s net profitability grew steadily during 2011-2016, increasing to GBP1.3 billion from GBP0.7 billion. Fitch expects L&G; to maintain profitability around the current level, which supports the ratings. L&G;'s financial leverage was 30% at end-2016 and end-2015. This is high for the ratings and a negative rating driver. The group issued USD850 million and USD500 million of new debt in March and April 2017, and called GBP600 million of debt in May 2017. Fitch estimates that this will have increased L&G;'s financial leverage to around 33% on a pro-forma basis, but that leverage remains within our rating trigger and will decrease over time as the company grows. The group's fixed-charge coverage of 10x at end-2016 is in line with the ratings, and Fitch views the group's financial flexibility and liquidity as strong. Under our insurance rating methodology, we consider Banner Life and William Penn (together, Legal & General America (LGA)) as core to L&G; and therefore align their IFS ratings with that of Legal & General Assurance Society Ltd, the other core rated operating entity in the group. Their core status reflects their long ownership by L&G; their importance to L&G;'s growth strategy; and the diversification benefit for L&G; between mortality risk in LGA and the longevity risk in the UK business. It also factors in L&G;'s long history of direct capital funding to support LGA's growth; the material share of LGA in L&G;'s business; shared management between LGA and L&G; and consistency of branding. We consider L&G; Re, the group's Bermuda-based longevity reinsurance arm, as 'very important' to the group based on its alignment with the group's pensions de-risking strategy; shared management; and consistency of branding. We therefore set L&G; Re's IFS rating one notch lower than the core entities, at 'A+'. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded in the event of the group's Prism FBM score falling to low in the 'very strong' range, financial leverage increasing to 35% or interest cover decreasing to below 5x for a sustained period. Banner Life, William Penn and L&G; Re's ratings could also be downgraded if their profitability or market position deteriorates to such an extent that we view them as less important to L&G.; An upgrade is unlikely in the medium term, given the group's concentration in the UK market and high financial leverage for the ratings. However, over the long term, an increase in international diversification could lead to an upgrade.

Many cash-strapped Maasai have become landless after subdividing and selling swathes of land to the south of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, where they used to roam with their cattle.  Years of neglect and abuse is forcing them to trade in their birthright for survival,  opposition presidential candidate Raila Odinga told a news conference on Monday.  Jubilee has refused to enact proper laws to protect these community lands,  he said, referring to the ruling party of President Uhuru Kenyatta who hopes to retain power in elections on Aug. 8.  Last week, he called on non-Maasai communities to  remain  on their own land rather than buying up Maasai ancestral land around Kajiado, 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital, Nairobi.     Land has been one of the main drivers of conflict in Kenya since independence in 1963, with politicians whipping up historic grievances over land loss to incite their supporters to move away voters opposed to them, experts say.   Dozens have been killed and injured in Kenya's Laikipia region over the last year as armed herders searching for pasture have driven tens of thousands of cattle onto private farms and ranches from overgrazed communal land.  We urge the politicians to stop making disturbing comments on land,  Stephen Ambani, chairman of the Institution of Surveyors of Kenya, told a news conference on Tuesday.   Our history has shown us how dangerous it can be in rekindling anxiety, hatred, hostility and conflict among communities.       Privatization Much of Maasai-dominated Narok and Kajiado counties was made into group ranches, with shared title deeds, in the 1960s in an effort to better manage nomads' grazing lands. But mismanagement by elected committees, who often proved corrupt, led to the subdivision of land into individual title deeds, which have then been sold on, often to other ethnic groups.  The overemphasis on privatization of land, in the long term, it's going to be very bad,  said Hillary Ogina of the Kenya Land Alliance advocacy network.  Pastoralism, as a way of livelihood, is also valid,  he said, adding that herders require large, communally owned land to give the animals enough grazing.  With increasingly frequent droughts and population growth, it is becoming harder for nomads to continue their traditional way of life. Many young, educated Maasai are keen to sell their land and invest in businesses like hotels, Johnson Mali ole Kaunga, a Maasai activist told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  They end up buying vehicles, investing in things which don't last,  he said in a phone interview.   The best thing would actually be to maintain land as communal but if the community themselves are pushing for subdivision into private (titles), then it becomes a challenge.  Leaders should help the Maasai find alternatives to livestock as a source of income, he said. Odinga criticized the government for delays in implementing the 2016 Community Lands Act which lays out the steps for communities to acquire titles to their ancestral land. Around two-thirds of Kenya's land is customarily owned without formal title deeds, making it easy for some individuals to sell it without other community members' knowledge.      The government finalised the regulations to roll out the law last week and they should be approved by parliament in a couple of months, Peter Kahuho, secretary of the lands ministry, told a news conference on Monday.

Amazon plans to keep the natural grocer's high standards, Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey said, adding,  They’re not stupid enough to go change that.  The filing contained a transcript of a town hall meeting for Whole Foods employees. But Mackey, at the Friday town hall, said,  Over time, there could be other formats that evolve that - that might - wouldn't be branded Whole Foods Market, potentially, wouldn't be our standards.  The remarks offered a preview into how e-commerce giant Amazon might turn around the sluggish sales of Whole Foods since announcing on Friday it would buy the company for $13.7 billion, including debt. Industry observers have said that Amazon may add a selection of discounted, non-organic food to distance the chain from its  Whole Paycheck  nickname. Whole Foods already has a separate store, called 365, which offers private-label goods and lower prices than its typical formats. The company has needed to tread a fine line between introducing more conventional and affordable products, while maintaining the allure of a premium brand.  That’s their dilemma,  said Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group. Mackey is  being pulled both ways.  A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo AllegriThe Whole Foods chief said Amazon's technology will help the grocer transform from  class dunce  into  valedictorian.  Amazon, which made a splash last year with a checkout-free grocery store, has said it has no plans to automate the jobs of Whole Foods cashiers. Technology is just one way Amazon stands to change Whole Foods and its culture, though. File Photo - John Mackey speaks at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 2, 2016.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoAmazon's focus on frugality contrasts with Whole Foods, known to have higher costs than peer grocers.  It’s too early to talk about how benefits and compensation may synch up,  Mackey said of the topic, after jesting that Whole Foods employees will get free Amazon devices on merger day. And Amazon has plenty to learn about bricks-and-mortar grocery. Amazon's Worldwide Consumer chief, Jeff Wilke, said at the town hall that Whole Foods' healthier options helped change how people think about food. A misstatement about his breakfast, though - quinoa, blueberry  and some other vegetables  - became a joke.  Those aren't vegetables,  jested Mackey.  We're learning.

While Britain's economy is showing all kinds of strain -- as underlined starkly on Tuesday by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney -- the 19-member single currency area is more buoyant that it has been in years. This also was made clear on Tuesday with a bullish upgrade for German growth from one of its main economic research institutes, Ifo. Amusingly, Ifo's press release noted Germany's economy is  strong and stable , echoing British Prime Minister Theresa May's campaign mantra for a June 8 election which backfired on her by depriving her of a parliamentary majority. Instead of matching its stereotype of a lagging, moribund growth engine, the euro zone -- the EU's core -- is now being hailed as relatively dynamic. Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, noted as much late on Monday when his firm significantly upgraded its 2017 euro zone growth forecast to 2 percent from 1.7 percent, leaving it just a tad behind the United States.  Stronger incoming data, improving external demand and greater confidence that (European Central Bank policy) is gaining traction on activity have resulted in (our) upward revision,  he said. Britain, by contrast, was seen by Fitch growing 1.5 percent this year, down from 1.8 percent last year and 2.1 percent in pre-Brexit vote 2015. The fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum has pushed up inflation and hit consumer spending in Britain, taking it from being one of the fastest-growing economies among the Group of Seven nations in 2016 to its slowest in early 2017. The BoE's Carney in a speech on Tuesday made no bones about his view of the danger to Britain's economy from Brexit, saying firmly that now was not the time to raise interest rates even if inflation was at 2.9 percent. He also took at dig at leading Brexit advocate Boris Johnson, now foreign minister, who once said Britain could have its cake and eat it outside the EU.  Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption,  he said, then added:  Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU.  Europe Redux Some of Britain's woes will be based on uncertainty about what kind of Brexit it will have. The lucrative trade deals promised by Brexit advocates, for example, may well come but they are a long way off. There is appears little such uncertainty in the rest of Europe, however. In its latest forecast, Ifo said the upturn in the German economy that began in 2013 is becoming broader and gaining impetus -- a key for Europe as a whole given Germany's dominant economic role. [nL8N1JH1LV} It also indicated that it did not expect Germany to suffer from Brexit.  An exit plan should emerge early on without any major negative effects on the economic interdependence between the EU and Britain,  said Timo Wollmershaeuser, Ifo's head of economic research. But it is not all Germany. Spain said on Tuesday it planned to raise its 2017 GDP growth forecast upwards from the current 2.7 percent.

Novartis said the trials showed its RTH258 drug would reduce the injection burden for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the leading cause of vision loss for over 65s in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Novartis shares climbed 1.4 percent by 1041 GMT, outperforming the Stoxx European health care sector index , with analysts saying the trial results gave RTH258 a competitive advantage over rival treatments. Head-to-head late-stage trials showed RTH258, whose generic name is brolucizumab, worked as well as Regeneron's Eylea, with just over half the patients needing doses every 12 weeks, rather than every eight weeks for Eylea. Cutting the frequency of injections could also give RTH258 an edge over Lucentis, another best-selling eye drug which Roche sells in the United States and Novartis sells elsewhere. Lucentis patients generally receive doses every four weeks.  It's a positive study, we're very excited about it - it exceeds our expectations - and we're looking forward to filing in 2018  for regulatory approval, said Vas Narasimhan, Novartis's drug development chief, in an interview.  We had hoped to see 40 percent or greater  of patients responding positively to injections every 12 weeks, he said.  Now that we see it well into the 52 to 57 percent range, we feel very good about the result.  Novartis expects RTH258 sales to eventually top $1 billion a year. Analysts at Jefferies called the trial result  a significant differentiator and competitive advantage for RTH258 . They cited previous estimates that success in the trials could boost Novartis's earnings per share and valuation by about 2 percent in the medium term. Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said the data should help Novartis win back share in a highly lucrative market of 20 million to 25 million patients. Eylea, which was developed with Bayer, has powered much of Regeneron's growth since late 2011. However, the drug's sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, mainly due to competition from Lucentis. Lucentis topped $3.2 billion in sales in 2016 for Roche and Novartis. Regeneron is betting on two key treatments, sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis and Dupixent, to reduce its reliance on Eylea, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of its revenue. Competition for nAMD patients is likely to grow even more intense, with data from trials on Abicipar, an investigational medicine being developed by Allergan and Switzerland's Molecular Partners <MOL N.S>, set for release in 2018. Allergan is also banking on reduced injection frequency compared to Lucentis and Eylea to win over eye doctors and patients, should its drug win approval.

Two guards were wounded in the late Monday attack while the men were on their way to the Bagram military base, north of Kabul, the U.S. military said. Afghan officials said eight guards were killed and two wounded.  In the past, there were attacks on Bagram air base’s Afghan employees individually, but this is the first time that armed forces target them in a group,  said Bagram district governor Abdul Shukor Qodosi. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group had carried out the attack, which occurred about an hour before midnight on Monday in a village near the base. In November last year, an Afghan working at the Bagram base detonated a suicide bomb on the base, killing four Americans and wounding at least 17 people. Before that attack, there were more than 3,000 Afghans working at Bagram, a number that has since dropped by half to about 1,500, according to Qodosi. About 8,400 American troops are in Afghanistan, alongside more than 6,500 troops from allied countries, mostly to provide training and assistance to Afghan forces. Bagram also hosts a number of U.S. Air Force attack and cargo aircraft that provide air support for international and Afghan troops. Afghans form the outer security of most bases used by foreign forces in Afghanistan, and they often bear the brunt of insurgent attacks.  I offer our deepest condolences to the families, and friends of these brave Afghan citizens,  Brigadier General Patrick Donahoe, U.S. commander of Bagram Airfield, said in a statement.   We will always remember the sacrifice of these determined men and are forever grateful for their service.

The South Asian nation is carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest, while exports have been hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Punjab will waive loans to farmers with holdings of up to 5 acres (2 hectares) and debts of up to 200,000 rupees ($3,100), state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal told Reuters. About 975,000 farmers will be completely debt-free after the scheme is implemented. Punjab, a major producer of wheat and rice, will settle farmers' debts to the banks through annual budget provisions, he said.  Every year we will make a provision of about 20-30 billion rupees in the budget to pay to the banks, so that the entire loan is paid in five years,  Badal told Reuters. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances.  The economy is not just about state finances, we also have to take care that our farmers do not commit suicide,  Badal said in a telephone interview. To pay off the loans, Punjab is banking on a 14 percent rise in state revenues after the July 1 launch of a new national Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is also planning to cut some of its capital investments.  The total loan to be absorbed by the state would be around 80 billion-100 billion rupees ($1.24 billion-$1.55 billion),  he said. Earlier the western state of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in the north, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), agreed to forgive billions of dollars in farm loans. Punjab is one of a handful states ruled by the opposition Congress party. Economists at Merrill Lynch estimate that states will end up writing off debts equivalent to 2 percent of GDP - the bulk of all outstanding loans to farmers.

Banco Popular was taken over by Spain's biggest bank Banco Santander early in June when European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse.  The policy of institutions on where to deposit cash depends on the credit rating of the bank and that means that some institutional depositors withdrew their cash as a consequence of rating downgrades,  he said. Retail investors had also withdrawn money from the bank days before Santander agreed to buy Popular for the symbolic price of one euro, de Guindos said at a conference in the northern Spanish coastal city of Santander. On Monday, European Central Bank supervisor Daniele Nouy was questioned in the European Parliament's economic affairs committee over a withdrawal of deposits from Popular by local and regional authorities.  There is certainly room for the Spanish justice to investigate these movements to see whether insider information has helped certain people to try to protect themselves better,  Nouy said. Guindos said he did not know whether deposit withdrawals were due to account holders having privileged information on the bank's takeover by Santander. Separately, Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde reiterated on Tuesday that the bank's rescue had been due to a lack of liquidity and not a solvency problem.  The attack, the run, the flight of deposits which was seen in Popular was not due to depositors suddenly saying 'oh, there's a solvency problem, I'm leaving,'  Linde said during a hearing in parliament on the Spanish economy.

In particular, he said, the yield curve will be sensitive to the actions of policymakers when removing monetary accommodation.  Reach-for-yield behavior can make financial intermediaries and the economy more risky,  Rosengren said. He noted financial intermediaries will need to factor in the possibility of lower rates, particularly during economic downturns, and flatter yield curves. The Boston Fed chief did not mention the U.S. central bank's decision to raise rates last week or the U.S. economic outlook in his prepared remarks. Earlier, at the same conference, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer warned that while the United States and other countries have taken steps to make their housing finance systems stronger, more needs to be done to prevent a future crisis. Rosengren called on central bankers to factor financial stability into policymaking and in their regulatory supervision.  They have implications for monetary policy responsiveness to negative shocks,  he said.

They had just one: bathroom access.  The project construction was complete by then and the stations were ready,  said Reshmi Chandrathil Ravi, a spokeswoman for Kochi Metro Rail, a new network in the port city launched at the weekend by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  So we are now turning the big bathrooms for the differently-abled into all-gender bathrooms to be shared with the disabled,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The washroom signs have now been removed and sent for a fresh  inclusive design . And the company has allowed its transgender recruits to choose a male or female uniform. Kochi Metro Rail is the first government-owned company to recruit staff from the transgender community as part of Kerala state's initiative to give the marginalized group better access to job opportunities. Since India's Supreme Court gave transgender people  third gender  recognition in 2014, a growing number of Indian companies have actively hired transgender people and drafted policies to ensure they are not discriminated against in the workplace. India's 2011 census recorded half a million transgender people but campaigners estimate the number at about 2 million. Less than half are literate and even fewer have jobs, according to the census. Traditionally, transgender people in India have been confined to the margins of society. Male-to-female  hijras , the most visible group in the transgender community, feature in Hindu mythology and are seen as auspicious oddities whose blessings are sought at weddings and births. This popular perception of transgender people has meant they have struggled to find regular jobs, campaigners said. But attitudes are slowly starting to change.  At least 12 to 13 of our member companies already have all-gender bathrooms. This started happening since last year,  said Rashmi Vikram, senior manager with Community Business, a charity that supports firms seeking to be more socially inclusive.  Some companies have turned the disability restroom to all gender, all-abilities restroom, promoting it in a way that there is no stigma attached to it. It didn't require a big infrastructural change, but it sent out a positive message.  Buddies and Benefits A handful of firms have gone beyond ensuring bathroom access. Global technology firm ThoughtWorks hired a transgender person in its Bangalore office as part of a diversity initiative last year and went on to provide an office buddy and an external counselor to its new employee to smooth the settling-in period. And in a first, IBM - named as the world's most LGBT-inclusive company by Amsterdam-based Workplace Pride Foundation - will from this year cover gender affirmation surgery under its corporate health benefit plan, a spokeswoman for IBM India said. Another major Indian IT firm that opened a new campus in Mumbai last year ensured at the planning stage it would have a unisex bathroom following requests from transgender employees.  Some firms are also hand-holding transgender staff during the initial employment period and keeping their identities discreet on request, but campaigners say the trend is restricted to big companies. Many Challenges Nyra D'souza, a transgender woman, never took a bathroom break when she worked at a Mumbai outsourcing firm - uncomfortable in the men's washroom and not allowed in the women's facility.  It meant holding on for 15 hours before she reached home. At job interviews, she had been told to consider fashion, beauty or films for a job  where I could be myself . But when she was interviewed at Mumbai-headquartered Godrej - a leading Indian conglomerate with interests ranging from consumer goods to real estate - she was asked about her work experience, not gender. This, a Godrej spokeswoman said, was in tune with the company's policy to make all interactions gender-neutral.  Such experiences are limited only to big companies, not small,  said D'souza, who finds others from her community struggling to find jobs, or dignity in the workplace if they do. After the Supreme Court ruling, campaigners said more companies are coming forward to recruit transgender people, but are reluctant to make adaptations.  Over the past year, we have got nearly 15 requests from companies that wish to hire a transgender, but they retreat when I ask them about bathroom access,  said Koninika Roy of the Mumbai-based Humsafar Trust that works with the LGBT community and tries to match them with jobs.   The trust had one successful placement in the last year. But Solidarity Foundation, a Bangalore-based rights group that works with sexual minorities, had more success - it placed 15 transgender people over the last year.  Companies are becoming more open and talking about these issues, but integration is still not part of their DNA,  said Shubha Chacko, executive director of Solidarity Foundation. Chacko cited the case of a transgender person detained at the office gate by security guards on his first day at work.  The biggest challenge in India is the mindset. They connect transgender to people who beg on the streets, do sex work or sing at weddings,  said Vikram of Community Business.  We still have a long way to go. A lot more work needs to be done.

Daimler said in February that it will invest more than 250 million euros ($279 million) in the factory, contrasting with widespread wariness among international investors after a prolonged downturn brought on by sanctions and a collapse in global oil prices. But Russia's economy has recently shown signs of recovery, while its car market is returning to growth after four years of decline. Speaking at a ceremony to lay the factory's first stone, Markus Schaefer, a member of the divisional board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, said Daimler had made the decision after a  very, very successful conversation  with the Russian government. Moscow Regional Governor Andrey Vorobyov said President Vladimir Putin had personally signed off on the deal, allowing the regional government to offer unspecified conditions previously not available to foreign investors. Markus Schaefer, a member of the divisional board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, speaks at a new Mercedes-Benz plant's cornerstone laying ceremony in the town of Esipovo outside Moscow, Russia, June 20, 2017.Tatyana Makeyeva Ultimately, we want to build cars where customers are,  Schaefer said at the construction site in the town of Esipovo, 60 km (37 miles) from Moscow.  We are confident in the long-term potential of Russia.  Slideshow (3 Images)Global automakers had viewed Russia as a promising growth market until the 2014 sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine and the economic downturn prompted companies to put projects on hold. Car sales have more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million a year and U.S. auto giant General Motors (GM.N) quitthe market in 2015.  Though Mercedes' Russian car sales dropped 11 percent last year to 36,888, according to the Association of European Business (AEB) lobby group, Schaefer said he expects numbers to show an increase in 2017 and continue growing after the new plant opens in 2019. The company's Russian car sales in May jumped 8 percent year on year. The factory will employ more than 1,000 people working across a 85-hectare site to produce more than 20,000 Mercedes-Benz cars and SUVs a year. Hoping to benefit from a future rebound in Russian car sales, some international manufacturers have recently started to strengthen their presence in Russia. Germany's Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) announced projects last week to boost its VW and Skoda brands as well as commercial vehicles.

Activist investors, including Starboard Value LP, have put pressure on Parexel to explore a sale, arguing that the company's profit margins have consistently lagged those of its peers. Pamplona will pay $88.10 per share in cash for Parexel, representing a 5 percent premium to the stock's Monday close. Parexel's shares were trading at $87.67 before the bell, just shy of the offer price. The stock has jumped more than 20 percent since the first report of a potential sale appeared in May. Including debt, the deal is valued at $5 billion. Headquartered near Boston, Massachusetts, Parexel provides a range of services to the pharmaceutical industry, ranging from drug development and regulatory consulting to clinical pharmacology, clinical trials management and reimbursement. The company focuses on cancer drug research and has a platform for so-called  real-world  data, which can be used to assess the economic value of medicines and is sought after by drug makers looking to justify their prices to health insurers. Pamplona had been scouring the market in the last year, seeking to acquire a contract research organization. It made an unsuccessful bid earlier this year for Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC (PPD), a U.S. clinical trials firm valued at more than $9 billion. The contract research industry has been undergoing a wave of consolidation as pharmaceutical companies cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Deal-making also allows companies to profit from economies of scale, as they seek to boost their real-world data gathering capabilities. Last month, INC Research Holdings Inc (INCR.O) agreed to merge with inVentiv Health Inc in a $4.6 billion deal.

Monetary policy is less capable of offsetting negative shocks when rates are already low,  Rosengren said in a speech at a conference on macroprudential policy in Amsterdam jointly organized by the Dutch and Swedish central banks. In particular, he said, the yield curve will be sensitive to the actions of policymakers when removing monetary accommodation.  Reach-for-yield behavior can make financial intermediaries and the economy more risky,  Rosengren said. He noted financial intermediaries will need to factor in the possibility of lower rates, particularly during economic downturns, and flatter yield curves. The Boston Fed chief did not mention the U.S. central bank's decision to raise rates last week or the U.S. economic outlook in his prepared remarks. Earlier, at the same conference, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer warned that while the United States and other countries have taken steps to make their housing finance systems stronger, more needs to be done to prevent a future crisis. Rosengren called on central bankers to factor financial stability into policymaking and in their regulatory supervision.  They have implications for monetary policy responsiveness to negative shocks,  he said.

The South Asian nation is carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest, while exports have been hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Punjab will waive loans to farmers with holdings of up to 5 acres (2 hectares) and debts of up to 200,000 rupees ($3,100), state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal told Reuters. About 975,000 farmers will be completely debt-free after the scheme is implemented. Punjab, a major producer of wheat and rice, will settle farmers' debts to the banks through annual budget provisions, he said.  Every year we will make a provision of about 20-30 billion rupees in the budget to pay to the banks, so that the entire loan is paid in five years,  Badal told Reuters. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances.  The economy is not just about state finances, we also have to take care that our farmers do not commit suicide,  Badal said in a telephone interview. To pay off the loans, Punjab is banking on a 14 percent rise in state revenues after the July 1 launch of a new national Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is also planning to cut some of its capital investments.  The total loan to be absorbed by the state would be around 80 billion-100 billion rupees ($1.24 billion-$1.55 billion),  he said. Earlier the western state of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in the north, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), agreed to forgive billions of dollars in farm loans. Punjab is one of a handful states ruled by the opposition Congress party. Economists at Merrill Lynch estimate that states will end up writing off debts equivalent to 2 percent of GDP - the bulk of all outstanding loans to farmers.

OPEC's revenues from petroleum exports have fallen to just $446 billion in 2016 from $1.2 trillion in 2012 ( Annual Statistical Bulletin , OPEC, 2017).  But past experience strongly suggests OPEC's effort to stabilize oil inventories and prices while protecting its market share will fail. Since the beginning of the modern petroleum industry, periods of high prices and concern about supplies running out have alternated with episodes of low prices and oversupply. High prices and concerns about availability normally trigger an exploration boom and rapid innovations in drilling and production technology as well as efforts to use oil more efficiently. The resulting increase in production and a slowdown in consumption growth creates conditions for a subsequent slump. The basic narrative has not changed since the first oil well was drilled in 1859, with periods of oversupply (1900s, 1930s, 1950s and 1990s) alternating with panics about shortages (1910s, 1970s, 2000s). The current oversupply and slump in prices has its roots in the panic about peak oil and soaring prices in the middle of the last decade. High prices between 2004 and 2014 spurred an exploration boom around the world as well as the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques in the United States. At the same time, the cost of oil led to renewed interest among governments, businesses and consumers in greater oil efficiency and alternative energy technologies including renewables and electric vehicles. The slump which followed was inevitable as were the subsequent calls for more coordination among producers to cut output, reduce excess stocks and boost prices. A Shooting Party Every slump prompts calls for more coordination, restrictions on production and the stabilization of market shares ( Crude volatility: the history and the future of boom-bust oil prices , McNally, 2017). The most notorious was the secret agreement reached between Standard Oil of New Jersey (forerunner of Exxon), Royal Dutch-Shell and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (forerunner of BP) in September 1928. Walter Teagle, president of Standard Oil, John Cadman, chairman of Anglo-Persian, and Henri Deterding, managing director of Royal Dutch-Shell, met at Deterding's rented castle in the Highlands of Scotland. Afterwards, all Teagle would say was that  Sir John Cadman ... and myself were guests of Sir Henri Deterding and Lady Deterding at Achnacarry for the grouse shooting, and while the game was a primary object of the visit, the problem of the world's petroleum industry naturally came in for a great deal of discussion.  In fact the three men had reached a secret deal under which they would accept their current share of the oil market and not seek to increase it at the expense of the others. A draft, which seems to have been adopted without alterations, is reproduced in the official history of BP ( The History of the British Petroleum Company , Volume 2, Bamberg, 1994). The Achnacarry Agreement, also called the  As-Is  agreement because its attempted to stabilize the status quo, is worth studying because of the close parallels with the current situation in the oil market. Market Stabilization Fears about shortages during the World War One and subsequent worries about the depletion of U.S. oilfields in the post-war period had caused real oil prices to more than double from $15 per barrel in 1915 to $37 in 1920. The result was an exploration boom and a subsequent slump in prices, which had fallen to just $19 by 1923, and remained depressed through the rest of the decade, even before the onset of the Great Depression after 1929.  Since its inception the oil industry has looked forward with apprehension to the gradual depletion and final exhaustion of its supplies of crude oil,  the preamble to the Achnacarry Agreement explained.  The temporary shortage of supplies that existed in certain countries during the great war further accentuated this fear and caused vast sums of good money to be expended to locate and develop reserves in all parts of the world where petroleum potentialities appeared, as well as accumulating large reserve stocks above ground.   Now the situation has changed. An adequate supply for a long time to come is assured. This is the result of the application of science to the petroleum industry.   On the other hand, more effective methods of handling crude have been developed so that the yield of gasoline from a given amount of crude has been enormously increased.   Methods of consumption are being made more economical; high compression motors are being developed; diesel engines and fuel oil is being is being utilized more efficiently and economically.   All these developments will have a marked tendency to slow down the rate of increase in consumption,  the agreement warned.  Excessive competition  had resulted in tremendous overproduction, as each oil company  has tried to take care of its own over-production and tried to increase its sales at the expense of someone else . The result was  destructive rather than constructive competition . No company could hope to cure its overproduction by increasing its market share when all the others were attempting to do the same. The rational solution was a market-sharing agreement in which all three companies agreed to accept their share of the current market and a proportionate share of any future growth in oil demand. As-Is specifically excluded oil production and imports into the United States because any attempt to cartelize the U.S. market was prohibited by U.S. antitrust law. Standard Oil nonetheless organized the Standard Oil Export Corporation and the U.S. Export Petroleum Association in a bid to control U.S. exports of crude and refined fuels to the rest of the world. And the three companies sought to formulate guidelines for competition in other countries with the Memorandum for European Markets signed in 1930 and the Heads of Agreement for Distribution signed in 1932. Ultimately, however, the Achnacarry Agreement was a failure. Part of the reason was the Great Depression, which resulted in a slump in oil demand, just as the oil companies were trying to restrict supply. But the discovery of the super-giant East Texas field in 1930 sparked an uncontrolled drilling race and a flood of oil onto U.S. domestic markets and into exports. The Achnacarry companies also proved unable to stem the flow of cheap crude from Russian and Romanian producers, both outside the agreement, into European markets, where it captured their market share. Achnacarry Warning Achnacarry holds many lessons for OPEC. The shale boom and growth of non-OPEC supplies are a reaction to earlier fears about shortages and high prices just as the exploration boom of the 1920s was a response to earlier fears about field depletion. OPEC's ability to coordinate with U.S. oil producers is constrained by U.S. antitrust laws, similar to the loophole in the Achnacarry Agreement, but without their collaboration it will prove hard to stabilize market shares. And any effort to stabilize market shares and support prices risks being undermined by new supplies not covered by the agreement. OPEC faced a similar problem 50 years later when the sharp rise in real oil prices as a result of the two oil shocks in the 1970s led to a surge in supplies from non-OPEC producers. Increased output from the North Sea, Alaska, the Soviet Union and China cut OPEC's share of the global oil market from 51 percent in 1973 to 28 percent in 1985. OPEC never really managed to reverse the loss of its market share. Production from  high-cost  sources such as the North Sea and Alaska proved surprisingly resilient despite lower real oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s. Only the collapse in output from the former Soviet Union during the 1990s and the rapid growth of the East Asian Tiger economies in the 1990s and China's industrialization in 2000s restored the organization's fortunes. Efforts to stabilize the oil market have always failed because they cannot control the emergence of alternative supplies from rival suppliers and the reaction of consumers. OPEC is no more likely to succeed in containing the challenge from shale today than it was in dealing with the earlier challenge from the North Sea or the Achnacarry companies were in dealing with East Texas.

The 30-year-old laments the dire conditions in which he and his family live, though he admits it is one step above being thrown out on the street - a reality they all now face. Last month, the Atasehir district municipality served an eviction notice on the Dum family, who live in what are among the last dwellings of a formerly thriving Roma neighborhood in Turkey's largest city that has been all but eradicated.  It's not the first time the family have faced eviction. In 2006, their previous home - a more structurally sound cottage - and many of their neighbors' houses were demolished for redevelopment, even though the Dum family held documents which should have protected them. Uygun's late father, Yüksel, held a  reservation certificate  for the cottage. This was not a full title deed but a document affording the holder certain rights, including the 'right to buy the property prior to the initiation of any eviction or demolition procedures,'  the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) said in a letter to the Atasehir municipality.  They knocked the houses down without allowing anyone to collect their furniture,  Dum told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Dum's father built the flimsy hut where the family now live on the same block of land and filed a lawsuit against the municipality. But while legal wheels were still turning, the land was sold and his father and mother have since passed away.  Since they are going to knock it down, I'm going to gather my furniture and settle in front of the district governor's office,  Dum said defiantly.  City Limits The last decade in Istanbul has been defined by an unprecedented construction boom that has seen informal, shanty-town neighborhoods like Kucukbakkalkoy quickly replaced by apartment blocks built for higher income earners. Istanbul's Roma community, already marginalized in Turkish society, is one of the biggest losers in the gentrification process. Roma migrated west from India and first settled in the Sulukule district in the 11th century during Byzantine times, 400 years before Mehmet the Conqueror stormed through Constantinople's previously impenetrable walls. But in 2009, the historic Roma enclave of Sulukule was demolished, prompting an international outcry given the tumultuous history of the iconic neighborhood.  Uygun Dum and his family pose outside their home in Kucukbakkalkoy, Istanbul, on Jun 2, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Paul OsterlundNew apartments were built in the area that is now home to large numbers of middle-class Syrian refugees who pay high prices to live in a shoddy complex, built in 'Ottoman' architectural style.  The concept of 'urban transformation' began with Sulukule. Before 2006, it wasn't as well known (in Turkey),  said Hacer Foggo, an activist with the ERRC rights group who has known the Dum family for a decade. Activists and architects now view the destruction of Sulukule as a social disaster, uprooting more than 3,000 Roma whose ancestors had lived there for centuries. Demolitions to make way for redevelopment in the Roma neighborhoods of Sarıgöl and Hacıhüsrev have also displaced hundreds of families, as informal housing is replaced by tower blocks.  Vulnerable There are no exact figures of how many Roma live in Turkey although some experts believe there may be as many as five million.  By and large, they live in poverty, although activists say they endure less social discrimination than Roma communities in some European countries including Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Turkey, the government has attempted to tackle their marginalization. In 2010 then-Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan launched the  Roma initiative  in Istanbul which aimed to unite thousands of Roma from throughout Turkey. Erdoğan, now president, addressed the crowd saying:  From now on, your problems are my problems. Nobody in this country can be treated as 'half' a person.  As well as symbolic significance, his remarks prompted meetings at the ministries of labor and education, but with few concrete results. In 2015, Turkey's first Roma parliamentarian, Ozcan Purcu, said in an interview that promises made to move Roma out of tents and shacks and into proper housing were not kept.  There were some nice reports, but there are still problems regarding their execution,  said the ERRC's Foggo. Meanwhile, the Dum family try to survive by selling flowers in a kiosk next to their home, but the season has just ended and for now they collect rubbish for recycling while they wait for the growing season to resume.  Upbeat and welcoming despite their precarious situation, the family know they face an uphill legal battle.   We will fight on,  Uygun said resolutely.

S&P; currently rates China AA- with a negative outlook but its next move is being watched carefully after rival agency Moody's cut the world's number two economy by one notch last month due to its mounting debts and eroding fiscal strength.  The Chinese rating has a negative outlook, signalling that a downgrade is a real possibility,  S&P;'s top sovereign analyst, Moritz Kraemer, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum chatroom. He said the decision was likely to be determined by whether China is able to move away from a credit-driven growth strategy based on investment towards a more balanced and sustainable growth strategy driven by domestic consumption.  There has been some progress,  Kraemer added,  but so far it has been fairly slow.  He said S&P;'s positive outlook on Russia's BB+ rating remained  justified  for now. However  any renewed deepening of geopolitical risks could diminish the chances of an upgrade.  This is because the consequences of, for example, a tightening sanctions regime might choke off the recovery of the Russian economy with fiscal but also potential political risks.

The British pound fell almost a cent against its U.S. counterpart after BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise UK interest rates. Last week three BoE policymakers had voted in favour of a hike. But Carney warned of weak wage growth and a likely hit to incomes as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, sending sterling to a one-week low of $1.2661. Conversely, New York Fed President William Dudley said on Monday that tightening in the U.S. labour market should help drive up inflation, reinforcing the message that a recent patch of weak data is unlikely to derail plans to keep raising interest rates, after two hikes so far this year. The dollar index - which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, including sterling - climbed to 97.648 , its highest since the end of May.  Although Dudley displayed optimism over the health of the US economy, I feel the macro-fundamentals from the States need to display ongoing signs of stability before investors adopt a similar school of thought,  said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga, in Cyprus. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise interest rates again, but this appeared to have little negative effect on the dollar.  Bill Dudley commonly represents the majority view on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) - this is the main reason why the dollar is appreciating,  said Commerzbank strategist Thu Lan Nguyen, in Frankfurt.  Evans was more dovish but he's known to be dovish.  Investors are now pricing in around a 50 percent chance that rates will be raised again by the end of the year, according to CME FedWatch. Against the yen, the dollar rose to as high as 111.90 , its strongest level since May 26. That marked a gain of almost 3 percent from the dollar's near 2-month low of 108.81 yen set on June 14. The greenback has edged higher since the Fed on June 14 raised interest rates for a second time in 2017 and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities later this year, while indicating that a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory. The dollar may see further gains against the yen, especially after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week indicated the BOJ would be in no hurry to dial back its massive stimulus programme, said Tan Teck Leng, forex analyst for UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. The euro was flat at $1.1144, close to a three-week low.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) aims to promote the domestic derivatives industry by loosening regulations that restrict how commercial banks, insurance companies and pension funds invest in commodity futures, Fang Xinghai, the commission's vice chairman, said on June 17. Fang, who was speaking at a financial forum in Qingdao, didn't give further details of the proposal, but it seems to fit into recent moves by the authorities in Beijing to promote commodity trading and become more of a player in global markets. The positive news out of the CSRC's announcement is that China seems to be getting serious about opening up its markets and encouraging a broader range of participation. Several commodity contracts have taken off in recent years, such as iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE). But these have often been criticised as more like legal casinos for day-trading retail investors rather than offering price discovery or viable hedging for market participants. As part of efforts to boost commodity trading, China's three major exchanges, the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and the DCE, are planning to boost the number of commodities that can be traded. Contracts for certain fruits, chemicals and electricity are among those being considered, adding to an already considerable array of contracts for commodities that would be considered somewhat obscure in Western markets, such as bitumen and silicomanganese. But while expanding the amount of commodities being offered and boosting the number and type of investors allowed to participate in the markets sounds promising, it's not straightforward. Trust Deficit If there is one thing investors have learnt about the authorities in Beijing is that they aren't afraid to intervene in what are supposed to be free markets if they don't like the price movements and volatility. On several occasions last year, the authorities took steps to crack down on trading in then hot commodities such as iron ore, steel and coal. Measures included increasing margins to be held against positions and boosting the cost of trading on the exchanges. These steps did have some impact on cooling commodity trading last year, but probably not to the extent that the authorities wanted. The problem for investors in Chinese commodity exchanges is that they can never be certain as to when, and how, the authorities will act to clamp down on trading. Allowing financial institutions to trade in commodities may smooth out some of the volatility, assuming they adopt longer-term positions based on expectations of supply and demand fundamentals. But if these investors choose to act more like hedge funds in taking large positions in order to drive the market in their preferred direction, it will boost volatility and undermine the use of Chinese commodity exchanges as a hedging tool. As the world's biggest producer, consumer and importer of commodities, China should have well-developed and open futures exchanges. But simply loosening regulations to allow for greater participation doesn't address the underlying problem in China, namely the uncertainty of government interference and the trust deficit this causes. To be truly effective, China's commodity contracts would also have to be fully open to foreign traders, something that isn't currently the case. But for foreigners to participate, regulatory certainty becomes essential, meaning Beijing must curb its inclination to intervene in the markets if it sees developments it doesn't like. It's this problem that has so far prevented China from setting up a crude oil futures contract, which would be aimed at capturing a chunk of the global trade in this key commodity. The struggles of China, the world's biggest importer of crude oil, to launch a viable futures contract covering the fuel shows just how far the country still has to travel in its ambition to become a global commodity hub.

If successful, Apple's attack would undermine a core tenet of Qualcomm's business model. Apple sued San Diego-based Qualcomm in January, saying the chip maker improperly withheld $1 billion in rebates because Apple helped Korean regulators investigate Qualcomm. Apple's initial lawsuit was a relatively narrow one focused on whether it violated a contract with Qualcomm by helping regulators that were investigating Qualcomm's business practices. But the new filing expands Apple's claims and seeks to stop Qualcomm's longstanding business model using a legal theory based on a ruling last month. The U.S. Supreme Court made it harder for manufacturers and drug companies to control how their products are used or resold, ruling in May against printer company Lexmark International Inc in a patent dispute over another company's resale of its used ink cartridges. In a Tuesday brief seen by Reuters, Apple took aim at Qualcomm's practice of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before purchasing chips, known in the industry as  no license, no chips . The license allows Qualcomm to take a percentage of the overall selling price for iPhone in exchange for supplying the modem chips that let phones connect to cellular data networks. Apple argued that the ruling involving Lexmark showed that Qualcomm was entitled to only  one reward  for its intellectual property and products. Qualcomm should be allowed to charge for either a patent license or a chip, but not both, Apple argued. Apple wants to be able to buy chips without signing the license agreement that forces it to pay a part of the overall iPhone sale price. Apple also asked the court to stop lawsuits that Qualcomm had filed against Foxconn Technology Group and three other contract makers that assemble the iPhone on Apple's behalf and are the formal buyers of Qualcomm's chip, as is standard in the electronics industry. Apple argued that the court fight should be between Apple and Qualcomm.

Brown's Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the  Autopilot  mode and he was killed. A Tesla Inc spokeswoman Keely Sulprizio declined to comment on the NTSB report. In 2016, the company said Autopilot  does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility,  however. Brown family lawyer Jack Landskroner said in an email the NTSB's findings should put to rest previous media reports that Brown was watching a movie at the time of the crash, which he called  unequivocally false.  He added that the family has not taken any legal action against Tesla and was still reviewing the NTSB report. The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. During a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the wheel, he apparently did so for just 25 seconds, the NTSB said in the report. The report said the Autopilot mode remained on during most of his trip and that it gave him to a visual warning seven separate times that said  Hands Required Not Detected.  In six cases, the system then sounded a chime before it returned to  Hands Required Detected  for one to three second periods. Tesla in September unveiled improvements in Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death. The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot order recalls. In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had found no evidence of defects in the aftermath of Brown's death. NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles (119 km) per hour less than two minutes before the crash -- above the 65 mph speed limit. The agency said the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds before impact. Brown  took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision,  the report said. A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said the truck driver was charged with a right of way traffic violation. He is due for a court hearing on Wednesday. The NTSB report disclosed that the Tesla Model S uses a proprietary system to record a vehicle's speed and other data, which authorities cannot access with the commercial tools used to access information from event data recorders in most other cars. For that reason, the NTSB said it  had to rely on Tesla to provide the data in engineering units using proprietary manufacturer software.

Nabra Hassanen, 17, was attacked early on Sunday in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles (50 km) west of Washington, after attending late-night prayers for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when many Muslims fast from dawn until sunset. Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, of Sterling, has been arrested and charged with murder in the incident that began with a road dispute with a boy on a bicycle who was among a group of teenagers that included Hassanen, Fairfax County police spokeswoman Julie Parker said.  It appears that the suspect became so enraged over this traffic argument that it escalated into deadly violence,  she told a news conference. Parker said there was no indication the attack near the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque was motivated by race or religion. Police said there was no sign that Martinez used racial slurs during the attack. Sharon Bulova, chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, expressed solidarity with the Muslim center and said a prayer vigil would held on Wednesday at a high school.

Courtesy Fairfax County Police Dept./Handout via REUTERS With regard to this case, I am confident justice will be served,  she said at the news conference. The attack took place about 3:40 a.m. as up to 15 teenagers who had attended prayer services at the mosque were returning from a fast-food restaurant, Parker said. Some of the teenagers were in the road and Martinez began arguing with the boy on a bicycle as he was driving in his car, Parker said. Martinez chased the youths into a parking lot, emerged from his car with a baseball bat, and struck Hassanen, she said. He loaded Hassanen into his car and dumped her in a pond in neighboring Loudoun County, Parker said. A search team recovered the body on Sunday, and an autopsy showed she had suffered blunt force trauma to the upper body, she added. The Washington Post reported that Hassanen and her friends were dressed in abayas, the robe-like dress worn by some Muslim women, prompting fears the victim was targeted because she was Muslim.

The Outlook on both is Stable. TTK's senior unsecured debt has been affirmed at 'B+'/ 'RR4'. The Short-Term IDR is affirmed at 'B'. TTK runs a large-capacity fibre backbone network laid along Russian railways. It operates under an asset-light business model and leases its core fibre network from its 100% shareholder Russian Railways (RZD) (BBB-/Stable). TTK holds established positions in the inter-operator segment, and has developed a sufficiently large end-user broadband franchise, holding approximately 5% of the all-Russia subscriber market share. The company is likely to manage its leverage at slightly below 3x net debt/EBITDA, corresponding to below 4x FFO adjusted net leverage, in line with the leverage policy of its controlling shareholder RZD. KEY RATING DRIVERS Large and Underutilised Network; The company benefits from running a large backbone network laid along the railways throughout Russia. Control over this extensive infrastructure positions TTK as a strong wholesale operator, but also allows it to offer a competitive broadband service in its covered territories. The network remains underutilised which allows it to keep capex at a relatively low level, at below 15% of revenues, but also to seek new monetisation opportunities. Focus on Monetisation: The company's strategy is focused on a more efficient use of its existing asset base and a search for new growth areas. We understand that TTK is likely to refrain from committing itself to large-scale investment projects without clear payback. The entry into new markets entails substantial execution risks, but the chosen strategy, in our view, protects against overinvestment and spikes in leverage. It may also help mitigate the impact of shrinking revenues in the over-competitive wholesale segment and rapidly slowing retail broadband segment. The management is keen to explore entry into new segments such as the internet of things, MVNO operations, captive projects with shareholder RZD, and new end-to-end wholesale services for smaller operators on the existing telecoms infrastructure. We believe that opening TTK's infrastructure to other telecom players may be value-accretive, and that it will not be cannibalistic in view of the company's relatively small retail franchise. However, with the likely exception of synergistic projects with RZD, business models in the new segments remain unproven while the visibility on their financial performance is low. Traditional Wholesale Under Pressure: TTK's traditional wholesale segment will remain the core cash-generating unit for the company, supported by sizeable indefeasible rights of use (IRU) contributions. However, the segment is in long-term decline, as a result of falling voice traffic and the continuing build-out of own infrastructure by large telecoms operators. The company's long network with connections to Russia's European and Asian neighbouring countries provides opportunities for recurring IRU proceeds from international operators, at least in the short to medium term. Stagnating Broadband: We believe TTK's growth in its retail broadband segment is likely to stagnate, due to significant average revenue per user (ARPU) and revenue pressures on the back of promotions in 2016. The subscriber take-up of broadband service in its covered territories remains lower than for peers, in the low 20% territory, suggesting modest opportunities for further subscriber and revenue growth, but also margin improvement in the medium term. Growth will be supported by the launch of pay-TV in March 2017. Stable Leverage: We believe TTK is likely to manage its leverage at slightly below 3x net debt/EBITDA and 4x FFO adjusted net leverage. This is in line with the targeted leverage of its shareholder RZD, which is comfortable with leverage of 2.5x net debt/EBITDA under Russian Accounting Standards (RAS) both at the group level, but also for key operating subsidiaries. Differences under RAS and IFRS reporting (including due to early recognition of IRU revenues under RAS) result in leverage under IFRS being approximately 0.4x higher than under RAS. We expect TTK to remain FCF positive on a pre-dividend basis, with free cash either spent on new projects as capex or returned to the shareholder, instead of further significant debt reduction. Relationship With Shareholder: Fitch rates TTK on a standalone basis. Legal ties are weak between TTK and its parent RZD as the latter does not guarantee TTK's debt. Owning a telecoms company is not strategic for a railway operator. However, operating ties are strong and RZD is likely to retain control over TTK in the medium term at least. We therefore assume that TTK should be able to continue leasing dark fibre from its shareholder on non-discriminatory terms. DERIVATION SUMMARY The company ratings' benefit from the established positions in the inter-operator segment and an improved position in the broadband segment as the fifth-largest operator in Russia with an approximately 5% subscriber market share. Compared to Russian mobile operators and Rostelecom, the company has smaller scale and a weaker competitive position in the residential segment. Its wholesale segment is intrinsically more volatile than retail revenues. TTK operates under an asset-light model business model which is a constraining factor for the ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - low single-digit revenue decline in 2017 and largely flat revenue in 2018-2020; - EBITDA margin at above 21% in 2017 and gradually improving in 2018-2020; - capex at below 12% of revenue in 2017 growing to 14% in 2018-2020; - progressively increasing dividends in 2018-2020; - around RUB0.4 billion of recurring cash proceeds from IRUs per year included in FFO in 2017-2020; - buyout of some minority interests in 2017; -given our understanding of the business and its peers, our recovery analysis assumes a post-restructuring EBITDA of RUB4.45 billion and a distressed EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.0x. Recovery prospects for the RUB16.2 billion senior unsecured debt are good, but the Recovery Rating of 'RR4' is limited by a soft cap due to country considerations. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Stable broadband performance and less volatility in the interoperator segment coupled with sustainably positive FCF generation and leverage at below 3x FFO adjusted net leverage (broadly corresponding to 2x net Debt/EBITDA) may lead to an upgrade. - A pre-requisite for a positive rating action is a comfortable liquidity position with a short-term liquidity score of at least above 1x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Pressures in the interoperator segment, but also broadband underperformance and weak financial results of new projects leading to a sustained rise in leverage to above 4.0x FFO adjusted net leverage (broadly corresponding to above 3x net debt/EBITDA) without a clear path for deleveraging will likely lead to a downgrade. - Liquidity and refinancing pressures may also be negative. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: TTK's liquidity is comfortable with RUB9 billion of credit lines with Russian banks covering RUB6.3 billion of short-term debt maturities at end-2016.

The Serious Fraud Office has charged Barclays and four former employees in connection with the £11.5 billion of capital it raised in 2008 from investors including the Qatari government. The charges of false representation and unlawful financial assistance are the first to have been brought against a major UK bank and its former bosses. In the intervening decade Barclays – and the world – have moved on. The British lender and its former employees, including ex-chief executive John Varley and former senior bankers Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath, will now present their case, starting with a hearing on July 3. Individuals could face prison if found guilty. Barclays itself could end up with fines along the lines of those that retailer Tesco and engine maker Rolls-Royce agreed with the SFO earlier this year. The stain on the bank’s history apart, the main impact on Barclays is the potential financial cost, and a drain on current Chief Executive Jes Staley’s time. Aside from any fines that may result from the SFO’s action, the lender faces potential civil cases including a $1 billion suit from financier Amanda Staveley, and an unfair dismissal case from Boath. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice, and Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, are also still investigating. Though it’s important that justice is seen to be done, authorities are edging towards answering questions nobody is asking anymore. Barclays has had three chief executives since Varley, and has conducted a wide-ranging review of its culture. Investors and regulators probably fret more about present risks, like whether Barclays can pass U.S. stress tests, or how to field Staley’s clumsy misfires, such as his attempt to unmask a whistleblower. The verdict also won’t change the fact that Barclays has benefited from avoiding an injection of UK government capital in 2008. Since then, the bank’s shares have delivered investors a total return of more than 70 percent, compared with around 20 percent for the part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group and heavy losses for investors in Royal Bank of Scotland, which still labours under state control. The SFO may be closing a chapter in financial history, but investors are already onto the next volume.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States. If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors. This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale. Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil. Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.   It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.  The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',  said Kuhach.  It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk.   Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy (SU.TO) at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.  Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil (IMO.TO), controlled by ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said. The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital. The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in. Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.     The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Statoil ASA (STL.OL) from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.     Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO), which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially. Dating and Marriage The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure. Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail. Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy (NBL.N) and Devon Energy (DVN.N) and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment. Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.  Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,  he said.  The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money.   Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later. The company is supported by GE's (GE.N) Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada. Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.  At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,  Reed said.  But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial.    Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions. 'Incremental Gains' Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd. Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices CLc1 of around $45 a barrel. Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more. The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D;), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.  It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,  Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate. Suncor and Imperial both held R&D; spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls  step-change technologies , while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed. The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D; budgets. A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations. Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.  Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance. Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in  technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.  I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,  he said.  Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home.

Merkel also said the talks were important for the future of European integration. Brexit was a setback but election results in the Netherlands and France this year have presented an opportunity for the EU to push ahead, she added.  The risk of the exit negotiations with Britain is that we do not take adequate care of our own future. Let's stay together, let's not divide from each other,  she said with reference to the remaining EU 27 and the 19 euro zone countries.   This is not just about the exit of Britain, with which we want to remain friends, with which we want to live in a good partnership, but it is also about the future of the European Union,  she said at a German industry conference.  The four freedoms that give us the internal market must not be jeopardised,  she said with reference to the EU's freedoms of movement of goods, capital, people, and services.  This will be significant at the exit negotiations.  Merkel said she wanted the talks to be conducted  in a good spirit  and that Britain's position would become evident in the coming months.  We will of course implement what Britain pitches, but in a way that the interests of the 27 member states are safeguarded.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel leaves the German Industry Day, hosted by the BDI industry association, in Berlin, Germany, June 20, 2017.Hannibal HanschkeMartin Schulz, the Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor candidate who Merkel will square up against in her bid to win a fourth term in September's election, told the same conference:  The best result of the Brexit negotiations would be - there wouldn't be a Brexit.  At their first meeting in Brussels on Monday, British and EU negotiators agreed on a timetable for the Brexit talks. Both sides stressed their goodwill but acknowledged the task's huge complexity and tight deadline. Almost a year to the day since Britons voted in a referendum to quit the EU, the Brexit strategy debate within the UK government has intensified since Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority in a snap parliamentary election on June 8.  She had called the early vote herself, saying it was to strengthen her mandate in the Brexit talks.  Merkel also said she was open to the idea of a joint finance minister for the euro zone, and a common budget for the currency union.  Of course one can think about a common finance minister if the conditions are in place and if we do not mutualize in the wrong areas,  she said. Germany has resisted the idea of introducing so-called Eurobonds, which could allow euro zone countries to issue debt jointly, with some benefiting from lower risk premia thanks to Germany's creditworthiness.  One can indeed consider a European budget if it is clear that structures are really strengthened and this is used to sensible ends,  Merkel added.

The energy firm said the capital raising will be done as a public offer for shares through a book building process to help price discovery. It has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Nigerian Stock Exchange for approval. Forte said its core investor, Zenon Petroleum and Gas Limited, owned by billionaire Femi Otedola, with a total stake of 78.08 percent in the company, will not participate in the offer, it said in an email to Reuters. Nigerian companies are going through a tough time brought on by low oil prices which tipped the economy into a recession, depleted the country's foreign reserves, weakened the currency and caused chronic dollar shortages, frustrating businesses. Several firms including Guinness Nigeria, reported losses last year due to the weak economy, and are set to raise funds from existing shareholders. In 2016, Forte posted a 24 percent fall in pretax profit, which knocked it shares down 74.4 percent. This year, the shares have fallen 34.2 percent, giving it a market value of 68.8 billion naira ($226 mln). It ended 4.98 percent down to 52.81 naira on Monday, underperforming the main index which gained 0.96 percent. On Monday Forte said it was on track to achieve its target for 2017 and that based on its performance so far it could payout half of its earnings as dividend. It said its fuel distribution and power business accounted for 95 percent of its operating profit and that it hoped to announce its half-year audited account before July 31.  The outlook remains positive on the back of the renewed peace in the Niger Delta ... while the passing of the (oil industry governance bill) by the Senate is another positive,  it said. Last year the energy firm planned to raise 100 billion naira in debt or equity for expansion. It later sold 9 billion naira in five-year bonds. Nigeria's IPO market has dried up for almost a decade following a stock market crisis with regulators struggling to revive it. In March, the SEC proposed to cut listing fees to attract issuers. Last year, stocks shed 40 percent in dollar terms after the naira fell by a third due to central bank's currency curbs. This year, stocks have recovered after the bank in April allowed investors to trade the naira at market rates.

They had just one: bathroom access.  The project construction was complete by then and the stations were ready,  said Reshmi Chandrathil Ravi, a spokeswoman for Kochi Metro Rail, a new network in the port city launched at the weekend by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  So we are now turning the big bathrooms for the differently-abled into all-gender bathrooms to be shared with the disabled,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The washroom signs have now been removed and sent for a fresh  inclusive design . And the company has allowed its transgender recruits to choose a male or female uniform. Kochi Metro Rail is the first government-owned company to recruit staff from the transgender community as part of Kerala state's initiative to give the marginalized group better access to job opportunities. Since India's Supreme Court gave transgender people  third gender  recognition in 2014, a growing number of Indian companies have actively hired transgender people and drafted policies to ensure they are not discriminated against in the workplace. India's 2011 census recorded half a million transgender people but campaigners estimate the number at about 2 million. Less than half are literate and even fewer have jobs, according to the census. Traditionally, transgender people in India have been confined to the margins of society. Male-to-female  hijras , the most visible group in the transgender community, feature in Hindu mythology and are seen as auspicious oddities whose blessings are sought at weddings and births. This popular perception of transgender people has meant they have struggled to find regular jobs, campaigners said. But attitudes are slowly starting to change.  At least 12 to 13 of our member companies already have all-gender bathrooms. This started happening since last year,  said Rashmi Vikram, senior manager with Community Business, a charity that supports firms seeking to be more socially inclusive.  Some companies have turned the disability restroom to all gender, all-abilities restroom, promoting it in a way that there is no stigma attached to it. It didn't require a big infrastructural change, but it sent out a positive message.  Buddies and Benefits A handful of firms have gone beyond ensuring bathroom access. Global technology firm ThoughtWorks hired a transgender person in its Bangalore office as part of a diversity initiative last year and went on to provide an office buddy and an external counselor to its new employee to smooth the settling-in period. And in a first, IBM - named as the world's most LGBT-inclusive company by Amsterdam-based Workplace Pride Foundation - will from this year cover gender affirmation surgery under its corporate health benefit plan, a spokeswoman for IBM India said. Another major Indian IT firm that opened a new campus in Mumbai last year ensured at the planning stage it would have a unisex bathroom following requests from transgender employees.  Some firms are also hand-holding transgender staff during the initial employment period and keeping their identities discreet on request, but campaigners say the trend is restricted to big companies. Many Challenges Nyra D'souza, a transgender woman, never took a bathroom break when she worked at a Mumbai outsourcing firm - uncomfortable in the men's washroom and not allowed in the women's facility.  It meant holding on for 15 hours before she reached home. At job interviews, she had been told to consider fashion, beauty or films for a job  where I could be myself . But when she was interviewed at Mumbai-headquartered Godrej - a leading Indian conglomerate with interests ranging from consumer goods to real estate - she was asked about her work experience, not gender. This, a Godrej spokeswoman said, was in tune with the company's policy to make all interactions gender-neutral.  Such experiences are limited only to big companies, not small,  said D'souza, who finds others from her community struggling to find jobs, or dignity in the workplace if they do. After the Supreme Court ruling, campaigners said more companies are coming forward to recruit transgender people, but are reluctant to make adaptations.  Over the past year, we have got nearly 15 requests from companies that wish to hire a transgender, but they retreat when I ask them about bathroom access,  said Koninika Roy of the Mumbai-based Humsafar Trust that works with the LGBT community and tries to match them with jobs.   The trust had one successful placement in the last year. But Solidarity Foundation, a Bangalore-based rights group that works with sexual minorities, had more success - it placed 15 transgender people over the last year.  Companies are becoming more open and talking about these issues, but integration is still not part of their DNA,  said Shubha Chacko, executive director of Solidarity Foundation. Chacko cited the case of a transgender person detained at the office gate by security guards on his first day at work.  The biggest challenge in India is the mindset. They connect transgender to people who beg on the streets, do sex work or sing at weddings,  said Vikram of Community Business.  We still have a long way to go. A lot more work needs to be done.

Several of the 27 remaining EU states have already signalled they could take on the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - bodies that together employ more than 1,000 people.  This is a difficult discussion because for the first time since the Brexit decision, this theme is actually dividing the 27 whereas so far our strength in facing Brexit has been in our unity,  one senior EU diplomat said.  Eventually it will be a political decision with a lot of horse-trading behind the scenes.  Arriving at an EU ministerial meeting on the matter on Tuesday, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn made a play for the EBA, saying his country was already a European financial hub. Germany and Ireland have already said they would apply to host both bodies, though diplomats say they would not go to any single country. The newer member states in the east of the bloc who have joined since 2004 say they host fewer common EU bodies and want this disparity addressed. Officially the meeting in Luxembourg is focused technicalities - ministers will work out a procedure for deciding the agencies' location. Those rules will be finalised and endorsed when EU leaders meet for a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. The bloc's executive European Commission would then prepare criteria for the choice though, diplomats said, some ministers wanted the Brussels-based EU political capital to go further and assess potential candidates, or even draw up a shortlist. Barcelona, Milan, Copenhagen and Dublin have all started campaigning to host the EMA, which has an annual budget of $360 million. Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Lyon and Strasbourg are among the cities wanting the EBA, whose 160 London-based employees write and coordinate banking rules across the bloc. EU officials said the bloc would have to consider a range of criteria including logistical support and infrastructure, though eastern states have said that would favour the wealthier west. One of the proposed criteria would ensure geographical spread. Countries have until the end of July to propose cities before EU states vote, first on the medical, then on the banking authority. A senior EU official said the final decision was expected in October.

Soros used Quantum Fund in 1992 to bet successfully that sterling was over-valued against the Deutsche Mark, forcing then-Prime Minister John Major to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Soros, who was born in Hungary but made his way to London as Communists consolidated power in Budapest, said economic reality was starting to catch up with a United Kingdom that voted 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum.  The moment of truth is fast approaching,  Soros said in an article emailed to reporters.  The fact is that Brexit is a lose-lose proposition, harmful both to Britain and the European Union. It cannot be undone, but people can change their minds.  Britain's $2.5 trillion economy has shown resilience since last year's referendum although sterling fell 25 cents against the dollar in the hours immediately after the shock vote. But Britain went from being one of the fastest-growing economies of the Group of Seven leading economic nations in 2016 to the slowest in early 2017, as the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum pushed up inflation and hit consumer spending. The combination of rising prices and slowing wage growth represents a challenge for the Bank of England and its top policymakers, three of whom voted last week to raise interest rates to head off the acceleration of inflation. Soros said the Bank had underestimated the impact of inflation and was now catching up.  Households will realize that their living standards are falling and they will have to adjust their spending habits,  Soros said.  To make matters worse, they will also realize that they have become over-indebted and they will have to pay back their debts.  Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth-largest global economy. Soros said that if Prime Minister Theresa May wanted to stay in power, she would have to change her approach and take account of young people who he said wanted to find well-paying jobs.

Major Chinese firms including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), search giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and e-commerce platform JD.com Inc (JD.O) all picked New York over Hong Kong for initial public offerings (IPOs). So the new rules offer Hong Kong a chance to bring the tech titans closer to home with a secondary listing. But bankers say these companies are not likely to get a big pickup in valuation or trading activity to justify the cost and regulatory burden of a secondary listing.  The appeal for unlisted companies is more obvious than for already-listed companies, especially for the non-giants. If your market cap exceeds $10 billion, your liquidity and valuation is global,  said Kai Fang, head of equity capital markets at boutique investment bank China Renaissance, which has advised on some of China's top technology deals. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK), which operates the stock exchange, unveiled a proposal on Friday for a new board that would allow companies with share structures providing special voting rights, and those yet to make a profit, to list. They were the two key hurdles that prompted Chinese startups to choose New York instead of Hong Kong for IPOs. If approved, the changes could be implemented at the beginning of 2018, HKEX chief executive Charles Li said on Friday. Potential new business for the exchange could be significant. Chinese companies targeted by the new board raised IPO funds of $49 billion in the past 10 years, including $34 billion raised by mainland companies that listed in the United States with weighted voting rights structures, the HKEX said. Those included Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com. Another $15 billion was raised by Chinese companies that had yet to make a profit. Such a voting-rights structure is critical for many unlisted Chinese firms such as ride hailing company Didi Chuxing, Ant Financial and food delivery provider Meituan-Dianping. The three companies, with a combined valuation of about $130 billion, have different classes of stock to give founders control of the companies.  They're trying to attract some of the high profile companies that have dual class structures and wouldn't list here otherwise,  said an investment banker who worked on recent Chinese technology listings in the United States and who declined to be identified.  Without those changes, these companies just won't come to Hong Kong, full stop.  Still, some companies with little turnover or low valuations overseas might seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong to bolster their prospects, including Chinese firms that had been considering a delisting from New York. Manchester United (MANU.N), which scrapped a Hong Kong IPO because of its dual share structure, could get a boost from Asian investors appetite for sports-related assets, the bankers said.  If you're looking at some companies that have relatively low liquidity in the U.S., then the dual listing could make sense,  Fang added.  The Hong Kong stock exchange is trying to find a way to lure some companies that might originally achieve a premium valuation in Hong Kong, but due to the voting rights issue they choose to list somewhere else.

About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees at its three factory facilities joined the protest, union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said, adding that production would be hit. VW said the Bratislava plant halted production lines that make Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, Volkswagen up!, Seat Mii, Skoda Citigo and bodies for the Porsche Cayenne. More than 99 percent of the plant's output is exported.  It said VW parts and machinery factories in towns of Stupava and Martin were working normally on Tuesday. The first strike at a major Slovak plant since the 1989 end of communist rule comes as economies across central Europe outpace western Europe, leading to a labor shortage that many companies worry will limit growth. On Monday, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico supported the strike action, which began as labor office data on Tuesday showed Slovakia's unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent in May, the lowest since the global financial crisis hit central Europe in 2008.  Why should a company making one of highest quality and most luxurious cars with a high labor productivity pay its Slovak workers half or one third of the amount it pays to the same workers in western Europe?  Fico said to reporters. But VW's Slovak unit said last week that union demands for a bigger pay hike would endanger the plant's competitiveness within the car group and also job stability. The VW workers are seeking a 16 percent pay hike and have refused management's offer of a 4.5 percent raise this year and 4.2 percent raise next year, plus bonuses.  We deserve at least a double-digit raise,  Smolinsky said. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016.  The company pays an average wage of 1,800 euros ($2,008) a month, double the national average. That figure is also higher than the average salary of 37,000 crowns ($1,577) that VW pays at its Czech carmaker Skoda Auto. Slovakia's Finance Ministry has calculated 12 days of an uninterrupted strike would cut 0.1 percentage points off the country's annual economic output.  Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver.

Muslims around the world are expected to pay  zakat , typically 2.5 percent of any savings accumulated over the year, generally via state institutions that collect funds for aid to impoverished citizens. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees said it had obtained religious rulings from top Muslim clerics in Egypt, Morocco and Yemen as well as a senior Islamic scholar in Saudi Arabia, that it hoped would persuade wealthy Muslims, especially in oil-rich Gulf countries, to donate their alms directly for relief work.  It is an innovation in our efforts to raise funding,  said Muhammed Abu Asaker, a UNHCR Middle East spokesman. The UNHCR posted the rulings on its webpage that appeals for zakat contributions to aid programs.   The amount of zakat money distributed each year in Muslim countries ranges from $20 billion to $30 billion, experts say. Picture of a poster provided by UNHCR. UNHCR/Handout via REUTERSThe United Nations has projected it will need a total of $8 billion this year to provide life-saving assistance to millions of Syrians inside their shattered homeland and to refugees and their host communities in neighboring countries. UNHCR has also called for $2.1 billion to provide food, and medicine for Yemen, where 12 million people are at risk of famine and cholera brought on by two years of civil war. Slideshow (2 Images)Millions of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis have been displaced by years of civil war, sometimes to neighboring countries, straining the hosts' resources as well as United Nations and other non-governmental humanitarian agencies. UNHCR said it will use some of the additional funds it expects from the alms project to help some 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugee families in Jordan, with around $180 in monthly cash support for each family.  The needs of these people increase daily and because the crises are ongoing, for example, the Syrian crisis is entering its 7th year,  Abu Asaker said.   So anything these people had is not completely gone and they need continuous support. So this requires us as an organization to search for creative ways that go in parallel with governmental support, which has become insufficient given the rising number in refugees and IDPs (internally displaced people).  Zakat payments can be a matter of personal choice in many Muslim countries, though it is a religious obligation under Islamic law. Governments in some countries deduct payments from savings accounts on a pre-determined day. The funds tend to be used to help those in poverty, in debt or refugees.

One Qatar-based banker, whose own institution received funds, said new deposits in the banking system by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) at the end of last week were believed to total several billion dollars. He described the deposits as  pre-emptive . At a recent meeting between top commercial bank executives and central bank officials, the executives said they did not need dollar liquidity at present, the banker told Reuters, declining to be named because of commercial sensitivities. But if the diplomatic crisis lasts another three or four months, and Saudi Arabian and United Arab Emirates banks pull their deposits out of Qatar, local banks might need official help, the banker said. The QIA declined to comment. Asked for comment, a central bank official told Reuters:  QIA regularly place deposits in local banks - this is normal. Contrary to media reports, there haven't been big withdrawals from banks in Qatar, and the embargo is only having a limited effect on the banking sector here, and one that is easily manageable.  Qatar's banks became dependent on foreign funding during the last few years of strong economic growth. Their foreign liabilities increased to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015. Yousef al-Jaida, chief executive of the Qatar Financial Centre, said this week that institutions from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain had about $18 billion of deposits in Qatari banks that would mature in two months. He said it was not yet clear whether those countries would decide to have their institutions pull the money out, but added that Qatar's government was prepared to step in and support local banks if needed. The Centre has a legal, regulatory, tax and business infrastructure, and licenses foreign companies to exempt them from local ownership laws. Both the QIA and the central bank have told the banking community that they are ready to assist local banks further with dollar or riyal funding, said the Qatar-based banker. He said that so far, only one UAE institution, a government-linked-firm, had pulled deposits from his bank, asking to withdraw a three-month deposit of about $100 million early. Many depositors have been asking questions, but nobody else has asked for their money back and one Asian asset manager has continued to place deposits, he added. The central bank has about $34.5 billion of net foreign reserves and the QIA is believed to hold over $200 billion of liquid assets, so Qatar appears to be in no danger of running out of money to protect its banking system. The QIA owns stakes in several Qatari banks including 50 percent of Qatar National Bank, the largest lender, and a 16.9 percent stake in Qatar Islamic Bank, the largest sharia-compliant lender by assets. The Qatari riyal, which is pegged at 3.64 to the U.S. dollar, has moved slightly off the peg since the diplomatic crisis began on June 5, and is now quoted by banks offshore at around 3.67. The Qatari banker said the central bank had not issued any specific warnings to banks about speculating against the peg, but it was committed to the peg and the only institutions speculating in the foreign exchange market were hedge funds and some other international investors.

For the transport sector, the government is considering easing rules on airport operation services, Sumadi said. Current rules stipulate maximum foreign ownership of 49 percent. President Joko Widodo has repeatedly said he wants more investment to boost economic growth. But despite amendment last year of Indonesia's  negative investment list  that specifies caps and restrictions, foreign direct investment remains sluggish. Widodo described last year's easing of foreign ownership rules as a  Big Bang  liberalisation of the economy, while one minister called it the largest opening to international investment in 10 years. The government scaled back restrictions in many sectors, including retail and ports. Southeast Asia's largest economy grew an annual 5.01 percent in January-March, just a touch better than the previous quarter. Growth has been stuck around 5 percent for years, highlighting Widodo's struggle to make good a campaign promise to lift growth to 7 percent during his term, which ends in 2019. The finance minister said last month that 2017 growth could reach 5.3 percent.

The Rockies entered the week with a narrow lead over the Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the three teams own the three best records in the NL. Colorado is on a five-game winning streak but is merely the second-hottest team in the bunch, with the Diamondbacks coming into the series 5-0 on its current eight-game road trip and riding a string of seven consecutive wins and 10 of 11 overall. The Rockies nearly had their winning streak come to an end on Sunday before Nolan Arenado completed a cycle with a walk-off home run in a 7-5 win over the San Francisco Giants.  He's an All-Star player,  Colorado manager Bud Black told reporters of Arenado.  He's one of the best players in the game. He's capable of doing these things, no doubt about that. And he's been swinging well. That's the thing. His at-bats today, his at-bats yesterday, his at-bats the last couple of days have been solid.

The 33-year-old owns 104 strikeouts in 90 total innings and is limiting opponents to a .222 batting average. Greinke was solid in a pair of starts against Colorado earlier this season, going 1-0 while yielding a total of five runs in 13 innings and striking out 16. Marquez failed to make it through six innings in any of his last four starts but is coming off a win at Pittsburgh on Wednesday in which he allowed one run and four hits in five frames. The Venezuela native surrendered one or no earned runs in five of his last seven outings. Marquez struck out eight in six scoreless innings at Arizona on April 30 but was not as sharp against the Diamondbacks on May 5, when he was knocked around for five runs in six frames. Walk-Offs 1.

The Cardinals seek only their third win in a stretch of 15 road contests Tuesday when they open a three-game set in Philadelphia. St. Louis ended a season-high seven-game slide by silencing the Phillies' bats from June 9-11 at Busch Stadium, as the rotation recorded a 1.80 ERA while picking up the win in every contest during the three-game set. While the offense has held up its end of the bargain by scoring 44 runs in the seven games since, Cardinals' starting pitchers have not - posting a 9.39 ERA while the team has won only two of seven. Philadelphia (22-46), which has mustered a total of 30 runs while dropping 11 of 12, fell in extra innings for the third time in a week Sunday against Arizona and has lost six one-run affairs during its slide.

Leake is 3-3 with a 5.40 ERA in 10 starts versus the Phillies. Like his counterpart Tuesday, Hellickson has dropped four straight decisions, including Wednesday's loss against Boston in which he surrendered six runs on nine hits and three walks over five innings. Walks have been a problem for the 30-year-old Iowa native during his five-start winless spell, as he has issued 14 of his 23 on the season while posting a 7.57 ERA.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States. If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors. This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale. Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil. Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil. It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.  The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',  said Kuhach.  It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk.  Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said. Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil, controlled by ExxonMobil Corp, is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said. The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital. The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in. Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale. The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead. Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially. Dating and Marriage The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure. Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail. Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment. Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.  Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,  he said.  The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money.  Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later. The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada. Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.  At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,  Reed said.  But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial.  Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions. 'Incremental Gains' Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd. Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel. Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more. The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D;), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.  It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,  Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate. Suncor and Imperial both held R&D; spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls  step-change technologies , while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed. The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D; budgets. A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations. Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said. Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance. Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in  technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.  I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,  he said.  Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home.

At an annual investor event in Toronto, Chief Executive Brian Ferguson is expected to unveil plans for asset sales to cut debt assumed for the C$17 billion ($12.9 billion) March purchase of some ConocoPhillips assets in Canada. The deal effectively doubled Cenovus' assets, a move the company has said would allow it to utilize economies of scale to lower costs. Cenovus shares have since fallen about 40 percent to just above C$10, wiping out $6.7 billion in the company's market value. Two months after the deal is too soon to realize any benefits of the acquisition, and shareholders lack faith in management's ability to deliver, Laura Lau, senior vice president at Toronto-based Brompton Group, said in an interview. Brompton holds 183,800 Cenovus shares.  They're not going to give them the benefit of the doubt,  Lau said. She said the same goes for asset sales.  It's too soon to actually know,  she said.  What's probably likely is: 'We've put the package out. These are the packages, and these are the possible bids.'  When asked about investors' skepticism, Cenovus spokesman Brett Harris said,  With respect to our conversations with individual investors, that's not something we would discuss publicly.  Cenovus expects a  fulsome discussion  about the acquired assets and the company's longer-term outlook on Tuesday, Harris said without providing additional details. Royal Bank of Canada analyst Greg Pardy said in a note on Monday that questions from investors had increased over the past month, with the most significant being whether Cenovus can achieve its asset-sale target. Cenovus has said it wants to raise C$3.6 billion by selling its Pelican Lake and Suffield oil assets and potentially others, including parts of its Deep Basin gas play, newly acquired from ConocoPhillips, which had been unpopular among investors who saw it as unwanted diversification.  Most people view they overpaid for the assets, and now two months later, we're sitting with higher interest rates and oil prices that are 10 percent lower,  said Len Racioppo, managing director of Toronto-based Coerente Capital Management.  They say they want to sell assets, but how do you sell assets and what kind of a price do you get when you bought them at $50-something a barrel, and now we're at $45 a barrel?  Racioppo said. Racioppo wrote to the Toronto Stock Exchange's regulator seeking to halt the deal soon after it was announced. He manages more than 500,000 shares on clients' behalf.

In a separate briefing at the Paris Airshow, Delaney said the jet would make  extensive use  of composites and confirmed it would have a  hybrid  cross-section, apparently referring to the need for a slimmed-down cargo space.

The 19-year-old ended up living in a flat on the outskirts of the city and “doing nothing” for a year, he said. But his fortunes have changed dramatically.  Now he works full-time in the kitchen of El Repartidor, an attractive new restaurant that opened in the Barcelona suburb of L'Hospitalet in April.  Despite its designer appearance and prominent position on one of the district’s main squares, El Repartidor is run almost entirely by disadvantaged young people who are outside the Spanish school system. The non-profit restaurant is helping unemployed teenagers who don’t have work – either because they just arrived in Spain or quit school – to learn vocational hospitality skills. Teenagers like Méndez normally move to Spain with another family member who migrated for economic reasons, or to be reunited with them after several years apart, said Borja Castellet, a project manager at the restaurant school. It is one of several initiatives migrants and refugees can turn to for support in the Catalan capital which is vocal about its desire to help newcomers. In February, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona, calling for the Spanish government to take in more refugees. The city’s leftist mayor Ada Colau has criticized the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for failing to meet its pledge to house more refugees.  In 2015 she published a register of families in Catalonia, Spain’s wealthiest region, willing to open their homes to refugees, or simply to help in some way.  Barcelona is “a progressive city which is open and warm towards people coming from outside”, Ignasi Calbó, coordinator of the “Refugee City” program at Barcelona City Hall, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The social inclusion program helps migrants settle in Barcelona, he explained. Its initiatives include Mescladís, a quirky bar and restaurant in the historic center run entirely by migrants.  The scheme also helps refugees find work at the many cultural events that take place across the city each year, including Sonar, a popular electronic music festival. Among those seeking asylum in the Catalan capital, the largest numbers are from Venezuela, Ukraine, Honduras and El Salvador.  Eu Commitment Other Spanish cities, including Valencia, Malaga, Pamplona, Zaragoza and La Coruña, have also said they are keen to welcome more refugees.  Calbó branded the Spanish government’s system for integrating refugees “a disgrace”. “It... just tries to create a checklist on a screen,” he said. The government can take up to seven years to process an asylum application, he added.  The hardest part is deciding what to do with those who have had their application turned down after being in Spain for several years, he said.  “They can just become illegal from one day to the next, and then they are rejected from all the services on our program,” he added. In September 2015, Spain's conservative-led government pledged to bring in more than 17,000 refugees from camps in Italy, Greece, Turkey and Libya within two years.  Non-profit restaurant El Repartidor in the Barcelona suburb of L’Hospitalet teaches hospitality skills to migrants and refugees, May 24, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Sophie DaviesSince then, the country has taken in just over 1,300 refugees, its interior ministry said. Spain has provided “all the means at its disposal” to accommodate asylum seekers, said ministry sources, who did not want to be named.   The government is also working to ensure Spain’s relocation and resettlement commitments - made with other EU states at the height of an influx of people fleeing conflict in the Middle East - can be implemented “within the required time and in the right conditions”, they said.  Last year, international protection was granted to 57 percent of those who applied for asylum in Spain, according to the ministry, up from about 30 percent in 2015.  Youth Unemployment Some of the students at El Repartidor have been “brutally abandoned” by the school system, and many have “very complicated lives and difficult situations at home”, said Begonya Gasch, director of the charitable foundation El Llindar.  It set up the restaurant school with financial support from the local government and Catalan bank La Caixa. Slideshow (2 Images)El Repartidor, which translates as “The Delivery Man”, is located in a former post office building in a quiet, leafy square that also used to contain important public fountains. “We like to say that the square began by delivering water, then letters and now opportunities,” said Castellet. The working class area of L'Hospitalet, which has a large immigrant population, is better known for its high-rise apartment blocks and transport thoroughfares.  “The school receives a lot of young migrants that have just arrived – and arrived by the worst means,” Gasch said, noting that many come from North Africa or Latin America. “Schools are not responding to what they need and they are also unprepared to enter the world of work.” Spain has the second highest unemployment rate in the EU after Greece. One in five Spaniards aged under 34 is not in work, education or training, according to official statistics.  Unemployment has fallen since a peak in 2013, but experts say temporary contracts are making the job market less secure. The school tries to give young people hope for a better future and stop them ending up on the street, said Gasch. “We can’t change their lives, their situations... but we work so that they take charge of their lives and see themselves as something other than victims,” she said. Rising Rents Limited access to housing is another challenge refugees face when they arrive in Barcelona - the most expensive city in Spain to rent. “We have a city that is tourist-wise very, very successful, and it has created a problem with housing. The rental price of flats is unbelievably high now,” said Calbó. Rental prices in Barcelona in the first quarter of this year were 19 percent higher than in the same period last year, according to real estate website idealista.com. Many refugees and poor migrants simply cannot afford to live in the city. In the short term, projects like El Llindar can help Barcelona-based youths like Méndez find their feet in Spain. “I’m really enjoying doing this and I can see myself working in a good restaurant in future,” said the budding chef, who has already interned at one of the city’s upmarket eateries.

The expected appointment of Dufourcq, who joined the STMicro board in 2015 as a representative of the French government, comes less than two months after another French national, Jean-Marc Chery, was lined up as successor to Italian CEO Carlo Bozotti. France and Italy jointly control a 27.5 percent stake Europe's second-biggest chipmaker and have clashed regularly over nominations of top managers and operational strategy. That included the CEO succession, a source said in April, after Paris had publicly complained about STMicro's strategy and hinted that it was deeply dissatisfied with Bozotti when the company announced plans to cut about 430 jobs in France. Dufourcq, 53, became Bpifrance's CEO in 2013 and joined Geneva-based STMicro's board two years later as a representative of the French government. As chairman he would replace Italian representative Maurizio Tamagnini. The election of Dufourcq, a graduate of France's elite administration school ENA and the HEC business school, should take place on Tuesday afternoon after an STMicro shareholder meeting in the morning. The appointment is in compliance with a shareholder accord between France and Italy, under which the countries alternately propose a new chairman every three years, the source said. The same goes for the office of vice-chairman, which has been held by Frenchman Didier Lombard, a former Orange chief executive, over the past three years. A spokesman for the Italian government was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. STMicro declined to comment.

Long-standing tensions between the company's founders - former brothers-in-law - first became public during a court hearing on March 7.  Businessman Eduard Zanen, who provided seed capital for the company, had become frustrated after co-founder and inventor Max Barenbrug continued to influence strategic direction after agreeing to a design role. Zanen invoked a 2012 agreement that either could trigger the sale of the company to a third party. That disagreement was settled without a ruling, a spokeswoman for the Amsterdam District Court said. But Het Financieele Dagblad first reported on Thursday that the partners have now agreed to a sale. Zanen and Barenbrug's sister divorced a decade earlier, the paper said. Founded in 1999, Bugaboo's breakthrough came after one of its strollers was shown on in an episode of hit TV series  Sex and The City  in 2002, when the character Miranda had a baby. The strollers, which can cost more than $1,000, have been snapped up by celebrities including Gwynneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham, and Elton John.  Designers Viktor & Rolf, Bas Kosters and the Andy Warhol Foundation, among others, have crafted limited edition designs, and the company recently made a foray into luggage. The company made a pretax profit of 16.8 million euros  ($18.75 million)on sales of 95 million euros in 2015, according to its most recent filing with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.  Lieke der Kinderen walks her newborn in her Bugaboo stroller in Dordrecht Monday, June 19, 2017.Michael KoorenJelena Sokolova, analyst at Morningstar, said Bugaboo could be valued against luggage makers Samsonite (1910.HK) and Rimowa, recently acquired by LVMH (LVMH.PA), which both trade at 2 times sales. Rabobank, which has been given the commission to sell the company, will approach both strategic and private equity buyers for Bugaboo. Slideshow (4 Images) Selling is the wisest decision in a situation like this: when the owners start to fight, that can be the beginning of the end for a lifestyle brand,  said Dutch marketing specialist Paul Moers. Moers noted that while Bugaboo's image of sturdy quality and versatility has spawned many imitators, its reputation is still solid and the market is fragmented.  It's not too late for Bugaboo, not by any means,  he said.  Find a buyer with knowledge of sales and marketing and the power to invest behind advertising and you can grab market share, become a much bigger player.  Competitors and possible buyers for Bugaboo include Britax, owned by Nordic Capital, Stokke, owned by Korean investment firm MXMH, Quinny, owned by Canada's Dorel Industries, Graco, owned by U.S. firm Newell Brands, and LVMH, among others.

A total of 30.1 percent of bankers believed monetary policy was  relatively tight  in April-June, according to the survey, an increase of 9.8 percentage points from the first quarter. About 67 percent of respondents said the policy is appropriate, down 6.9 percentage points from the percentage saying that in a first-quarter survey. The increase in citing of  relatively tight  appears to reflect intensifying worries about a liquidity squeeze as a vigorous regulatory clampdown on riskier forms of financing has kept liquidity conditions unusually tight this year. But while more bankers to feel the heat of tighter money, their confidence about the economy rose in the second quarter. An index in the central bank survey on confidence was 67.8, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2013, as profitability edged up. A reading above 50 indicates business expansion. A separate survey published by the central bank showed Business confidence among entrepreneurs in China also picked up to its highest level in more than three years. The entrepreneurs' confidence index rose to 65.4 percent in the second quarter, 3.9 percentage points higher than in the January-March, and only slightly below the 67.0 level in the first quarter of 2014. China's economy generally remained on solid footing in May, but tighter monetary policy, a cooling housing market and slowing investment reinforced views that it will gradually lose momentum in coming months. China's fast start to the year led the International Monetary Fund last week to raise its 2017 growth forecast to 6.7 percent from 6.6 percent in April, though it recommended Beijing accelerate reforms and rein in credit expansion.

The city-state has increased its level of surveillance for Islamist radicalism as concern grows about the spread of Islamic State in the region. Singapore has been urging citizens to report anyone deemed at risk of being radicalized, and has reiterated over the past year that it is a target of Islamist groups. The Ministry of Home Affairs said auxiliary policeman Muhammad Khairul bin Mohamed, 24, had been arrested in May and officially issued with a detention order this month under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for suspects to be held for lengthy periods without trial.     Khairul, whose path to radicalism began in 2012, intended to undertake armed violence in Syria and was interested in joining the Free Syrian Army or other militant groups operating there, the ministry said in a statement.   His readiness and proclivity to resort to violence in pursuit of a religious cause makes him a security threat to Singapore,  it said. A colleague, Mohamad Rizal bin Wahid, was put under a  restriction order for supporting Khairul's intentions to engage in armed violence in Syria, it said. Auxiliary police are private contractors hired to perform certain security duties. Both men were in the auxiliary force at the time of their arrests last month. Rizal did not share Khairul's desire to participate in armed violence but he had failed to bring the matter to the attention of authorities and had even suggested to Khairul various ways to get to Syria and die there as a  martyr , the ministry said.   The news comes just a week after authorities said that they had detained the first Singaporean woman for suspected Islamist radicalism. At least 16 Singaporeans have been put under restriction or detention orders under the ISA since 2015 because of their radicalization, up sharply from 11 cases between 2007 and 2014, according to ministry data. In a separate statement, the Ministry for Communications and Information said it banned nine publications by another Singaporean, Rasul Bin Dahri, that contained extremist religious views.  It said in some of his publications, the preacher rejected the idea of a secular state and called on Muslims to establish an Islamic State.  Rasul Bin Dahri is a Singaporean who has, through his radical teachings, betrayed the values that Singapore has held so close to us as a multi-cultural and multi-racial society,  the ministry said in a statement.  We will not allow his radical teachings and his extremist ideology to take root in Singapore,  it said, adding distributing or possessing any of the prohibited publications would be an offence. It was not immediately clear whether the preacher will face any other action. Reuters was not able to contact him for comment.

Wolseley, which is set to change its name next month to match its U.S. brand Ferguson, said margins in the business fell 90 basis points to 8.5 percent over the three months ended April 30. The news disappointed the market as Wolseley had earlier said it expected cost growth to moderate over the quarter, raising hopes of greater profit contributions from the U.S. business that accounts for 84 percent of its trading profit.  The drop-through margin in the U.S. has been disappointing ... and improvement is clearly needed,  Davy analysts wrote. Wolseley shares recovered some of their lost ground and were down 0.8 percent at 4,847 pence by 0943 GMT. Chief Executive John Martin said the costs were related to the addition of 400-500 associates to grow Wolseley's existing U.S. network of 25,000.  Now (we're) exactly where we wanted to be and therefore our flow through to profit, we expect, should be better in the final quarter of the year and in a good place going into our new year,  he told Reuters. Martin said Wolseley would see increased U.S. revenue growth as it benefited from investments, recent bolt-ons and the fading cost impact. Quarterly like-for-like U.S. revenue growth rose to 8.5 percent from 6.7 percent in the prior quarter. The company has increasingly banked on growth in its U.S. business to drive results, against challenging market conditions in its UK business and parts of its European business, which has most recently led it to promise an exit from the Nordic region. Martin said Wolseley expected to launch an auction for the sale of its Nordic business in the summer, after noting strong interest from  strategics  and potential private equity buyers. The firm would use proceeds for bolt-on U.S. deals, but would make investor returns if it failed to deploy cash, he said, declining to comment on the potential sale price.  Wolseley forecast it would meet full-year trading profit consensus of about 1.102 billion pounds, as since the start of the new quarter revenue growth had been broadly in line with the third quarter, while gross margins and cost controls had been  good .

China and the United States last week settled the conditions for American beef exports after the two sides agreed in May to resume the trade. Pent-up demand for U.S. meat could erode sales of Australian beef, China's current top supplier of premium steaks.  We have ordered 56 to 58 tonnes of whole carcasses, which are expected to arrive by the end of July,  said Chen Fugang, owner of Aoyang International, a Shanghai-based trading company.  Chen said he expects the product to be a hit in the Chinese market, where total beef sales grew around 4 percent last year to reach 5.9 million tonnes, according to Euromonitor.  We're especially interested in several barbecue products, like rib eye and fillet steak, which we believe Chinese customers would like,  added Chen. American beef is known for its quality in China, but was banned in 2003 after a mad cow disease scare. Since then, other beef imports have surged, as domestic production has struggled to keep up with demand from the expanding middle class. Total beef arrivals rose 22 percent to 579,836 tonnes last year and foreign suppliers will meet about 20 percent of demand by 2020, forecasts Rabobank. <COM/CN>      The number of enquiries to our exporters number in the hundreds, if not low thousands, since the announcement of the agreement,  said Joel Haggard, senior vice president for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Asia-Pacific. Increased competition for the lucrative premium market will stir concerns in Australia, where a drought has cut the herd size. FILE PHOTO: Cows are seen at Harris Cattle Ranch in Coalinga in the Central Valley, California, United States May 6, 2015.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoSimilar quality cuts of U.S. beef are expected to be cheaper than Australian meat because of low U.S. grain prices, a large component of the cost of raising cattle. Chen, who sells Australian and New Zealand beef to five-star hotels and high-end restaurants, declined to reveal the price for his U.S. cargoes, adding that customs and handling fees still needed to be factored in. But the product would be cheaper than Australian beef, he added.  Price is a key (selling) point, as U.S. beef is cheaper than Australian beef of the same quality,  he said. Despite the high interest, strict Chinese import conditions will limit shipments of American beef initially. And U.S. prices are also high currently, warned the Meat Export Federation's Haggard.  This isn't going to be a wave of product coming in. It's going to roll in slowly,  he said. Australian beef will still see strong demand, said Michael Finucan, general manager of international markets at industry body Meat & Livestock Australia. Australia's grass-fed beef is seen as  more green  than American in some markets, he said. And, unlike the U.S., the country can export refrigerated beef to China, tapping into demand from high-end retailers. However, for some, U.S. beef has the edge.  I have been in this industry for a long time. In my view, U.S. beef tastes more tender,  said Aoyang's Chen.

David Shearer, head of the 13,000-strong United Nations mission, welcomed signs that regional leaders were rejuvenating the peace process but said any initiative must include all factions, including that of former Vice President Riek Machar, and discourage the multiplication of armed groups. South Sudan slipped into civil war in 2013, just two years after becoming independent from Khartoum, and some 4 million people – around one third of the population – have fled to neighboring countries or to pockets of relative safety. The conflict, ignited by a feud between President Salva Kiir and Machar, has resulted in ethnic cleansing between the leaders’ respective Dinka and Nuer communities.  However, an escalation of fighting since last July that forced Machar to flee the country a month later has seen clashes spread to previously unaffected areas.  The situation now is somewhat different to what it was a year ago, when it was largely bipolar,  Shearer told Reuters in an interview late on Monday.   We are seeing a lot more of the conflict being played out at a very local level and that is worrying because as it fractures it becomes more difficult to try to put the pieces back together again.  Fighting has in particular affected the southern Equatoria regions, previously largely spared violence. The spike in fighting resulted in South Sudan having the fastest growing refugee population in the world as civilians poured into Uganda. Tens of thousands of civilians have fled to camps within South Sudan that are ringed by U.N. troops.  FILE PHOTO: South Sudan's rebel leader Riek Machar speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kenya's capital Nairobi July 8, 2015.Thomas Mukoya/File PhotoPeacekeepers have frequently been criticized for failing to do enough to protect civilians but the U.N. leadership says troops are obstructed and restricted by the army.  A combination of red tape and unwillingness meant it took eight months for the first of 4,000 U.N. reinforcements approved to start deploying after last year's fighting. Places at the Table Analysts and diplomats say regional peace efforts have stumbled for much of the last year as Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya adopted a more bilateral approach to the conflict.  But Shearer was optimistic that a recent meeting of regional leaders in Ethiopia would result in a more collective approach to the crisis.  There was a sense that they want to rejuvenate the peace agreement and start moving that forward. That collective effort hasn’t been apparent for the last year,  he said. Machar remains in exile in South Africa, excluded from the process.  Shearer said while regional leaders were reluctant to return to the  old formula  of insisting on a potentially explosive face-to-face between Kiir and Machar, there was recognition that Machar’s camp needed to be represented in talks and he could too, further down the line.  The U.N. chief said there was a delicate balance between a rejuvenated and broadened push for peace and creating incentives to add to the plethora of armed groups.   What we don’t want to do is to encourage a greater degree of conflict or arming of groups in order to be relevant and have a place at the table,  he warned.

Church officials, citing their own sources in the remote territory bordering Angola, said the army had destroyed 10 villages as it sought to stamp out an insurrection. They also accused the Kamuina Nsapu militia of killing hundreds of people, destroying four villages and attacking church property in a campaign to drive out central government troops. Related CoverageMilitia mutilates toddlers, burns villages in central Congo: U.N.No one was immediately available to comment from the militia or Democratic Republic of Congo's army, which has dismissed accusations of excessive force in the past. The clashes have triggered fears of a wider conflict in the central African giant, a tinderbox of ethnic rivalry and competing claims over mineral resources. Wars at the turn of the century killed millions and sucked in neighbouring countries. The church's report will carry considerable weight in a country where about 40 percent of the population identifies as Catholic. Fighting surged in Kasai in August when the army killed a chief who had been calling for central government forces to quit the region, saying it should be left to local leaders. The violence has stoked political tensions already heightened by President Joseph Kabila's decision to stay in power beyond the December 2016 end of his mandate. Kasai is an opposition stronghold. The U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva is due to decide this week whether to authorize an investigation into the Kasai violence. U.N. investigators say they have discovered 42 mass graves.  Congo's government opposes an international investigation, saying that would violate its sovereignty. The United Nations says more than 1.3 million people have fled the fighting.

The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the 'BB+' long-term foreign-currency ratings on the USD490 million 4.9% senior unsecured notes due 2019 issued by Hanrui Overseas Investment Co., Ltd. The notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Hanrui International Investment Company Limited (HII), HanRui's wholly owned subsidiary. Under the keepwell structure, HanRui undertakes to ensure HII has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations. KEY RATING DRIVERS Linked to Zhenjiang Municipality: HanRui's ratings are credit-linked with those of Zhenjiang municipality in Jiangsu province. The link reflects strong oversight and supervision of HanRui by the Zhenjiang government and the company's strategic importance as the flagship local government funding vehicle (LGFV) platform for public-sector construction in Zhenjiang New Area, a national-level economic and technological development zone. Hence, HanRui is classified as a public-sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Zhenjiang's Creditworthiness: Zhenjiang's economy is backed by a traditionally strong secondary industry and the expanding tertiary industry has also become an important driver as part of the municipality's economic transformation. Zhenjiang maintained strong gross regional product (GRP) growth of 9.3% in 2016, outperforming both Jiangsu and the national average. Zhenjiang has a favourable socio-economic profile, despite its smaller economy, with population inflow and GRP per capita that ranked fifth among Jiangsu's 13 municipalities. These strengths mitigate the city's moderately high continent liabilities arising from its state-owned entities. Legal Status 'Mid-Range': HanRui is registered as a wholly state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law and is under the direct supervision of Zhenjiang State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Zhenjiang SASAC has full control over HanRui and HanRui's daily operations are supervised by the administrative committee of Zhenjiang New Area on behalf of Zhenjiang SASAC. The government has no plan to dilute its shareholding in HanRui. Control 'Stronger': HanRui's financing plan and debt level are closely monitored by the municipality. HanRui reports its budget performance on a regular basis and its board members, except for employee representatives, are all appointed by Zhenjiang municipality. Strategic Importance 'Stronger': HanRui is Zhenjiang's flagship urban development LGFV and helps fund infrastructure and social housing construction within the Zhenjiang New Area. Zhenjiang New Area and HanRui play an important role in driving the transformation of Zhenjiang's economy, which would suffer significant consequences from a default. Hence, this attribute has been given more weight for the rating. Integration 'Stronger': HanRui has received consistent government financial support, including subsidies and capital injections. Annual subsidies have averaged 148% of the company's net profit over the previous three years, demonstrating the government's commitment in maintaining HanRui as a going concern. Fitch expects continued government support to partly fund HanRui's capital expenditure and debt servicing, considering its high strategic importance. Weak Standalone Profile: HanRui's financial profile is borne by large capital expenditure, negative free cash flow and high leverage. Its weak standalone credit metrics are not likely to see any significant improvement in the near term. Fitch expects ongoing government financial support to mitigate this risk, despite HanRui's infrastructure developments in Zhenjiang New Area. RATING SENSITIVITIES A stronger or more explicit support commitment from Zhenjiang municipality may trigger positive rating action on HanRui. Significant changes to HanRui's strategic importance, a diluted municipal shareholding or reduced explicit and implicit municipality support could lead to a wider rating gap between HanRui and Zhenjiang. An upgrade of Fitch's internal credit view of Zhenjiang may trigger positive rating action on HanRui. A weaker fiscal performance or higher municipality indebtedness could lead to a lowering of Fitch's internal assessment of Zhenjiang's creditworthiness and thus trigger negative rating action on HanRui.

Buyout firms typically invest in a company for up to five years before  exiting , but if they are unable or unwilling to sell out they can turn to so-called dividend recapitalisations, funded by loans or bonds, to get a cash return. Their use has been criticised in the past because it can saddle portfolio companies with high levels of debt, while private equity firms and their investors make a profit.  Dividend recapitalisation is a legitimate instrument used by all kinds of businesses for short-term liquidity. In private equity it can be one way of enabling investors to realise some of the value they have created in a portfolio company,  Michael Collins, chief executive of industry body Invest Europe, said. In Europe, these payouts to private equity have totalled 2.6 billion euros ($2.9 billion) so far this year, up from 650 million euros for the same period in 2016, data from S&P; Global Market Intelligence showed. Despite the rise, dividends paid to private equity in the region through bond markets and loans were way off the 11.32 billion euros paid in the whole of 2006, at the height of the previous credit boom. Out of 2.6 billion euros, around 1.6 billion euros came from loans and the rest via the bond market.  It is not in the interests of fund managers to load an unsustainable level of debt onto a portfolio company given that the stronger and more valuable that company is the higher the return they will get at exit,  Collins said. The rise in payouts has partly been fuelled by buoyant credit markets in Europe as well as investors seeking to buy non-investment grade debt as they look for higher yields during a period of record low interest rates.  Fierce competition (in the debt markets) coupled with the liquidity, means private equity sponsors can still take money off the table for their investors by effecting a dividend recapitalisation of a portfolio company, when they are not in a position to exit that investment,  said Tom Whelan, head of private equity at law firm Hogan Lovells. But the trend could already be nearing an end.  I think there's going to be a healthy exit environment and the balance may swing back to sales over recaps,  Whelan said. Debt Is Cheap Although full details of individual deals are not disclosed, Advent International-owned Allnex launched a dividend recapitalisation in March after huge demand from investors for the Belgian chemicals company to issue new debt. The move was expected to net a 425 million euro payout to its owners. And Spanish sports management company Dorna Sports financed a dividend payment of up to 300 million euros to its private equity owner Bridgepoint, marking the third payout from the company in six years. The leverage ratios for Dorna and Allnex were not disclosed but if a company's earnings have risen sufficiently during their period of private equity ownership, they may not be any higher than when the companies were bought. Cheap debt is the oil in the gears for such deals and the pricing of leveraged loans has dropped to around 316 basis points in the second quarter so far from a 10-year peak of 450 basis points in the final quarter of 2011, according to LPC, a provider of information and data on syndicated loans and high yield bonds. According to the S&P; data, the sharp rise in dividend recaps has also coincided with a sharp fall in the volume of private equity sales. Macroeconomic and political uncertainties across Europe have at times made it more difficult for buyout firms to trade their assets either via initial public offerings or sales. Sales and listings of assets in the region have fallen to 78.5 billion euros so far this year, compared with 172.4 billion euros in the same period of 2016.  In this market, while debt financing is cheap, valuations are high so maximizing value through a sale may not be feasible for all companies,  said Rajani Gupta, Leveraged Finance Partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  Neither is the IPO market – which has picked up considerably in certain sectors,  but remains volatile enough that may not be an available option either.

Wolseley, which is set to change its name next month to match its U.S. brand Ferguson, said margins in the business fell 90 basis points to 8.5 percent over the three months ended April 30. The news disappointed the market as Wolseley had earlier said it expected cost growth to moderate over the quarter, raising hopes of greater profit contributions from the U.S. business that accounts for 84 percent of its trading profit.  The drop-through margin in the U.S. has been disappointing ... and improvement is clearly needed,  Davy analysts wrote. Wolseley shares recovered some of their lost ground and were down 0.8 percent at 4,847 pence by 0943 GMT. Chief Executive John Martin said the costs were related to the addition of 400-500 associates to grow Wolseley's existing U.S. network of 25,000.  Now (we're) exactly where we wanted to be and therefore our flow through to profit, we expect, should be better in the final quarter of the year and in a good place going into our new year,  he told Reuters. Martin said Wolseley would see increased U.S. revenue growth as it benefited from investments, recent bolt-ons and the fading cost impact. Quarterly like-for-like U.S. revenue growth rose to 8.5 percent from 6.7 percent in the prior quarter. The company has increasingly banked on growth in its U.S. business to drive results, against challenging market conditions in its UK business and parts of its European business, which has most recently led it to promise an exit from the Nordic region. Martin said Wolseley expected to launch an auction for the sale of its Nordic business in the summer, after noting strong interest from  strategics  and potential private equity buyers. The firm would use proceeds for bolt-on U.S. deals, but would make investor returns if it failed to deploy cash, he said, declining to comment on the potential sale price.  Wolseley forecast it would meet full-year trading profit consensus of about 1.102 billion pounds, as since the start of the new quarter revenue growth had been broadly in line with the third quarter, while gross margins and cost controls had been  good .

The city-state has increased its level of surveillance for Islamist radicalism as concern grows about the spread of Islamic State in the region. Singapore has been urging citizens to report anyone deemed at risk of being radicalized, and has reiterated over the past year that it is a target of Islamist groups. The Ministry of Home Affairs said auxiliary policeman Muhammad Khairul bin Mohamed, 24, had been arrested in May and officially issued with a detention order this month under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for suspects to be held for lengthy periods without trial.     Khairul, whose path to radicalism began in 2012, intended to undertake armed violence in Syria and was interested in joining the Free Syrian Army or other militant groups operating there, the ministry said in a statement.   His readiness and proclivity to resort to violence in pursuit of a religious cause makes him a security threat to Singapore,  it said. A colleague, Mohamad Rizal bin Wahid, was put under a  restriction order for supporting Khairul's intentions to engage in armed violence in Syria, it said. Auxiliary police are private contractors hired to perform certain security duties. Both men were in the auxiliary force at the time of their arrests last month. Rizal did not share Khairul's desire to participate in armed violence but he had failed to bring the matter to the attention of authorities and had even suggested to Khairul various ways to get to Syria and die there as a  martyr , the ministry said.   The news comes just a week after authorities said that they had detained the first Singaporean woman for suspected Islamist radicalism. At least 16 Singaporeans have been put under restriction or detention orders under the ISA since 2015 because of their radicalization, up sharply from 11 cases between 2007 and 2014, according to ministry data. In a separate statement, the Ministry for Communications and Information said it banned nine publications by another Singaporean, Rasul Bin Dahri, that contained extremist religious views.  It said in some of his publications, the preacher rejected the idea of a secular state and called on Muslims to establish an Islamic State.  Rasul Bin Dahri is a Singaporean who has, through his radical teachings, betrayed the values that Singapore has held so close to us as a multi-cultural and multi-racial society,  the ministry said in a statement.  We will not allow his radical teachings and his extremist ideology to take root in Singapore,  it said, adding distributing or possessing any of the prohibited publications would be an offence. It was not immediately clear whether the preacher will face any other action. Reuters was not able to contact him for comment.

We're experiencing a first half which is so strong that the impetus will carry on into the coming year,  Timo Wollmershaeuser, head of economic research at Ifo, said in a statement. Ifo raised its growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent, adding that risks linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president have receded since the start of the year.  We assume the Brexit negotiations between Britain and the EU will go ahead without much turbulence, and an exit plan should emerge early on without any major negative effects on the economic interdependence between the EU and Britain,  said Wollmershaeuser of the talks which began on Monday. For 2018, the institute predicts Germany's gross domestic product will expand by 2.0 percent, up from the 1.8 percent it had predicted previously.      The upswing is being driven by the domestic economy, especially construction and consumption,  Wollmershaeuser added.  But now we have industry too. The improving economies of the euro zone and the rest of the world are significantly boosting exports.  Consumption, construction and state spending have been the main growth drivers in Germany as exports have gradually weakened. These three pillars of growth have been supported by a robust labor market and the low interest rate environment created by the European Central Bank's expansive policy.     Ifo expects there to be 44.2 million people employed this year, an all time high, compared with 43.6 million last year. That would be coupled with higher inflation, reaching 1.7 percent this year and 1.6 percent in 2018, compared with 0.6 percent in 2016. It said it expects the ECB to start exiting its bond-buying program next year as the recovery in the euro zone firms up. Ifo's improved outlook chimes with the projections of Germany's central bank, which has raised its growth forecasts for the German economy to a workday-adjusted 1.9 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018. Still, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said in a Reuters interview last week that the government was sticking to its more cautious growth outlook for Europe's biggest economy despite solid economic data and upbeat sentiment indicators. The government said in April that it expected an economic growth rate on a non-adjusted basis of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018.

As much as 2 million tonnes of sugar is estimated to arrive illegally in China each year, transported across porous borders with southern neighbours Vietnam and Myanmar and sold illegally at wholesale markets. Domestic producers have complained that the illegal imports, along with cheaper legal imports, have damaged their sales in recent years. But though last month's hike in import duties on legal shipments was welcomed by the local industry, analysts contacted then said it could further incentivise smuggling by keeping domestic prices high and reducing supplies. To bolster their efforts, the customs administration will strengthen inspections and the collecting of intelligence, it said in a statement on its website. Customs has confiscated 6,526 tonnes of smuggled sugar between February and the end of May, the statement said. They also uncovered 148 cases of sugar smuggling during this period, involving sugar worth 78.99 million yuan ($11.57 million). Those efforts are thought to have slowed the smuggling through Yunnan province, leading to the arrest of some traders and boosting domestic prices, traders and experts said. $1 = 6.8256 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-sugar-idUSL3N1JH2OY"},

Euro zone blue chips rose 0.4 percent while the broader regional index was up 0.3 percent. The DAX scaled a record high at 12,951.54 points in early trading, underpinned by strong consumer, banking and industrial stocks. The swift rebound in tech stocks over the past week had lifted Wall Street to another record high overnight. In Europe, Germany's Prosiebensat 1 led gains among media stocks after it sold its online travel agency Etraveli to CVC.  We are slightly surprised that the company did not sell a group of travel assets, but management suggests the rest of the travel portfolio remains under review,  they added. In the UK, gains on the FTSE 100, the worst performing major benchmark in Europe this year, were held in check by weakness in commodities companies, Wolseley and BT, though a weaker sterling helped support exporters. UK midcaps gained 0.2 percent. Ocado rose 3.7 percent, the top European gainer, as analysts continued to speculate over a potential next target for Amazon after its acquisition of Whole Foods roiled food retailers worldwide. Tuesday's gains put it on track for its best two-day run in nearly three years. Analysts at HSBC said Ocado, often mentioned as an M&A; target, was the least likely to be snapped up by Amazon if it extends its shopping list to UK supermarkets. Despite overall gains, large losses among some European stocks grabbed headlines. Groupe Eurotunnel, which runs Eurostar trains, fell 5.9 percent after suffering its second broker downgrade in as many weeks. Barclays cut the firm to a 'sell', citing slowing traffic and recent UK attacks which could impact tourism appetite. A downgrade from Credit Suisse sent business support services group DKSH down 4.3 percent. The Swiss broker said it expected the firm's growth rate to slow with downside risks including political uncertainty and demographic headwinds in Thailand weighing. Swedish real estate company Castellum fell 4.2 percent after pension fund AP2 sold the majority of its stake. Weaker copper and iron ore prices sent basic resources firms down 1.1 percent, while crude prices remained near seven-month lows, weighing on oil and gas stocks. British workspace company IWG was the worst-performing European stock set after Estorn Limited placed 27 million shares in the company for sale at 345.1 pence per share.

Ifo raised its growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent, adding that risks linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president have receded since the start of the year.  We assume the Brexit negotiations between Britain and the EU will go ahead without much turbulence, and an exit plan should emerge early on without any major negative effects on the economic interdependence between the EU and Britain,  said Wollmershaeuser of the talks which began on Monday. For 2018, the institute predicts Germany's gross domestic product will expand by 2.0 percent, up from the 1.8 percent it had predicted previously.      The upswing is being driven by the domestic economy, especially construction and consumption,  Wollmershaeuser added.  But now we have industry too. The improving economies of the euro zone and the rest of the world are significantly boosting exports.  Consumption, construction and state spending have been the main growth drivers in Germany as exports have gradually weakened. These three pillars of growth have been supported by a robust labor market and the low interest rate environment created by the European Central Bank's expansive policy.     Ifo expects there to be 44.2 million people employed this year, an all time high, compared with 43.6 million last year. That would be coupled with higher inflation, reaching 1.7 percent this year and 1.6 percent in 2018, compared with 0.6 percent in 2016. It said it expects the ECB to start exiting its bond-buying program next year as the recovery in the euro zone firms up. Ifo's improved outlook chimes with the projections of Germany's central bank, which has raised its growth forecasts for the German economy to a workday-adjusted 1.9 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018. Still, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said in a Reuters interview last week that the government was sticking to its more cautious growth outlook for Europe's biggest economy despite solid economic data and upbeat sentiment indicators. The government said in April that it expected an economic growth rate on a non-adjusted basis of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018.

The 10-year-old is still recovering from seeing Islamist gunmen kill his father for being Christian. In an attack claimed by Islamic State, gunmen ambushed a group of Coptic Christians traveling to a monastery in Minya in southern Egypt last month, killing 29 and wounding 24, with Mina's father Adel among the dead. A month later, residents of Dayr Jarnous, a Christian village that was home to seven of those killed, say the government is not providing proper security and has done nothing to help the victims' families. Mina is receiving therapy at a local church, in the absence of any treatment from the government. His brother Marco, 14, who also escaped the attack, visits a monastery to read the bible as a form of therapy.  Still shaken, village residents fear they are exposed if there is another attack and want President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to keep his promise to protect Christians. There was no extra security in the village, with only a police point out in the desert where the attack took place. In one of the first detailed eyewitness accounts of the Minya attack, which has led to retaliatory Egyptian air strikes in Libya, Mina told Reuters it was pure chance that he and Marco were spared.  They were on a pickup truck headed to the monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor when the militants stopped them. Ahead, blood-soaked bodies littered the desert road to the monastery and two vehicles had clearly been attacked.  We saw dead people, just dumped on the ground,  Mina recounted.  They asked my father for identification then told him to recite the Muslim profession of faith. He refused, said he was Christian. They shot him and everyone else with us in the car.  Mina said there were around 15 gunmen. He does not know why he and Marco were spared when other children were shot.  They saw us in the back of the truck. They made us get down and a man wearing camouflage like the army pointed his gun at us, but another one in all black told him to let us go. Every time they shot someone they would yell God is great.  Marco added:  They had Egyptian accents like us and they were all masked except for two of them ... They looked like us and did not have beards.  A butcher and his wife sit in Dayr Jarnous, the neighbourhood of schoolboy Mina Habib whose father was killed in last month's militant attack against a group of Coptic Christians in Minya, Egypt June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanyLion Hearted Three vehicles were attacked. A bus and a car taking children and families to the monastery were the first targets. The gunmen shot out the windows then killed all the men and fired at the feet of the women and children. They took the women's gold jewelry, eyewitnesses said. Some children were killed. When one of the gunmen's vehicles had a flat tire, they stopped Adel Habib's truck, which was carrying Christian workers, shot them and took the truck. Marco stopped a car when the militants left and put Mina in it to get him to safety. When at last he got mobile phone reception on the desert road, Marco called their mother. Slideshow (8 Images) I first thought it was someone trying to take the truck, I never thought it would be terrorism,  said Hanaa Youssef.  My husband has been going to the monastery for 25 years and nothing like this had ever happened.  Now she keeps her children at home - neighbors have written  Marco and Mina the lion-hearted  on its walls - only letting the boys out for therapy in church. Marco was unavailable for interview; he was at a monastery reading the bible.  Ever since the accident I am always at home,  said Mina.  Security, the government, and the army are negligent. No one protects us other than God. It is known that Christians are not protected in this country,  said Kirolos Ishak, a university student whose father was also killed that day. Coptic Christians, who make up 10 percent of Egypt's population of 92 million, say they have been persecuted for years. In recent months attacks have increased, leaving about 100 dead.  Egypt's Copts support Sisi, who has vowed to crush Islamist militants and protect Christians. He declared a three-month state of emergency after church bombings in April. But many Christians feel the state is failing to protect them.  Our Muslim neighbors say 'you chose Sisi' but ever since he came to power we are the ones who have suffered, not them,  said Youssef, the boys' mother.  Churches and people have been attacked, people have been kidnapped, we are suffering.

At over 30 years old, the Rough facility accounts for about 70 percent of UK storage capacity and a lack of new-build to replace it will increase dependency on imports over the next few years, boosting wholesale gas market volatility and prices, analysts and traders said.  Seasonal gas storage provides security and flexibility of supply. At times of low demand and therefore low gas prices in the summer, gas is injected into storage to be kept for when demand rises in the winter. Rough could cover a tenth of Britain's peak winter demand.   Due to the age and condition of Rough we can no longer safely inject gas into the reservoir and build up the pressure in the well,  a Centrica spokesman said.  Falling demand for gas storage facilities would have forced Centrica to close Rough regardless of the investment needed to refurbish its ageing wells, he added.  European utilities are losing billions of euros from gas storage facilities, triggering site closures and divestments in a market suffering from oversupply and weak demand. In a statement, Centrica said it intends to file applications to permanently end Rough's status as a storage facility but aims to produce all recoverable gas from the field, which is estimated at 183 billion cubic feet (bcf). Selling off the so-called cushion gas, used to maintain minimum reservoir pressure for the site to operate, would likely take several years, a Centrica spokesman said. Centrica is assessing how much gas could be available for sale.  Concerns about the integrity of wells at the site prompted Centrica in April to put off any further gas injections until at least April 2018. Without Rough, Britain would be more vulnerable to winter price shocks. Wholesale prices would have to rise to attract more gas from Norway, Europe or liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, with a knock-on effect on consumer prices.  The market will be more exposed to international price fluctuations as more imports will be required to balance Britain's gas market when cold,  Katrina Oldham, an energy trader at Inenco. Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski said the shutdown of Rough would lift British wholesale gas prices above continental gas hubs in winter and make them trade at a discount in summer, given that demand for injecting gas into storage would be less in summer months without Rough.  The effects could be compounded by potential changes to energy supply terms with EU countries if Britain leaves the internal energy market when it quits the European Union. Britain has seven other gas storage sites but they offer shorter injection and withdrawal times and less stock. Other storage operators are also struggling to cover their capital costs due to unfavorable market returns. In 2015, utility SSE decided to mothball a third of the withdrawal capacity at its Hornsea site.

South Africa's rand stabilised too having been spooked by talk of changing the central bank's mandate, Hungary looked set to slosh more cheap money into its banking system, while Russian stocks were on their best run in almost two months. Taiwan's stock market also hit a 17-year high but the main focus of the day was the potential landmark decision by global index provider MSCI on adding 169 mainland-China listed 'A-shares' to its widely tracked emerging market benchmark. Though it would represent a token 0.5 percent weighting in the index and represent just 5 percent of the mainland China stocks universe, it would be a symbolic step in recognising China's growing stature in financial markets.  It is a close call, but in our view they will be added to the index and according to our calculations it could create 7 billion of inflows (over time),  said senior emerging market strategist at Crédit Agricole Guillaume Tresca.  So it is positive but it is a long-term change, so I don't think it will be a trigger for CNY (yuan) appreciation or anything like that.  Chinese stocks dipped 0.2 percent overnight in Asia , but have risen more than 7 percent over the last month as the MSCI expectations have added to a growing sense that U.S. trade war risks have receded. Over the past two weeks, an average of 1.2 billion yuan ($177.15 million) has flowed into Chinese shares via the Connect each day, nearly 30 percent more than the average during the Jan-May period. Away from China, South Africa's rand regained some ground having slumped more than 1.5 percent on Monday after a public watchdog recommended changing the country's constitution to force the central bank to promote economic growth rather than currency and price stability. It was changing hands at 12.9950 per dollar in morning trade, government bond yields were steady after hitting a three-week high and stocks were down 0.5 percent, having been boosted almost 2 percent by Monday's rout in the rand. The central bank hit back on Tuesday saying Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane had no business in making recommendations about how it is run.  The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful,  it said. In central Europe, the Hungarian forint trod water with its central bank expected to keep interest rates at record lows later and pump more liquidity into money markets despite rising wage growth in the country. The NBH is regarded as one of central Europe's most dovish central banks and a Budapest-based trader said that barring any unexpected developments, the decisions would leave the forint somewhere between 307.30 to 308.50 versus the euro.  We expect the central bank to really remain on the dovish side,  added Crédit Agricole's Tresca.

The 10-year-old is still recovering from seeing Islamist gunmen kill his father for being Christian. In an attack claimed by Islamic State, gunmen ambushed a group of Coptic Christians traveling to a monastery in Minya in southern Egypt last month, killing 29 and wounding 24, with Mina's father Adel among the dead. A month later, residents of Dayr Jarnous, a Christian village that was home to seven of those killed, say the government is not providing proper security and has done nothing to help the victims' families. Mina is receiving therapy at a local church, in the absence of any treatment from the government. His brother Marco, 14, who also escaped the attack, visits a monastery to read the bible as a form of therapy.  Still shaken, village residents fear they are exposed if there is another attack and want President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to keep his promise to protect Christians. There was no extra security in the village, with only a police point out in the desert where the attack took place. In one of the first detailed eyewitness accounts of the Minya attack, which has led to retaliatory Egyptian air strikes in Libya, Mina told Reuters it was pure chance that he and Marco were spared.  They were on a pickup truck headed to the monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor when the militants stopped them. Ahead, blood-soaked bodies littered the desert road to the monastery and two vehicles had clearly been attacked.  We saw dead people, just dumped on the ground,  Mina recounted.  They asked my father for identification then told him to recite the Muslim profession of faith. He refused, said he was Christian. They shot him and everyone else with us in the car.  Mina said there were around 15 gunmen. He does not know why he and Marco were spared when other children were shot.  They saw us in the back of the truck. They made us get down and a man wearing camouflage like the army pointed his gun at us, but another one in all black told him to let us go. Every time they shot someone they would yell God is great.  Marco added:  They had Egyptian accents like us and they were all masked except for two of them ... They looked like us and did not have beards.  A butcher and his wife sit in Dayr Jarnous, the neighbourhood of schoolboy Mina Habib whose father was killed in last month's militant attack against a group of Coptic Christians in Minya, Egypt June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanyLion Hearted Three vehicles were attacked. A bus and a car taking children and families to the monastery were the first targets. The gunmen shot out the windows then killed all the men and fired at the feet of the women and children. They took the women's gold jewelry, eyewitnesses said. Some children were killed. When one of the gunmen's vehicles had a flat tire, they stopped Adel Habib's truck, which was carrying Christian workers, shot them and took the truck. Marco stopped a car when the militants left and put Mina in it to get him to safety. When at last he got mobile phone reception on the desert road, Marco called their mother. Slideshow (8 Images) I first thought it was someone trying to take the truck, I never thought it would be terrorism,  said Hanaa Youssef.  My husband has been going to the monastery for 25 years and nothing like this had ever happened.  Now she keeps her children at home - neighbors have written  Marco and Mina the lion-hearted  on its walls - only letting the boys out for therapy in church. Marco was unavailable for interview; he was at a monastery reading the bible.  Ever since the accident I am always at home,  said Mina.  Security, the government, and the army are negligent. No one protects us other than God. It is known that Christians are not protected in this country,  said Kirolos Ishak, a university student whose father was also killed that day. Coptic Christians, who make up 10 percent of Egypt's population of 92 million, say they have been persecuted for years. In recent months attacks have increased, leaving about 100 dead.  Egypt's Copts support Sisi, who has vowed to crush Islamist militants and protect Christians. He declared a three-month state of emergency after church bombings in April. But many Christians feel the state is failing to protect them.  Our Muslim neighbors say 'you chose Sisi' but ever since he came to power we are the ones who have suffered, not them,  said Youssef, the boys' mother.  Churches and people have been attacked, people have been kidnapped, we are suffering.

Tellingly, Monday's decision related to trademarks, not patents. Since its term began last October, the Supreme Court has thrown out all six patent-related decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which was set up to handle such cases. Since 2014, the high court has upheld the patent court in only two of 16 patent cases, a Reuters review showed. The lack of agreement between the high court and the patent court reflects a basic conflict at the top of the U.S. legal system over intellectual property rights, which are critical to many industries. The high court's pattern on patent law is part of a wider trend, under Chief Justice John Roberts, of the court siding with business in legal disputes that come before it. Business interests have won a string of victories in the current term, which is scheduled to end next week. Through its repeated reversals of the patent court, the Supreme Court is making it harder to sue companies using patents. That helps major technology firms such as Google , Apple and Samsung, all frequent targets of patent infringement lawsuits by  patent trolls.  Other industries, including drug and medical diagnostics companies, have warned against weaker patent rights.  The patent system has been weakened, and as far as I'm concerned the Supreme Court is unaware of that,  said Paul Michel, who retired as Federal Circuit chief judge in 2010. Michel said the high court's decisions had created huge uncertainty for companies and investors over patent rights and could affect research and development and innovation. Reached by Reuters, a representative for the Federal Circuit declined to comment. The Supreme Court's patent cases this term have been significant, including one involving Apple and Samsung over smartphones. In that case, the justices said the Federal Circuit misinterpreted the law on design patents. In another major case, the Supreme Court repudiated a 27-year-old Federal Circuit precedent and tightened where patent lawsuits may be filed, a blow to the  trolls,  or entities that generate revenue by suing over patents.  It’s pretty safe to say that it's one of the most impactful decisions of the term,  said Allyson Ho, a business lawyer, at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event on Friday. In an exception that perhaps proves the rule, the high court on Monday upheld the Federal Circuit's decision to strike down a law that prevents disparaging names from being trademarked. The Federal Circuit also handles some trademark cases. Condescending Tone The justices have sometimes adopted a condescending tone toward the Federal Circuit's patent rulings. During arguments in a 2014 case, Roberts suggested the Federal Circuit was failing at streamlining patent law, one of the reasons for its creation in 1982. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in an opinion that same year that the Federal Circuit  fundamentally misunderstands what it means to infringe  certain patents. When the patent court was founded, the judges  saw their mission as making patents stronger, and the Supreme Court thought it went too far and started to reel them in,  said Rochelle Dreyfuss, a professor of law at New York University who has studied the court.  Now the question is whether the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction.  She said the patent court was doing a better job explaining its rulings. It recently seated several new judges, and Sharon Prost, viewed as less pro-patent than her predecessor, became chief judge in 2014. Duke University law professor Arti Rai said the high court seemed to disapprove of treating patent law differently from other areas of law. The situation could spark further debate over the future trajectory of the specialist court, Rai said. For several years, attorneys, judges and professors have sparred over whether the court should retain exclusive control over patent cases. Some observers note that other appeals courts also go through periods of high reversal rates. Carter Phillips, who frequently argues patent cases, said that since the Federal Circuit was the sole appeals court to decide patent issues, the Supreme Court was more likely to review only those rulings it thinks are wrong.

For a change, Azarenka, who has four wins and 17 defeats against Williams, is a step ahead of the American having given birth to son Leo in December -- a day, she says, represented a  180 degree  turn in her life. While the former world number one and twice Australian Open champion resumes her career this week in Mallorca, Williams's baby is due in September with the American to return next year.  I've been friends off the court with Serena for a long time and I'm very happy for her,  Azarenka told Reuters as she prepared for her comeback on the Mallorcan grasscourts.  First of all I was so happy when she said she was pregnant but when I first heard I thought, 'Oh my God, I'll never have the chance to play against her again.' I was a little sad.  But it's incredible that she's coming back and I know that hopefully we'll face each other more times.  Azarenka, 27, has always been one of the most ferocious competitors on the women's circuit. Tennis has been all-consuming -- a diet of practise, tournaments, gym sessions and the all-too-regular rehabilitations from injury. Since becoming a mum, however, there is a new Azarenka.  Having Leo has changed my life 180 degrees,  the Belarusian explained.  I love every moment of being a mum. But now I have two different mentalities.  When I'm on the court, the only reason I'm there is that I love the game and I still have so much potential to improve. When I'm there I give 100 percent every time.  But after that I'm in a different mode. I switch off. That has always been so hard in the past.   I used to come back and watch tennis or talk about tennis, or check tennis on the internet. Now with Leo, it's easy to forget it.  Whenever I come back from practise I just want to spend time with Leo, read books, swim in the pool, regular stuff. He is a good napper too. When I'm practise he usually naps.  FILE PHOTO: Belarus' Victoria Azarenka hits a shot during her third round match against Japan's Naomi Osaka at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park, Australia, January 23, 2016.Jason Reed/File PhotoAzarenka, who is back on a protected ranking, believes the enforced 12-month break can help her become an even better player than before and maybe emulate Kim Clijsters, who returned after starting a family to win three of her four major titles.  I'm managing my time better now,  she said.  I get better quality time now. When it comes to practise I used to get there and talk and laugh, and waste some time.  Now I'm just there for one reason. I'm there, then I'm gone. I have a limited time and I need to make the best of it. You have a short time to have your priorities straight, to give it all for the sport you love, but it doesn't end here.   Tennis is not forever. More Meaningful  So for me to be able to continue my career with having already had a child, it's more meaningful. You can still chase your dream but I have a much bigger life purpose now.  Hopefully what Kim did and what hopefully Serena and I can do can inspire more women to do the same. It's a stereotype that only male players can succeed after having kids.  Azarenka is used to making comebacks. A foot injury kept her off court for five months in 2014 and she has suffered niggling injuries since. Her last tournament, the 2016 French Open, was curtailed by a knee injury. So this break from the game has been a happier one as it also allowed her to spend time with partner Billy McKeague, rediscover her roots in Minsk and support her mother, Ala, who has successfully fought cancer.  Emotionally it's completely different,  she said.  Absence because of injuries is a disappointment. But this was for a very happy reason and I think it can help me.  It was nice to experience the vibes in Minsk again. And it's given me time to work hard on my body, make sure I'm strong and can come back injury free,  she said.  I never really had that time before. I didn't really expect to play this early. I don't know how I'm going to do. But I'm ready to play and grind again and play a lot of matches.  Just need time to get the rhythm back. I don't know how long that will take but I will get there. Definitely. It's going to be fun.

This departure from traditional pork-rich dumplings is a hit with busy, young urbanites, trying to reduce the fat in diets often heavy on fast food.  They like to try to eat more healthy products once a week or fortnight. It's a big trend for mainland China consumers, especially those aged 20 to 35,  said Ellis Wang, Shanghai-based marketing manager at U.S. food giant General Mills, which owns top dumpling brand Wanchai Ferry. For pig farmers in China and abroad, it is a difficult trend to stomach. The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026. Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree, constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world's biggest pork market, while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports. Some have, for example, stopped using growth hormones banned in China. China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry this year, around twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. agriculture department estimates. More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market, especially for Western-style packaged meats. But pork demand has hit a ceiling, well ahead of most official forecasts. Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. Last year they hit three-year lows of 40.85 million tonnes from 42.49 million tonnes in 2014, and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017. Chinese hog prices are down around 25 percent since January, even though official numbers suggest supply is lower compared with last year. Rare Luxury Since China began opening up to the world in the late 1970s, pork demand expanded by an average 5.7 percent every year, until 2014 as the booming economy allowed hundreds of millions of people to afford to eat meat more often. During Mao Zedong's reign as Chinese leader from 1949-76 meat had, for many, been a rare luxury. Now, growing concerns about obesity and heart health shape shopping habits too, fuelling sales of everything from avocados to fruit juices and sportswear. [reut.rs/2rpFDhp] [reut.rs/2tis0Tg]  Market demand remains very weak. I think one factor behind this is people believe less meat is healthier. This is a new trend,  said Pan Chenjun, executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. Sales of vegetable-only dumplings grew 30 percent last year, compared with around 7 percent for all frozen dumplings, Nielsen research also shows.  Demand for vegetable products keeps rising, giving us large room for growth,  said Zhou Wei, product manager at number two dumpling producer Synear Food. Guangzhou-based Harmony Catering says health is the key to reduced servings of meat to the roughly 1 million workers eating at its 300 canteens each day. Staff at the technology companies, banks and oil majors that are Harmony's clients will consume about 10 percent less meat today than they did five years ago, but around 10 percent more green vegetables, according to Harmony vice president Li Huang.  It's mainly because of media, the concept of health has entered popular consciousness,  he said. For now, it's mostly urban and white-collar workers paying closer attention to their diets. There's been, for example, a sharp rise in vegetarian food stations at university campuses. But the government wants a nationwide shift in eating habits. Childhood obesity in China is rocketing, and the country also faces an epidemic of heart disease, Harvard researchers warned last year. Among the problems, they blamed growing consumption of red meat and high salt intake. In April, the health ministry kicked off its second 10-year healthy lifestyle campaign, urging citizens to consume less fat, salt and sugar, and aim for a 'healthy diet, healthy weight and healthy bones'. By 2030, Beijing wants to see a marked increase in nutritional awareness, a 20 percent cut in the per capita consumption of salt, and slower growth in the rate of obesity, it said in its recently published 'Healthy China 2030' pamphlet. Some companies have been urgently changing the mix of products they sell, going for higher-margin pork meats rather than volume. Sales of traditionally less popular lamb and beef have also been increasing. Li of Harmony Catering says although servings of pork are down, the firm is including more beef and lamb in meals.  People usually eat lean beef or lamb, like beef brisket, while with pork it's both fatty and lean parts, like in 'hong shao rou',  said Beijing-based nutritionist Chen Zhikun, referring to the widely consumed braised pork dish. China's top pork producer WH Group has been going up market, selling Western-style products in China, such as sausages and ham. A lot of this is imported from Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork producer, which was acquired by WH in 2013. Some producers say that the recent drop in pork consumption can be partly explained by sharply lower output. A prolonged period of losses during 2013 to 2015 forced farmers to cull millions of hogs, hitting supply and sending pork prices to record levels in 2016. But for a growing portion of Chinese consumers, price tags on food items are less and less important. A spate of safety scandals in recent years, many related to meat, have made urban Chinese highly sensitive to food quality. More than 80 percent of people in China surveyed by Nielsen last year said they were willing to pay more for foods without undesirable ingredients, much higher than the global average of 68 percent.

The trade-dependent economy has expanded for four quarters underpinned by rebounding exports. Even though momentum may cool in the second half, global demand for Taiwan's tech goods will bolster the economy and likely give the central bank leeway to keep interest rates on hold this week.  All major products showed year-on-year growth,  the finance  ministry said in a statement.  Order value from the U.S. market hit $10.36 billion, a record level for the month of May.   May orders rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier, beating the 6.85 percent forecast in a Reuters poll and compared with a 7.4 percent expansion in April. The ministry said that June export order value would be higher than May. Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months. Orders from China and the United States - its two biggest markets - rose an annual 14.5 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively. In April, they climbed 13.8 percent and 6 percent. Europe orders jumped 15.3 percent and from Japan, they surged 19.2 percent.  Taiwan raised its 2017 economic growth forecast to a three-year high in May, thanks to strong global demand for smartphones and other hi-tech electronic gadgets. Exports in May expanded for the eighth straight month as factories churned out supplies for Apple's new iPhone.

It's bringing together these data platforms with the knowledge of our engineers,  Airbus chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier said at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday.  Tony Fernandes, CEO of Air Asia, said the Airbus platform allowed the airline to increase the amount of data it can collect and analyze.   We have about 400 sensors on our aircraft, with the kit from Airbus we will go to 24,000 sensors, which means we can analyze so much than ever before,  he said, adding data could be used to improve turnaround times, training, safety as well in promotional applications.  The data can also be used to provide more predictive maintenance, allowing airlines to swap out parts before they fail and thus reducing time on the ground.   It will enable us to increase reliability and improve productivity, which are keys for success in the low cost business,  Shinichi Inoue, CEO of Japanese low cost carrier Peach Aviation, said. Marc Fontaine, digital transformation officer at Airbus, said the company wanted to extend the platform across the group, such as to military aircraft, its space business, and helicopters.

The 2017 China Private Wealth Report, by Bain Consulting and China Merchants Bank, put the number of high net worth individuals (HNWI)- with at least 10 million yuan ($1.47 million) of investable assets - at 1.6 million in 2016, nearly nine times the number a decade earlier. The report, issued every two years, forecasts a slower growth pace for the wealth business this year, but still sees substantial gains. It projects an 18 percent increase in HNWIs to 1.87 million by the end of 2017, and a 14 percent increase in China's private wealth market to 188 trillion yuan from 165 trillion yuan. In 2014-2016, the market grew 21 percent annually, the survey said.  Some asset classes like real estate are likely to have a larger impact on the slowing growth rate,  Liu Xin of Bain Consulting told reporters, adding that increased regulation and oversight of investment products including property, wealth management products and insurance will contribute to the slowdown. According to the report, around 120,000 HNWIs had at least 100 million yuan worth of investable assets, compared with fewer than 10,000 people in 2006. The percentage of HNWIs with overseas investment increased to 56 percent in 2017, from 19 percent in 2011, but the overall percentage of assets invested overseas has been stable since 2013. The top five destinations for overseas investment were Hong Kong, the United States, Australia, Canada and Singapore although between 2015 and this year Hong Kong's popularity fell 18 percent and the United States dropped 3 percent. High net worth individuals are keen to diversify the location of their investments and are looking further afield to places such as Australia, Singapore and Canada, Jennifer Zeng from Bain said. According to a 2015 study by Capgemini, China's population of high net worth individuals, which it defined as those with investable assets of at least $1 million, ranked fourth globally that year, behind the United States, Japan and Germany. $1 = 6.8166 Chinese yuan Reporting by Sue-Lin Wong and Shu Zhang; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Richard Borsuk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-wealthy-idUSL3N1JH261"},

The pound got a slight boost last week after two more policymakers on the Bank of England's eight-strong rate-setting committee joined outgoing Kristin Forbes in voting for a rate rise. But in a speech to London's banking community alongside Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, Carney cited weak wage growth and mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment as reasons for not moving to raise interest rates at the moment. Sterling sank to a one-week low of $1.2669 from $1.2758 after the text of Carney's Mansion House speech was released. It was last trading at $1.2691. It also fell over half a percent to a five-day low of 88.04 pence per euro. Ten-year yields on British government bonds fell below 1 percent after the text was released and last stood at 1.001 percent down 3 basis points on the day. Short sterling interest rate futures <0#FSS:> also rose strongly, especially for the late 2018 and early 2019 contracts, as the market priced in a shallower path of interest rate hikes in future years.    The FTSE 100 stocks index, whose externally-focused companies often benefits from a weaker pound, was up 0.24 percent, slightly outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. Consumer stocks were among the top FTSE gainers, helped by the prospect of lower interest rates for longer.  Carney doesn't want to be seen as reacting too quickly (to Brexit) - he's also fully aware the UK hasn't left the EU yet and he wants to keep his monetary policy loose on the off chance that the UK doesn't get an amazing deal,  said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets. Sterling investors also kept a wary eye on politics, with the dual uncertainty of having no government at home 12 days after a parliamentary election and talks, which began on Monday, on Britain's exit from the European Union adding to pressure on the pound. Prime Minister Theresa May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to form a government after her gamble on a snap election backfired, eroding her majority in parliament. Sterling sank nearly 3 percent after the election produced a parliament with no clear majority for any party and  disappointed investors who had earlier bet on a landslide victory for May. Data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed speculators took bets against the pound to the highest since early May in the week up to last Tuesday, the first reading of positioning since the election result. [IMM/FX]  The politics have the potential for a fair amount of volatility for sterling over the next few weeks and next few months in terms of the deals that are likely to be done,  said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley.

Mayweather, a former multi-weight world champion who retired in 2015 with a 49-0 record, is coming back to face McGregor on Aug. 26, three weeks before Golovkin's middleweight showdown with Mexican Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez at the same Las Vegas venue. Kazakhstan's Golovkin believes the 12-round boxing match between Mayweather and McGregor, a double UFC champion who has never boxed professionally, is nothing more than a business arrangement for both men to rake in millions of dollars.  This is not for fighters, but business,  Golvokin, who has won all 37 of his fights, told reporters of the non-title contest that is expected to draw a huge pay-per-view audience.  I think people understand what is a true fight, a boxing fight, like mine with Canelo or a big show, maybe sometimes for people a funny show, like a circus show.  Everybody knows.

The attack last month struck Bangkok's Phramongkutklao Hospital and injured more than 20 people. It coincided with the third anniversary of a May 2014 military coup.

I'm a normal person who doesn't agree with a military government that wasn't elected.  He said he acted alone. Police said Wattana had been appointed a police lawyer. Reuters was not immediately able to contact the lawyer. Wattana has been held and questioned at an army base, used by the military as a temporary prison.  The military has the power to detain civilians at military camps without charge and rights activists say some face unfair trials in military courts, which the junta has designated for cases involving national security. Since the coup, the military has kept a tight lid on dissent by arresting critics and banning public protests. But the capital has seen sporadic violence including a deadly explosion at a shrine in August 2015 that killed 20 people, most of them foreigners.  Two men, Uighur Muslims from China's restive Xinjiang region, are on trial for that bombing which authorities have said was retaliation for a crackdown on human-smuggling networks. National police chief Jakthip Chaijinda said he had ordered further investigations into the recent bombings, adding that Wattana may not have acted alone. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said further unrest could mean a delay in a general election which is expected to take place next year. On Tuesday, however, he said the vote was still on course.

Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 election after a lackluster campaign during which her poll lead of 20 points or more evaporated. The Conservatives still won the largest number of House of Commons seats, but are now having to seek a deal with a small Northern Irish party to support their minority government. Ipsos Mori said age was a bigger dividing factor than in any election since it began keeping detailed records in 1979. It said Labour increased its share of the vote among people aged 18 to 34 by 20 percentage points, while the Conservatives lost support. May's party picked up vote share among older voters, achieving a 7-point gain in the 45-54 age group and a 14-point increase in voters aged over 55. An increase in turnout among younger voters, compared with the previous election in 2015, was also crucial.  Compared to 2015, turnout rose most among young people, to match their estimated turnout levels in the EU referendum, while it fell very slightly among older people – but older people were still much more likely to vote overall,  Ipsos Mori said. As well as age, Ipsos Mori said class was a factor in the outcome, with more middle-class voters, who usually favor the Conservatives, choosing Labour, while the opposite trend was seen in lower-income groups. The findings chime with much analysis that has appeared since the election, focusing on the generational divide.  Political analysts have said younger voters, who are facing challenges such as record-high university tuition fees and housing costs, were enthused by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's youth-friendly policies such as abolishing tuition fees. In contrast, older voters, who are more likely to own homes and to have benefited from decades of rising property prices, were far more receptive to the Conservatives' message of low tax and fiscal discipline. Both main parties increased their share of the national vote compared with 2015, at the expense of smaller parties. But Labour's share increased by 9.5 points to 40 percent, while the Conservatives' increased by 5.5 points to 42.4 percent. Under Britain's first-past-the-post voting system, the number of seats each party wins is determined by how they do in each of the 650 constituencies, or electoral districts. The stronger surge in support for Labour meant that some tightly contested seats went from the ruling to the opposition party. Overall, the Conservatives lost 13 seats, while Labour gained 30.

The market regulator said in a statement that the probe  deals with suspicions of violations of the securities law and the penal code relating to transactions connected to the controlling shareholder . It did not elaborate. Trading in Bezeq and its parent companies was halted in Tel Aviv following the announcement. The company said it learned of the investigation on Tuesday morning and that its offices were searched.  The company does not have any additional information about the nature and circumstances of the investigation,  it said. Bezeq is controlled by its chairman, Shaul Elovitch, through holding company Eurocom Group, which declined to comment. But another Eurocom subsidiary, Internet Gold, said it was suspending a planned bond issue as a result of the investigation. Eurocom gives Elovitch control over a myriad of assets like satellite operator Spacecom and Enlight Renewable Energy. He is also a close friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a relationship that bars Netanyahu from dealing with all things Bezeq.  A prolonged trading halt is a rather rare procedure which requires approval from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's chairman and cannot exceed one trading day and gives the company a chance to provide colour to the market,  Barclays analyst Tavy Rosner said in a note. Israel's financial news websites reported that investigators were focusing on a recent deal in which Bezeq bought control of its satellite TV unit from Eurocom. Bezeq has dominated Israel's telecom sector for decades and, with a generous dividend policy of distributing all its net profit, is a favourite among foreign investors. Looking to shore up its position further, Bezeq is lobbying the government to end a forced separation of its fixed-line, mobile and satellite TV units. However, opponents say that allowing Bezeq to combine its subsidiaries into a single company will stifle competition.

Sterling hit a one-week low after Mark Carney dashed prospects of an early rise in borrowing costs after three BoE members surprised markets by voting for a hike last week. The sterling effect turned the FTSE around from a lacklustre start of trading, with some weak company updates weighing. The index was up 0.2 percent by 0920 GMT. The prospect of lower rates for longer boosted housebuilders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey, which were among the top FTSE gainers. Shares in plumbing and heating supplier Wolseley fell 3.4 percent after its quarterly results. The firm saw sales growth in all its regions except the UK, adding to signs that Britons are cutting back on big ticket spending. Analysts at Liberum and Davy Research said eroding margins in its U.S. business were disappointing. BT fell up to 1.6 percent, then paring losses after France's Orange said it could get $1.15 billion by cutting its stake in the British telecoms company. A downgrade to 'neutral' from BAML on Monday also weighed. Antofagasta, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto reined blue-chips back, falling on lower copper and iron ore prices. Barclays was in focus after the bank and four former senior executives were criminally charged over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during a 12 billion pound emergency fundraising in 2008. The announcement, which had been anticipated, left Barclays shares down 0.3 percent. Domino's Pizza fell 5.1 percent to a 16-month low after Investec initiated coverage of the company with a 'sell'. Workspace provider IWG was set for its worst day in a year after Estorn Limited placed 27 million shares in the company for sale at 345.1 pence per share. Despite the losses from IWG and Domino's, mid-caps rose 0.2 percent gain, with Serco up 2.9 percent after winning a $2 billion contract to run an Australian prison. Consumer, financial and tech stocks were the main drivers for the FTSE 250 index which, having suffered heavy losses on Thursday, was climbing back up to near record highs on Tuesday. Among small caps, plus-size clothes retailer N Brown jumped 12 percent to a 14-month high after a strong start to the year with first-quarter revenue up 10 percent and loss-making store closures pleasing investors.

Nestle did not disclose its exact investment, which it said would help Freshly build a new East Coast kitchen and distribution center in 2018 as it prepares to expand its U.S. service nationwide.  Nestle USA's Food Division President Jeff Hamilton would join Freshly's board of directors. Nestle shares rose 0.8 percent by 0920 GMT. The world's largest packaged foods maker is becoming more health and nutrition-focused as a new generation of savvy consumers demand fresher and healthier foods. It said last week it could exit its U.S. confectionary business.  The deal comes just days after Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said  it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) for $13.7 billion, in a deal that could turn the high-end natural and organic supermarket chain into a mass-market retailer.

Wind and solar advocates have said the government study's outcome appeared to be pre-determined to favor fossil fuel industries. The new report, commissioned by the American Wind Energy Association and Advanced Energy Economy, says cheap natural gas is behind most of the decline in the numbers of U.S. coal-fired power plants in recent years, not government subsidies that have bolstered the growth of wind and solar power. It also said there is no evidence to show that wind and solar energy are threatening the reliability of the electric grid. The groups commissioned the report shortly after Energy Secretary Rick Perry in April ordered a 60-day study of the reliability of the grid and said Obama-era policies offering incentives for the deployment of renewable energy had come at the expense of energy sources like coal and nuclear. With the 60-day deadline for the DOE study looming this month, AWEA and AEE released their own analysis of the issue performed by economic consulting firm Analysis Group. The authors of the analysis found that the rapid growth of renewable energy and related policies were  a distant second to market fundamentals in causing financial pressure  on coal plants without long-term contracts. Market forces such as new, more-efficient efficient natural gas plants, low natural gas prices and flat electricity demand are the biggest contributor to coal plants' inability to compete, the report found. The analysis also found that greater diversity of technologies made the system more reliable.   There are lots of different technologies that fill different pieces of the reliability puzzle,  said Susan Tierney, one of the report's authors.  That led us to believe that there is not a problem on the horizon for reliability.  The DOE's grid study is expected to be released later this month.

Fendi, who died late on Monday and was the fourth of the sisters, was the public face of the company famous for its line of colorful  baguette  bags that cost thousands of dollars. While other members of the family were the creative forces, Carla concentrated on promoting the company brand, whose logo of two F's, one of them upside down and backwards, became an internationally recognized symbol for luxury. The multinational LVMH luxury group gained a controlling stake in Fendi in 2001 in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars that brought together some of the world's most famous luxury brands. LVMH significantly increased its stake later. It was a far cry from the family's humble origins nearly a century ago. The sisters' mother, Adele Casagrande, opened a small leather workshop in 1918 just off Rome's bustling Piazza Venezia. Adele Casagrande married Eduardo Fendi in 1925 and the two opened a small boutique next door and lived above the shop. The five sisters were born between 1931 and 1940 and as children they played among the leather shreds on the shop floor and slept amid the handbags.  Accessories were our first toys,  Carla Fendi once told Women's Wear Daily. The sisters moved to company to the chic neighborhood around Rome's Spanish steps in the 1960s and in later expanded into ready-to-wear, shoes, perfume, household goods and children's wear. The company received a big boost from the creative collaboration of Karl Lagerfeld, who helped in the design of  clothes, furs, and accessories. Animal rights activists frequently protested against the company for its use of furs. In her later years, Carla Fendi became a well-known patron of the arts. Deeply committed to Rome and its culture, her foundation financed the restoration of the city's famous Trevi Fountain. She was also a chief patron of the Two Worlds arts festival in the Umbrian city of Spoleto.

The shortage of pilots is a problem today. There's demand today, so people need to start building a strategy with us or other professional academies to be able to build that pipeline,  Nick Leontidis, CAE's Group President for civil aviation training solutions told journalists at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday. Rival L3 (LLL.N) also operates pilot training academies.  To meet demand, Leontidis said CAE would seek to grow its own training academy business, rather than make acquisitions.        Pilot unions in the United States have said low wages and limited benefits for entry-level positions are deterring a new generation of potential aviators from pursuing the career. In the United States, training requirements also are a hurdle for many would-be pilots.     The United States is the only country to require co-pilots to have at least 1,500 flight hours unless they have experience flying planes in the military or are graduates of certain specialized programs. According to the U.N.'s aviation agency, which sets global standards typically adopted by regulators from its 191-member countries, it takes a minimum of about 250 hours to obtain a commercial pilot license for work as a co-pilot.      By contrast, 1,500 hours is the minimum required to become a captain under norms set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.N. agency that supports the development of global aviation.     While the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration previously had followed ICAO norms, the 1,500-hour requirement for co-pilots was imposed following the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, a regional jet, in 2009, that killed 50 people.     The 1,500-hour mandate is supported by pilots' unions as a way to improve air safety.

Fendi, who died late on Monday and was the fourth of the sisters, was the public face of the company famous for its line of colorful  baguette  bags that cost thousands of dollars. While other members of the family were the creative forces, Carla concentrated on promoting the company brand, whose logo of two F's, one of them upside down and backwards, became an internationally recognized symbol for luxury. The multinational LVMH luxury group gained a controlling stake in Fendi in 2001 in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars that brought together some of the world's most famous luxury brands. LVMH significantly increased its stake later. It was a far cry from the family's humble origins nearly a century ago. The sisters' mother, Adele Casagrande, opened a small leather workshop in 1918 just off Rome's bustling Piazza Venezia. Adele Casagrande married Eduardo Fendi in 1925 and the two opened a small boutique next door and lived above the shop. The five sisters were born between 1931 and 1940 and as children they played among the leather shreds on the shop floor and slept amid the handbags.  Accessories were our first toys,  Carla Fendi once told Women's Wear Daily. The sisters moved to company to the chic neighborhood around Rome's Spanish steps in the 1960s and in later expanded into ready-to-wear, shoes, perfume, household goods and children's wear. The company received a big boost from the creative collaboration of Karl Lagerfeld, who helped in the design of  clothes, furs, and accessories. Animal rights activists frequently protested against the company for its use of furs. In her later years, Carla Fendi became a well-known patron of the arts. Deeply committed to Rome and its culture, her foundation financed the restoration of the city's famous Trevi Fountain. She was also a chief patron of the Two Worlds arts festival in the Umbrian city of Spoleto.

The shortage of pilots is a problem today. There's demand today, so people need to start building a strategy with us or other professional academies to be able to build that pipeline,  Nick Leontidis, CAE's Group President for civil aviation training solutions told journalists at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday. Rival L3 (LLL.N) also operates pilot training academies.  To meet demand, Leontidis said CAE would seek to grow its own training academy business, rather than make acquisitions.        Pilot unions in the United States have said low wages and limited benefits for entry-level positions are deterring a new generation of potential aviators from pursuing the career. In the United States, training requirements also are a hurdle for many would-be pilots.     The United States is the only country to require co-pilots to have at least 1,500 flight hours unless they have experience flying planes in the military or are graduates of certain specialized programs. According to the U.N.'s aviation agency, which sets global standards typically adopted by regulators from its 191-member countries, it takes a minimum of about 250 hours to obtain a commercial pilot license for work as a co-pilot.      By contrast, 1,500 hours is the minimum required to become a captain under norms set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.N. agency that supports the development of global aviation.     While the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration previously had followed ICAO norms, the 1,500-hour requirement for co-pilots was imposed following the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, a regional jet, in 2009, that killed 50 people.     The 1,500-hour mandate is supported by pilots' unions as a way to improve air safety. However, regional airlines and some aviation experts say the tougher standard does not make flying any safer and has exacerbated the pilot shortage by making the training process longer and more costly.  Reporting by Alana Wise in New York and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Additional reporting by Victoria Bryan in Paris; Editing by Joseph White, Bill Trott and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/airshow-paris-cae-idUSL1N1JH06Q"},

A day after the start of Brexit talks, Hammond sought to soften the more confrontational tone towards the bloc taken by Prime Minister Theresa May - a role he has re-adopted since her election flop earlier this month.  Our departure from the EU is under way. But ensuring that it happens via a smooth pathway to a deep and special future partnership with our EU neighbours, one that protects jobs, prosperity, and living standards in Britain will require every ounce of skill and diplomacy,  he said in a speech.  ...Yesterday was a positive start. It will get tougher. But we are ready for the challenge.  Almost a year to the day since British voters decided to leave the EU, the Brexit strategy debate within the government has been opened up again by May's unexpected failure to win a parliamentary majority in the June 8 ballot. She had raised concerns among many businesses in Britain by saying that no deal with the EU was better than a bad deal, raising the prospect of an abrupt Brexit. Hammond had looked set to lose his job until May's election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business' leading proponent in the government, a role he reinforced on Tuesday by emphasising the need for  mutually beneficial transitional arrangements to avoid unnecessary disruption and dangerous cliff edges.  In his speech, Hammond also reiterated he planned to stick to the government's target of turning Britain's budget deficit into a surplus by the mid-2020s, despite pressure from the resurgent opposition Labour Party for more public spending.  Crusade  for Services In his annual Mansion House speech, Hammond said Britain would almost certainly need an implementation period as it left the EU's single market and its customs union  with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, speaking after Hammond, said companies might soon start to activate contingency plans if a transitional deal did not appear likely. Hammond said he wanted Britain to lead a  crusade  for the opening up of services markets around the world as it leaves the EU, reflecting the importance of a sector that accounts for around 80 percent of Britain's economic output. Speaking to an audience packed with banking executives, he took a swipe at recent moves by the EU to try to shift some of Britain's financial services to the bloc.  We are already hearing protectionist agendas being advanced, disguised as arguments about regulatory competence, financial stability, and supervisory oversight,  he said.  We can have no truck with that approach.  The EU's executive said last week it planned to give itself powers to move euro clearing business away from London's financial sector to the EU after Brexit. However, Hammond made a point of acknowledging the concerns of other EU countries about their oversight of financial markets which are vital to their economies but will be outside the bloc. Hammond also reiterated his calls for Britain to remain open to skilled workers, reflecting a key concern among businesses which are worried that they might face big hurdles to hiring EU workers after Brexit.

Susan Thornton, the U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said that China has taken only a limited role in counter-terrorism efforts, although it appeared to be becoming more interested.  We would like to see them step up and take more responsibility,  Thornton told reporters as Washington and China's diplomatic and defense chiefs prepared for a meeting in the U.S. capital on Wednesday.  They have a lot of interests, for example in Iraq, and we think they should be doing to more to contribute to the efforts of the international coalition to defeat ISIS (Islamic State),  she said. Thornton said Beijing, which is not a member of the 68-member coalition, was increasingly affected by terrorism, as was seen by the recent killing of two Chinese nationals in Pakistan.  Beijing has sent out  early feelers  about getting more involved, Thornton said.  We'd like to have a good discussion with them about what more we think they can do, certainly in the way of providing resources to governments that are battling against terrorism and trying to help with capacity-building for governments and security forces in various places,  she added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday that China and the United States were both victims of terrorism.  Cooperation is in the interests of both sides,  he said, without elaborating. Wednesday's talks will involve U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis as well as China's top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of state of the People’s Liberation Army. The State Department says they will focus on ways to step up pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs, but also cover areas such as counter-terrorism and territorial rivalries in the strategic South China Sea. The United States has been at odds with China over the latter's building and fortifying of islands in the disputed waterway. Thornton said now that there were moves towards agreeing a code of conduct over the South China Sea, Washington would like to see a freeze on all such construction activity. She reiterated a call on China to fully implement U.N. sanctions on North Korea and, while praising Beijing for imposing a ban on North Korean coal imports, added:  We would like to see China do more.

Yet the company, whose assets include mobile phone company 3 Group, stopped short of denying a report in the Wall Street Journal that said Li had told associates he planned to step down as chairman by next year. The report, citing people briefed by Li, said he had not given a specific date and would likely remain a senior adviser even after stepping down.  Mr Li has from time to time talked about his retirement and his confidence in (deputy chairman) Victor (Li Tzar-kuoi) to lead the company,  a company spokesman said in an email.  Mr Li is in very good health and will make his official announcement when he decides to retire.   The spokesman said there was no timetable. Li, Hong Kong's richest man, anointed his eldest son Victor, 52, as his successor five years ago. Victor, already on the board, is seen as a steady hand unlikely to change course.  The retirement has been well expected. Within the company the division of work has long been in place and Victor Li has been running the company,  said Alvin Cheung, associate director of Prudential Brokerage Ltd in Hong Kong.   With the help of so many senior executives the transition will be smooth.      Li's likely retirement is no surprise - the tycoon turns 90 next July - but it marks the end of an era for Hong Kong. With a net worth of $33.2 billion, Li is symbolic of a generation of self-made Hong Kong businessmen who tapped into the former fishing village's rapid development in the 60s and helped turn a small city into a financial hub. His rise, from plastic flowers, then to property and a global empire, has mirrored that of his city. News of his potential retirement comes as Hong Kong marks the 20th anniversary of its handover from Britain to China. In recent years, Li has been investing heavily overseas. Nearly half of CK Hutchison's revenue now comes from Europe, with Britain accounting for just over a fifth. Flowers to Ports Li, who fled Japanese-occupied mainland China with his family in 1940, is one of several first generation Hong Kong tycoons, preparing to pass the baton. From the 1970s, Li and billionaire peers including Lee Shau-kee of Henderson Land (0012.HK) and Cheng Yu-tung of New World Development Co (0017.HK) saw their businesses expand at breakneck pace. Hong Kong was growing fast and favorable regulations helped them dominate the city's transport, retail and property sectors.  Cheng died last year. Lee remains actively involved in the business. But this oligopoly has come under pressure in recent years as growth slows and competition from companies from mainland China heats up. Political pressure to equal the playing field has also increased. Li, who remains very prominent in the running of his companies, appeared jovial and healthy when he met reporters in March. At the time he raised the prospect of retirement and said he could step back into the role of senior adviser.  I will be turning 90 next year.

The trade-dependent economy has expanded for four quarters underpinned by rebounding exports. Even though momentum may cool in the second half, global demand for Taiwan's tech goods will bolster the economy and likely give the central bank leeway to keep interest rates on hold this week.  All major products showed year-on-year growth,  the finance  ministry said in a statement.  Order value from the U.S. market hit $10.36 billion, a record level for the month of May.   May orders rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier, beating the 6.85 percent forecast in a Reuters poll and compared with a 7.4 percent expansion in April. The ministry said that June export order value would be higher than May. Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months. Orders from China and the United States - its two biggest markets - rose an annual 14.5 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively. In April, they climbed 13.8 percent and 6 percent. Europe orders jumped 15.3 percent and from Japan, they surged 19.2 percent.  Taiwan raised its 2017 economic growth forecast to a three-year high in May, thanks to strong global demand for smartphones and other hi-tech electronic gadgets. Exports in May expanded for the eighth straight month as factories churned out supplies for Apple's new iPhone.

Ageas announced on 16 June 2017 that the Amsterdam Court of Appeal did not make the settlement reached between Ageas and the claimant organisations on 14 March 2016 binding for all eligible Fortis shareholders. The court was concerned about the distribution of the settlement amount of EUR1.2 billion between non-active and active claimants and the related compensations for the claimant organisations. Fitch upgraded Ageas SA/NV's IDR to 'A' on 15 March 2016 on the expectation that the Amsterdam Court of Appeal would declare the settlement binding for all eligible Fortis shareholders. Previously, the litigation risk was reflected in Ageas SA/NV's IDR being one notch lower than the IDR of the other entities in the group. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal's recent ruling is contrary to Fitch's expectations; however, Fitch understands from management that Ageas intends to re-submit an amended agreement by the legal deadline of 17 October 2017. The agreement, if declared binding by the Dutch court, would significantly reduce litigation risk and enhance future financial flexibility. If Ageas fails to submit an amended agreement by 17 October 2017, or the Court does not make the revised agreement binding, in the context of heightened litigation risk Fitch will review Ageas's IDR. Fitch will continue to monitor civil proceedings and will comment further as appropriate.

Britain, the EU's biggest financial market, is leaving the bloc in 2019, raising the prospect of an abrupt cut in cross-border links without a new trade deal. Rival financial centers, including Frankfurt, Paris and Luxembourg, are vying to benefit.  Hammond said Britain's Brexit negotiations with the EU would take a  pragmatic approach  to financial services and how they are supervised.   Fragmentation of financial services would result in poorer quality, higher priced products for everyone concerned,  Hammond told a financial audience in London. At present, banks and insurers in London serve the EU market from a single base, but this  passporting  is set to end after Brexit without new arrangements.  First, we will need a new process for establishing regulatory requirements for cross-border business between the UK and EU. It must be evidence-based, symmetrical and transparent.  And it must reflect international standards,  Hammond said.  Second, cooperation arrangements must be reciprocal, reliable, and prioritize financial stability. Crucially they must enable timely and coordinated risk management on both sides.   Related CoverageUK's Hammond says challenge to avoid 'cliff-edge' Brexit Third, these arrangements must be permanent and reliable for the businesses regulated under these regimes,  Hammond said. Without passporting, banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain would only be allowed to access the bloc's single market if they set up costly subsidiaries in the EU, which some are planning, or by using the EU's  equivalence  regime. Brussels allows market access to foreign firms whose home rules are  equivalent  to those in the bloc, but this can be withdrawn at short notice. Last week the bloc proposed toughening  equivalence  for foreign central counterparties (CCPs) or clearing houses used by EU customers, seen by London's financial sector as a land grab. Under the proposals, a foreign CCP that clears large amounts of euro-denominated business must be directly supervised by EU regulators and, if necessary, the business moved to the bloc to safeguard financial stability. Genuine Concerns Hammond said  protectionist agendas  were being advanced, disguised as arguments about financial stability and supervisory oversight. But in a broad hint that Britain would accept some loss of regulatory sovereignty after Brexit to avoid loss of market share, he said the bloc has  genuine and reasonable  concerns about financial markets outside its jurisdiction.  We saw such a concern articulated in the EU's proposal on supervision of CCPs last week. We must, and we will, engage with all genuine concerns,  Hammond said. London-based LCH (LSE.L) dominates euro clearing, and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who spoke alongside Hammond, said fragmentation of the business was in nobody's interest and could actually damage financial stability.  Any development which prevented EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else,  Carney said. Authorities should instead build on current models to develop  a new form of regulatory and supervisory cooperation .  The European Commission’s proposals announced last week recognize the importance of effective cooperation arrangements between the relevant EU authorities and their overseas counterparts,  Carney said.   The Bank welcomes this.  Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alison Williams and Andrew Heavens","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-economy-eu-banks-idUSL8N1JH1E2"},

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, fresh from a meeting which saw three colleagues on the bank's policy committee vote for higher rates, knocked half a percent off Britain's pound by saying  now was not the time  to adjust borrowing costs. Similarly, in a speech late in U.S. time on Monday, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise rates again. After jitters on hi-tech stocks this month, that leaves markets confident that major central banks will not be tightening the flow of cash which has kept markets rising for eight years, at a time when growth globally looks solid.  Companies are in aggregate in robust health, and with all the cash from quantitative easing still washing around the system, there is a lack of alternatives for investors to put their money in,  said Andy Sullivan a portfolio manager with GL Asset Management UK in London.  Low rates - and the negative return on cash that they continue to generate - just sustain that dynamic.  The Nikkei closed 0.8 percent higher on the day, having earlier gained more than 1 percent. European markets gained between a quarter and half a percent in early trading   . The technology sector which has led U.S. stock market gains this year, fell for a second week last week but they saw a strong rebound on Monday that helped push Wall Street indexes  to record highs.  Hi-tech shares just went through a correction,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities.  Valuation is not that expensive, standing far below their levels at the peak of the dot-com bubble ... Given that their profits are expected to see exponential growth in coming years, it is premature to say the rally in hi-tech shares is over.  The votes for higher rates at the Bank of England's meeting last week propped up the pound after an almost 3 cent fall on the back of surprise election results two weeks ago. But Carney, in a speech delayed from last week due to fire in London, played down the chances of any swift move at a time when the hard data on the UK economy has been worsening. The pound hit a one-week low of $1.2671 after his comments on rates.

About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees at its three factory facilities joined the protest, union chief Zoroslav Smolinsky said, adding that production would be hit. VW declined to comment on the impact of the first-ever strike at a major Slovak plant, which comes as economies across central Europe outpace western Europe, leading to a labour shortage that many companies worry limits growth. On Monday, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico supported the unlimited strike action by the VW workers, which began as labour office data on Tuesday showed Slovakia's unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent in May, the lowest since the global financial crisis hit central Europe in 2008.  Why should a company making one of highest-quality and most luxurious cars with a high labour productivity pay its Slovak workers half or one third of the amount it pays to the same workers in western Europe?  Fico said to reporters. But VW's Slovak unit said last week that union demands for a heftier pay hike would endanger the plant's competitiveness within the car group and also job stability. The VW workers are seeking a 16 percent pay hike and have refused management's offer of a 4.5 percent raise this year and 4.2 percent raise next year, plus bonuses.  We deserve at least a double-digit raise,  Smolinsky said. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016. The company pays an average wage of 1,800 euros ($2,008) a month, double the national average. That figure is also higher than the average salary of 37,000 crowns ($1,577) that VW pays at its Czech carmaker Skoda Auto. Slovakia's Finance Ministry has calculated 12 days of an uninterrupted strike would cut 0.1 percentage points off the country's annual economic output. Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in the coming years, with the car sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, makes more than a 1 million vehicles a year and is the biggest per capita producer in the world. Besides VW, Kia and Peugeot run plants in Slovakia and Jaguar Land Rover is building a plant due online next year. Peugeot and Kia have raised wages at their Slovak plants by 6.3 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively.

Major Chinese firms including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), search giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and e-commerce platform JD.com Inc (JD.O) all picked New York over Hong Kong for initial public offerings (IPOs). So the new rules offer Hong Kong a chance to bring the tech titans closer to home with a secondary listing. But bankers say these companies are not likely to get a big pickup in valuation or trading activity to justify the cost and regulatory burden of a secondary listing.  The appeal for unlisted companies is more obvious than for already-listed companies, especially for the non-giants. If your market cap exceeds $10 billion, your liquidity and valuation is global,  said Kai Fang, head of equity capital markets at boutique investment bank China Renaissance, which has advised on some of China's top technology deals. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK), which operates the stock exchange, unveiled a proposal on Friday for a new board that would allow companies with share structures providing special voting rights, and those yet to make a profit, to list. They were the two key hurdles that prompted Chinese startups to choose New York instead of Hong Kong for IPOs. If approved, the changes could be implemented at the beginning of 2018, HKEX chief executive Charles Li said on Friday. Potential new business for the exchange could be significant. Chinese companies targeted by the new board raised IPO funds of $49 billion in the past 10 years, including $34 billion raised by mainland companies that listed in the United States with weighted voting rights structures, the HKEX said. Those included Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com. Another $15 billion was raised by Chinese companies that had yet to make a profit. Such a voting-rights structure is critical for many unlisted Chinese firms such as ride hailing company Didi Chuxing, Ant Financial and food delivery provider Meituan-Dianping. The three companies, with a combined valuation of about $130 billion, have different classes of stock to give founders control of the companies.  They're trying to attract some of the high profile companies that have dual class structures and wouldn't list here otherwise,  said an investment banker who worked on recent Chinese technology listings in the United States and who declined to be identified.  Without those changes, these companies just won't come to Hong Kong, full stop.  Still, some companies with little turnover or low valuations overseas might seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong to bolster their prospects, including Chinese firms that had been considering a delisting from New York. Manchester United (MANU.N), which scrapped a Hong Kong IPO because of its dual share structure, could get a boost from Asian investors appetite for sports-related assets, the bankers said.  If you're looking at some companies that have relatively low liquidity in the U.S., then the dual listing could make sense,  Fang added.  The Hong Kong stock exchange is trying to find a way to lure some companies that might originally achieve a premium valuation in Hong Kong, but due to the voting rights issue they choose to list somewhere else.

Trading was pretty quiet, although we continued to see some buying of Chinese asset-management companies' 10-year bonds,  said a Hong Kong-based trader. The Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment-grade index was little changed at 83.5bp/85.25bp. The bonds of Australian major banks largely showed little adverse impact of Moody's one-notch downgrades to Aa3, with stable outlooks, of its ratings on the issuers. The newly priced floating-rate notes of ICBC, Hong Kong branch, were hovering at reoffer, said the trader. The Chinese lender priced US$300m floaters of 3 years at 3-month Libor plus 77bp and US$400m notes of 5 years at Libor plus 87bp. Road King Infrastructure's newly US$300m 7.00% perpetuals, which were priced at par, traded up and were bid at a cash price of around 100.3 in the afternoon. Noble Group's 6% perpetual bonds, callable in 2019, plunged more than 5 points to a cash price of 10 bid. This was after the commodity trader said it would delay the payment of a coupon due on the perps. The coupon is due on June 24, but payable on June 26, the next working day. Its 8.75% 2022s fell around 2 points to 35.5/37.5, according to Tradeweb. Gome Electrical's 5% 2020s were flat at 100.25, even though the company announced plans for a tap of up to US$100m of the issue. David Tan, chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors' Asia Pacific fixed income, remains positive on Asia high-yield credits as these bonds continue to offer attractive returns, while default rates are low.  With the unpredictability surrounding the Trump administration, we expect market volatility to escalate. Against the uncertain backdrop, we believe an actively managed Asian fixed income portfolio can continue to offer decent yield pick-up with relatively lower volatility within the broader emerging market universe, supported by Asia's improved fundamentals,  Tan said.

At 0811 GMT, most central European currencies were little changed, with the Romanian leu gaining 0.1 percent and the Polish zloty shedding 0.1 percent. Main stock markets were a tad weaker after Monday's rally.     Analysts polled by Reuters expect Hungary's central bank to keep its base rate at a record-low 0.9 percent at least until the second quarter of 2019.     But the NBH, regarded as Central Europe's most dovish central bank, is expected to pump more liquidity into interbank markets, continuing to squeeze funds out of its 3-month deposits.     A Budapest-based trader said that barring any unexpected developments, the central bank's decisions would probably have a neutral to slightly negative effect on the currency market, projecting a post-meeting range for the forint of 307.30 to 308.50 versus the euro.     The Czech crown was 0.07 percent weaker at 26.20 versus the euro, remaining on the strong side of the former cap on its value at 27 to the euro. The Czech central bank lifted the cap in April, abandoning a weak-crown policy.       The average crown exchange rate has strengthened by 1.6 percent to the euro since April, trading at an average of 26.58.      So far there has not been sufficient tightening of monetary conditions via the exchange rate, which still supports the need to tighten conditions by raising the basic interest rates. We expect the central bank to start the tightening cycle in the last quarter of this year,  said Jakub Seidler, ING chief economist for the Czech Republic.      The crown should break through the psychologically important level of 26 to the euro in the second half of the year, but in the short term it can be pressed by the dividend season, so the relatively fast appreciation from recent weeks is less likely.      The crown should strengthen to 25.75 per euro in the next 12 months according to the median forecast of analysts in a May 28-June 1 Reuters poll.

The online takeaway business has been booming in recent years, prompting listings of firms like Britain's Just Eat (JE.L) and the Netherlands' Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), as well as the more recent entry of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Uber [UBER.UL]. However, online food delivery is seen as a  winner takes all  game as most users are only likely to download and use one app, meaning there is only enough space in most markets for one or two major players, underlining the need to build scale quickly. Delivery Hero announced on Monday that it aims to raise around 927 million euros ($1 billion) through a stock market listing that could value it at up to 4.4 billion euros, with about 450 million euros in new shares. Of that, about 300 million euros will be used to pay back loans, and the rest to finance growth. CEO Niklas Ostberg told journalists the capital would be used to grow organically and through acquisitions.  Growth and size is very important for building profitability,  he said.  It is about time to have a European company in the tech space that is a global leader.  News of the sale has boosted German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE), which holds a 35 percent stake in Delivery Hero. Its shares, which jumped on the news on Monday, were up another 2.5 percent at 0820 GMT on Tuesday. Ostberg said Delivery Hero was market leader in 35 of the more than 40 countries it operates in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and the total market it has access to is worth 72 billion euros. Delivery Hero only competes with Uber in a few places, primarily major cities, Ostberg said, adding that the U.S. firm's entry into some markets had helped Delivery Hero by raising awareness of food delivery.  The focus on food rather than trying to do taxis and other stuff makes us unique,  he said.

You outlive your usefulness when you start harming your party by your policy stances or your stubbornness,  the 89-year-old Jean-Marie Le Pen told reporters after he was locked out of a party meeting.  Asked if she should quit he said:  Yes, I think so.  Relations between Le Pen senior and his daughter have soured since she kicked him out of the party in 2015 for comments minimizing the holocaust, and their very public rows have in the past harmed the party's image.  Marine Le Pen had said her father would not be welcome at the meeting of the party's leadership. He arrived with a bailiff and lawyer, to get testimony of the fact that the gates were locked up by chains to prevent his entry.   I'm too old to climb up over gates,  he said, after describing his daughter's showing in the second round of the presidential election and the party's parliamentary results as  scathing failures . Marine Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential election, capturing the support of voters increasingly disillusioned with mainstream parties, but was soundly beaten by centrist Emmanuel Macron in the run-off.  In the legislative poll, her party scooped up eight seats in the 577-seat chamber, a four-fold increase on the previous parliament but much less than it hoped for and not enough to form a parliamentary group. Le Pen has made large strides to detoxify the anti-semitic, xenophobic image the National Front held under her father's leadership. It remains staunchly anti-EU, anti-immigration.

The old site will be redeveloped as a tourist area.     The delay has complicated the construction of a road planned for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics to speed journeys from the yet-to-be-built Olympic village to the National Stadium, raising fears of traffic jams around key venues     Koike said that the market, on prime real estate at the edge of Tokyo Bay, will move to Toyosu, a newly built facility on a man-made island in the bay, after steps to deal with soil pollution that includes benzene, a legacy of its past as a gas plant.     In a nod to the tourist value of the 80-year-old Tsukiji market, she said the site would be rebuilt over five years and merchants who choose to can then move back to form the core of a redeveloped tourist area centered on food.      Because we're a nation that treasures our traditional culture, I want to promote the Tsukiji brand,  she told a news conference. FILE PHOTO : Workers are seen at the new Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market, known as Toyosu market, which will take over from the famous Tsukiji market, under construction in the Toyosu district in Tokyo, Japan, September 27, 2016.Toru Hanai/File Photo    Tsukiji draws tens of thousands of visitors a year to its warren of stalls laden with exotic species of fish, huge tuna and fresh sushi, part of a tourism boom that is a key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic plan.     But Koike said the market's age and vulnerability to a big earthquake meant it had to be rebuilt.

The person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified, said the Galaxy Note 8 will sport a curved screen that is marginally larger than the 6.2-inch version of the Galaxy S8 smartphone and feature two rear cameras. The Note 7 was equipped with a 5.7-inch curved screen and one rear camera. The person did not elaborate further on the phone including pricing. A Samsung Electronics spokesman declined to comment. Samsung is intent on continuing the premium Note series despite the costly collapse of the Galaxy Note 7, which it was forced to scrap roughly two months from launch in October due to fire-prone batteries. The incident, one of the biggest product safety failures in tech history, cost the firm 6.1 trillion won ($5.4 billion) in operating profit and hurt its credibility. The firm disclosed its preliminary findings in January that different battery problems from two suppliers caused the fires, which was corroborated by two other independent probes. The firm implemented several steps including a new set of battery safety checks to avoid repeat incidents, which analysts said is helping it win back consumer trust. Strong initial response for the Galaxy S8 smartphones that began selling in April indicate the firm is recovering quickly, with some analysts forecasting the device to set Samsung's internal sales records and push the firm towards what is widely expected to be its best-ever profit for April-June. There have been no battery fire incidents reported for the S8. Counterpoint Research estimates Samsung regained its spot as the top global smartphone maker in the first quarter after ceding the spot to archrival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in the previous quarter.

In May, overseas investors bought a net 19.8 billion yuan  ($2.90 billion) of mainland shares via the  Connect  schemes that link the Hong Kong and China markets, pushing up volumes by  56 percent from the previous month.   We believe this was due to foreign investors' expectation that MSCI will announce the inclusion of A-shares this week,  said UBS strategist Gao Ting, noting that northbound investors have mostly chosen shares in the consumer and pharmaceutical sectors over the past month. Net inflows so far this month have reached nearly 15 billion yuan.               The flows into Chinese firms such as Midea Group (000333.SZ) and Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) came ahead of MSCI's decision on whether to open up its Emerging Markets Index (EMI) .MSCIEF to mainland-listed China shares. The announcement is due shortly after 4.30 pm New York time on Tuesday, June 20 (4.30am Wednesday in Hong Kong).  If China A shares were to be included, consumer and real estate stocks in particular would see their weighting increase - at the expense of financials - under MSCI's new methodology unveiled in March, which will cut the number of constituents to 169 from 448.  MSCI has previously declined to include China in the EMI three times amid investor complaints about curbs on repatriating capital from China and concerns over the country's large number of suspended stocks. The newly adopted methodology is designed to address these issues and make inclusion more likely, analysts said.       China's securities regulator said on Friday that it hopes MSCI can open its index to China shares, but if not, Chinese capital market reform will not be derailed. All the Chinese stocks set to be included are big-caps and can be easily accessed by foreigners through the  Connect  trading link between mainland and Hong Kong markets. Morgan Stanley sees a more than 50 percent chance of a  Yes  decision, expecting a 0.5-1 percent rise in the Shanghai Composite Index on a positive result, although it noted that actual implementation would not take place until June, 2018. Eligible Chinese stocks would represent a weighting of only 0.5 percent in the MSCI EM index.   In the case of a 'No' decision: The A-share market might first react with a minor decline of 1.0 percent,  Morgan Stanley said in a recent report.  FILE PHOTO: A man looks at an electronic board at a brokerage house in Shanghai August 31, 2009.Aly Song/File PhotoAsset managers have noted that inclusion in the index after the three previous rejections is likely this time, with the weight of money flowing into Chinese A shares evidence of that conviction. Over the past two weeks, an average of 1.2 billion yuan has flowed into Chinese shares via the Connect each day, nearly 30 percent more than the average during the Jan-May period.  Shenzhen-listed Chinese home appliance maker Midea Group Co (000333.SZ) - potentially a heavyweight in the EMI - has witnessed a surge in foreign interest since MSCI in March unveiled its new methodology for China inclusion.  Overseas holdings in Midea via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect doubled to 4.16 percent, from 1.94 percent three months ago, with about 230 million shares acquired by foreign investors during the period. Slideshow (2 Images)Founder Securities (601901.SS), another potential EMI constituent, has seen foreign holdings in the brokerage under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect surge to 17.2 percent, from just 10 percent three months ago. In another sign of rising foreign interest in Chinese big-caps ahead of the MSCI decision, qualified foreign institutional investors have visited a total of 29 Chinese listed companies so far this month, 23 of which have stocks in the Connect schemes, the Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday.  However, some investors appear retreating just ahead of the MSCI announcement, exchange-traded fund (ETF) data suggests.     ETFs tracking China stock indices saw 14.5 million euro  ($16.17 million) of outflows on Friday, reversing a trend of steady inflows seen since the beginning of this month, according to independent ETF selection platform TrackInsight. That suggests some investors are thinking again about the likelihood of inclusion in the index, TrackInsight said.

The consortium is seen as one of the strongest suitors for the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - as it would automatically have the government's stamp of approval, but it is worried about legal risks if the spat is not settled, the sources said. The group includes a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), as well as U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, has sought a court injunction to prevent its partner from selling its chip business without the U.S. firm's consent. Toshiba, which is seeking a minimum of $18 billion for its chip business, wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. The conglomerate had set its sights on choosing a preferred bidder at a board meeting on Wednesday, separate sources familiar with the matter said. It wants to reach a definitive agreement by June 28, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. But the sources added that the condition set by the government-led group could prompt Toshiba to postpone the vote. The sources declined to be identified as discussions concerning the sale were confidential. INCJ, DBJ and SK Hynix declined to comment. A representative for Bain was not immediately available for comment. Toshiba said it would not comment on the auction process. Western Digital reiterated a June 15 statement by Chief Executive Steve Milligan in which he said that Toshiba was violating contractual rights and had left the U.S. firm no choice but to pursue legal action. The government-led consortium's bid has been orchestrated in large part by the trade ministry which wants to keep the chip unit under domestic control. It has been seeking to counter a 2.2 trillion yen ($19.7 billion) from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake.

The move would come amid concern held by some analysts that the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening path could trigger a withdrawal of funds from emerging Asian economies and disrupt financial markets. Under the new scheme, member countries that undergo a preliminary review can tap the IMF for short-term dollar funds they can use to battle any speculative attack on their currencies, the source said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The new facility has been under consideration at the IMF to strengthen safe-guards against abrupt rises in market volatility. Its creation will be formally decided at the IMF's board meeting at the end of this month, the source said.  The IMF is considering various measures, as it sees the importance of strengthening global safety nets to guard against potential liquidity problems,  an IMF official told Reuters.

The drug, whose generic name is brolucizumab, aims to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the leading cause of severe vision loss and blindness in people over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Head-to-head late-stage trials showed RTH258 worked as well as Regeneron's Eylea, developed with Bayer. This was achieved with over half the patients dosed every 12 weeks compared to every eight weeks with Eylea. Novartis shares rose 0.8 percent by 0826 GMT, outpacing a 0.2 percent gain in the Stoxx European health care sector index . In a note to investors, analysts at Jefferies called this  a significant differentiator and competitive advantage for RTH258  and cited previousl estimates that success in the trials could boost Novartis's earnings per share and valuation by around 2 percent in the medium term. Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said the data should help Novartis win back share in a highly lucrative market of 20-25 million patients. Regeneron is betting on two key treatments – sarilumab, to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and Dupixent – to reduce its reliance on Eylea, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of total revenue. Eylea has powered much of the company's growth since late 2011. However, the drug's sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, mainly due to competition from Lucentis, marketed by Novartis and Roche AG.

German mechanical engineering association VDMA said on Tuesday it expected sales of robotics and automation equipment to reach 13.7 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in 2017. That would mark a pickup from 5 percent growth last year and would beat the 2 percent sales growth expected for Germany's wider mechanical engineering sector.  The German industry players are benefiting from a robust economy in the global race to modernise industry,  Norbert Stein, chairman of the VDMA's robotics and automation association, said. In the first four months of the year, sales jumped by 13 percent even as domestic demand declined thanks to revenue from overseas. Order intake, an indicator of future sales, rose even more steeply, at a rate of 27 percent. Germany exported 57 percent of its robotics and automation equipment last year, with China accounting for 10 percent of sales, making it the sector's biggest single market. Leading providers include industrial robot maker Kuka , which was bought by Chinese home appliance maker Midea, and industrial group Siemens. Other global leaders in standard industrial robots are Switzerland's ABB and Japan's Fanuc. Global demand for industrial robots is rising as labour costs increase and technology becomes more sophisticated, allowing robots to do more delicate work than in the past. The VDMA's more than 3,000 members - which include large industrial groups such as Siemens and Linde as well as many smaller, family-owned firms - generated around 220 billion euros of sales last year and employ more than a million people.

Marlin Bidco, the buyout vehicle set up by BC Partners and Pollen Street Partners, said it had received valid support for its offer from other Shawbrook shareholders owning a combined 75.6 percent of the company. Shawbrook declined to comment. Valid acceptances representing 50 percent of the company were required for the deal to go through with Shawbrook remaining listed on the London Stock Exchange. Under the deal structure, the company would be de-listed if at least 75 percent of its shareholders accept the offer, with those who did not accept, being part owners of an unlisted entity. Shawbrook earlier this month rejected a raised and final 868 million pound ($1.1 billion) offer from the private equity groups, which already hold 38.8 percent of the lender. The consortium first made a bid for Shawbrook in January, offering 307 pence per share, before raising its offer to 330 pence in March. However, so far, Shawbrook's directors had advised shareholders to reject the offers. Founded in 2011, London-listed Shawbrook is one of several 'challenger' banks to emerge since the financial crisis to fill a gap in small-business lending after larger banks slimmed down to focus on bolstering their capital to meet tougher regulatory requirements. These challenger banks have increasingly been seen as ripe for takeovers in recent months, bankers who advise on mergers and acquisitions have said, as a prolonged period of low interest rates has squeezed earnings and the pound's fall has made them cheaper for foreign buyers.

Risk aversion due to Brexit, concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to carry out financial reforms, election results in Europe and Middle East turmoil have provided some support for gold, said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.      We can see things are getting more complicated and investors have to take some time to put things into context,  To said.      Spot gold        was up 0.3 percent at $1,246.82 per ounce, as of 0809 GMT. U.S. gold futures         rose 0.1 percent to $1,247.8 per ounce.      Spot prices touched a low of $1,242.61 an ounce early in the session, the weakest since May 17, after New York Fed President William Dudley reinforced that recent weak data is unlikely to derail plans to keep raising interest rates.                     Gold is used as an alternative investment during times of political and financial uncertainty.      British and EU Brexit negotiators agreed how to organize talks on Britain's divorce at a first meeting in Brussels on Monday, where both sides stressed goodwill but also the huge complexity and tight deadline.                      Late Monday, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise rates again and that it should move slowly to raise them and trim its massive bond portfolio.                   Mixed U.S dollar trade provided some respite for gold during Asian trade on Tuesday, with modest physical interest out of the region evident underneath $1,250, however, not to the extent we expected we would see,  MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note.     The dollar index        was last unchanged at 97.551 against a basket of currencies.        Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,248 per ounce and rise towards the next resistance at $1,251, as it failed to break a support at $1,243, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.                      After having broken through the 100-day moving average, the 200-day moving average could be the next significant support for gold, said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.         A daily close below here suggests we could target the May lows.

Earlier this year, government bond prices in southern Europe were under pressure from uncertainty over how French elections in May would play out, the possibility of a snap vote in Italy and speculation over European Central Bank tapering of its extraordinary monetary stimulus. But recent indications suggest the ECB is in no hurry to end its programme, the election of President Emmanuel Macron has helped soothe concerns and worries on Italy have also faded.  The perception in the market is that the main political risks that were the dominating factors (in euro zone bond markets) are now behind us,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  Investors are now happy to take some carry into the summer months.  The Italian-German bond yield spread, which is closely watched as a key indicator of political risk in the bloc, dropped to 165 basis points, its narrowest level since early January. Low-rated Southern European government bonds were in demand in general on Tuesday, dropping 1-2 bps on the day. Italian and Portuguese bonds in particular had rallied after Macron scored a strong victory in French parliamentary elections. Low-rated South European government bonds tend to rally when risk appetite is high and when the threat of euro zone break up is at an ebb. The promise of continued monetary stimulus is also positive for lower-rated bonds in the bloc, and indications are that central bankers in major developed countries are all hesitating to tighten monetary policy. On Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said now is not the time to raise rates.

The data showed the deficit at 462 million euros ($515.45 million) from 872 million euros in April 2016. Tourism revenues rose slightly to 484 million euros from 434 million in the same month a year earlier.  A year-on-year drop of 196 million euros in the deficit of the balance of goods is attributable to a decrease mostly in the deficit of the oil balance and to a lesser extent of the non-oil balance of goods,  the Bank of Greece said. Non-oil exports of goods at current prices remained virtually flat, while they declined by 2.6 percent at constant prices, it said. The 176 million euro rise in the primary income account surplus was mainly due to higher net interest, dividend and profit receipts. In 2016 as a whole, Greece posted a current account deficit of 1.1 billion euros versus a surplus of 206 million in 2015 as a result of a lower services balance surplus. **************************************************************** CURRENT ACCOUNT (bln euros)    2017     2016 January                       -0.271   -0.771 February                      -0.937   -0.828 March                         -1.324   -0.772 April                         -0.462   -0.872     ----------------------------------------------- * revised source: Bank of Greece         ($1 = 0.8963 euros) Reporting by George Georgiopoulos","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-currentaccount-idUSKBN19B0VH"},

Jaitley, addressing a news conference, said there would be initial challenges after launching the tax, which will require all but the smallest businesses to file three detailed returns online every month. But, with 6.5 million firms already registered for GST and more expected to sign up, there was no excuse for firms not to be ready for what has been billed as the biggest tax reform in India's 70-year history. A decade in the making, the GST would bring down barriers between more than 30 states and territories, unifying India's $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a single market. The government says it will boost both commerce and state revenues.  We have been saying for the last six months it would be July 1 - nobody has any business not to be ready,  Jaitley told reporters.  If he's still not ready, then I'm afraid he does not want to be ready.  To ease the transition, a GST coordination panel agreed on Sunday to allow companies to file simplified, aggregate tax returns in July and August before they have to comply fully with the GST from September. Any company generating a large number of invoices will need to adopt special software packages that enable them to format and reconcile invoices, then upload them to the GST Network, an IT system that will process up to 5 billion invoices a month. If companies struggle to comply, that could block the flow of input tax credits that are a new feature of the tax, experts and business groups say. This would force firms to pay tax on the full cost of an item rather than just value added, tying up working capital and cutting into profits. Jaitley said he expected there to be  some challenges  in the short term after the launch, but he dismissed concerns that registering for and complying with the GST would be too hard.  Industry and trade have to prepare themselves. It's not a complicated process,  he said. Jaitley said he anticipated, over the medium and the long term, that improved tax collection under the GST would cause revenues to grow, and the spending capacity of India's federal and regional governments would increase.  Consequently, it should have a positive impact on the GDP,  said Jaitley.  The size of the formal economy should also increase.

N Brown, whose brands target women aged 30 and above and those of a larger frame, said demand was strong for its women's clothing and reported a 16 percent rise in online sales in the 13 weeks to June 3, amid a tough trading conditions that have hit retailers. Ladieswear and its Simply Be brand had a very strong period, with good responses to N Brown spring and summer campaigns, particularly JD Williams'  Spring into Summer  and Simply Be's  We Are Curves , the retailer said. Rival Bonmarche Holdings Plc, which makes women's clothing in sizes 10-28, reported an almost 40 percent drop in full-year profit, and said the apparel market was hurt by lower demand, Britain's move to leave the European Union and unseasonal weather patterns. Rising inflation and muted wage growth following the Brexit vote in June last year has forced consumers to rein in their spending. British retail sales posted their biggest quarterly fall in seven years in the first three months of 2017, hurt by rising prices following the Brexit vote, reinforcing views that household spending, the main driver of the UK economy, was slowing sharply.  Although the outlook for consumer confidence remains uncertain, our offering is resonating with customers,  Chief Executive Angela Spindler said. Analysts at Jefferies nudged up their full-year 2018 pretax profit expectations for N Brown by 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) and pushed up 2019 estimates by 2 million pounds, accounting for the store closures. Analysts at Peel Hunt upgraded the stock to a  hold  from  reduce.  N Brown said on Tuesday that it would close up to five Simply Be and Jacamo dual-fascia stores as a result of ongoing weak footfall in some locations. Together, these five stores contributed 5 million pounds to revenue, but accounted for the entire 2 million pounds operating loss of N Brown's store estate in full year 2017, it said. The retailer expects the process to complete by the end of August and sees exceptional costs between 10 million pounds to 14 million pounds.

The data showed the deficit at 462 million euros ($515.45 million) from 872 million euros in April 2016. Tourism revenues rose slightly to 484 million euros from 434 million in the same month a year earlier.  A year-on-year drop of 196 million euros in the deficit of the balance of goods is attributable to a decrease mostly in the deficit of the oil balance and to a lesser extent of the non-oil balance of goods,  the Bank of Greece said. Non-oil exports of goods at current prices remained virtually flat, while they declined by 2.6 percent at constant prices, it said. The 176 million euro rise in the primary income account surplus was mainly due to higher net interest, dividend and profit receipts. In 2016 as a whole, Greece posted a current account deficit of 1.1 billion euros versus a surplus of 206 million in 2015 as a result of a lower services balance surplus. **************************************************************** CURRENT ACCOUNT (bln euros)    2017     2016 January                       -0.271   -0.771 February                      -0.937   -0.828 March                         -1.324   -0.772 April                         -0.462   -0.872     ----------------------------------------------- * revised source: Bank of Greece         ($1 = 0.8963 euros) Reporting by George Georgiopoulos","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-currentaccount-idUSEONH6G0RU"},

The greenback got a further lift on Tuesday when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise British interest rates, sending sterling down more than half a percent against the U.S. currency. The dollar index - which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, including sterling - edged up to 97.623 , its highest since the end of May. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Monday that tightening in the labour market should help drive up inflation, reinforcing the message that a recent patch of weak data is unlikely to derail plans to keep raising interest rates. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise interest rates again.

The greenback has edged higher since the Fed on June 14 raised interest rates for a second time in 2017 and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities later this year, while indicating that a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory. The dollar may see further gains against the yen, especially after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week indicated the BOJ would be in no hurry to dial back its massive stimulus programme, said Tan Teck Leng, forex analyst for UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.

The vehicle swerved into the group of worshippers, mainly of North and West African origin, after they left prayers in the early hours of Monday at the Muslim Welfare House and the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, one of the biggest in Britain, injuring 11. Police said it was clearly targeted at Muslims and Prime Minister Theresa May described it as a  sickening  terrorist attack. A 47-year-old man was restrained by locals at the scene and police later arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder and terrorism offences. He is still being questioned by detectives. The suspect was named by British media as Darren Osborne, 47, a father-of-four, who lived in the Welsh capital Cardiff. In a statement given to local media on behalf of his family, his nephew Ellis Osborne said:   We are massively shocked; it's unbelievable, it still hasn't really sunk in.  We are devastated for the families, our hearts go out to the people who have been injured. It's madness. It is obviously sheer madness.  The incident at Finsbury Park was the fourth attack in Britain since March and the third to involve a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians. The previous attacks had been blamed on Islamist extremists. The latest attack comes at a tumultuous time for the government with Britain starting complex divorce talks with the European Union and May negotiating with a small Northern Irish party to stay in power after losing her parliamentary majority in a snap election that backfired. An imam from the Muslim Welfare House who stepped in to protect the driver from the angry crowd after the incident was hailed as a hero in British newspapers on Tuesday.  We found that a group of people quickly started to collect around him ... and some tried to hit him either with kicks or punches,  Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters.  By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm.  Security Minister Ben Wallace said the man was not known to the security services and police said they believed he was acting alone. They were carrying out searches of addresses in Cardiff where the vehicle hire company that the van was rented from was based.

We're experiencing a first half which is so strong that the impetus will carry on into the coming year,  Timo Wollmershaeuser, head of economic research at Ifo, said in a statement on Tuesday.  The upswing is being driven by the domestic economy, especially construction and consumption,  he added.  But now we have industry too. The improving economies of the euro zone and the rest of the world are significantly boosting exports.  For 2018, the institute now predicts Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) will expand by 2.0 percent, up from the 1.8 percent it had predicted previously. It expected there to be 44.2 million people employed this year, an all time high, compared to 43.6 million last year. That would be coupled with higher inflation, reaching 1.7 percent this year and 1.6 percent in 2018, compared with 0.6 percent in 2016. The improved outlook chimes with the projections of Germany's central bank, which has raised its growth forecasts for the German economy to a workday-adjusted 1.9 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018. Still, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said in a Reuters interview last week that the government was sticking to its more cautious growth outlook for Europe's biggest economy despite solid economic data and upbeat sentiment indicators. The government said in April that it expected an economic growth rate on a non-adjusted basis of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018.

It won't be quid pro quo but mutual interest...They can share the profit of those power plants,   said Pradhan, adding New Delhi wants to expand its ties with Doha beyond simply buyer and supplier. India wants to gradually move to a gas-based economy and has plans to raise its annual LNG import capacity to 50 million tonnes in the next few years from 21 million tonnes now. India is also open to granting stakes to Qatar in local oil and gas companies and LNG terminals, should the Gulf emirate make such a proposal, said Pradhan. India's biggest gas importer Petronet LNG annually buys 8.5 million tonnes under a long-term contract. It also buys additional volumes from Qatar under spot deals. Prabhat Singh, chief executive of Petronet, said the Gulf nation needed to decide quickly on the Indian proposal. He said India could be a stable outlet for Qatar's LNG.

Speaking to London's banking community alongside finance minister Philip Hammond a day after Brexit talks started, Carney cited weak wage growth, mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment as reasons for not moving to raise interest rates any time soon. Sterling sank from $1.2758 to a one-week low of $1.2669 after the text of Carney's postponed Mansion House speech was released. It also fell over half a percent to a five-day low of 88.02 pence per euro.  Market sentiment towards sterling had shifted towards a possible rate hike followiing a shock shift to 5-3 last week from the MPC (Bank of England monetary policy committee),  said Mizuho's head of hedge fund FX sales, Neil Jones.  The balance (of sentiment is) being addressed somewhat at Mansion House.  British government bond futures surged by around 50 ticks after the release of Carney's speech and last stood at 128.46, up 40 ticks on the day. Short sterling interest rate futures also rose strongly, especially for the late 2018 and early 2019 contracts, as the market priced in a shallower path of interest rate hikes in future years. The 10-year gilt yield dipped below 1 percent for the first time since last Thursday. Britain's FTSE 100 exporter-heavy index of stocks rose 0.4 percent from a lacklustre open.

Jaitley, addressing a news conference, said there would be initial challenges after launching the tax, which will require all but the smallest businesses to file three detailed returns online every month. But, with 6.5 million firms already registered for GST and more expected to sign up, there was no excuse for firms not to be ready for what has been billed as the biggest tax reform in India's 70-year history. A decade in the making, the GST would bring down barriers between more than 30 states and territories, unifying India's $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a single market. The government says it will boost both commerce and state revenues.  We have been saying for the last six months it would be July 1 - nobody has any business not to be ready,  Jaitley told reporters.  If he's still not ready, then I'm afraid he does not want to be ready.  To ease the transition, a GST coordination panel agreed on Sunday to allow companies to file simplified, aggregate tax returns in July and August before they have to comply fully with the GST from September. Any company generating a large number of invoices will need to adopt special software packages that enable them to format and reconcile invoices, then upload them to the GST Network, an IT system that will process up to 5 billion invoices a month. If companies struggle to comply, that could block the flow of input tax credits that are a new feature of the tax, experts and business groups say. This would force firms to pay tax on the full cost of an item rather than just value added, tying up working capital and cutting into profits. Jaitley said he expected there to be  some challenges  in the short term after the launch, but he dismissed concerns that registering for and complying with the GST would be too hard.  Industry and trade have to prepare themselves. It's not a complicated process,  he said. Jaitley said he anticipated, over the medium and the long term, that improved tax collection under the GST would cause revenues to grow, and the spending capacity of India's federal and regional governments would increase.  Consequently, it should have a positive impact on the GDP,  said Jaitley.  The size of the formal economy should also increase.

Qatar's RasGas is India's biggest LNG supplier.   It won't be quid pro quo but mutual interest...They can share the profit of those power plants,   said Pradhan, adding New Delhi wants to expand its ties with Doha beyond simply buyer and supplier. India wants to gradually move to a gas-based economy and has plans to raise its annual LNG import capacity to 50 million tonnes in the next few years from 21 million tonnes now. India is also open to granting stakes to Qatar in local oil and gas companies and LNG terminals, should the Gulf emirate make such a proposal, said Pradhan. India's biggest gas importer Petronet LNG annually buys 8.5 million tonnes under a long-term contract. It also buys additional volumes from Qatar under spot deals. Prabhat Singh, chief executive of Petronet, said the Gulf nation needed to decide quickly on the Indian proposal. He said India could be a stable outlet for Qatar's LNG.

A European power network lobby group ENTSO-E said in a report on 36 countries published this month that prolonged heatwaves this summer could cause problems for Polish and Italian electricity networks. Poland, which generates electricity mostly from outdated coal-fuelled power stations, faces the risk of power shortages when temperatures reach extreme levels as increased demand overloads the system. In August 2015 it had to impose curbs on power consumption due to unexpected outages and a heatwave that drained rivers that supply water to cool its coal power plants. However, the energy ministry, in a statement published on Monday afternoon, quoted deputy energy minister Andrzej Piotrowski as saying that the ministry, grid operators and power companies were taking action to prepare for any disruption to power supplies in the event of a long heatwave this summer.  (But) the probability of such a scenario taking place is very small,  Piotrowski said. The ministry added that since 2015 a number of steps had been taken to avoid power shortages, including launching a power link with Lithuania.  Taking into account the forecasts of peak demand, steps taken by the operator and favourable hydro situation, there is an infinitesimal probability of reductions in power consumption due to network overload or lack of the needed power capacities in the system in summer 2017,  the ministry said.

Euro zone blue chips rose 0.4 percent while the broader regional index was up 0.3 percent. The swift rebound in tech stocks over the past week lifted Wall Street to another record high overnight. In Europe, Germany's Prosiebensat 1 led gains among media stocks after it sold its online travel agency Etraveli to CVC. In the UK, gains on the FTSE 100, the worst performing major benchmark in Europe this year, were held in check by weakness in Wolseley and BT. UK midcaps were little changed. Shares in Wolseley, a plumbing and heating supplier, fell 3.4 percent after its quarterly results. The firm saw sales growth in all its regions except the UK, another indication Britons are cutting back on big ticket spending, and analysts at Liberum and Davy Research also said eroding margins in its U.S. were disappointing. BT fell 1.6 percent after France's Orange said it could get $1.15 billion by cutting its stake in the British telecoms company. A downgrade to 'neutral' from BAML on Monday also weighed on the firm. Barclays was in focus after the bank and four former senior executives were criminally charged in an investigation into undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during a 12 billion pound emergency fund raising in 2008. The highly-anticipated announcement left Barclays shares near unchanged, however, down just 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, British workspace company IWG fell 6.5 percent on the mid-cap index, set for its worst day in nine months, after Estorn Limited placed 27 million shares in the company for sale at 345.1 pence per share.

The world's largest planemaker said it expected 41,030 industry deliveries over the next two decades, up from 39,620 in a similar forecast a year ago and topping $6 trillion in value. That includes a five percent increase in the 20-year forecast for deliveries of single-aisle aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, respectively the cash cows of the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers. Boeing now expects 29,530 deliveries in the medium-haul single-aisle category, which is popular with low-cost airlines, it said at the Paris Airshow. Air travel has been on a sharp uptrend, led by emerging economies as China looks set to replace North America as the world's biggest transport market in coming years. But China's growth is now slowing even though it remains above 6 percent a year. Boeing trimmed its 20-year forecast for average global traffic growth to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent. Airbus took a similar step in its own 20-year forecast released earlier this month, while increasing the projection for total deliveries by 6 percent, compared with last year's edition, to 34,899 aircraft. Boeing's overall tally is a bigger number partly because it counts aircraft with 90 seats or more, whereas Airbus starts at 100 seats. In a symbolic change likely to rankle with its European rival, Boeing ditched its forecast for very large four-engined airplanes such as the Airbus A380 and its own 747-8. For the first time, it lumped these together with large two-engined jets such as the Boeing 777 and largest A350. Boeing has long argued that the  very large  category is on its way out as airlines switch to smaller twinjets. Both manufacturers have had to cut output of four-engined jumbos.  In fact, frankly, we look at the demand for really big airplanes and we find it hard to believe that Airbus will be able to deliver the rest of their A380s in backlog,  Marketing Vice-President Randy Tinseth said in a briefing. Boeing also expects to deliver only  a handful  of 747-8 passenger jets. Airbus insists the double-decker A380 has a future due to airport congestion and predicts 5 percent of aircraft delivered over the next 20 years will be very large people carriers or freighters, even though its forecast has been revised lower. Despite slower growth in some of the hottest aviation markets, Boeing said it continued to see  resilient  demand with a long-term growth trend in traffic of 5 percent a year. Passenger travel tends to outpace the economy, reflecting growing numbers of people with some disposable income, while cargo is a barometer of trade and business confidence. Boeing predicted demand for 920 cargo planes, down 1 percent from its previous forecast. Much air cargo nowadays goes in the belly of wide-body passenger planes rather than freighters.

Most of the rest of the Gulf was sluggish. MSCI will announce its decision after the close. The Saudi index rose 0.5 percent in the first half-hour; it had surged 2.4 percent on Monday after Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, vice chairman of the Capital Market Authority, was quoted as saying by the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that he expected Riyadh to be upgraded by the end of 2018. That would be faster than the mid-2019 date which MSCI's past practice would suggest. Tuesday's rise was broad-based, with nine of the 10 most heavily traded stocks gaining. Petrochemical blue chip Saudi Basic Industries, which would be a key Saudi component of MSCI's emerging market index if the upgrade happens, rose 0.8 percent. Banks were also strong with Banque Saudi Fransi adding 4.2 percent. In a research note, Morgan Stanley argued that the rally in Saudi banks had further to go, saying Riyad Bank and Al Rajhi Bank were underpriced relative to history and that because loan growth in the sluggish Saudi economy was slow, banks would increase dividends. Dubai's index edged up 0.2 percent as National Central Cooling Co (Tabreed), the most heavily traded stock, jumped 7.1 percent. It had soared its 15 percent daily limit on Monday, when France's Engie said it had agreed to buy 40 percent of Tabreed for 2.8 billion dirhams ($763 million) from Mubadala. Qatar's index slipped 0.3 percent as Doha Bank dropped 2.4 percent and Qatar International Islamic Bank lost 2.2 percent. Qatari banks have been weak because of concern about increases in their funding costs after other Gulf countries imposed sanctions on Qatar early this month, accusing it of supporting terrorism.

Carney, speaking to London's banking community alongside finance minister Philip Hammond a day after Brexit talks started, said that depending on how the talks progress, businesses might soon need to activate contingency plans.  Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption,  he said.  Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU.  Last week, three BoE policymakers of the eight on the Monetary Policy Committee unexpectedly voted to raise interest rates. Carney voted to keep them at a record low 0.25 percent and gave no sign he was in a rush to change his view.  Given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment,  he said.  In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to ... the reality of Brexit negotiations.  Carney also underlined the importance of trade liberalisation - especially in financial services - and said it was unclear if Britain's large current account deficit was yet on a sustainable footing.

Regulators should instead work with each other to forge a new form of cross-border supervision of clearing houses, Carney said.  Fragmentation is in no one's economic interest. Nor is it necessary for financial stability. Indeed it can damage it,  Carney said in a speech in London's Mansion House. Last week the European Union's executive European Commission proposed giving itself powers to move euro clearing business away from London after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019. It said such powers might be needed to maintain financial stability in the EU given that the bulk of euro clearing takes place in London, where it is regulated by the BoE. Carney said fragmentation of such global markets by jurisdiction or currency would reduce the benefits of central clearing, which ensures the safe completion of a trade. Instead of forced relocation, authorities  can and should build on current models to develop a new form of regulatory and supervisory cooperation,  Carney said.  The European Commission’s proposals announced last week recognise the importance of effective cooperation arrangements between the relevant EU authorities and their overseas counterparts,  Carney said.  The Bank welcomes this.  (Reporting by Huw Jones; editing by John Stonestreet)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-economy-carney-clearing-idUSL8N1JH13T"},

More than half of the necessary pilots have not yet begun training, the report concludes, as the industry braces for an increase in passenger air traffic that will double the size of the commercial air transport industry in the next 20 years.  Rapid fleet expansion and high pilot retirement rates create a further need to develop 180,000 first officers into new airline captains, more than in any previous decade,  said the report by CAE, which trains pilots for airlines around the world. Pilot unions in the United States have said low wages and scarce benefits for entry-level positions are deterring a new generation of potential aviators from pursuing the field. In the U.S., training requirements also are a hurdle for many would-be pilots. The United States is the only country to require co-pilots to have at least 1,500 flight hours unless they have experience flying planes in the military or are graduates of certain specialized programs. According to the U.N.'s aviation agency, which sets global standards typically adopted by regulators from its 191-member countries, it takes a minimum of about 250 hours to obtain a commercial pilot license for work as a co-pilot. By contrast, 1,500 hours is the minimum time required to become a captain under norms set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.N. agency that supports the development of global aviation. While the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration previously had followed ICAO norms, the 1,500-hour requirement for co-pilots was imposed following the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, a regional jet, in 2009, that killed 50 people. The 1,500-hour mandate is supported by pilots' unions as a way to improve air safety. However, regional airlines and some aviation experts say the tougher standard does not make flying any safer and has exacerbated the pilot shortage by making the training process longer and more costly.  The idea was that you would fly a year or two as a paid co-pilot and then become a captain when you had the 1,500 hours,  said one aviation source familiar with the matter.  Now you have to get the 1,500 hours before you get the first paycheck.

One officer died on the spot while another succumbed while being moved to hospital,  Baloch said, adding that three officers were wounded in the attack.  A spokesman for the separatist Baluch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. Baluchistan, which has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but remains Pakistan's poorest province, is the site of long-running rebellion by separatists who argue the state is taking over their lands and have targeted Chinese-funded projects. Beijing has pledged $57 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship  Belt and Road  project that first focused on Chinese firms building roads and power stations but is now expanding to include setting up industries. Gwadar, which houses a natural deep-water port, is central to the establishment of the corridor and is among the most guarded areas in the country. In May, BLA insurgents gunned down 13 Pakistani laborers working on CPEC-linked projects in Baluchistan in two separate attacks.  Taliban and other Islamist militants also operate in the province, which shares borders with Afghanistan and Iran. Last month, Islamic State militants abducted and killed two Chinese nationals in Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital. Pakistan's interior ministry later said the couple were preachers who had not registered with the government and turned down security offers.  The attack prompted Pakistan to boost security around Chinese nationals and other foreigners.

There's two ways you can go: You can either try to rethink everything or you can just say 'Screw it,' and come back tomorrow and act like it didn't happen,  Kershaw said.  So I'm going to go with the latter for now, I think.  Cody Bellinger hit two home runs and had four RBIs, sparking the Dodgers to a 10-6 victory over the New York Mets on Monday night at Dodger Stadium. Bellinger became the fastest player to reach 21 home runs in major league history, doing so in 51 games and breaking the mark of 20 homers in the same number of games by New York Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez (2015-16) and Boston Braves outfielder Wally Berger (1930).  Guy was at second base, so I was just trying to get an RBI. Luckily, it went out of there,  Bellinger said of his first-inning homer off Mets starter Zack Wheeler, who also yielded another one in the second.  The second one, I think it was 3-2, so I was trying to protect. I think it was inside, so I was just trying to protect.  Justin Turner, who also drove in four runs and tied a career high with four hits, and Chris Taylor added home runs for the Dodgers (45-26), who have won four in a row and 10 of their past 11. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at DodgersNew York Mets - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchJose Reyes homered twice and rookie Gavin Cecchini hit his first major league home run for the Mets (31-38). Jay Bruce had a solo homer. Kershaw (10-2) served up all four home runs, a career high for him. The 17 home runs Kershaw has given up this season is a career worst, topping the 16 he allowed in 2012. Kershaw struck out 10 and walked one but allowed six runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings against the Mets.  Got a lot of guys swinging the bats well that picked me up today,  said Kershaw, who tied Kansas City Royals left-hander Jason Vargas for the most wins in the majors. Mets starter Zack Wheeler (3-5) was tagged for seven runs and eight hits in two innings. It was the second worst outing for Wheeler, coming on the heels of Tuesday's 14-3 loss to the Chicago Cubs when he gave up a career-worst eight runs in 1 2/3 innings.  Well, when you've got that kind of stuff and you're getting hit like he's getting hit, there's something,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  We've got to get to the bottom of it.  Wheeler said his command failed him again.  It's really frustrating,  Wheeler said.  But it all starts with me.  Turner, who extended his hitting streak to 14 games, had an RBI single in the sixth to increase the Dodgers' lead to 8-4. However, Reyes took Kershaw deep again in the seventh with a two-run homer to close the gap to 8-6. But Taylor's solo home run in the bottom of the inning and a run-scoring single by Chase Utley put the Dodgers up 10-6. Bellinger's three-run blast highlighted a four-run surge by the Dodgers in the first. Turner had an RBI single in the inning for a 4-0 edge. In the second, Turner smacked a two-run shot to left for a 6-0 advantage. Bellinger followed with his second homer, a solo shot to right center to make it 7-0. Reyes launched his fifth home run of the season in the third, jumping on Kershaw's first pitch of the inning and hitting it out to left to cut the Dodgers' lead to six runs. Bruce added a solo shot in the fourth to slice the margin to 7-2. It was his 19th home run this season. Cecchini delivered a two-run shot in the fifth to pull the Mets within 7-4.

The government has raised Taiwan's GDP outlook for 2017 to a three-year high on strong export momentum, while it expects inflationary pressures to remain mild. The central bank is expected to leave the discount rate at 1.375 percent at its quarterly meeting on Thursday, all 14 analysts polled by Reuters predicted. It had cut the rate four times in a row from late 2015 to help lift the trade-reliant economy out of a mild recession.  Only the U.S. is raising rates now. It is mostly to normalize its monetary policy rather than tightening,  said analyst Lucas Lee of Mega Securities Investment Advisory. Economists said it was unlikely the central bank would follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates this year as that would accelerate Taiwan dollar TWD=TP momentum. The local currency has strengthened about 6.4 percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of this year, making it Asia's second-best performing currency after the Korean won.      Most economists do no anticipate a rate hike until early next year, in part because a strong Taiwan dollar is already putting a dent in exporters' profitability. Last month, the government raised its full-year 2017 GDP forecast to 2.05 percent, up from the last estimate of 1.92 percent, thanks to solid demand for tech gadgets. Taiwan's exports in May expanded for the eighth straight month, as factories rushed to meet orders for new product launches, such as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone 8. Momentum will likely cool in the second half of the year, with a slowdown in China and the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies being potential risks for Taiwan's economy.

The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be especially hard on regional-language films, which pay little or no entertainment tax. Movie tickets are placed in the GST’s highest slab of 28 percent, with the government making a concession for tickets priced below 100 rupees ($1.5), taxing them at 18 percent. “This will be a killer for regional films… At the least, they will now have to pay 18 percent, which is a huge hike,” film and trade analyst Girish Johar told Reuters.  India will launch the GST from July 1, a move that would unify its $2 trillion economy and tear down trade barriers between more than 30 states and union territories. Up until now, entertainment tax was a state subject. Maharashtra, where Bollywood is based, imposes a 45 percent entertainment tax. But films in the local Marathi language are exempted. In the southern states, entertainment tax is on average 7 percent.   “Even if we assume tickets cost less than 100 rupees, we would still be looking at a hike of more than 10 percent in terms of tax liability. That will ultimately be passed on to the consumer,” said Rajkumar Akella, who heads comScore, an agency that tracks box office earnings in India.    India is the world’s largest film industry, producing more than a 1000 movies a year. But the proliferation of smartphones coupled with prohibitive movie ticket prices and piracy has led to theatre footfalls nearly halving from ten years ago. “The final recovery for the distributor and exhibitor would be lower than it was earlier, and that would cause immense pressure on the industry from an economic perspective. That consequently leads to a situation where investment is not being encouraged,” the president of The Film and Television Producers Guild of India, Siddharth Roy Kapur, told Reuters.   The Guild has made several representations to the government asking for film tickets to be placed in a lower slab. Industry players also lament that local municipal bodies can still levy a separate entertainment tax apart from GST. “We are one of the few industries in the country which are still subject to double taxation,” Kapur said.

ProSieben had announced in February that it was looking into where to go with it travel business, which includes Internet portals such as event agency mydays and travel booking site weg.de and accounts for more than a third of digital revenues at the company. Critics had previously said ProSieben lacked a clear leader in an e-commerce portfolio which they argued was too diversified, with activities in travel, price comparison, online dating and even sex toys. ProSieben said it would continue the review of its remaining online travel business, especially travel booking portals weg.de and tropo. It aims to use proceeds from the sale of Etraveli to fund further growth, make bolt-on acquisitions in the Digital Entertainment and Commerce business and acquire minority stakes in companies already in its portfolio. The deconsolidation of Etraveli, expected in the third quarter, will force ProSieben to adjust its 2018 targets, the group said, adding it would provide details on the revision at its Capital Markets Day on Dec. 6.

Consumer electricity prices are under scrutiny in Britain after some of the big six providers, including Innogy-owned Npower and Iberdrola's Scottish Power, announced price rises this year. In a March consultation document, Ofgem said reducing payments under its proposal would cut household bills because the cost of the subsidies is included in overall network fees charged to power companies, which they pass on to consumers. Overall, the subsidies cost customers around 370 million pounds ($471 million) last year. Under the changes, power generators with less than 100 megawatts (MW) of capacity embedded into local power grids would see payments they receive for providing electricity during peak demand reduced drastically to between 3 and 7 pounds per kilowatt (kW) from about 47 pounds/kW. The changes would be introduced over three years from 2018. Large power producers have said that the subsidies are too generous and distort the market. So-called embedded generators have grown rapidly over the past few years thanks to rules that let them avoid the costs of using and maintaining the national transmission network.  Ofgem's view is that the level of the payment is distorting the wholesale and capacity markets and if no action is taken the distortion will increase,  it said. That payment was forecast to increase over the next four years to 70 pounds/kW.

Many investors predict that the so-called A shares which make up the majority of China's stock market will be included by MSCI, which has rejected this on three previous occasions. But Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities, said he believes inclusion of A-shares is  not that likely . Still, if MSCI again rejects inclusion, the impact on Chinese markets  could be rather limited , he said. Generous money injections by the central bank are helping to maintain some calm in China's financial markets, but market interest rates are persistently high, reflecting worries that liquidity conditions remain unusually tight. Any signs of a potential credit crunch usually ripples through Chinese financial markets as investors are wary of a knock-on impact across broader economic activity. Most sectors lost ground, led by the defensive consumer and healthcare stocks.

The deal values the online travel agency, which operates with brands Gotogate, Supersaver and Seat24, at around 14 times core profit, ProSieben said in a statement on Tuesday. ProSieben had announced in February that it was looking into where to go with it travel business, which includes Internet portals such as event agency mydays and travel booking site weg.de and accounts for more than a third of digital revenues at the company. Critics had previously said ProSieben lacked a clear leader in an e-commerce portfolio which they argued was too diversified, with activities in travel, price comparison, online dating and even sex toys. ProSieben said it would continue the review of its remaining online travel business, especially travel booking portals weg.de and tropo. It aims to use proceeds from the sale of Etraveli to fund further growth, make bolt-on acquisitions in the Digital Entertainment and Commerce business and acquire minority stakes in companies already in its portfolio. The deconsolidation of Etraveli, expected in the third quarter, will force ProSieben to adjust its 2018 targets, the group said, adding it would provide details on the revision at its Capital Markets Day on Dec. 6. So far, the company has targeted 2018 sales of 4.5 billion euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.15 billion.

So forgive Servais if a pair of two-run homers wasn't what impressed him about Mike Zunino's performance Monday night as the Mariners defeated the Detroit Tigers 6-2 at Safeco Field.  The thing with Zunino is how he managed the game, the way he got (reliever James) Pazos through (a bases-loaded jam),  Servais said.  We love the home runs. But taking the next step in leading the pitching staff was huge.  After the Mariners had tied the score at 2-2 in the fifth on Guillermo Heredia's two-run homer, the Tigers threatened in the next inning. Pazos (2-1) entered with one out and the bases loaded. He immediately fell behind 2-1 in the count to pinch-hitter Mikie Mahtook. That prompted a visit to the mound by Zunino.  I just wanted to sit him down and explain what we wanted to do with those guys,  Zunino said.  He made the pitches.  Pazos caught Mahtook looking at a called third strike, then fanned Andrew Romine on three straight pitches, including a 99 mph fastball, to end the inning. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at MarinersDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch Mike was incredible back there,  Pazos said.  He knows what we want to do.  Zunino's home run to left field on a 3-2 pitch from Tigers reliever Alex Wilson (1-4) in the bottom of the sixth inning gave the Mariners the lead.  As I got deeper into the at-bat, I was able to see what he was throwing,  Zunino said.  Any time you can fall behind and work my way back and get a hit like that ... it's huge.  The catcher added a two-run homer to straightaway center off Francisco Rodriguez with two outs in the bottom of the eighth for the final margin.  The quality of his at-bats was outstanding,  Servais said.  The last one off Rodriguez was pretty impressive.  Since being recalled from Triple-A Tacoma on May 22, Zunino is batting .338 with nine home runs and 28 RBIs.  In the (batting) cage, it's just been the same routine every day,  Zunino said. When he was sent down, Zunino was batting .167 with no home runs and two RBIs.  I've had a few chances in my career to hit the reset button,  said Zunino, the third overall pick in the 2012 draft who has spent time in the minors in each of the past two seasons.  Obviously, what I was doing wasn't working.  Anibal Sanchez, making his first start of the season, pitched five innings for the Tigers, the only runs allowed coming on Heredia's homer. The right-hander, a 12-year veteran, started the season in the bullpen and accepted a month-long assignment to Triple-A Toledo to stretch out his arm and allow him to return to the rotation.  He threw pretty well,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.  I thought he did a good job locating his fastball, change-up was good, mixing in the breaking balls.  The Mariners nearly knocked out Sanchez earlier in the fifth, as Taylor Motter led off with a liner that struck Sanchez in the left knee. Motter reached on an infield single, and after a visit from Ausmus and the Tigers' training staff, Sanchez stayed in the game. An out later, Heredia lined a 2-1 pitch over the fence in left-center field. The home run, Heredia's fifth of the season, tied the score at 2-2. Sanchez allowed two runs on five hits in five innings, with three walks and five strikeouts. The Tigers opened the scoring in the third, as two walks and a single loaded the bases with no outs. Romine, who led off the inning with a walk, scored when Alex Avila grounded into a double play. Detroit made it 2-0 in the fifth as Ian Kinsler lined a two-out double down the left-field line, scoring Jose Iglesias from first base. Mariners rookie right-hander Sam Gaviglio went five innings, allowing two runs on three hits. Gaviglio struggled with his control, with four walks and one strikeout. Of his 84 pitches, only 46 were strikes. NOTES: Mariners RF Ben Gamel extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a third-inning single. The rookie has hits in 21 of his past 22 games. ... Tigers SS Jose Iglesias went 2-for-4, his 15th multi-hit game of the season. ... Seattle improved to 21-13 at home. ... Tigers RHP Jordan Zimmermann (5-5, 5.35 ERA) is scheduled to start Tuesday against Mariners LHP Ariel Miranda (6-3, 4.17).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED6KU0952X"},

Macron's right-hand man during the presidential campaign, Ferrand became embroiled in allegations of financial impropriety within days of the centrist's victory in May. A preliminary investigation is under way over allegations he benefited improperly from property deals done six years ago by a health insurance fund he managed in the Brittany region. The affair tainted the early weeks of Macron's presidency with a whiff of bigger scandals that hit some of his opponents during a bitter presidential campaign. Under a government reshuffle to be conducted this week after Macron's party won a majority in parliament at the weekend, Ferrand is to step down as minister for territorial planning. He will take up instead the leadership of the 308 lawmakers representing Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) party in the National Assembly, the 577-seat lower house of parliament. Many of them are young and new to politics, although they are allied in parliament to another long-established centrist party, MoDem, or Democratic Movement.  It is a strategic role,  he told RTL Radio.  Emmanuel Macron has signaled the confidence that unites us ... He judged that it was a good moment because I know the parliamentary procedure well.  Ferrand was a Socialist member of parliament who deserted the now-devastated party to join Macron's cause. Other ministers in Macron's government are from The Republicans, the mainstream conservative party that was also decimated by LREM in Sunday's parliamentary vote.

Springer hit his 20th blast on Monday night in just his 65th game, a solo shot in the eighth inning of a 4-1 win over the Oakland Athletics at Oakland Coliseum. Springer reached the 20-homer mark for the third time in his four major-league seasons, but this time he's on pace to shatter his home-run mark long before the season ends.  I think just slowing everything down,  Springer said of the key to increased power.  Just trying to get to first base for guys like (Carlos) Correa, (Jose) Altuve, (Carlos) Beltran. I know who's up behind me. It's been slowing me down a lot and I've been fortunate enough to hit some balls hard.  Jake Marisnick and Derek Fisher also homered for the Astros, and right-hander Brad Peacock pitched 5 2/3 strong innings. Marisnick gave Houston a 2-0 lead with a two-run blast in the fifth inning. Springer homered in the eighth, and Fisher added a solo homer in the ninth.  I think it's a more controlled swing for him,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Springer.  He still has a tendency to swing hard and swing violently from time to time, but for the most part he's under control of his at-bats. He's a good guy getting a good pitch to hit, and he's not missing them.  He can hit the ball out of the ballpark, from foul pole to foul pole, which will help him. You go opposite field here, that's a really, really tall task. It's a combination of a lot of things. He's a really good hitter and he knows his pitches he can drive.  Related CoveragePreview: Astros at AthleticsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchCatcher Evan Gattis went 2-for-4 with two doubles and scored a run for Houston, which defeated the A's at the Coliseum for the seventh straight time and for the 12th time in their past 13 games overall. Peacock (4-1), a former A's minor-leaguer, allowed one run and four hits. He walked two and struck out eight. In six starts since moving from the bullpen to the rotation, Peacock struck out at least eight batters five times. He has 44 strikeouts in 28 1/3 innings.  The slider's huge for me, working it off the two-seamer,  Peacock said.  I think that's the key. I'm really not trying to strike anybody out. I'm just trying to make pitches and try to go deep in the game.  A's rookie right-hander Daniel Gossett (0-2) gave up two runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings in his second career major-league start. He struck out six and walked none. In his first start, Gossett allowed seven runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings in an 11-6 loss at Miami on June 14.  A lot more focus,  Gossett said of his second start.  I realized that every pitch deserves every bit of focus I've got. I was able to stay focused throughout the game and on every pitch. That was a key learning point.  The last-place A's, coming off a four-game series sweep of the Yankees at home, fell 15 1/2 games behind the first-place Astros in the American League West. Houston opened a seven-game road trip after going 3-6 in a nine-game homestand. The A's cut Houston's lead to 2-1 in the sixth inning. With one out, Matt Joyce lined a double to right off Peacock. After Chad Pinder walked, Jed Lowrie doubled to right center, scoring Joyce. Pinder tried to score, too, but he was thrown out at home after a relay from Springer in right to shortstop Carlos Correa to Gattis. The speedy Springer cut the ball off on one hop in the alley, spun and quickly got the ball to Correa, who made a strong throw home.  It starts with Springer, him cutting the ball off and having an acrobatic throw off his back leg to get the ball in so quickly,  Hinch said.  And then Correa threw a strike. The three of them had to work together seamlessly. There wasn't much room for error. When the ball was hit, I thought both guys were going to score ... but we fundamentally made the play.  Springer led off the eighth with a home run to right center against reliever John Axford. Fisher launched a home run into the right field seats off Josh Smith with one out in the ninth. Astros relievers Will Harris, Chris Devenski and Ken Giles combined to blank the A's on no hits in the final 3 1/3 innings. Giles pitched a perfect ninth for his 17th save. The Astros took a 2-0 lead in the fifth on Marisnick's two-run shot off Gossett. On a 2-2 count, Gossett threw a 94 mph fastball that tailed back over the middle of the plate, and Marisnick hit it 440 feet for his ninth home run of the season.  Fastball out over (the plate), where Marisnick likes it,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He had some pretty good swings. That's why I took (Gossett) out the third time when he came up. But it was down, at least it looked like it was down from my angle, but he squared him up pretty good. Other than that, just a few line-drive outs, but it was way better than what we saw the first time out.  NOTES: After the game, Houston optioned OF Derek Fisher to Triple-A Fresno, opening a roster spot for OF Josh Reddick, who will be activated from the seven-day concussion disabled list on Tuesday. ... A's rookie 3B Matt Chapman (left knee infection) missed Monday's game and is being treated with antibiotics.  We'll see how it does in the next 24 hours,  said Nick Paparesta, Oakland's head athletic trainer. ... A's bench coach Mark Kotsay will take an indefinite leave of absence from the team to be with his daughter, Sienna, who was struck from close range with a tennis ball in her right eye last week and has experienced a partial loss of vision, general manager David Forst said.  Mark will stay with his family as they seek the opinions of specialists and he will remain as long as needed through recovery and the healing process,  Forst said.  He's hopeful of returning at some point this season.  Third base coach Chip Hale will serve as bench coach during Kotsay's absence, and Steve Scarsone, who had been a longtime minor-league manager for the A's until becoming a traveling instructor this year, will coach third base. Garvin Alston, a longtime pitching instructor in the organization, was hired as bullpen coach. ... Astros RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (lower back discomfort) threw a pain-free bullpen session and will likely come off the DL and return to the rotation at some point during the Astros' three-game series at Seattle, which begins Friday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-astros-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED6KTZ6R1Z"},

On Friday, Amazon.com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc, the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world. The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar, but by who is better at both. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector, a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war. German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart, which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market, with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer. The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart. Amazon's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant's business - groceries, which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart's $486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. With the deal, Whole Foods’ more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart’s 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population. Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods' notoriously high prices, enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart's customers. The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday, menswear e-tailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart may be ready. In preparation for the grocery price war, Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices, improved fresh food and meat offerings, modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles, and expanded its online grocery pickup service. Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon, told Reuters in an interview that Amazon's move does not change Wal-Mart's game plan.  We're playing offense,  he said. Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations, with 300 more planned by year end. It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores.  We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that,  Lore said. Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group, said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar advantage. The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal Rossignol I think this acquisition is a concern,  he said. Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers. But Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers. Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores, and is targeted at younger, value-conscious shoppers. Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big. Slideshow (3 Images) That (Whole Foods 365) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart,  Grant said. Amazon, which reported $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $10.2 billion in the year ended March 31, has plenty to spend. Wal-Mart reported $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31. Brittain Ladd, a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy, said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future.  Ladd, who left Amazon in March, said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts. It will select merchandise based on Amazon's vaunted customer data, and potentially expects the use of technology to change prices during the course of a day. Amazon declined comment on competition with Walmart but spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company has no plans to cut jobs or use technology in development at its Seattle Amazon Go store to automate jobs of cashiers. Ladd, who helped with AmazonFresh's global expansion and now is a supply chain consultant, said an Amazon-owned Whole Foods also likely will offer in-car pickup of online purchases, and home delivery from Whole Foods stores, add pharmacies and showcase Amazon devices inside the stores.  Amazon will reduce prices and change the assortment of products carried in Whole Foods stores to attract a larger customer base,  said Ladd.  Kroger and Wal-Mart will be impacted as their customers will defect to Amazon.

The issue -- triggered by a public watchdog's recommendation -- comes just as South Africa's economy has sunk into recession, its credit rating downgraded and politics is gripped by questions over President Jacob Zuma's stewardship. Zuma has been facing mounting calls to resign ahead of a conference in December where his successor as party leader will be chosen. His term as head of state runs until a national election in 2019. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of South Africa's  constitutionally-sanctioned anti-graft watchdog, called on Monday for the central bank's mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to be changed, saying the bank should act in the interests of empowering ordinary citizens. Speaking on 702 Talk Radio on Tuesday, Mkhwebane said the central bank's mandate was focused on a  few commercial interests . The Reserve Bank said in a statement that Mkhwebane's office had no business in making recommendations about how it is run.  The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful,  it said in a statement.  Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, who is currently in London, told Reuters he was still studying the Public Protector's report and would make a decision on whether to back the central bank in seeking a court review of the recommendation. Call for Caution But Gigaba also stressed that the independence of the central bank must be protected at all times.  We should be very cautious about making proposals that are going to leave the economy -- and the institutions we have to manage our economy -- weaker,  he said.  The Secretary General of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party Gwede Mantashe said that Mkhwebane had over-reached her powers and undermined the central bank's credibility. However, the country's largest trade union and ANC-ally Cosatu backed Mkhwebane's position.  South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said Mkhwebane's recommendation  goes beyond what she is legally empowered to do  and was illegal. S&P; Global Ratings said it was  critical  that the operational independence of the central bank remains. South Africa's banking industry lobby group also backed the central bank, urging the government to confirm the bank's independence. Prolonged political turmoil has dealt several body blows to Africa's most industrialized economy.  Unemployment is at a 14-year high, key sectors of the economy are struggling as the country reels in recession and Fitch has warned that new rules on mine ownership introduced last week could deter investment. The rand ZAR=D3 weakened as much as 1.6 percent on Monday after Mkhwebane's recommendations, but on early Tuesday it had recovered some ground following the central bank's comments, trading 0.45 percent weaker at 13.0584 per dollar. On Monday evening, the bank's governor Lesetja Kganyago defended the mandate to keep inflation low and protect the value of the currency, saying it was supportive of economic growth. Tito Mboweni, a former Reserve Bank governor warned against meddling with the central bank's independence, which he noted had been agreed as a  covenant  between bank and government.  It is unwise to try and change this at the slightest political provocation. It is a very serious matter for our beloved country,  he said in a Facebook post. Economic Woes South Africa is on the brink of prolonged economic downturn after data this month showed a second consecutive quarterly contraction to growth, with elevated political uncertainty sapping already weak business activity.    The country's credit rating was recently downgraded by all three major rating firms, with two of the top three agencies slashing Pretoria's debt into junk territory, all citing the risk of abrupt fiscal policy shifts following the sudden axing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March.     Gordhan, sacked by Zuma in what was seen as a political move, was a favorite among international investors. Investors were already expressing concern about the central bank row.  For a country grappling with political uncertainty and the medium-term need to reduce corruption and strengthen institutions, this is a worrisome development,  Head of Emerging Markets Strategy at Societe Generale Jason Daw said in a note. Dennis Dykes, chief economist at Nedbank, said:  The recommendation is completely flawed and extremely bizarre.

Speaking at an annual forum in Shanghai, Zhou focused on broad reforms and competition, but did not discuss more immediately pressing policy challenges like managing the yuan exchange rate or balancing efforts to  de-leverage  the economy and encourage growth. Zhou said some people keen to limit foreign participation in the financial sector were  focused on their own interests  and not doing Chinese financial institutions any favors.  From the experience of many countries, including our own, protections will lead to laziness and weakness... protectionism will lead to weak competitiveness and will hurt the industry's development, and (make for) unhealthy and unstable markets and institutions,  he said. The financial services industry had benefited from opening up, and must continue to do so, he said at the start of the Lujiazui Forum in China's finance hub. While the government has opened parts of the financial sector to foreign participation, non-Chinese firms still face a range of restrictions on both investment and business. Analysts say the risks to China's financial sector and the broader economy have grown as debt has soared. Maintaining healthy financial institutions was key to defending against a financial sector crisis, Zhou said. As part of efforts to lift the yuan's status as a globally significant currency, China's long-planned international payment system for cross-border yuan settlement would  soon  be based in Shanghai, Zhou said. The China International Payments System, or CIPS, would replace a patchwork of networks and allow hassle-free yuan payments. China has been keen to turn the yuan into a global currency, but its efforts have been stymied by a string of capital control measures aimed at easing depreciation pressure in recent months. The yuan lost about 6.5 percent of its value against the dollar last year and economists had expected further depreciation this year, but capital controls, a weaker dollar and other steps by the authorities have bolstered the value of the Chinese currency.

Shares of information technology companies including Infosys Ltd jumped tracking an overnight rebound in U.S. technology stocks. Asian shares were also up, with Japan's Nikkei rising more than 1 percent to a near two-year high, tracking gains in U.S. hi-tech shares as investors bet on solid growth in the economy and corporate profits globally.  The Indian IT sector is mostly trading at fairly good valuations at the moment, specifically in the mid-cap space,” said Amit Chandra, senior manager and research analyst at HDFC Securities. Short-term triggers such as bonus and share buybacks due from companies such as Wipro Ltd are also boosting overall sentiment in the sector, he added. The Nifty IT index was up 0.6 percent, with Infosys, up 1.7 percent, gaining the most. The stock had fallen in the last three sessions. Among mid-caps, Mindtree Ltd gained as much as 1.8 percent while Tata Elxsi Ltd rose as much as 2.5 percent. The broader NSE index was up 0.09 percent at 9,666.35 as of 0550 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.11 percent higher at 31,345.03. However, weakness in banking capped index gains. The Nifty PSU Bank index fell as much as 1.05 percent. The farm loan waivers for small-and-marginal farmers announced by the Punjab government on Monday are impacting the PSU sector particularly, said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer, Sanctum Wealth Management. Punjab National Bank was the top percentage loser on the Nifty PSU Bank index, declining as much as 2.5 percent. SpiceJet Ltd rose as much as 2.9 percent to 128.20 rupees, its highest in over two decades, after the budget airline said it has committed to buy 737 MAX 10 planes worth $4.7 billion (303.17 billion rupees) from Boeing Co.

The Nikkei finished up 0.8 percent at 20,230.41, after rising as high as 20,318.11 in the morning session, its loftiest peak since August 2015. Naoki Kamiyama, chief strategist at Nikko Asset Management, said the bullish tone in the Japanese equity market stemmed largely from the stronger dollar and nascent economic recoveries in Japan, the United States and Europe. In particular, he cited upbeat comments from New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, who noted that U.S. inflation should rebound alongside wages as the labour market continues to improve.  I believe the economic trend will be unchanged  in coming quarters, even with uncertainty about the next Fed chair, Kamiyama added. The next target for the Nikkei is 20,500, said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. On Wall Street overnight, the S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs, with growth sectors such as technology in favour again, as the upbeat Fed comments cheered investors. The dollar was up slightly at 111.58 yen. Sharp Corp jumped 7.7 after Jiji news agency reported that its president said it will apply for relisting on the first section of Tokyo bourse later this month. Iwaki & Co soared 11.9 percent after scaling more than 11-year highs earlier. The pharmaceutical company on Monday hiked its outlook. Askul Corp shares rose 8.9 percent, after the office supply vender on Monday revised up its profit forecast for the fiscal year that ended on May 20 and said it will pay an annual dividend.

Companies Veneto Banks The government plans to hive off the lender's impaired loans into a bad bank that would be capitalised using public money and then auction off the two lenders' healthy assets, Il Sole 24 Ore reported. Intesa is still in pole position as a buyer but also cooperative banking group ICCREA is involved in discussions, the paper said. An info memo prepared by adviser Rothschild has been sent also to UniCredit and foreign banks operating in Italy. The state could put more than 3 billion euros into the bad bank and asset sales worth up to 500 million euros could be used to reduce the size of the public contribution, la Repubblica siad. The two bank's equity and 1.2 billion euros from the conversion of junior bonds would also be used to capitalise the bad bank. Intesa will meet on Wednesday to discuss a possible offer. Several newspapers said a solution would be reached by the weekend. According to MF the bad bank could be capitalised drawing money from the resolution fund and lenders would be forced to contribute two yearly installments to beef it up. Mediaset The Italian broadcaster said on Monday it had acquired an 11.1 percent stake in its pay-TV unit Mediaset Premium from Spanish telephone group Telefonica. Spain's Telefonica will get part of any damages Italian broadcaster Mediaset may receive from Vivendi in an ongoing legal spat in exchange for its stake in pay TV unit Mediaset Premium, a source said. (*) Vivendi on Monday submitted to Italy's communications authority a proposal to cap its voting rights in Mediaset at 10 percent in a bid to address the issue of its dominant position in the sector, Il Sole 24 Ore said. Telecom Italia, Enel Italy's Industry Ministry said it would summon Telecom Italia management to discuss ultra-fast broadband plans. It told Telecom Italia it needs to respect legal commitments and rules set by European Commission for broadband investments in non-economic viable areas. (*) Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena, Popolare Emilia Romagna Banking industry bailout fund Atlante is determined to buy the Tuscan bank's bad loan portfolio, which would require it to invest alone 1.6 billion euros after Fortress and Elliott pulled out of the deal, Il Sole 24 Ore reported. Atlante has already decided not to go ahead with a 450 million euro investment earmarked for the bad loans of the Veneto banks, but it risks having to drop also commitments to buy the bad loans of the four good banks which are being taken over by BPER and Credit Agricole Italia, the paper said. Eni A consortium comprising Eni and Citla Energy made the winning bid for the 14th shallow water oil and gas block put up for auction on Monday, Mexico's oil regulator said. Libya's oil output has risen by more than 50,000 barrels per day to 885,000 bpd after the state oil firm agreed to restart production which had been stopped by a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan oil source said.

Prices paid to local farmers for common grade paddy rice are to be raised by 5.4 percent to 1,550 rupees ($24.03) per 100 kg for the year starting on July 1, while long staple cotton prices have been hiked by 3.8 percent to 4,320 rupees per 100 kg. The increases for rice, cotton and other crops follow an outburst of discontent in the heartland states of Madhya Pradesh and neighbouring Maharashtra as farmers sought higher prices and debt relief. Five protesting farmers were shot dead this month in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which along with Maharashtra is ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The unrest has posed a challenge to regional BJP leaders and Modi, who have promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years. India is the world's biggest rice exporter and buys the grain from local farmers to protect them from distressed sales and to build stocks for welfare programmes. The government fixes minimum prices for more than two dozen farm commodities, although it mainly procures wheat and rice. Growers of other crops like onions, tomatoes and potatoes are also protesting due to steep falls in the prices of their produce and the absence of the government buying. The government has also raised soybean prices by 9.9 percent to 3,050 rupees per 100 kg, and corn by 7.1 percent to 1,425 rupees per 100 kg, effective from July 1. The increases for these two grains were also the greatest since 2012/13. $1 = 64.5125 Indian rupees Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav in MUMBAI and Nidhi Verma in NEW DELHI; Editing by Tom Hogue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/india-farmers-prices-idUSL3N1JH1WM"},

Tellingly, Monday's decision related to trademarks, not patents. Since its term began last October, the Supreme Court has thrown out all six patent-related decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which was set up to handle such cases. Since 2014, the high court has upheld the patent court in only two of 16 patent cases, a Reuters review showed. The lack of agreement between the high court and the patent court reflects a basic conflict at the top of the U.S. legal system over intellectual property rights, which are critical to many industries. The high court's pattern on patent law is part of a wider trend, under Chief Justice John Roberts, of the court siding with business in legal disputes that come before it. Business interests have won a string of victories in the current term, which is scheduled to end next week. Through its repeated reversals of the patent court, the Supreme Court is making it harder to sue companies using patents. That helps major technology firms such as Google, Apple and Samsung, all frequent targets of patent infringement lawsuits by  patent trolls.  Other industries, including drug and medical diagnostics companies, have warned against weaker patent rights.  The patent system has been weakened, and as far as I'm concerned the Supreme Court is unaware of that,  said Paul Michel, who retired as Federal Circuit chief judge in 2010. Michel said the high court's decisions had created huge uncertainty for companies and investors over patent rights and could affect research and development and innovation.  Reached by Reuters, a representative for the Federal Circuit declined to comment. The Supreme Court's patent cases this term have been significant, including one involving Apple and Samsung over smartphones. In that case, the justices said the Federal Circuit misinterpreted the law on design patents. A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S., November 15, 2016.Carlos BarriaIn another major case, the Supreme Court repudiated a 27-year-old Federal Circuit precedent and tightened where patent lawsuits may be filed, a blow to the  trolls,  or entities that generate revenue by suing over patents.  It’s pretty safe to say that it's one of the most impactful decisions of the term,  said Allyson Ho, a business lawyer, at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event on Friday. In an exception that perhaps proves the rule, the high court on Monday upheld the Federal Circuit's decision to strike down a law that prevents disparaging names from being trademarked. The Federal Circuit also handles some trademark cases. Condescending Tone The justices have sometimes adopted a condescending tone toward the Federal Circuit's patent rulings.  During arguments in a 2014 case, Roberts suggested the Federal Circuit was failing at streamlining patent law, one of the reasons for its creation in 1982. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in an opinion that same year that the Federal Circuit  fundamentally misunderstands what it means to infringe  certain patents.  When the patent court was founded, the judges  saw their mission as making patents stronger, and the Supreme Court thought it went too far and started to reel them in,  said Rochelle Dreyfuss, a professor of law at New York University who has studied the court.  Now the question is whether the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction.  She said the patent court was doing a better job explaining its rulings. It recently seated several new judges, and Sharon Prost, viewed as less pro-patent than her predecessor, became chief judge in 2014.  Duke University law professor Arti Rai said the high court seemed to disapprove of treating patent law differently from other areas of law.  The situation could spark further debate over the future trajectory of the specialist court, Rai said. For several years, attorneys, judges and professors have sparred over whether the court should retain exclusive control over patent cases.  Some observers note that other appeals courts also go through periods of high reversal rates. Carter Phillips, who frequently argues patent cases, said that since the Federal Circuit was the sole appeals court to decide patent issues, the Supreme Court was more likely to review only those rulings it thinks are wrong.

It also said that planned gas export curbs would be delayed until January 2018 at the earliest. The move to limit network price hikes is the latest of several steps announced to bolster power supply and cap soaring energy prices, following a string of blackouts due to the rise of wind and solar power and shutdown of coal- and gas-fired plants. Homes are facing power price hikes of around 18-20 percent from July 1, on top of sharp rises in electricity and gas bills over the past few years, turning energy into a hot political issue. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce told the coalition government on Tuesday that energy bills were the  No.1 issue amongst the electorate , a person familiar with talks in the party room told Reuters. Power transmission and distribution costs make up around half of household power bills, and to keep a lid on prices, the government is proposing barring networks, like the recently privatised Endeavour Energy, from appealing rate decisions. Distributors in Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, last month won a court fight that could earn them close to A$3 billion ($2.3 billion) extra in revenue over five years, after the energy regulator tried to make them cut their charges.  By abolishing the limited merits review process, we believe that that will put downward pressure on electricity prices,  Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg told reporters. The government also said regulations it has proposed to curb exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from eastern Australia at times of tight supply would be in place from January next year at the earliest, later than the July 1 start date originally touted. Each year around September, starting this year, a determination will be made as to whether there will be a gas shortfall the following calendar year, but the actual trigger has yet to be determined, Resources Minister Matt Canavan's spokeswoman said. The rules are expected to apply only to east coast exporters that are not  net contributors  to the domestic market. Santos, operator of the Gladstone LNG plant in Queensland, is most at risk of having its exports curbed, as it is the only LNG producer that has been taking gas out of the domestic market to meet its export contracts. Santos has said the proposal is unfair and could lead to higher gas prices. $1 = 1.3170 Australian dollars Reporting by Sonali Paul; Additional reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by Joseph Radford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-power-gas-idUSL3N1JH1UU"},

Their borrowing costs have increased more than 200bp in the 12 months to March 2017 as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka increased policy rates by 125bp and the statutory reserve ratio by 150bp in an attempt to reign in aggressive credit growth. Fitch does not expect the pressure on interest rates to ease in the near term owing to rising inflationary pressures and weak external finances. Annual inflation as measured by the Colombo consumer price index rose to 8.4% in April 2017 from 4.3% a year ago. Corporates with high short-term working capital requirements such as retail and manufacturing companies are hurt the most by the recent rate increases. In Fitch's view, the two large consumer-durable retailers, Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (A-(lka)/Stable) and Abans PLC (BBB+(lka)/Stable), are the most affected of the entities we rate as most of their borrowings consist of short-term working capital financing and will have to be rolled over at higher rates. Furthermore, both companies realise 30%-40% of their sales through hire-purchase schemes which can meaningfully weaken with rising interest rates and slow EBITDA growth. Fitch believes Singer has more headroom in its current rating to withstand these challenges compared with Abans. Kotagala Plantations PLC (CC(lka)) may also face further liquidity pressure on account of higher interest payments. Fitch believes Hemas Holdings PLC (AA-(lka)/Stable) and Sunshine Holdings PLC (A(lka)) to be the least affected due to their low refinancing requirements during the next 12 months. The interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense) of corporates that Fitch rates deteriorated to 6.9x on average in the 12 months ended March 2017 from 9.2x a year ago because of the rising rates and higher debt. Debt increased mostly on account of investments in new capacity in sectors such as retail and manufacturing, which may take longer to translate into meaningful cash flows. Fitch estimates interest coverage may fall to 5.2x by the end of the current financial year if interest rates were to rise by 100bp. If interest rates were to rise by 200bp, coverage would weaken further to 4.8x. These estimates are based on our expectations that Fitch-rated corporates' EBITDA will grow by around 1% on average over this period, and debt will increase by 6%. We have assumed that 100% of corporates' short-term debt and 40% of long-term debt will be re-priced at higher rates immediately. Most of the long-term debt stems from banks and around half of such debt are at a variable interest rate. As of end-March 2017, almost 50% of the outstanding borrowings of Fitch-rated corporates consisted of short-term borrowings primarily funding working capital, exposing the companies to modest interest-rate risk at the point of refinancing. Only 12% of the outstanding borrowings of Fitch-rated corporates consisted of debenture financing, which is predominantly on fixed rates.

The deal between Tabcorp, Australia's top horse racing and sports betting company, and Tatts would help create a domestic gambling powerhouse even as the challenge from overseas online rivals mounts.

Poroshenko praised the U.S. Senate for the decision to  introduce new sanctions against Russia, saying that sanctions were a civilized mechanism  to force the aggressor to get away from Ukraine , withdraw troops and equipment.  Last week, the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly for new sanctions punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and to force Trump to get Congress' approval before easing any existing sanctions. The move was intended to punish Russia over issues including alleged meddling in the election, which Moscow denies, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country's six-year-long civil war. The Minsk peace agreement, brokered by France and Germany and signed by Russia and Ukraine in February 2015, calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy.

Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said the French group would make an initial $1 billion investment after the United States extended sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 agreement. Washington has warned that it could cancel the sanctions waivers if it believes Tehran is not curbing its nuclear program in line with the deal with world powers.  It is worth taking the risk at $1 billion because it opens a huge market. We are perfectly conscious of some risks. We have taken into account (sanctions) snap-backs, we have to take into account regulation changes,  Pouyanne said in an interview. The offshore field was first developed in the 1990s, and Total was one of the biggest investors in Iran until the international sanctions were imposed in 2006 over suspicions that Tehran was trying to develop nuclear arms. Total has decided to return and develop phase 11 of the South Pars project in the Gulf, which will cost up to $5 billion, at a time when President Hassan Rouhani has faced criticism at home over a lack of economic revival following the easing of sanctions under the nuclear deal.  Though one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, most major international giants including Royal Dutch Shell and BP have so far shown limited appetite to invest in Iran, due to uncertainty over contract terms and a sharp drop in global oil prices. U.S. President Donald Trump's hard line on Iran has further cooled the investment climate, even though his administration extended the wide sanctions relief last month.  The U.S. waivers have been renewed and they will be renewed every six to eight months. We have to live with some uncertainty,  said Pouyanne. Total holds a 50.1 interest in the South Pars project along with state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, with 30 percent, and Iran's Petropars with a 19.9 percent, he said. The French group has also made a number of significant investments in recent years in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Brazil as Pouyanne sees the three-year downturn in the global energy market as an opportunity to clinch deals for cheap resources to secure strong growth.  Real Improvement  Total aims to achieve returns of above 15 percent on every new project it is enters into around the world. That includes South Pars, where terms discussed with the Iranian government would be significantly better than in the pre-sanctions period, Pouyanne said. Investors have complained that previous Iranian contracts allowed foreign companies little profit. Total worked on phases 2-3 of South Pars in the 1990s. The new Iranian Petroleum Contract (IPC) differs from its predecessor by offering the operator remuneration based on production rather than a simple percentage of the development costs, Pouyanne said. It also extends over a period of 20 years rather than seven or eight.  The IPC is a real improvement,  he said.  We will not go to Iran if there is not a reward which is commensurate.  With U.S. sanctions still in place prohibiting trading with Iran in dollars, Total will finance the project in euros from its own resources. Gas from South Pars will supply only the fast-growing domestic Iranian market and none will be exported, Pouyanne said. Total will be paid not in cash but in condensate, a very light crude oil which is a by-product of gas production. South Pars is part of a giant gas reservoir that straddles the territorial waters of Iran and Qatar, where Total is also a major player in gas production as well as in oil and refining. Tehran has indicated that the development of the project will not be hit by Qatar's diplomatic isolation due to a dispute with Saudi Arabia and some of its Gulf Arab allies.  Total is also considering a petrochemicals project in Iran which would require external financing from Asian banks, although this remains in less advanced stage, Pouyanne said.

That could provide a further boost to Chinese tin exports that have already been climbing this year, buttressing dwindling stocks abroad and dampening global prices.  We don't have a clear timeframe for (such) tin exports ... as there is lots of preparation work to do. We are in talks with the Ministry of Commerce and customs to go through the process,  Yunnan Tin Co (YTC) official Yue Min told Reuters, without giving further details. The agreement means that YTC will be able to skip the 17-percent value-added tax (VAT) on refined metal exports that it has produced from imported concentrate, said tin industry body ITRI. The Chinese government did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. The step comes after China, the world's biggest user and producer of tin, early this year scrapped 10-percent duty on all exports of refined tin, ending a policy that had crimped export volumes since it was introduced in 2008. YTC is by far the world's biggest producer of refined tin, with some 76,000 tonnes of output last year, around three times the amount of No.2 producer, Malaysia Smelting Corp, according to data from ITRI. YTC's approval could indicate that other tin producers may also get the green light for processing trade, although that was unlikely to happen in the near term, market participants said.  I think a lot of that concern about tightening supply outside of China has been relieved with this new potential for increased Chinese exports,  said Tom Mulqueen of ITRI in London.  We are likely to see more significant exports than we've seen so far this year and last year.  China's tin exports have more than doubled so far in 2017, though still remain at modest levels of around 200 tonnes. That compares with 735 tonnes for 2016 and more than 23,000 tonnes in 2007. Although China has its own reserves, it has imported much more concentrate from Myanmar in recent years. London Metal Exchange tin stocks have sunk below 2,000 tonnes to the least since 1998, while benchmark LME tin prices have fallen more than 7 percent so far this year, making it the second worst performing base metal after nickel. Traders noted that international demand for tin would need to heat up further for LME prices to attract metal out of China. Shanghai Futures Exchange tin at 144,440 yuan ($21,195) a tonne is still more expensive than LME tin at $19,640.

Police in Manila have been on high alert since fighting erupted last month in Marawi City in the south of the predominantly Christian country between the military and militants linked to Islamic State.  We have no confirmation whatsoever of any terror attack in Manila,  Police Director Oscar Albayalde told ANC television, responding to concern about a leaked police intelligence report warning of bomb attacks that spread on social media. He said the leaked report was genuine but said it contained raw information that was distributed to police units to check and seek verification. The internal memo, dated June 16, said police had information that members of the Maute group - the Islamic State-linked faction that is fighting in Marawi - were planning to set off bombs in the capital.  The content of the memorandum is meant for validation and confirmation, it's not meant to scare the public,  Albayalde said, adding that he had ordered an investigation into how the document was leaked. He said police were  on top of the situation  and people should not be alarmed.      Financial markets were largely unruffled by fears of violence. Philippine stocks were down marginally while the peso earlier touched a one-month low, tracking other weaker Asian currencies. The battle in Marawi has entered its fifth week. On Tuesday, military aircraft bombed rebel positions and ground troops launched a renewed push against the militants holed up in a section of the city.

Lately it doesn't seem like we score unless we're hitting home runs,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. This season, Toronto has scored 56 percent of its runs off home runs. If that holds up through the year, it would be the highest rate of production from home runs of any team in major-league history, according to STATS Inc. That changed Monday when the Blue Jays used a couple of base hits at the most crucial time of the game. Josh Donaldson drove in the tying run with a hard-hit single, and two batters later Kendrys Morales' base hit drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth in Toronto's 7-6 comeback victory over the Texas Rangers. The Blue Jays sent eight hitters to the plate in scoring twice on three hits and two walks off Texas closer Matt Bush (2-2), who blew his third save attempt in 11 opportunities. Jeff Beliveau (1-0) earned the victory by working a scoreless eighth. Right-hander Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect bottom of the ninth to record his 18th save. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RangersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchLeft-handed reliever Aaron Loup played a key role in keeping Toronto in the game, entering the game to get the Blue Jays out of a bases-loaded jam with one out in the fifth. He retired all five batters he faced in the fifth and sixth while recording three strikeouts.  I'm proud of all of them. It was a tough game on both sides,  Gibbons said.  Both starters gave up runs early and then both bullpens shut the teams down until the end.  Ryan Goins led off Toronto's half of the ninth with a double. Kevin Pillar popped out to second before Donaldson delivered a base hit to tie the game. Jose Bautista, who had a home run in the Blue Jays' four-run fourth, walked to bring up Morales, who drove in Donaldson.  After he gave up the leadoff double on the fastball, he got away from I think what his best pitch is, and that's the fastball,  said Texas manager Jeff Banister of Bush, who blew his second save in a span of four chances.  Two walks, one was on a slider, the other a curveball and the rest of the damage was done on his secondary stuff.   I left a couple of pitches up, and they did their job and deposited them,  Bush said.  I felt like I didn't attack guys enough. I feel like I missed with some sliders and getting beat on my second-best pitch. I can't lose faith in my fastball. It's not that I don't trust the pitch. It's just that I want to keep hitters off-balance and off my fastball.  Morales was 2-for-5 with a double. Justin Smoak hit his 20th home run in the second. Steve Pearce, who has hit in a club-best six consecutive games, had a three-run double. Adrian Beltre's double in the Rangers' five-run fourth put Texas up 6-5. Beltre's hit also moved him further up baseball's statistical ladder, passing Al Kaline for 37th all-time with 1,583 RBIs. He also tied Luis Gonzalez for 17th all-time with his 596th double and matched Cal Ripken Jr. with 1,078 extra-base hits, 23rd all-time. Elvis Andrus contributed a two-run single in Texas' big inning, which was boosted by three walks off Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada. Nomar Mazara had a solo home run in the first for Texas. Neither starter figured in the decision. Texas journeyman Austin Bibens-Dirkx, who spent 2013-15 in the Toronto organization, gave up five runs on five hits and a walk while striking out five over five innings. Offensively, the Rangers finally figured out Estrada, who entered having limited Texas to one earned run in six of his seven career starts against them. In his last start in Texas, Estrada was masterful, giving up one run over 8 1/3 innings in Game 1 of the ALDS in October. Monday, though, marked a fourth straight poor outing. In four starts in June, Estrada is 0-4, having given up 34 runs on 24 hits and seven walks over 16 1/3 innings. This time walks were the problem as he allowed four free passes.  I'm in a bit of a pitcher's slump, I guess, and it (stinks),  Estrada said.  But the good thing is we won. I'm happy. The only thing I'm upset about is the bullpen had to pick up those innings.  Estrada wasn't the only one with walk issues. Left-handed reliever Dominic Leone walked the bases full in the fifth with one out. Loup, however, rode to the rescue.  Loupy's been around a few years. I've seen him do that many times,  Gibbons said.  He's had a good solid year. I think that's the best he's looked in his last few appearances because he's throwing strikes, hitting his spots.  The teams combined to send nine hitters to the plate in the fourth and in total threw 79 pitches.

MSCI will announce its decision after the close. The Saudi stock index surged 2.4 percent on Monday after Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, vice chairman of the Capital Market Authority, was quoted as saying by the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that he expected Riyadh to be upgraded by the end of 2018 - faster than the mid-2019 date which MSCI's past practice would suggest. This hope encouraged local funds to buy stocks on Monday and that may continue for another day, although many fund managers think fundemntals are not particularly attractive so a positive decision by MSCI could prompt profit-taking. In the United Arab Emirates, Dana Gas may attract interest after Goldilocks Investment Co, an open-ended equity fund which is part of Abu Dhabi Financial Group, said it had bought 5 percent of the company. Goldilocks' brief statement did not say what it intended to do with Dana, but it may be anticipating ultimate success in Dana's efforts to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid receivables and damages from Iraqi Kurdistan.

The stock may not continue rising sharply for much longer, however, as some analysts think it is close to fair value. Analysts at Arqaam Capital said they were keeping their target price unchanged at 2.32 dirhams, as Tabreed's growth would benefit from Engie's experience but share buy-backs by the company were no longer likely.

The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said it expected economic growth of 1.4 percent in 2017, below the forecast of 1.6 percent it gave in March.  The slight downward adjustment compared with the previous forecast takes into account the more sluggish growth seen in the first quarter. Economic growth is expected to accelerate substantially throughout the year due to favourable economic conditions at an international level and thanks to the continued strong sentiment indicators,  SECO said. SECO kept its forecast for gross domestic product to expand 1.9 percent in 2018. Inflation was forecast to be 0.5 percent in 2017 and 0.2 percent in 2018, compared to its earlier view of 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent. Anticipated rent reductions should weigh on 2018 price increases, it said. The Swiss National Bank last week said it expected Swiss economic growth of around 1.5 percent this year, with inflation rising to 1.0 percent by 2019 from 0.3 percent this year.  There still remains a significant amount of political risk in connection with the USA's stance on trade and fiscal policy and the implementation of the Brexit referendum. If these risks materialise, they would, however, not be likely to have an impact on Switzerland until the second half of the forecast period,  SECO said. It also cited  additional uncertainty  in Italy ahead of a general election.  After the failure of the electoral reform, political instability is a possible threat. The associated risks must not be underestimated given the high level of government debt borne by this key member of the euro and the ongoing fragility of its banking sector,  it said.  The Swiss franc could end up being pushed up sharply if the European debt crisis were to flare up again or the situation in the banking sector worsen significantly, with considerable consequences for the Swiss economy.

Given that their profits are expected to see exponential growth in coming years, it is premature to say the rally in hi-tech shares is over,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. U.S. financial shares also gained as U.S. debt yields rose after New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said U.S. inflation should rebound alongside wages as the labour market continues to improve. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged up to 2.184 percent from a seven-month low of 2.103 percent touched on Wednesday, following surprisingly weak U.S. inflation data.  Even though the Federal Reserve is about to shrink its balance sheet, possibly as soon as in September, U.S. bond yields are kept at low levels, which are very comfortable for stocks,  said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  Trade volume is light and whether the market continues to rise depends on whether large cap tech shares continue to rebound,  he also said. The rebound in U.S. bond yields helped to lift the U.S. dollar, which rose to 111.775 yen, its highest level in more than three weeks. The euro traded at $1.1154, just above its two-week low of $1.11315 set on Thursday. The British pound slipped slightly to $1.2735 from Monday's high of $1.2814, held back by uncertainty over domestic politics and over Britain's economic future, as formal Brexit negotiations got under way on Monday. Oil prices flirted with this year's lows as market players saw more signs that rising crude production in the United States, Libya and Nigeria were undercutting OPEC-led efforts to support the market with output curbs. Brent crude futures traded at $46.92 per barrel, flat on the day and not far from last week's low of $46.70 and five-month low of $46.64 touched in early May. U.S. crude futures stood at $44.19 per barrel, less than a half cent above its five-month low of $43.76 set on May 5. Safe-haven gold hit a one-month low of $1,243.2 an ounce as risk sentiment improved, before bouncing back a tad to $1,245.5.

At one point, the dollar rose to 111.775 yen, reaching its strongest level since May 26. That marked a gain of about 2.7 percent from the dollar's near 2-month low of 108.81 yen set on June 14. The greenback last stood at 111.67 yen, up 0.1 percent on the day. The dollar was lifted on Monday when New York Fed President William Dudley said that tightening in the labour market should help drive up inflation. That helped offset concerns among some investors that stubbornly low inflation could prevent the Fed from raising interest rates further this year. Dudley's comments reinforced the message from last week's Fed meeting and gave a boost to the dollar, said Teppei Ino, analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore. The dollar is now near some key technical resistance levels, including its May 24 intraday high of 112.13 yen, Ino said.  It's sort of at a crossroads now. If it gets through these levels, that could open the way for further gains, at least from a technical perspective,  he said. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise interest rates again. The greenback has edged higher since the Fed on June 14 raised interest rates for a second time in 2017 and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities later this year, while indicating that a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory. The dollar may see further gains against the yen, especially after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week indicated the BOJ would be in no hurry to dial back its massive stimulus programme, said Tan Teck Leng, forex analyst for UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.  Short-term, maybe the dollar/yen could be the one that's more interesting,  Tan said. However, any weakness in U.S. inflation data going forward would pose a risk for dollar bulls, he added. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar rose to as high as 97.609 at one point on Tuesday, its highest level since May 30. The dollar index last traded at 97.514. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1156.. Sterling held steady at $1.2740, ahead of speeches by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and British finance minister Philip Hammond later on Tuesday. The two men in charge of Britain's economy are expected to spell out how they plan to prevent a further hit to its already weakened growth prospects following this week's launch of the historic Brexit talks.

By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 20 (Reuters) - The call by China's securities regulator for the country's wealth managers to invest in domestic commodity futures is both encouraging and somewhat bizarre. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) aims to promote the domestic derivatives industry by loosening regulations that restrict how commercial banks, insurance companies and pension funds invest in commodity futures, Fang Xinghai, the commission's vice chairman, said on June 17. Fang, who was speaking at a financial forum in Qingdao, didn't give further details of the proposal, but it seems to fit into recent moves by the authorities in Beijing to promote commodity trading and become more of a player in global markets. The positive news out of the CSRC's announcement is that China seems to be getting serious about opening up its markets and encouraging a broader range of participation. Several commodity contracts have taken off in recent years, such as iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE). But these have often been criticised as more like legal casinos for day-trading retail investors rather than offering price discovery or viable hedging for market participants. As part of efforts to boost commodity trading, China's three major exchanges, the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and the DCE, are planning to boost the number of commodities that can be traded. Contracts for certain fruits, chemicals and electricity are among those being considered, adding to an already considerable array of contracts for commodities that would be considered somewhat obscure in Western markets, such as bitumen and silicomanganese. But while expanding the amount of commodities being offered and boosting the number and type of investors allowed to participate in the markets sounds promising, it's not straightforward. Trust Deficit If there is one thing investors have learnt about the authorities in Beijing is that they aren't afraid to intervene in what are supposed to be free markets if they don't like the price movements and volatility. On several occasions last year, the authorities took steps to crack down on trading in then hot commodities such as iron ore, steel and coal. Measures included increasing margins to be held against positions and boosting the cost of trading on the exchanges. These steps did have some impact on cooling commodity trading last year, but probably not to the extent that the authorities wanted. The problem for investors in Chinese commodity exchanges is that they can never be certain as to when, and how, the authorities will act to clamp down on trading. Allowing financial institutions to trade in commodities may smooth out some of the volatility, assuming they adopt longer-term positions based on expectations of supply and demand fundamentals. But if these investors choose to act more like hedge funds in taking large positions in order to drive the market in their preferred direction, it will boost volatility and undermine the use of Chinese commodity exchanges as a hedging tool. As the world's biggest producer, consumer and importer of commodities, China should have well-developed and open futures exchanges. But simply loosening regulations to allow for greater participation doesn't address the underlying problem in China, namely the uncertainty of government interference and the trust deficit this causes. To be truly effective, China's commodity contracts would also have to be fully open to foreign traders, something that isn't currently the case. But for foreigners to participate, regulatory certainty becomes essential, meaning Beijing must curb its inclination to intervene in the markets if it sees developments it doesn't like. It's this problem that has so far prevented China from setting up a crude oil futures contract, which would be aimed at capturing a chunk of the global trade in this key commodity. The struggles of China, the world's biggest importer of crude oil, to launch a viable futures contract covering the fuel shows just how far the country still has to travel in its ambition to become a global commodity hub.

The U.S. coast guard investigation is one several into the incident on Saturday involving the guided missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal. The cause of the collision at night and in clear weather is not known.  We are scheduled to interview the crew members,  said U.S. Lieutenant Scott Carr told Reuters, referring the crew of the merchant ship. The USS Fitzgerald crew will also be interviewed. The U.S. coast guard, which is undertaking the investigation on behalf of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, will  gather electronic data and ship tracking information from the USS Fitzgerald and ACX Crystal. The investigation will also look into a time discrepancy in the ACX Crystal's initial report of the incident south of Tokyo Bay, said Scott.  There is a contradiction. It will be part of the investigation,  Carr said. The Japan Coast Guard has already spoken to the Filipino crew and is also probing the inconsistency. It is in talks with the U.S. Navy for access to its crew members and data from the destroyer, a spokesman for the organization said. The U.S. Navy did not immediately respond when asked if it would release tracking data to the Japan Coast Guard. The ACX Crystal reported the collision at 2:25 a.m. (1725 GMT) prompting Japanese authorities to initially log the incident at 2:20 a.m. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, damaged by colliding with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel, is seen at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka,, Japan.Toru HanaiThe Japan Coast Guard subsequently revised the time to 1:30 a.m. meaning the container ship waited 55 minutes before contacting the coast guard, according to the Japan Coast Guard.  Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the merchant ship chartered by Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, made a complete U-turn between 12:58 a.m. and 2:46 a.m. on June 17. The Fitzgerald did not contact local authorities. The Japan Coast Guard radioed it after receiving the first report of the collision.      Many of the crew on the U.S. ship were asleep when the collision tore a gash under the waterline on the warship's starboard side, flooding two crew compartments, the radio room and the auxiliary machine room.  Maritime rules suggest vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard.  When asked on Sunday if the damage indicated the U.S. ship could have been at fault, Seventh Fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin declined to speculate on the cause. Complicating the inquiries could be issues of jurisdiction. Although the collision occurred in Japanese waters, international maritime rules, could allow the U.S. Navy to claim some authority over the investigations. The incident was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000, when 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured Reporting by Tim Kelly and Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Michael Perry","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-navy-asia-idUSKBN19B0DE"},

Seven strong innings,  Yost said of Hammel.  He only mis-located a slider to (Jackie) Bradley (Jr.) that he hit out of the park. Besides that he was fantastic. Since he and Dave (Eiland, pitching coach) made a little mechanical tweak, he's really been on a roll.  Brian Boyer (0-1) took the loss, giving up two runs on three hits in 1 1/3 innings. Left-hander Mike Minor, who replaced Hammel, weaved his way into and out of turmoil in the eighth. The Red Sox loaded the bases on singles by Hanley Ramirez and Bradley and a walk to pinch hitter Chris Young. The inning ended when Christian Vazquez grounded out to third baseman Cheslor Cuthbert.  Once again we created a number of opportunities, a big one in the eighth,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said. The Red Sox stranded 11 runners and went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position.  You can't fault the effort at all on our part,  Farrell said.  We didn't get a two-out base hit to narrow the gap.  Kelvin Herrera worked the ninth to pick up his 16th save. Hector Velazquez, who was making his second big league start and third appearance, was removed after 5 1/3 innings, allowing two Kansas City runs on five hits in a no-decision. He walked none and struck out three. Fernando Abad replaced Velazquez and immediately got into trouble. He walked Eric Hosmer, and Mike Moustakas put down a bunt single to the left side that beat the shift. Abad exited after facing two batters and getting nobody out. Boyer was summoned from the bullpen and retired Cuthbert on a fly to shallow center and Alcides Escobar on a fielder's choice grounder with second baseman Josh Rutledge making a diving stop of a ball headed for center. Boyer escaped in the sixth, but not in the seventh. The Royals broke out on top 2-0 in the third inning. Hosmer went deep to center, a 446-foot blast on a full-count change up from Velazquez. Bonifacio was along for the ride.  It was just a pitch I left over the plate,  Velazquez said through an interpreter.  You can't make those mistakes to big league hitters and Hosmer is a good one. So he made me pay. But you have to turn the page and move forward.  Hammel could not hold the lead for two batters. Ramirez led off the top of the fourth with a bloop single to right. Bradley turned on a Hammel pitch and deposited it over the right-field fence and into the Red Sox bullpen to tie the score at 2. Velazquez pitched out of trouble in the first when Bonifacio singled and went to third on Cain's one-out single. Hosmer struck out and Moustakas flied out to left to strand the runners. NOTES: Red Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia was not in the lineup after being hit by a pitch in the ribs Sunday. X-rays were negative. ... Royals C Salvador Perez did not start because of discomfort in his rib cage area from a swing Sunday. Drew Butera started behind the plate, but Perez entered in the eighth after Ramon Torres ran for Butera. ... The Royals signed 1B Nick Pratto, their first-round pick out of Huntington Beach (Calif.) High School. ... The Royals recalled RHP Kevin McCarthy from Triple-A Omaha. They optioned LHP Eric Skoglund to the Storm Chasers. ... Red Sox 3B Pablo Sandoval, who did not play in the series at Houston, started Monday. ... Red Sox LHP Chris Sale and Royals LHP Matt Strahm are the Tuesday probables.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED6KTV44Z7"},

The U.S. coast guard investigation is one several into the incident on Saturday involving the guided missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal. The cause of the collision at night and in clear weather is not known.  We are scheduled to interview the crew members,  said U.S. Lieutenant Scott Carr told Reuters, referring the crew of the merchant ship. The USS Fitzgerald crew will also be interviewed. The U.S. coast guard, which is undertaking the investigation on behalf of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, will  gather electronic data and ship tracking information from the USS Fitzgerald and ACX Crystal. The investigation will also look into a time discrepancy in the ACX Crystal's initial report of the incident south of Tokyo Bay, said Scott.  There is a contradiction. It will be part of the investigation,  Carr said. The Japan Coast Guard has already spoken to the Filipino crew and is also probing the inconsistency. It is in talks with the U.S. Navy for access to its crew members and data from the destroyer, a spokesman for the organization said. The U.S. Navy did not immediately respond when asked if it would release tracking data to the Japan Coast Guard. The ACX Crystal reported the collision at 2:25 a.m. (1725 GMT) prompting Japanese authorities to initially log the incident at 2:20 a.m. The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, damaged by colliding with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel, is seen at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka,, Japan.Toru HanaiThe Japan Coast Guard subsequently revised the time to 1:30 a.m. meaning the container ship waited 55 minutes before contacting the coast guard, according to the Japan Coast Guard.  Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the merchant ship chartered by Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, made a complete U-turn between 12:58 a.m. and 2:46 a.m. on June 17. The Fitzgerald did not contact local authorities. The Japan Coast Guard radioed it after receiving the first report of the collision.      Many of the crew on the U.S. ship were asleep when the collision tore a gash under the waterline on the warship's starboard side, flooding two crew compartments, the radio room and the auxiliary machine room.  Maritime rules suggest vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard.  When asked on Sunday if the damage indicated the U.S. ship could have been at fault, Seventh Fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin declined to speculate on the cause. Complicating the inquiries could be issues of jurisdiction. Although the collision occurred in Japanese waters, international maritime rules, could allow the U.S. Navy to claim some authority over the investigations. The incident was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000, when 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured Reporting by Tim Kelly and Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Michael Perry","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-navy-asia-idUSL3N1JH1W4"},

(Reuters) - U.S. local social networking phenomenon Nextdoor is entering Germany, Europe's largest market, the company said on Monday, following expansion moves last year into Britain and the Netherlands, where it has grown rapidly. San Francisco-based Nextdoor launched in 2011 and now covers more than 144,000 discrete U.S. neighborhoods, or roughly three-quarters of the country, the company estimates. Local residents can use the site to ask advice on everything from finding babysitters to organizing neighborhood sports clubs or even how to contend with household rodent invasions, via computer or mobile phone apps.  Its local forums serve as conversation starters that help neighbors meet one another, forging real-world bonds instead of the virtual ones that connect friends as well as strangers on social networks such as Facebook, Snapchat or Twitter.  Most social media apps are about self-expression,  Co-founder and Chief Executive Nirav Tolia said in an interview.  Nextdoor is about getting things done. It's more of a utility.   If you lose your dog, your online friends can give you sympathy but your neighbors help you find it,  he said. Nextdoor has raised over $210 million in funding from top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists, with its last financing round in 2015 valuing the company at more than $1 billion. Since expanding into Britain last year, Nextdoor has signed up users in 40 percent of UK neighborhoods, or about 11,000 in all. Similarly, it has drawn in members in 4,000 Dutch neighborhoods, covering about 44 percent of the country, Nextdoor said. The company has already been testing its service in 200 neighborhoods in Germany and aims to have thousands up and running by the end of this year, Tolia said. It has hired veteran internet executive Marcus Riecke, the one-time head of eBay's German local selling site and CEO of StudiVZ, a successful early German rival to Facebook that ran out of steam around the start of this decade. Riecke will run Nextdoor's national offices from Berlin.   To join Nextdoor Germany, members must use their real names and confirm their home address at nextdoor.de. Conversations are only accessible among verified local neighbors and are not available via Google or other search engines.  Nextdoor began generating revenue from its U.S. site this year by selling online advertising. The model is similar but more locally focused than the ads that finance Facebook or Google, reviving the tradition of local classified ads that has disappeared as the online era wiped out the economics of local newspaper circulars.

(Reuters) - U.S. local social networking phenomenon Nextdoor is entering Germany, Europe's largest market, the company said on Monday, following expansion moves last year into Britain and the Netherlands, where it has grown rapidly. San Francisco-based Nextdoor launched in 2011 and now covers more than 144,000 discrete U.S. neighborhoods, or roughly three-quarters of the country, the company estimates. Local residents can use the site to ask advice on everything from finding babysitters to organizing neighborhood sports clubs or even how to contend with household rodent invasions, via computer or mobile phone apps.  Its local forums serve as conversation starters that help neighbors meet one another, forging real-world bonds instead of the virtual ones that connect friends as well as strangers on social networks such as Facebook, Snapchat or Twitter.  Most social media apps are about self-expression,  Co-founder and Chief Executive Nirav Tolia said in an interview.  Nextdoor is about getting things done. It's more of a utility.   If you lose your dog, your online friends can give you sympathy but your neighbors help you find it,  he said. Nextdoor has raised over $210 million in funding from top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists, with its last financing round in 2015 valuing the company at more than $1 billion. Since expanding into Britain last year, Nextdoor has signed up users in 40 percent of UK neighborhoods, or about 11,000 in all. Similarly, it has drawn in members in 4,000 Dutch neighborhoods, covering about 44 percent of the country, Nextdoor said. The company has already been testing its service in 200 neighborhoods in Germany and aims to have thousands up and running by the end of this year, Tolia said. It has hired veteran internet executive Marcus Riecke, the one-time head of eBay's German local selling site and CEO of StudiVZ, a successful early German rival to Facebook that ran out of steam around the start of this decade. Riecke will run Nextdoor's national offices from Berlin.   To join Nextdoor Germany, members must use their real names and confirm their home address at nextdoor.de. Conversations are only accessible among verified local neighbors and are not available via Google or other search engines.  Nextdoor began generating revenue from its U.S. site this year by selling online advertising. The model is similar but more locally focused than the ads that finance Facebook or Google, reviving the tradition of local classified ads that has disappeared as the online era wiped out the economics of local newspaper circulars.

But a play at the plate that stopped Rizzo from scoring a run raised ire from the Padres and shrugs from Rizzo and the Cubs. Rizzo tripled to open the Cubs sixth, bolted for home after Kris Bryant's liner to center was caught. Rizzo barreled into Padres catcher Austin Hedges after he caught a throw from center fielder Matt Szczur and defended the plate.  It's a cheap shot,  said Padres manager Andy Green.  I'm not saying he's a dirty player, nobody's saying that (but) he clearly deviated from his path to hit our catcher. He took our catcher out.  But the Cubs first baseman, who was tagged out on the play, said it was just good, hard baseball.  By no means do I think that's a dirty play at all,  Rizzo said.  I went pretty much straight in. He caught the ball and went towards the plate so I went in -- I slid in there -- it was a hard slide. ... I play this game hard for a 162 games-plus so I can't see that being dirty.  Hedges apparently suffered a bruised thigh in the collision and did not return for the seventh inning.  I don't expect him to play tomorrow,  said Green.  I don't know how long he's out for.  Related CoveragePreview: Padres at CubsSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchJavier Baez went 2-for-3 and scored a go-ahead run on a throwing error as the Cubs (35-34) beat the Padres for the first time this season after three losses last month in San Diego. Reliever Hector Rondon (2-1) worked one inning -- a scoreless seventh -- for the victory. Right-handed reliever Kirby Yates (1-1) took the loss after allowing one run on two hits in the seventh. Cubs reliever Wade Davis faced five batters in the ninth and had runners on second and third with one out after two wild pitches. But he struck out Wil Myers swinging and got Hunter Renfroe to ground out to earn his 14th save. Neither San Diego left-hander Clayton Richard nor Chicago left-hander Jon Lester figured in decisions. The Padres (28-43) dropped their second straight and third in four games despite homers from leadoff batter Jose Pirela and second baseman Yangervis Solarte. Rizzo, playing this sixth game in the leadoff spot, extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games. He has reached base in all six games leading off, just the fifth Cubs player to do so since 1946. Lester worked six innings and allowed two runs on five hits. He walked one and struck out seven. The Cubs tied the game 2-2 in the seventh on Willson Contreras' sixth homer of the season, coming with none out on Richard's 1-2 pitch. Richard departed with one out, and Baez greeted Yates with a single to shallow right. Albert Almora Jr. then doubled to left, and Baez scored on Pirela's throwing error for a 3-2 Cubs lead. Richard allowed two runs on five hits over 6 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out three. The Padres claimed an instant 1-0 lead on leadoff batter Pirela's first-inning home run. Pirela sent Lester's 1-1 pitch to center field for his third homer of the season. In the bottom of the first, Rizzo spoiled the Padres' infield shift toward first base by placing a perfect bunt down the third-base line that wasn't picked up until he had reached first.  It's not your prototypical lead off the game,  said Rizzo. Solarte made it 2-0 in the third with a first-pitch homer to left field. It was his 10th of the season and third since Saturday, when he clubbed two against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Cubs got one run back in the third when Rizzo sent a one-out sacrifice fly deep to left field to drive in Almora from third. Chicago had runners at first and second with none out in the fifth, but Lester struck out while bunting foul and Jon Jay grounded into an inning-ending double play. The Cubs were without right fielder Jason Heyward, who sat out Monday after suffering a laceration to his left hand in the second inning of Sunday's game at Pittsburgh while attempting to make a sliding catch. NOTES: San Diego designated RHP Zach Lee for assignment on Monday and claimed LHP Dillon Overton off waivers from Seattle and optioned him to Triple-A El Paso. ... San Diego needs just one win this week to take the season series from Chicago after the Padres recorded a three-game sweep and held the Cubs to 12 collective hits last month at Petco Park. ... The Padres will send RHP Jhoulys Chacin (6-5, 5.10 ERA) against Cubs LHP Mike Montgomery (0-3, 2.65 ERA) in Tuesday's middle game. ... The three-game Cubs-Padres series is also Chicago's shortest homestead of the season. After Wednesday's finale, the Cubs embark on an 11-day, 11-game road trip that takes them to Miami, Washington and Cincinnati. ...

Chinese with at least 10 million yuan ($1.47 million) of investable assets hit 1.6 million in 2016, up from 180,000 in 2006, according to the 2017 China Private Wealth Report by Bain Consulting and China Merchants Bank. The overall value of the private wealth market increased to 165 trillion yuan in 2016, growing at 21 percent annually in 2014-2016. But the growth rate of China's private wealth market is expected to decline to 14 percent in 2017 to a total size of 188 trillion yuan. Around 120,000 HNWIs had at least 100 million yuan worth of investable assets, up from less than 10,000 people in 2006.  The percentage of HNWIs with overseas investment increased to 56 percent in 2017, up from 19 percent in 2011, but the overall percentage of assets invested overseas has stabilized since 2013.  The top five destinations for overseas investment were Hong Kong, the United States, Australia and Canada although Hong Kong's popularity fell 18 percent and the United States dropped 3 percent from 2015 to 2017.  Respondents said their top three reasons for investing overseas were to diversify investment risks, to capture market opportunities of overseas investments and to migrate. Sixty-three percent of rich Chinese rely on financial service providers to manage their domestic financial assets and among them, around half use private banking services provided by commercial banks.

The CSI300 index was unchanged at 3,552.56 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent, to 3,146.25 points.

Many investors predict that the so-called A shares which make up the majority of China's stock market will be included by MSCI, which has rejected this on three previous occasions. But Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities, said he believes inclusion of A-shares is  not that likely . But if MSCI again rejects inclusion, the impact on Chinese markets  could be rather limited , he said. Generous money injections by the central bank are helping to maintain some calm in China's financial markets, but market interest rates are persistently high, reflecting worries that liquidity conditions remain unusually tight. Yan said the central bank intends to maintain stability in the market at particular times, such as providing funds ahead of the mid-year macro-prudential assessment (MPA).

The New York-based rights group described 36 incidents in which unknown men in civilian clothes beat rights campaigners and bloggers between January 2015 and April 2017, often resulting in serious injuries. Despite sweeping reforms in Vietnam's economy and increasing openness towards social change, the Communist Party retains tight media censorship and zero tolerance for criticism. With information tightly controlled by the government, some critics take to web blogs to air their grievances. Social media sites, including Facebook, are also hugely popular. The rights group said many victims reported beatings occurred in the presence of uniformed police who did not intervene. It is common for Vietnamese police to push activists into vans or buses to prevent them protesting on the streets.  The Vietnamese government should understand that tolerance of these violent attacks will lead to lawlessness and chaos instead of the social order and stability it says it is striving for,  said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. The group said in January at least 112 bloggers and activists were serving prison sentences in Vietnam, down from at least 130 at the end of 2015. The rights group said the decrease coincided with a rise in recorded beatings during the period in which Vietnam was negotiating a trade agreement with the United States.  Vietnam's human rights record was a major focus of the negotiations,  it said in a statement.   It is possible that the government of Vietnam wanted to show a decrease in political arrests and trials but still pursued measures to crack down on dissent.  'False Information' The rights group said 35 out of 36 cases featured in their report found no identified and prosecuted perpetrator despite the fact that victims often reported their beating to the police. Vietnam rejected the report saying the government acted in accordance with international human rights treaties.  The report is based on false information and lack of objectivity about the situation in Vietnam,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement sent to Reuters. The report follows a meeting this month between U.S. President Donald Trump and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the first White House talks with a Southeast Asian leader since Trump took office in January. Though a joint written statement included a brief section on the  importance of protecting and promoting human rights , Phuc's visit was dominated by the burgeoning economic relationship between the two former wartime foes, with the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars. Trump and his aides have mostly publicly sidestepped human rights issues in their dealings with autocratic governments, including Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally Trump visited last month where political parties and protests are banned. The Trump administration has made clear that its  America First  approach prioritizes economic and security interests.

Fears over the effects of a sharp correction in the housing market mean interest rates in Australia are likely to stay at an all-time low of 1.50 percent for a considerable time - even as some global central banks turn hawkish. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last cut interest rates in August 2016. It has since stood pat, juggling the risks of record household debt, tepid inflation and weak consumer spending. RBA board members spent considerable time at their June policy meeting discussing the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy. They even reviewed the academic literature and policy experience in a number of countries, including Sweden and the United States.   This highlights the focus of monetary policy at present, with considerations around financial stability trumping almost everything else including sub-target inflation,  said Su-Lin Ong, head of economics at RBC.   This will keep housing, lending, and credit growth dynamics firmly in the spotlight and at top of the RBA's list as it ponders the appropriate stance of policy.  Australia's household sector is under severe strain with debt-to-income at a record high 189 percent while wages are crawling at the slowest pace ever. The share of national income going to households has shrunk to its smallest since 1964 while the savings rate has fallen to a 10-year low.  That is one reason the RBA is unlikely to hike official rates in coming months because to do so would push up mortgage costs for already indebted Australian families. Yet it fears easing further might only encourage more borrowing by investors to speculate in the housing market. Australia's super-easy policy stance contrasts with global central banks in the mood to nudge interest rates higher. Three of eight policymakers at the Bank of England voted last week to raise rates, while the Bank of Canada surprised by suddenly holding out the prospect of hiking rates to damp down Canada's red-hot housing market. The U.S. Federal Reserve has already moved rates higher twice this year as economic growth picked up and the labor market tightened.   The bank has responsibility for promoting financial stability within its flexible medium-term inflation targeting framework,  the RBA said on Tuesday.  The board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.  Moody's Downgrade Late on Monday, Moody's Investors Service cited  elevated risks  within the household sector when lowering its ratings on 12 Australian banks.  The reduction in the savings rate, the rise in household leverage and the rising prevalence of interest-only and investment loans are all indicators of rising risks,  Moody's noted. Australia's 'Big Four' banks are heavily reliant on mortgages for earnings growth. A sharp correction in property prices would certainly hit them, although the Moody's downgrade alone is not expected to lift their funding costs. Official government data on Tuesday pegged the value Australia's housing stock at A$6.6 trillion, nearly four times annual gross domestic product of A$1.7 trillion.  House prices in Sydney and Melbourne - the two hottest markets - have broadly doubled since 2009. There are tentative signs of a cooling off since April following tighter regulation of lending to property investors.  The RBA noted it would take time for the full effects of regulatory measures to show. Australian banks have also increased mortgage rates, out of cycle. The interest-only home loan rate for ANZ Banking Group (ANZ.AX), for example, is as high as 6.26 percent.

The Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander turned in a second consecutive seven-inning, one-run performance as the Pirates handed the NL Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers an 8-1 thumping Monday night at Miller Park.  He's a big leaguer,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  He's pitched really well throughout his career. The last two outings have been the Cole that we've seen. Really performed well. Really strong.  Cole (5-6) had been struggling of late, posting an ERA over 10 in a four-start stretch, but he turned things around last week when he held the Colorado Rockies to a run over seven innings. He picked up right where he left off, holding Milwaukee to three hits and two walks while striking out five in his sixth seven-inning effort of the season. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at BrewersPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch We made a lot of good pitches and kept them off balance just enough,  Cole said of himself and catcher Francisco Cervelli.  It was a good opportunity for us to get the road trip started on a high note. We played a nice game tonight.  The only blemish on Cole's line came in the second, when Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw led off the inning with his 13th home run of the season, giving Milwaukee a 1-0 lead. But the Brewers, who have scored their last 16 runs via home runs, couldn't get much going against Cole, who stranded his final four base runners.  We certainly didn't do anything offensively tonight,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.  Gerrit Cole was really good tonight. He pitched a nice game. That's really good stuff tonight, for sure. He threw a bunch of strikes, and not much really good for us to hit. He threw some really good changeups, even to our right-handed hitters, and we couldn't get much going.  Pittsburgh's offense took the lead back in the third on a two-run single by Adam Frazier. The Pirates had a chance to do some real damage in the inning, loading the bases against Brewers starter Matt Garza, but couldn't cash in.  We shifted right, they hit it left,  Garza said.  We shifted left, they hit it right. It was just ground ball after ground ball.  Garza (3-3) blanked Pittsburgh in the fourth and fifth innings but was chased in the sixth after Andrew McCutchen's 13th home run of the season made it a 4-1 game.  I should have probably thrown to a different spot,  said Garza, who allowed four runs on six hits and a pair of walks with three strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings in his second start since coming off the disabled list for whiplash-like symptoms.  He's the type of guy who, if you fall into a pattern, he'll clip you. I fell into a pattern, threw too many fastballs and he hit it out.  Wily Peralta got Garza out of the inning without further damage but allowed a leadoff single to Cole and a walk to Frazier to open the seventh. Josh Harrison doubled to drive in Cole and make it a 5-1 game, and the Pirates added two more when Gregory Polanco singled to left. Josh Bell struck out for the first out of the inning but McCutchen drove in another with a single before Paulo Espino took over and ended the inning with a double play.  We are capable of playing a good team game,  Hurdle said.  We've shown the ability to be resilient. Cole started everything off the mound. He was in attack mode from pitch one. He was really good at the bottom of the zone again. He pitched in very well with the fastball. The change-up showed up really well from the first time he used it. All four pitches. Good mix. The offense stayed on Garza. A couple of big swings. McCutchen. What a beautiful swing he put on that ball.  NOTES: The Pirates have won seven of their last eight games in Milwaukee but are still just 37-82 at Miller Park dating back to the 2003 season.... Milwaukee released RHP Neftali Feliz, who was designated for assignment last Wednesday after going 1-5 with a 6.00 ERA in 29 appearances. ... Milwaukee's last 16 runs have all come via home runs, setting a franchise record. ... Pirates OF Andrew McCutchen had two hits Monday, extending his hitting streak at Miller Park to nine games. He has hit 29 home runs against the Brewers since arriving in the majors in 2009. ... The Brewers have lost two of their last three games but remain 1 1/2 games ahead of the Cubs in the NL Central.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED6KTUK5YH"},

The Syrian woman is severely traumatized and has no money to pay rent on the rat-infested house that she shares with her husband and three children in Amman, the Jordanian capital.   There's no shortage of cases that are serious,  Fleming, who works for the global law firm Reed Smith, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the windowless, lavender-walled room provided by charity Jesuit Refugee Services that serves as her base in Amman. She leads the Reed Smith Refugee Protection Project, a mobile legal clinic offering free legal, psychological and social support to some of Jordan's most vulnerable refugees – mostly from Syria, Iraq and Sudan.   One in 11 people in Jordan is a refugee, according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). Some 650,000 are Syrians, by far the largest group of refugees in the country of about 10 million people. The project's goal is to resettle clients to third countries where they can start their lives anew, said Fleming, who has been to Jordan 10 times in the past two years. The team on this trip includes another senior Reed Smith lawyer from the United States, a young Egyptian judge and two Jordanian women who are employed by the project year-round.   We find our team members from all over the world, and when I see someone who's good, we grab them,  said Fleming.  The team's days are packed as it attends to clients who  include victims of torture incapacitated by trauma, children with life-threatening or degenerative illnesses and survivors of rape or other forms of gender violence. They want to move to countries that can provide support unavailable in Jordan, for example specialist medical care. Many may not survive or be permanently disabled if they are not resettled, said Fleming.  Like Winning the Lottery  Their chances of being resettled through UNHCR's resettlement program, which relies on nations volunteering to accept a certain number of refugees from the overburdened countries in which they already have asylum, are slim.   Getting refugee resettlement is like winning the lottery. It just almost never happens,  says Fleming. Less than one percent of refugees globally are resettled, according to UNHCR. In 2016, the refugee agency referred some 189,000 refugees for resettlement, mostly to the United States. While the situation in Jordan is better than the global average, with 19,300 refugees leaving through the resettlement program in 2016, the numbers are still discouraging.   The resettlement screening process is arduous and can take three to four years – by which time many of Fleming's clients would be beyond help, she said.  To speed up the process, Fleming and her colleagues look for individually tailored legal solutions for each of their clients.  For a medical evacuation case, for example, they will identify a team of experts to testify to the urgency, a hospital willing to provide care, a country willing to host the individual or family, and sponsors willing to support them.  It becomes an effort of community engagement to support refugees,  says Fleming.  So far they have succeeded in resettling 19 people from Jordan to Australia, France, Spain, and the United States.  Fifty more clients in Jordan are awaiting a solution. Emotional Support The legal solutions, while faster than UNHCR resettlement, can still take months - or even years.  During this time clients receive non-legal support from the  U.S.- based Patricia Fleming Foundation, which Fleming established in her mother's name. This includes payments for rent, food, and urgent medical needs.  If we take somebody into the project, we keep them in the project until they are safe, which could mean paying rent and financial assistance for years,  Fleming explains.  And while a deep understanding of international law has been key to the project's success, it is only half of the work.  With her clients Fleming often seems more like a therapist than a lawyer. She embraces everyone and often holds hands while talking, speaking quietly, with a soft smile on her face.    I'm not a mental health expert, but I have worked with refugees for 16 years and I have interviewed thousands of them,  said Fleming.   You can't dive into (questions like) 'Do you meet the refugee definition and were you persecuted' because this could be very harmful.  Instead Fleming begins by asking people how they are sleeping, eating, and feeling.   If they tell me they're only sleeping four hours a night, haven't eaten for days, and all they think about is what happened to them in Syria, I know it's time for me to do emotional rescue before we can do the legal work.  This might mean making sure they are receiving medical care and counseling from a local charity, and have enough money to feed themselves and their families and pay the rent.   Asked where she learned her empathetic skills, Fleming refers to her mother, who grew up in extreme poverty and became a young widow with five children.   In some sense that taught me how to be a compassionate person,  says Fleming.  I bring a lot of her into my work.  Impossible to Stop Fleming did not set out to be the kind of lawyer she has become. She studied law at the University of California Berkeley as a single mother with two young children and just wanted a decent job, so she joined Reed Smith after graduation.  Her first free (pro bono) legal advice case was helping a woman from Guatemala who had been abused by the military during the civil war. Soon her case load was half commercial, half pro bono.  By her fifth year Reed Smith had given Fleming permission to work on human rights and pro bono cases full time. In 2016 the project expanded to Greece, helping to obtain refugee status for vulnerable people at risk of deportation to Turkey. They have achieved this for 16 people so far.  They are not huge numbers in relation to the millions of refugees in the Middle East, but each represents a life that has probably been saved, said Fleming.  This is a monumental humanitarian crisis,  said Fleming. “I've dedicated my life to this work and it would be impossible for me to stop...just from a personal moral perspective, it will be impossible to stop.

The Washington Nationals reliever had just thrown an 0-2 fastball that was clocked at 97 mph on its way to the plate before making contact with the bat of Marcell Ozuna, the Miami Marlins left fielder who is having an All-Star-caliber season. Ozuna rocketed that pitch into the gap in left-center field for a bases-loaded, two-out, walk-off single in the ninth as Miami rallied from an early six-run deficit and defeated Washington 8-7 on Monday night at Marlins Park.  That's sweet,  said Ozuna, who leads Miami with a .327 batting average.  I said, 'OK, stay short and put the ball in play,' and that's what I did.  He did quite a bit more than that, and the Marlins (31-37) twice tied Washington with homers -- a grand slam by Justin Bour in the third and a solo shot by Giancarlo Stanton in the seventh. It was the 18th homer of the season for both Stanton and Bour, tying them with Ozuna for the team lead. Washington (42-28) was led by Bryce Harper, who also hit his 18th homer, and Anthony Rendon, who hammered his 13th before leaving due to a neck stinger. He is listed as day-to-day. Miami's winning rally started with a two-out, four-pitch walk drawn by Dee Gordon, who stole second base for his 27th swipe of the season. Gordon advanced to third on a Stanton infield single that bounced off the knee of Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy, who could have ended the inning had he fielded the hard shot cleanly. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at MarlinsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchThat became a huge play when Ozuna hit his shot that was ruled a single because that was all that was required to earn the win. It was sweet redemption for the Marlins, who lost on walk-off hits by the Atlanta Braves' Brandon Phillips on Saturday and again on Sunday. Miami's bullpen was strong on Monday, however, as five Marlins relievers combined to allow just one run in six innings. A.J. Ramos (2-3) pitched a scoreless ninth to earn the win. Romero (2-3) took the loss in another rough night for a Nationals bullpen that is the worst in the league in numerous categories.  These guys have been giving up runs,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Washington's bullpen.  When you get into their bullpen, you never know what's going to happen ... but you know you have a chance to score some runs.  As for the starting pitchers, neither lasted long in the first meeting of the two clubs since the season's opening series in Washington in April. In his first start since returning from the disabled list due to a finger injury, Miami left-hander Justin Nicolino worked just three innings. He gave up Harper's two-run homer in the first inning and Rendon's solo shot in the second. Washington built the lead to 6-0 in the third on a run-scoring double by Murphy and a two-run single by Michael A. Taylor. However, the Marlins immediately battled back against Nationals starter Tanner Roark, who beat Miami on April 5. This time, Miami scored six times in their half of the third. J.T. Riddle tripled in Derek Dietrich and later scored on Gordon's RBI groundout to trim the deficit to 6-2. Bour then tied it 6-6 by clubbing his third career grand slam, launching a 2-2 changeup from Roark into the right-field bullpen.  You get a six-run lead and give it up -- that's pathetic on my part,  Roark said.  I felt good, I just pitched bad.  This one hurt, but it's a long season.  Despite Roark's poor performance, Washington's offense kept up the pressure in fifth. Stephen Drew, who replaced Rendon midway through the game, doubled to score Ryan Zimmerman, giving the Nationals a 7-6 lead.  Drew came in and did a great job,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said after Rendon was hurt diving for a ground ball. Stanton tied the score 7-7 in the seventh by hitting an opposite-field homer off of former Marlins pitcher Jacob Turner, setting the stage for the dramatic conclusion.  This was a great game to be a part of,  Bour said.  We were down six runs but never really out of it. This is a great time to be a Marlin. We're having fun.  NOTES: Miami optioned RHP Drew Steckenrider (0-1, 5.40 ERA in four games) to Triple-A New Orleans. ... Marlins 3B Martin Prado (hamstring) and SS Adeiny Hechavarria (oblique) are expected to return to the majors after a few more minor-league rehab games. ...

The decision to defer payment of the coupon on its $400 million perpetual securities, due June 26, worried investors, who said the failure to pay $12 million sent a negative signal and suggested lenders may have asked the group to defer payment where possible. Shares slipped after a sharp rise on Monday.  While non payment of the perpetual bond coupon will not trigger a default event, it is a further hit to the company's reputation. This is hurting investor confidence,  said one Hong Kong-based analyst, who declined to be named. Noble - which has sold billions of dollars in assets over the past two years - from its U.S. energy unit to its agribusiness, also said it could sell more and cut costs further to boost liquidity.  The remaining assets and investments on its books are smaller - from vessels used by its logistics business to stakes in Australian and Indonesian coal miners.  At its height, Hong Kong-based Noble was Asia's largest commodity trader, a powerhouse in coal and oil to rival larger European players like Glencore (GLEN.L). Questions over its accounting and the sharp downturn in commodity markets since 2012, however, have left the company struggling to meet its debt obligations, forcing it to dramatically reduce the scale of its operations. It has been buffeted by a collapsing share price, credit downgrades, management upheavals and a series of writedowns and asset sales. Its shares were trading on Monday at S$0.465 - down from a 2011 peak of around S$17. In a statement on Tuesday, Noble said its revolving credit facility would be extended by 120 days from June 20, confirming reports last week. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that Noble had extended the $2 billion credit line, but was told to find a strategic investor. Noble said it was also continuing talks with its bankers in relation to a revolving credit facility due May 2018. Its bankers, based in Europe, the United States and Asia, have hired legal and financial advisers, Noble said.          Noble has a bond worth about $379 million due in March and a  $1.1 billion loan due in May 2018. Traders, analysts and industry sources have warned that the credit extension was likely to be only a temporary fix, and some said on Tuesday that they did not expect an imminent investment or major sale.  I don't factor in any strategic sale yet,  said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research in Asia at Morningstar.  But obviously, if they do find a strategic partner that would be very positive because it actually strengthens their ability to get funding, which is what a trading house needs.   Noble's $400 million perpetual bonds XS107907602=TE slid four points on Tuesday. Noble can defer payments without triggering a default under the bonds' terms.  Coupon payments on its other bonds are due in July and September.

In remarks for a speech to U.S. manufacturers released by his office, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Congress and the Trump administration are moving  full speed ahead  to deliver fundamental tax reform for individuals, corporations and small businesses. Ryan and other Republicans are under mounting pressure from U.S. businesses and voters to make progress on tax reform, a top 2016 Republican campaign pledge that could determine whether Ryan's party retains control of the House and the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections. But it is not clear whether Republicans in Congress can overcome infighting over healthcare legislation and government spending to move forward on tax reform legislation.  We are going to get this done in 2017. We need to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this once-in-a-generation moment slip,  Ryan said in remarks prepared for a Tuesday afternoon speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful Washington lobby group.  Transformational tax reform can be done, and we are moving forward. Full speed ahead,  he added. Major stock indexes hit multiple record highs from Trump's November election to the end of the first quarter, on bets that he would improve economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending. The tax reform debate has largely moved behind closed doors, where Ryan is trying to hammer out an agreement with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and the Republican chairmen of two congressional tax committees. The aim is to unveil tax reform legislation in September. Ryan will not delve into details about tax reform provisions on Tuesday but will describe major provisions of any major legislation including a  territorial  system that would no longer tax the foreign profits over U.S. corporations. Ryan will also emphasize the importance of permanent reforms, reject the notion that legislation should do little more than reduce tax rates and make a case for mechanisms to prevent U.S. corporations from moving income, assets and jobs overseas.
