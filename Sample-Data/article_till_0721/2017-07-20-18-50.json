[{"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fines-exxon-2-million-over-russia-sanctions-breaches-1500570876", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Treasury Department imposed a $2 million fine on             Exxon Mobil                   Corp. for what it called a \u201creckless disregard\u201d of U.S. sanctions on Russia while Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       was the oil giant\u2019s chief executive. The company immediately said it would challenge the finding.Exxon, under Mr. Tillerson\u2019s helm, in early 2014 deepened the company\u2019s longstanding partnership with the Kremlin despite Washington levying fresh sanctions against Russia for seizing territory in eastern Ukraine. In May 2014, Treasury said the company signed eight documents relating to oil-and-gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        chief executive of the state oil giant PAO Rosneft. Treasury on Thursday said those deals were violations of U.S. sanctions against Mr. Sechin, a former Russian intelligence officer and top ally to President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Tillerson, who has close ties to Russia and received an \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d award from Moscow, left Exxon last year to become U.S. secretary of state. The $2 million fine, Treasury said, was the maximum amount it could levy against the company.A spokesman for Exxon called the fine \u201coutrageous\u201d and said Treasury\u2019s findings are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration at the time the sanctions were enacted.Exxon doesn\u2019t have any direct deals with Mr. Sechin, but does have business dealings with Rosneft, where Mr. Sechin in his capacity as CEO signed company documents, Exxon said. Under President       Barack Obama,        the White House and Treasury in 2014 said U.S. companies were allowed to participate in business dealings with Mr. Sechin if they were professional, not personal, Exxon said.The Office of Foreign Assets Control \u201cseeks to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order that is inconsistent with the explicit and unambiguous guidance from the White House and Treasury issued before the relevant conduct and still publicly available today,\u201d Exxon said in a filing in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas.When Mr. Tillerson took his position in President Trump\u2019s cabinet he promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year. He hasn\u2019t spoken out expressly against the sanctions since taking office.The company showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements\u201d when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under U.S. sanctions, the U.S. Treasury said in an enforcement notice.The State Department referred questions to Exxon.Rosneft spokesman Michael Leontiev told The Wall Street Journal in an email, \u201cI am sure that while Exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both OFAC and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully.\u201d Mr. Leontiev said that signing an agreement with Mr. Sechin not as an individual, but as a representative of Rosneft management, can\u2019t be the foundation for a sanctions violation.The penalty, issued by Treasury\u2019s sanctions unit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, comes as committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as a Justice Department special prosecutor, investigate what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to interfere in the presidential election, and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. President Donald Trump has denied any collusion. Russia has denied meddling.\u201cExxonMobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\u201d of a sanctioned entity, Treasury said.Exxon and other big energy companies recently joined President Trump in voicing concerns about Congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners. Exxon unsuccessfully sought a sanctions waiver from the administration on at least one Russian deal.Lobbyists for Exxon told lawmakers that several provisions in the sanctions legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill are worrisome, including measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals. Companies have also voiced concern that the bill could force them to disclose information they consider proprietary.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 15:47:00", "news_title": "U.S. Fines Exxon $2 Million Over Russia Sanctions Breaches ", "keywords": "exxon,obama,oil ,putin,rosneft,russia,sanctions,tillerson,Exxon Mobil,XOM,U.S. Treasury,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeff-sessions-says-he-to-plans-on-continuing-as-attorney-general-1500562008", "content": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he has no plans to leave the Justice Department and will \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d pursue the Trump administration\u2019s priorities, a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s comment in a recent interview that he regretted appointing Mr. Sessions.\u201cThe work we are doing today is the kind of work that we intend to continue,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at a previously scheduled press conference at the Justice Department. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d he said.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The comments came after Mr. Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t have appointed Mr. Sessions to his job if he had known he would remove himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In the extensive interview, Mr. Trump also criticized the deputy attorney general who took Mr. Sessions\u2019 place overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein      ; the special counsel appointed to run the probe,       Robert Mueller      ; and former Federal Bureau of Investigation director       James Comey,        whom Mr. Trump has said he fired in part over the Russia investigation.Mr. Sessions, an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, deflected the criticism. He said he was honored to serve as attorney general and the position was \u201cbeyond any thought I would have ever had for myself.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201dMr. Sessions was at the White House as recently as Wednesday, for a National Security Council meeting, according to White House spokesman       Sean Spicer.On Thursday, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Sanders       told reporters that Mr. Trump was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself earlier this year but that he didn\u2019t regret keeping him in the role. The two haven\u2019t spoken in the last 24 hours, she said.\u201cClearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.At the news conference, scheduled to announce a major takedown of the largest online marketplace for illicit goods, AlphaBay, Mr. Sessions was asked only about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, fielding no questions about the case. Aides ended the gathering after they solicited, but didn\u2019t receive, any questions on the AlphaBay operation.Mr. Sessions pointed to the AlphaBay case and a health-care fraud takedown announced last week, as well as a gathering with state and local law-enforcement officials on Wednesday, as evidence the agency was continuing to enforce administration priorities in combating transnational crime and spikes in drug use and violent crime.\u201cI\u2019m totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.In the interview with the Times, Mr. Trump said, \u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\u201dSome prominent Republicans had called on Mr. Sessions to recuse himself, including Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), as well as many Democrats. Legal ethics experts said that because Mr. Sessions had played a key role in the Trump campaign, it could raise questions if he oversaw an investigation that examined, among other things, whether that campaign coordinated with Russia.On Thursday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who had been a vocal proponent of appointing a special counsel, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time right before our eyes,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.In the Times interview, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest; said Mr. Comey had provided congressional testimony \u201cloaded up with lies\u201d; and questioned Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s neutrality since he was from Baltimore, a city Mr. Trump said had \u201cvery few Republicans.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment, and Mr. Comey declined to comment through an associate. At the news conference, Mr. Rosenstein said he was working to \u201cadvance\u201d the administration\u2019s priorities.\u201cI was proud to be here yesterday, I\u2019m proud to be here today, I\u2019ll be proud to be here tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.Mr. Trump aimed much of his frustration in the interview at Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator who endorsed Mr. Trump early in the campaign, when few Republicans were getting behind their eventual nominee. Mr. Trump described the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as \u201cextremely unfair\u2026to the president.\u201dHe also blamed Mr. Sessions for \u201cbad answers\u201d to Congress that set him down a path that led to his recusal. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he hadn\u2019t had \u201ccommunications with the Russians\u201d even though he had met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.,       Sergey Kislyak.\u201cJeff Sessions gave some bad answers\u2026He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The recusal came one day after reports of those discrepancies emerged. Mr. Sessions said at the time that he was recusing himself from all investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign on the recommendation of senior Justice Department officials.\u2014Byron Tau, Michael C.

John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

Purchases, even for bulky or expensive items, are shifting to             Amazon.com Inc.,        AMZN 0.18%       which has become the start of most shopping trips.That is one reason behind             Sears Holdings Corp.\u2019s        SHLD 10.60%       decision, announced Thursday, to start selling its Kenmore appliances on the Seattle giant\u2019s website, the first time it will offer its in-house brand at a major rival.The struggling department store chain is the latest to capitulate to Amazon, whose rapid growth has displaced traditional stores and left even powerful brands unable to ignore it.             Nike Inc.,       one of the biggest holdouts, recently decided to start selling directly to Amazon.For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could give it a boost in sales, which have declined every year since 2007. \u201cThis will give the Kenmore brand access to a new set of customers who aren\u2019t necessarily shopping at Sears,\u201d said Dev Mukherjee, a former president of Sears home appliances, who now works at a private-equity firm.But also it carries some risks. It gives shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears department store. \u201cWe believe most Amazon sales will simply cannibalize Sears stores,\u201d said Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba, since other major retailers don\u2019t currently sell Kenmore.Still, news of Amazon\u2019s move into appliances, one of the categories it hasn\u2019t deeply penetrated, rippled through markets. Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have been benefiting from Sears\u2019s retreat.             Home Depot Inc.       and             Best Buy Co.       fell 4% apiece on Thursday.Sears\u2019s long-battered shares jumped 11% to $9.62, while Amazon was trading near all-time highs at $1,029.27.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our competitive positioning from both a brand and service perspective,\u201d said a Home Depot spokesman. Best Buy declined to comment.Kenmore is Amazon\u2019s first retail offering in major appliances. Previously, most major appliances available on Amazon were via third-party sellers on its marketplace.Amazon, which started selling books online more than two decades ago, is now gaining ground in a number of categories, from office supplies to home goods. After a serious push into apparel a decade ago, it is now one of the biggest clothing retailers, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, second only to             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Amazon\u2019s market value is closing in on $500 billion\u2014more than double Wal-Mart\u2019s\u2014while Sears hovers near $1 billion.More than half of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, versus 28% on search engines and even fewer at other retail sites. And an estimated 63 million loyal North American members of the company\u2019s Prime subscription program, according to UBS, offers brands big online customer reach.Amazon has bigger ambitions than selling Kenmore products. The company plans to expand its reach in both furniture and appliances, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also building at least four massive warehouses focused on handling bulky items, the people said.Under the Kenmore deal, Amazon will own the inventory but Sears will ship orders from its warehouses, a Sears spokesman said. Innovel Solutions, a unit of Sears, will deliver the goods to customers\u2019 homes and provide installation services, he said. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal.The Kenmore name first appeared in 1913 on a sewing machine. The first Kenmore washing machine was introduced in 1927 and business boomed after World War II. The brand is currently produced by Whirlpool Corp.,             Electrolux                   AB and other manufacturers.Sears\u2019s major-appliance sales fell 9.5% in 2016 to $3.76 billion compared with the prior year, according to TWICE, a trade publication. In addition to Kenmore, Sears sells other brands. The retailer ranks third, behind Lowe\u2019s Cos. and Home Depot, according to the publication.Sears CEO       Eddie Lampert,        a hedge-fund manager who took control of Kmart out of bankruptcy and merged it with Sears in 2005, had been looking at strategic options for the company\u2019s top brands for more than a year, as the parent company\u2019s losses have mounted.Earlier this year, he agreed to sell the Craftsman tool brand to             Stanley Black & Decker Inc.       for $900 million, helping to pay down debt and pension costs. Sears is still exploring options for its DieHard brand, Sears Auto Centers and its Home Services unit.\u201cThe launch of Kenmore on Amazon.com will NOT significantly boost Sears\u2019s liquidity,\u201d wrote Bill Dreher, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group in a note to clients. \u201cWe suspect this is a move to beautify the Kenmore brand for divestiture and help alleviate some pressure, temporarily, of Sears as a going concern.\u201dMr. Lampert, who owns more than half of Sears\u2019s shares and is a large creditor, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the Amazon deal \u201cis a testament to our commitment to unlocking value from our various assets.\u201dThe CEO has also been cutting spending and selling real estate to help the company fund its operations. He has also been financing the company, including a $200 million short-term credit facility that Sears announced on Monday.Although that facility was marketed to others, only entities affiliated with Mr. Lampert participated in the financing, according to one investor. The Sears spokesman said the company is in ongoing discussions with various parties with respect to the loan facility.\u2014Andrew Scurria and Imani Morse contributed to this article.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 17:19:00", "news_title": "Sears to Sell Kenmore Brand on Amazon", "keywords": "amazon appliances,sears amazon sales,sears kenmore amazon,Amazon.com,AMZN,Sears Holdings,SHLD,Lowe's Cos.,LOW,Whirlpool,WHR,General Electric,GE,Matt McGinley,Howard Riefs,Dev Mukherjee,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,machinery,computers,consumer electronics,household appliances,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,etailing,consumer goods,durable household products,e-commerce,home electronics,appliances,industrial goods,online service providers,technology"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbo-says-revised-senate-plan-would-increase-uninsured-by-22-million-1500572177", "content": "The number of people without health insurance would rise by 22 million in a decade if a revised Senate Republican bill replaced large parts of the Affordable Care Act, while federal deficits would be cut by $420 billion, according to a report Thursday from the Congressional Budget Office.The impact of the new report is uncertain, however, as the CBO didn\u2019t include a full analysis of an amendment from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) that would allow for cheaper but more bare-bones insurance plans because that analysis requires more time.The new CBO analysis shows the bill wouldn\u2019t change the number of people without coverage compared with projections released in June on an earlier version of the GOP legislation.That earlier number spurred a revolt from some centrist GOP senators who said they couldn\u2019t support the bill because it caused too many people to lose coverage. In the new report, the deficit-reduction figure is about $100 billion more than the earlier reading.In Thursday\u2019s report, the CBO said the projected decline of 22 million people covered under the Senate bill includes a drop of 15 million people on Medicaid. In addition, the decline includes five million people who wouldn\u2019t have individual coverage, and two million who wouldn\u2019t have employment-based coverage, partly due to the removal of ACA requirements that individuals get coverage or pay a fine, and that most employers offer health plans.The incomplete analysis is likely to complicate a major push by President       Donald Trump       and Senate GOP leadership to revive the bill: Some lawmakers wavering in their support have said they want to see a full CBO analysis before making a final decision.Without a full analysis, lawmakers won\u2019t have comprehensive estimates on how the legislation would impact the federal deficit, premiums, or the number of people without coverage.The Senate plans a vote next week on a motion to proceed, which allows lawmakers to debate the legislation. That could take the form of a repeal plan with a delay to set up a new health system or another attempt to pass a broader overhaul soon.The analysis comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is working to get the 50 votes needed to keep the health-care push alive. Several conservatives want to overturn more of the ACA while centrists are seeking to preserve certain parts of the law, including a higher level of Medicaid spending.The revised Senate bill retained steep cuts to Medicaid and phased out enhanced federal funding for the expansion in 31 states. But it does include other changes meant to ease the impact, including an additional $45 billion to combat the opioid epidemic and $70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance markets.To help fund the programs, the revamped bill also keeps a 3.8% tax on net investment income and a 0.9% Medicaid surtax\u2014changes some conservative Republicans strongly oppose.Mr. McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans, assuming no Democrats support the bill, in order for it to pass. Vice President       Mike Pence       would break any tie.That goal has also become harder because Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) has been recovering from surgery and said late Wednesday he has been diagnosed with a brain tumor. The timing of his return to the Senate depends on consultations with his medical team.The bill\u2019s $420 billion reduction to the federal deficit through 2026 compares with a $321 billion savings under the earlier Senate bill. The revised bill would lower the deficit by cutting Medicaid spending and subsidies to consumers who get coverage on the individual markets.In 2018, average premiums for a midprice plan would be about 20% higher than under the ACA, in large part because the bill ends the penalty for not having coverage. That would cause fewer healthy people to sign up, the CBO reported, leaving insurers with consumers who have costlier medical conditions that drive up costs.The average premiums would then drop about 30% in 2020 compared with the ACA, although plans would pay for a smaller share of health benefits and effects of premiums would vary across the country with higher costs for older people.A person buying a midtier plan under the legislation in 2026 would see a deductible of roughly $13,000 for medical and drug expenses combined, the report said. The CBO estimates these midtier plans would cover 58% of covered medical expenses. Many low-income people wouldn\u2019t purchase any plans, the CBO found.The revised bill includes the Cruz proposal would let insurers that sell plans that comply with ACA regulations also sell plans that don\u2019t. Opponents say the proposal would increase the number of uninsured by raising costs for people with pre-existing health conditions.Supporters say it would reduce premium costs and allow more people to buy insurance.House Republicans have passed a health bill that would result in 23 million fewer uninsured compared with the ACA, an earlier CBO report estimated.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 15:12:00", "news_title": "CBO Says Revised Senate Plan Would Increase Uninsured by 22 Million ", "keywords": " aca, affordable care act,cbo, health care, health law, republicans, senate,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pepsico-ceo-picks-a-president-but-no-heir-apparent-1500552001", "content": "PepsiCo Inc.\u2019s        PEP 0.15%       longtime leader,       Indra Nooyi,        is promoting one of her lieutenants into the vacant No. 2 position at the company, in a move that shuffles potential successors to her job.Ramon Laguarta,        head of the company\u2019s Europe and sub-Saharan Africa business, will become PepsiCo\u2019s president, a headquarters role covering global operations, corporate strategy, public policy and government affairs. The spot has been unoccupied for nearly three years.Mr. Laguarta\u2019s current duties will be given to       Laxman Narasimhan,        who will continue to oversee the snack-and-beverage giant\u2019s Latin America division. Both appointments will take effect Sept. 1.In an interview, Ms. Nooyi, 61 years old, said she intends to keep running the Purchase, N.Y.-based company \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The two promotions are the latest in a series of moves over the past few years to \u201cstretch\u201d executives and prepare them to be contenders for the top job, she said. The company\u2019s division heads will continue to report to her.The leading internal candidates to succeed Ms. Nooyi include Mr. Laguarta, Mr. Narasimhan and       Hugh Johnston,        PepsiCo\u2019s chief financial officer, who in 2015 was named vice chairman and put in charge of e-commerce and information technology.PepsiCo, which has a market value of about $165 billion, has been using higher prices, smaller packaging and a broader product portfolio to help boost results amid shifting consumer tastes that are pressuring the packaged-food and beverage industries. Despite falling soda demand and other industry challenges, the company\u2019s profit margins are rising and its shares are trading near all-time highs.During Ms. Nooyi\u2019s 11-year tenure, two potential successors have been promoted to the No. 2 role of president only to leave the company later on. The job has been vacant since the 2014 departure of       Zein Abdalla.Ms. Nooyi, who was chief financial officer and president before she was named chief executive in 2006, said Mr. Laguarta shouldn\u2019t be presumed to be her successor.She took over as chairman in 2007 and led the spinoff of             Yum Brands Inc.       as well as acquisitions of Tropicana and Quaker Oats. She has fended off calls to break up the company and has pushed into healthier snacks and beverages.\u201cThere is no heir apparent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the time comes for succession, whenever it is, I think the wonderful thing is our board is going to have so many people to choose from.\u201dMr. Laguarta, 53, a native of Barcelona, joined the company in 1996 and has spent most of his career rising through the ranks of the European operations. He has an M.B.A. from Spain\u2019s ESADE business school. He speaks English, Spanish, French, German, Greek and Catalan and will relocate to the U.S. from Geneva in his new role.Mr. Narasimhan, 50, was previously a senior partner at McKinsey & Co., where he spent 19 years before joining PepsiCo in 2012. He worked as senior vice president and finance chief at PepsiCo Americas Foods before rising to Latin America chief in 2014.Ms. Nooyi said she wanted Mr. Laguarta, whom she called \u201ca great operating executive,\u201d to gain experience at the corporate headquarters, where his mandate will be to increase sales and productivity to fund investments, she said.Meanwhile, she said she wanted to push Mr. Narasimhan to \u201clift and shift ideas\u201d across Europe, Africa and Latin America to accelerate his divisions\u2019 growth. He has \u201cevolved from brilliant strategist to a very good operating executive,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said.As Mr. Laguarta takes on some of Ms. Nooyi\u2019s responsibilities, she said she would turn her focus to PepsiCo\u2019s future. Letting other executives \u201ccome into their own, but being there as a helping hand, is my job at this point,\u201d she said.Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 08:03:00", "news_title": "PepsiCo CEO Picks a No. 2, but No \u2018Heir Apparent\u2019", "keywords": "ceo,executives,management,president,sales,PepsiCo,PEP,Indra Nooyi,Ramon Laguarta,plans,strategy,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,soft drinks,drinks,consumer goods,non-alcoholic beverages"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/musk-teases-a-new-york-to-d-c-hyperloop-in-a-tweet-1500571308", "content": "Billionaire entrepreneur       Elon Musk,        known for his teasing tweets and ever-expanding list of high-tech ambitions, set observers abuzz again with a vague claim he received \u201cverbal\u201d approval for a high-speed, tunnel-based travel system along one of the busiest corridors in the U.S.In a message Thursday on his official Twitter account, Mr. Musk said he had \u201cJust received verbal govt approval\u201d to build a \u201cHyperloop\u201d along the East Coast that could deliver people from New York to Washington in 29 minutes. Amtrak\u2019s Acela Express travels between New York and Washington in slightly less than three hours.He didn\u2019t immediately say which government agency or official had given approval, or elaborate on issues such as timing or cost, but later added he aimed to build similar systems in suburban Los Angeles and Texas. Infrastructure projects of large sizes often take years\u2014if not decades\u2014to receive government approvals.\u201cStill a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.A representative for Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnel venture, The Boring Company, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for clarification.The Transportation Department referred questions about the hyperloop to the White House, which confirmed conversations with Mr. Musk and other Boring Company executives. But the White House didn\u2019t say whether it had given any kind of approval for the hyperloop.A White House spokesman said in a statement: \u201cWe have had promising conversations to date, are committed to transformative infrastructure projects, and believe our greatest solutions have often come from the ingenuity and drive of the private sector.\u201dA spokesman for New York\u2019s mayor tweeted the announcement was \u201cnews to City Hall.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s tweets raised more questions than they answered.Depending on the route, such a project could require approvals from five or six state governments, said Lynne Kiesling, associate director of Purdue University\u2019s Research Center in Economics. Ms. Kiesling\u2019s research includes the effect of regulatory institutions on technological change.\u201cStringing together five or six such approvals would be a long, costly and fractious process,\u201d she said.Mr. Musk has long talked about the creation of a so-called hyperloop, a system for high-speed transportation in a near-vacuum state that takes place in miles-long tubes. Since Mr. Musk floated the idea in 2013, others have tried to commercialize the concept. Hyperloop One has raised $180 million but has faced delays in rolling out a prototype.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets convey his wide-ranging interests. He is chief executive of electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.,       which last year merged with energy company SolarCity, another business he backed. He also heads rocket-maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp.In April, Mr. Musk announced plans for a new company called Neuralink Corp., where he also is CEO, aiming to merge computers with brains so humans could one day engage in \u201cconsensual telepathy.\u201dIn his series of tweets Thursday, Mr. Musk said the hyperloop system, a network linking New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, would be accessible from city centers, with up to a dozen access points in each city.Mr. Musk responded to few of the questions posed to him on Twitter. \u201cSupport would be much appreciated!\u201d he said in one tweet.He began teasing the idea of a tunnel project on Twitter in December, with a post saying, \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear, however, if the musing was more than just a man bored with Los Angeles traffic.In January he tweeted: \u201cExciting progress on the tunnel front.\u201d \u201cPlan to start digging in a month or so,\u201d he said.He has been testing his tunneling techniques at SpaceX in Hawthorne, Calif.Just days ago, at a gathering of U.S. governors, Mr. Musk answered a question about whether he feels pressure from people\u2019s expectations about his projects, particularly in light of the Tesla\u2019s stock price, which has soared more than 50% this year.\u201cI find it quite tough when there are very high expectations,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI try to actually tamp down those expectations.\u201d\u2014Eliot Brown contributed to this article.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 15:26:00", "news_title": "Elon Musk Teases a New York-to-D.C.

Policies have expiration dates, and the one in the Lebbin family\u2019s two contracts is age 100 for the policyholder.It is a standard feature of permanent life insurance, a product combining a tax-deferred savings component with a tax-free death-benefit. The provision calls for the termination of the death benefit and payout of all of the built-up savings when the policyholder reaches the specified age.The limits weren\u2019t an issue in the many decades when very few people lived beyond 100. But they increasingly are a problem for the U.S. life-insurance industry as more people become centenarians. There were an estimated 53,364 centenarians in the U.S. as of 2010, up from 37,306 in 1990 and 32,194 in 1980, according to a U.S. Census report published in December 2012.Since the mid- to late-2000s, the industry has used age 121 as the standard maturity date in new contracts. But an unknown number of older contracts with the 100-year-old limit remain in consumers\u2019 hands. Some insurers previously offered older policyholders the opportunity to extend the age in their older policies with varying financial terms.The Lebbin family\u2019s insurer, a unit of Transamerica Corp., didn\u2019t offer an extension.Lawrence Rybka,        president of insurance brokerage Valmark Financial Group in Akron, Ohio, worries many people may unexpectedly lose out. At least seven people have recently contacted his firm with questions about older policies with maturity dates of 95 to 100 years. \u201cContract language of this type was common practice,\u201d he said.Faced with the potential loss of coverage, Mr. Lebbin\u2019s family filed suit in federal court in Maryland earlier this month, accusing Transamerica of knowingly using a too-low age at the time of sale in the early 1990s. The suit also alleges the insurer improperly marketed the policies as \u201ccoverage for life.\u201dThe federal-court lawsuit says the Lebbins paid Transamerica more than $1.5 million in premiums over the years. It seeks revision of the contracts to allow coverage until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death. It also seeks an award including punitive and other damages.In a statement, Transamerica, a unit of the Netherlands\u2019s             Aegon                   NV, says it acted properly.\u201cWe understand that Mr. Lebbin is disappointed that his life insurance coverage will shortly come to an end. However, his policies, according to their terms, pay benefits only if he were to pass away before the policies\u2019 anniversaries nearest age 100\u2026We take seriously our obligations to the millions of customers who rely on the solutions we provide and we abide fully by the terms and conditions of our policy contracts,\u201d according to the statement.In terminating the policy, Transamerica said it would pay Mr. Lebbin the built-up \u201cnet cash value,\u201d or savings. That is as per contractual terms.It is unclear how much cash value there is, said       James Bainbridge,        a lawyer for the family. Industrywide, many of these policies have performed poorly in recent years because interest buildup is tied to the insurers\u2019 bond investments, and low interest rates have had a punishing effect. Upon termination of the policies, the Lebbin family would collect less money and potentially pay taxes, while a future $3.2 million death benefit would be tax-free, Mr. Bainbridge said.\u201cTransamerica has a public-relations problem because it didn\u2019t think ahead and offer policyholders like these\u201d options at an earlier stage to deal with the looming age issue, said       Todd Erkis,        a former chief actuary at             Lincoln National Corp.       and a visiting professor at St. Joseph\u2019s University.Ironically, policy maturity dates were born as a way to help consumers get a reasonable value out of a policy after years of ownership but before a death, said       Paul Graham,        a senior actuary with the American Council of Life Insurers. To calculate monetary values and set annual premium levels, \u201cyou have to have an end point,\u201d he said.By the mid 2000s, a new mortality table was available that established 121 as the new maturity age to help prevent an abundance of policies maturing before death, according to Mr. Graham.\u201cThe agents didn\u2019t want the policies maturing before people were dying, the companies didn\u2019t want it happening, and policyholders didn\u2019t want it happening,\u201d he said.The policies taken out by the Lebbins are called universal life. They are a popular form of permanent life insurance. Permanent life stands in contrast to basic \u201cterm\u201d life, which is sold to provide a payout if a death occurs within a specified period of time, usually 10 to 30 years.The suit alleges Transamerica marketed the policies as coverage that would insure the Lebbins for life and would guarantee they would have tax-free income with which their heirs could pay estate taxes. The lawsuit maintains that Transamerica established the maturity date with a 1980 mortality table \u201cdespite the fact that it was outdated and not an accurate reflection of the actual life expectancies of its customers.\u201dThe Lebbins became aware last year of Transamerica\u2019s intention to terminate the policies and unsuccessfully sought an extension of the contracts until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death, the lawsuit says.Mr. Lebbin was born on Sept. 6, 1917, in Berlin. He came to the U.S. in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution, according to his son-in-law       Phillip Spector.      \u00a0From arriving penniless, he founded a paint-manufacturing business in the 1940s and ultimately had more than 50 retail outlets in the Baltimore-Washington area.He married in 1944. Bernice Lebbin died in 2015.\u201cCentenarians are cherished and routinely honored by local communities and governments,\u201d said Mr. Bainbridge, the lawyer. \u201cCentenarians, however, are problematic for the life-insurance industry.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 07:00:00", "news_title": "Happy 100th Birthday!
