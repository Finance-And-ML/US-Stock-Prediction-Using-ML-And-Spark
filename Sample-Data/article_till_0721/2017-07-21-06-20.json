In May of that year, the Treasury Department said the company signed eight documents relating to oil and gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        chief executive of the state oil giant PAO Rosneft. The Treasury said Thursday those deals violated U.S. sanctions against Mr. Sechin, a former Russian intelligence officer and ally to President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Tillerson, who had close business ties to Russia and received an \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d award from Moscow, left Exxon last year to become U.S. secretary of state.The $2 million fine, the Treasury said, was the maximum amount it could levy against the company.A spokesman for Exxon called the fine \u201coutrageous\u201d and said it would fight the Treasury\u2019s findings, saying they are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration when the sanctions were enacted. The Treasury\u2019s sanctions unit started its probe of the alleged sanctions violation several years ago. Exxon said it was first notified in 2015 by the sanctions unit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, that it had violated sanctions regarding its interactions with Mr. Sechin. In a filing in a Texas court Thursday, the company said it had challenged the notification about a month later.Exxon doesn\u2019t have any direct deals with Mr. Sechin but does have business dealings with Rosneft, where Mr. Sechin signed company documents in his capacity as CEO, Exxon said. According to the company, under President       Barack Obama,        the White House and the Treasury in 2014 said U.S. companies were allowed to participate in business dealings with Mr. Sechin if they were professional, not personal.On Thursday afternoon, the Irving, Texas, company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, seeking to toss the fine. In a court filing, Exxon said the sanctions unit \u201cseeks to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order that is inconsistent with the explicit and unambiguous guidance from the White House and the Treasury issued before the relevant conduct and still publicly available today.\u201dThe Justice Department declined to comment about Exxon\u2019s legal challenge.The U.S. Treasury said in an enforcement notice against Exxon that the company showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements\u201d when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under U.S. sanctions. The Treasury unit said one of the \u201caggravating factors\u201d it considered was that Exxon is a globally sophisticated company that routinely deals with sanctions compliance concerns.\u201cNo materials issued by the White House or the Department of the Treasury asserted an exception or carve-out for the professional conduct of designated or blocked persons, nor did any materials suggest that U.S. persons could continue to conduct or engage in business with such individuals,\u201d the Thursday notice said.When Mr. Tillerson took his position in President       Donald Trump\u2019s       cabinet this year, he promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year. He has stood by the current sanctions regime. In Ukraine earlier this month, Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2014imposed along with sanctions from the European Union\u2014would remain \u201cuntil Moscow reverses the actions that triggered these particular sanctions.\u201dMr. Tillerson, as Mr. Trump\u2019s top diplomat, has been leading administration efforts to improve relations with Russia.\u201cThis is a big black eye for Tillerson,\u201d said Anders \u00c5slund, a senior fellow and Russia expert at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank and Russia critic.Though the State Department referred most questions about this specific matter to Exxon, spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said Thursday that Mr. Tillerson is committed to the objectives of the Ukraine-related sanctions. She said the State Department wasn\u2019t involved with the decision to fine Exxon. She said Mr. Tillerson is \u201cliving up to his ethical commitments,\u201d including his recusal from Exxon-related matters.Rosneft spokesman Michael Leontiev said signing an agreement with Mr. Sechin not as an individual, but as a representative of Rosneft management, can\u2019t be the foundation for a sanctions violation. \u201cI am sure that while Exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both OFAC and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully,\u201d he said.The penalty comes as committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as a Justice Department special counsel, investigate what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to interfere in the presidential election, and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Russia has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion.\u201cExxon Mobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\u201d of a sanctioned entity, the Treasury said.Exxon applied to the Treasury Department for a partial waiver from Russia sanctions in 2015. The application was never acted upon at that time but was again circulating among government departments earlier this year. The Trump administration said in April that it wouldn\u2019t grant the waiver, two days after the application was reported by The Wall Street Journal.Exxon and other big energy companies also recently joined Mr. Trump in voicing concerns about congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners. Mr. Tillerson opposed ramped-up sanctions being considered in Congress, saying the White House needs flexibility on the matter.Lobbyists for Exxon told lawmakers in recent weeks that several provisions in the sanctions legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill are worrisome, including measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. and Exxon Spar Over Russia Sanctions.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fines-exxon-2-million-over-russia-sanctions-breaches-1500570876"}, {"news_title": "Financier Anthony Scaramucci Likely to Be Named White House Communications Director", "news_time": "2017-07-21 01:00:00", "keywords": " communications director,the mooch, trump administration, white house press office,Anthony Scaramucci,Donald Trump,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,audiovisual production,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,media,entertainment", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        a top donor to President       Donald Trump       during the campaign, is expected to be named White House communications director on Friday, two White House officials said.Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, is the founder of hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital and a hedge-fund conference known as SALT. Known as \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci previously hosted a financial TV show on             Fox Business Network                   and has been a frequent guest advocating for Mr. Trump on cable news shows.Mr. Scaramucci didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Separately,       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney who is representing him in Special Counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       probe of the links of the president\u2019s associates to Russia, is expected to take on a lesser role on Mr. Trump\u2019s outside legal team, according to a person familiar with the shift.Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s spokesman, Mark Corallo, resigned from his post this week after less than two months on the job, according to a person familiar with his decision, after privately expressing frustration over the administration\u2019s handling of episodes such as the revelation of a meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged in June 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer.Mr. Corallo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Scaramucci, who worked at             Goldman Sachs                   and graduated from Harvard Law School, would join a communications office that has been a target of criticism from Republicans in Washington and Mr. Trump himself.The White House has been seeking a communications director since       Mike Dubke      resigned from the role at the end of May, \u200bas the president aimed to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Mr. Scaramucci had been a top candidate for the role of director for the Office of Public Liaison before it was given to       George Sifakis.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s new job was first reported by Axios.com.The president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI director       James Comey.       But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, press secretary       Sean Spicer       has been filling in for the role of communications director, while deputy press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Scaramucci was active during the 2016 presidential race. After having originally supported Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker for the Republican presidential nomination, and then former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he threw his support behind Mr. Trump and became one of his most vocal supporters.Mr. Scaramucci is serving as chief strategist at the U.S. Export Import Bank. His appointment to that role followed months of uncertainty about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s prospects of joining the White House, after a promised role in the White House was handed to someone else.The move to shift Mr. Scaramucci to the communications team comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are crafting a strategy that aims to contain Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and ensure it doesn\u2019t veer into Mr. Trump\u2019s private business dealings.\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s investigatory activities are limited by his mandate. And looking at a real-estate deal from 10 years ago would exceed that mandate,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, referencing a Bloomberg story that said Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump business deals dating back years.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also would be looking at potential conflicts of interest in the Mueller legal team, Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cConflict of interest issues, if they arise, will be addressed in due course through the normal legal channels if we get to that stage. Any lawyer would look at potential conflicts,\u201d he said.The recourse for Trump\u2019s legal team would be to first approach Mr. Mueller and then the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein,        Mr. Sekulow said. \u200bMr. Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.Write to Michael C.

Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and described investigations into the issue a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied meddling.The Senate and House intelligence committees also are probing possible money laundering by Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of those investigations.The Senate committee also has received reports from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tracks illicit money flows, to learn if any of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses may have financial ties to Russian interests, these people said.

John       McCain       went into full maverick mode to describe his quest to upset his party\u2019s prohibitive favorite in the race.\u201c      George Bush       is out there raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out there raising hell.\u201dRaising hell is what       John McCain       has always been willing to do, without much regard for party or precedent. Indeed, it often appears he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s a style that occasionally infuriates Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014but that ultimately has endeared him to many people in both parties, who admire his life story and the courage that has been laced through its many chapters.That admiration explains why the capital went into a kind of shock Wednesday night when the news broke that Mr. McCain has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.At one Washington dinner, perhaps a dozen cellphones pinged more or less simultaneously with the news, which temporarily brought the proceedings to a halt. Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        his closest friend in the Senate, articulated the view of many when he said that cancer has now picked the toughest opponent possible. And as if to underscore the point, Mr. McCain tweeted Thursday his intention to return to the Senate quickly.In a capital full of diverse characters, John McCain stands out. He is singular. Part of it is his remarkable story as a Vietnam War veteran: A young and somewhat reckless Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam, grievously injured and then imprisoned under the most horrific conditions for more than five years, during which he declined opportunities to be released before his comrades. Candidate       Donald Trump       said during the 2016 campaign that Mr. McCain wasn\u2019t a war hero, but few agreed.There has followed a political career that took him first to the House and then to the Senate and ultimately to the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.But it was that iconic 2000 presidential campaign that cemented the Arizonan\u2019s reputation as a unique political figure.To anyone who wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s almost impossible to describe what it was like. He banked his whole campaign on winning the New Hampshire primary, and set out to do so by canvassing the state, day after day, on a bus filled with aides and reporters and straight talk. In fact, it became known as the \u201cStraight Talk Express,\u201d and his dozens of town-hall meetings were a cross between religious revivals and voter-therapy sessions.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.He slaughtered his party\u2019s sacred cows and picked up support from disgruntled voters along the way. He said the GOP\u2019s big-money donors not only owned Mr. Bush, but were destroying democracy in the process. He said an emerging federal budget surplus should be used not for tax cuts, but to pay down debt and bank money for Social Security. He attacked the religious right, directly and repeatedly. He was light on policy details, but details didn\u2019t seem to be the point.He became a kind of Pied Piper in New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t just reporters who followed him around. Voters did, too; some of them trailing him in their cars from one town hall to another just to be part of it.In the end, he did win New Hampshire. It wasn\u2019t enough, because he went on to lose to Mr. Bush in South Carolina and ultimately in the race for the nomination. He finally won the elusive nomination eight years later, but it felt as if he\u2019d never quite recaptured that 2000 lightning.He returned to the Senate after the 2008 loss to Barack Obama, and seemed deflated at first. But then he roared back, and now leads the powerful Armed Services Committee and occupies a prominent place in every debate and controversy. Among other things, as a victim of torture himself, he has emerged as a powerful voice against harsh interrogation techniques.Sen. McCain has occasionally struck colleagues as tired and disoriented in recent days, probably early signs of the cancer diagnosis to come. But when he appeared last month at a Wall Street Journal conference for an onstage interview, he was sharp as ever.And as outspoken as ever. He talked of his disappointment that President Donald Trump didn\u2019t raise human rights concerns on his recent trip to the Middle East: \u201cIf we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t change human beings,\u201d Sen. McCain added. \u201cThey want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

But at least one senator who has voiced concerns about the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts said Ms. Verma has taken a careful approach by providing data without overselling her proposal.\u201cShe\u2019s not in the business of lobbying, but she\u2019s in the business of getting us good information,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said.Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) said, \u201cShe\u2019s obviously a knowledgeable person who\u2019s implemented innovative programs...That gives a great deal of street credibility.\u201dSen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, one of the Republicans who is opposed to the GOP bill, said she wasn\u2019t convinced by the pitch because the amount going to consumers would fall far short of the bill\u2019s $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding over a decade. Under the plan, up to $200 billion from the taxes would go to support affected low-income people.\u201cIf you\u2019re still going to take more than $700 billion out of the Medicaid program, you still have significant problems,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price,        have visited Capitol Hill in recent days. Republican senators have frequently cited Ms. Verma as providing detailed arguments for the GOP bill.Still, Medicaid cuts are only one issue cited by Republicans concerned about the bill. Some worry about losing consumer protections; others fear premiums won\u2019t be reduced enough.Under the latest version of the Republican health bill, the number of uninsured would increase by 22 million in 2026, compared with the current law, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday. Federal deficits would shrink by $420 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.With President       Donald Trump       signaling Wednesday that the administration will play a more aggressive role in wrangling 50 senators to support the bill, it appears Ms. Verma, a 46-year-old daughter of Indian-American immigrants, will play a large role in the coming days.Ms. Verma cut her teeth professionally as a consultant to states, including Indiana, that introduced conservative changes to their Medicaid programs through a complex waiver process.On Monday, Ms. Verma met with Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) and Mr. Portman. She met Wednesday morning with Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.), and that evening with about 20 senators gathered in the Capitol.At White House and Senate meetings Wednesday, Ms. Verma discussed the Medicaid provision at length. She has also been showing every senator numbers to illustrate how funds and waivers could affect their state, according to a person close to Ms. Verma. The goal is convincing them that the program could be put on a stable footing without hurting individuals, this person said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who presides over the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans, can lose only two GOP votes, with Mr. Pence casting a tiebreaking vote if necessary. His task has been complicated by Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) has been diagnosed with brain cancer; it isn\u2019t clear when he might return to Washington.The health debate has drawn Ms. Verma into an unfamiliar limelight, and White House officials said they are counting on her persuasiveness. They said they struggled in early phases of the House debate because Ms. Verma hadn\u2019t yet been confirmed, and they credit her with winning over House members at later stages.But many remain skeptical of her Medicaid proposal. Democrats and some Republicans said a one-time infusion of money, which aides and lawmakers said would likely be between $160 billion and $200 billion, wouldn\u2019t make up for far larger cuts to Medicaid over a longer period.\u201cThat\u2019s one of those tiny Band-Aids that you use for a child\u2019s cut,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). \u201cI would hope that won\u2019t win over any votes just to postpone the pain for a couple years or a couple months.\u201dSenate leaders say they expect to vote next week on a motion allowing them to begin debate on a health bill. But if Ms. Verma\u2019s proposal looks like it is picking up votes, GOP leaders could delay the vote to gather more support.One of Ms. Verma\u2019s few public appearances not related to health care came at a White House event in May celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.She talked about growing up in the U.S. at a time when people confused Indians with Native Americans, asking her what tribe she was from.She remembered her mother ruining silk saris by putting them in a U.S. washing machine. And she joked about her father\u2019s criticism of her 95% score on a test and\u2014years later\u2014her son\u2019s score of 89% on a math test that her daughter dubbed an \u201cAsian fail.\u201dThe U.S. is different now, she said. People now ask her which part of India her family is from, and they associate India with yoga and meditation, \u201cwhich I can say I haven\u2019t done much of\u201d lately.\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-floats-proposal-to-ease-medicaid-cuts-1500594788"}]
