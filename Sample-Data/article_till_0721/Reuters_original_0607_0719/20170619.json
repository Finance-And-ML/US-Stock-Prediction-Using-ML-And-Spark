Although FCA Japan has already announced its intention to concentrate its resources on the Jeep brand ahead, no decisions have been made regarding (the) Chrysler brand,  the automaker said in a statement on Monday. A woman walks past a logo of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in Turin March 31, 2014.Giorgio PerottinoThe Nikkei business daily reported that the European-U.S. automaker, which also sells the Jeep, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Abarth brands in Japan, was close to deciding to throw in the towel on the Chrysler brand, which posted sales of less than 300 vehicles in 2016, having fallen steadily since around 2000. Sales of the brand in Japan have shrunk to roughly one-tenth of what they were a decade ago. At the moment, FCA sells only one Chrysler model in Japan, the full-sized 300s luxury sedan, which is sold at the company's Jeep dealerships. As its sales struggle, FCA's Fiat brand, which include smaller models, and its Jeep brand have been growing in the country. Last year they sold around 6,700 and 9,400 units, respectively, making them top 10-selling foreign branded vehicles in the Japanese market. Foreign cars comprise a small portion of the total Japanese auto market, which is dominated by domestic brands. Last year, 295,000 foreign branded new cars were sold in the country, roughly one-tenth of total new vehicle sales.

Google said it would take a tougher position on videos containing supremacist or inflammatory religious content by issuing a warning and not monetizing or recommending them for user endorsements, even if they do not clearly violate its policies. The company will also employ more engineering resources and increase its use of technology to help identify extremist videos, in addition to training new content classifiers to quickly identify and remove such content.  While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies, the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done. Now,  said Google's general counsel Kent Walker. bit.ly/2rLgYEd Google will expand its collaboration with counter-extremist groups to identify content that may be used to radicalize and recruit extremists, it said.  The company will also reach potential Islamic State recruits through targeted online advertising and redirect them towards anti-terrorist videos in a bid to change their minds about joining. Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook (FB.O) and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter (TWTR.N) to do more to remove militant content and hate speech. Facebook on Thursday offered additional insight on its efforts to remove terrorism content, a response to political pressure in Europe to militant groups using the social network for propaganda and recruiting. Facebook has ramped up use of artificial intelligence such as image matching and language understanding to identify and remove content quickly, the company said in a blog post.

The 14.9 percent annual increase in exports in May was the biggest rise since January 2015 and nearly twice the pace seen in April, though it was below analysts' expectations of 16.1 percent. Japan's imports rose more than expected in May, partly due to increasing demand for intermediate goods companies need to manufacture their products.  Exports are likely to continue rising at a steady clip as overseas economies show increasing signs of strength, which should help Japan's economy extend its recent run of expansion.  The main scenario is Japan's exports will continue to recover,  said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  However, the pace of growth could slow somewhat as inventories of certain goods, like electronics, start to build up overseas.  Exports of cars and car parts rose partly because an earthquake in Kumamoto last year in May temporarily shut down production of these goods, Tonouchi noted.   Trade Surplus With u.s. Surges Japan's exports to the United States rose 11.6 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since July 2015, due to an increase of shipments of autos and auto parts. The trade surplus with the United States was 411.1 billion yen ($3.71 billion) in May, up 19.0 percent from the same period a year ago. In April, Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 4.2 percent.   A large trade surplus could draw criticism from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly indicated that it prefers protectionist policies to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and increase exports.      Exports to China increased 23.9 percent year-on-year in May, following a 14.8 percent annual increase in April. FILE PHOTO: Newly manufactured cars of the automobile maker Honda await export at port in Yokohama, Japan, January 16, 2017.Toru Hanai/File PhotoLarger shipments of flat panels and semiconductor manufacturing equipment drove the gains in China-bound exports. Exports to Asia, which includes China, rose 16.8 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest increase in three months, due to increased shipments of electronics to Hong Kong and steel to Indonesia, the data showed. In terms of volume, Japan's exports rose 7.5 percent in May from a year ago, the fastest gain in three months, another indication that overseas demand is firm. Import Growth at More Than 3-Year High Japan's imports rose 17.8 percent in the year to May, the strongest gain since early 2014, versus the median estimate for a 14.8 percent annual increase, as a rise in the price of oil from a year ago pushed up the value of imports. Excluding oil imports, the data showed increasing demand for chemicals, electronic parts and raw materials used in Japanese factories. In terms of volume, imports rose 5.4 percent in May from a year ago, the third consecutive month of gains in a sign of growing demand. The trade balance came to a deficit of 203.4 billion yen, versus the median estimate for a 76.0 billion yen surplus.  You can say domestic demand is doing well, but this is being driven more by the manufacturing sector,  said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.  There are some gains in durable goods, which are related to consumer spending, but rising factory output is the bigger factor behind imports.  Policymakers and economists have become more optimistic about Japan's prospects this year as an increase in factory output and a tightening labor market show the economy is poised to extend its recent growth. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Friday and upgraded its assessment of private consumption for the first time in six months. Consumption has been a soft spot in Japan's otherwise strengthening economy, with its weakness blamed for keeping inflation subdued by discouraging companies from raising prices, leaving growth heavily reliant on exports.

Chinese workers have increasingly come under attack as companies expand abroad as part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road plan to build infrastructure with the rest of Asia and beyond, often in politically unstable places.  China and Laos last year agreed to step up security cooperation following a series of attacks on Chinese nationals, including shootings and bomb attacks. [nL3N1812WV] One Chinese national was killed on Friday by an unidentified gunman, the embassy said in a statement posted to its website late on Sunday. It did not give further details.    The Chinese embassy requested that Laos quickly solve the case and severely punish the killer, and at the same time take practical action to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens and organizations in Laos,  the embassy said. The embassy also reminded Chinese people in the country to raise their security awareness.  Laos' Xaysomboun region has been plagued by sporadic conflict between the government and ethnic Hmong rebels for years. Two Chinese people, including an employee of a mining company, were killed in a suspected bomb blast on a vehicle in the region in January 2016.   In March 2016, one Chinese worker was killed and several injured in an attack on a company with Chinese investment in Luang Prabang province. China has been vying for influence in Laos, providing loans, aid and infrastructure investment. Beijing sees its neighbor as an important route to Southeast Asian ports for landlocked parts of southwestern China such as Yunnan.

The Nikkei was up 0.6 percent at 20,063.42 in mid-morning trade. The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 111.01 yen, boosting investor demand for stock futures, traders said.  Investors are buying futures today ... it's more like today's trading is futures-led than trade-led by individual stocks,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 110.955 yen, which lifted U.S. futures, which helped underpin risk appetite in Asian trade.  People also expect that Wall Street will fare better later in the day,  Mizuho's Miura said. The Nikkei is trading at more than one-week highs above the psychologically important 20,000-line, after the market digested the Bank Of Japan's decision to keep policy unchanged on Friday. After the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike and the BOJ's policy meeting, traders said the market was left with no major catalysts this week but will continue to stay focused on upcoming U.S. economic indicators. Monday's notable gainers included domestic-demand sensitive stocks. Construction companies Taisei Corp and Obayashi Corp both rose 1.6 percent, while Kajima Corp soared 2.1 percent. Underperforming the market was Nomura Real Estate Holdings , which sank 13 percent after it confirmed weekend media reports that Japan Post Holdings would likely scrap the talks to buy a stake in Nomura as the two companies had struggled to agree on the terms. The potential deal was first reported in mid-May, pushing Nomura's shares up by 20 percent. Major exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp flat, Nissan Motor Co shedding 0.7 percent and Hitachi Ltd gaining 0.7 percent. Takata Corp was untraded with a glut of sell orders, indicating the shares will tumble 17 percent to a daily limit low of 404 yen after the company released a statement on Friday saying that no decision of any kind has been made about bankruptcy procedures. Trading in Takata was suspended throughout Friday because the company offered no official statement after sources said it was preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as next week. The broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,605.73 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 0.6 percent to 14,286.43.

Google said it would take a tougher position on videos containing supremacist or inflammatory religious content by issuing a warning and not monetizing or recommending them for user endorsements, even if they do not clearly violate its policies. The company will also employ more engineering resources and increase its use of technology to help identify extremist videos, in addition to training new content classifiers to quickly identify and remove such content.  While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies, the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done. Now,  said Google's general counsel Kent Walker. bit.ly/2rLgYEd Google will expand its collaboration with counter-extremist groups to identify content that may be used to radicalize and recruit extremists, it said.  The company will also reach potential Islamic State recruits through targeted online advertising and redirect them towards anti-terrorist videos in a bid to change their minds about joining. Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook (FB.O) and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter (TWTR.N) to do more to remove militant content and hate speech. Facebook on Thursday offered additional insight on its efforts to remove terrorism content, a response to political pressure in Europe to militant groups using the social network for propaganda and recruiting. Facebook has ramped up use of artificial intelligence such as image matching and language understanding to identify and remove content quickly, the company said in a blog post.

Going on the trip will be White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is Trump's son-in-law and husband of his daughter Ivanka Trump, and Jason Greenblatt, a top national security aide. Greenblatt will arrive in the region on Monday and Kushner on Wednesday. The talks follow Trump's discussions last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Behind-the-scenes conversations have been taking place since the Trump trip, the White House official said.  Excited to be traveling back to Israel and the Pal.

Kushner and Greenblatt will have meetings in Jerusalem and Ramallah to hear directly from the Israeli and Palestinian leadership  about their priorities and potential next steps,  the official said.  President Trump has made it clear that working towards achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians is a top priority for him.

It is important to remember that forging a historic peace agreement will take time and to the extent that there is progress, there are likely to be many visits by both Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, sometimes together and sometimes separately, to the region and possibly many trips by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington D.C. or other locations as they pursue substantive talks,  the official said.

The latest public offerings of US dollar notes with tenors of under a year point to concerns that mainland regulators may tighten rules even on short-dated offshore debt. The deals came days after the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's economic planning agency, published a statement that criticised five Chinese issuers for failing to pre-register their offshore bonds plans. Greenland Holdings Group, rated Ba1/BB/BB by the three international agencies, priced $500 million 363-day Reg S senior unsecured notes at par to yield 4.00 percent, well inside initial guidance of 4.25 percent area. The newly priced bonds were the Chinese property developer's second sale of short-dated dollar bonds in just two months. Meanwhile, Hainan Airlines Holding priced a $300 million offering of 364-day Reg S senior unsecured notes at par to yield 5.50 percent, below initial guidance of 5.75 percent area. Very short-dated bonds have taken off recently as a way for Chinese issuers to avoid restrictions on offshore bond issuance. Bonds with maturities of less than one year do not need to be registered with the NDRC, while getting NDRC approval for longer-dated paper has become difficult in recent months, especially for real estate companies and local government financial vehicles. In response, property developers started raising very short-dated US dollar bonds to meet their offshore refinancing needs. Last month, Greenland Holding and Modern Land (China) printed 364-day private placements, raising $320 million and $100 million, respectively. Greenland’s were priced at 3.85 percent and Modern Land’s at 6.50 percent. Then, earlier this month, Fantasia Holdings Group, rated B2/B+ (Moody’s/S&P;), sold $350 million 364-day notes at par to yield 5.50 percent via public offering, while Ronshine China Holdings privately placed $150 million 364-day bonds at par to yield 6.50 percent. Last week's issue from Hainan Airlines, part of the acquisitive HNA Group, showed that the borrowing restrictions have spread beyond the property sector. Window Closing? Issuing debt at maturities of less than one year allows borrowers to address immediate funding needs, but also leaves them under pressure to refinance further down the line. Given the sudden popularity of very short-dated notes, there are rumours in the market that NDRC may close the loophole and require pre-registration also for bonds with maturity of less than one year.  I think this is why issuers with high refinancing needs are rushing to the market to issue this kind of bonds. If the loophole is closed, they may not be able – or at least may need to go through more processes – to get deals done,  one banker said. Another banker involved in Greenland Holding's latest 363-day bond deal said that a recent NDRC statement criticising five issuers for failing to pre-register plans to issue offshore bonds was a sign that the rules may be tightened. However, the chatter has so far not deterred the plans of issuers or demand from investors. Greenland Holding's majority-owned Hong Kong-listed unit Greenland Hong Kong Holdings held investor update meetings in Hong Kong last Friday via Credit Suisse and HSBC, ahead of a potential US dollar bond offering. The market expects the company may issue bonds with a tenor below a year, given its refinancing needs. The company has $500 million of bonds maturing on August 7. Good Demand Investor demand, especially from private banks, has been good for very short-dated bonds. Hainan Airlines' 364-day bonds drew final orders of over $500 million from 58 accounts, with 66 percent of the buyers being private banks. Final statistics for Greenland Holding's deal were not available at the time of writing, but books were said to be $1.2 billion before the announcement of final price guidance. Guotai Junan International was sole global coordinator and bookrunner for Hainan Airlines transaction. BOC International, Haitong International and JP Morgan were joint global coordinators, joint lead managers and joint bookrunners for Greenland Holding's deal. The five companies criticised in a June 12 NDRC statement were China Water Affairs, China South City, Mingfa (Group), Ping An Real Estate and China Mengniu Dairy. The regulator urged the five to comply with the registration process as soon as possible. The NDRC also warned that, in the future, companies failing to pre-register offerings of offshore bonds will be added to a national blacklist. In the past seven months, the five companies issued offshore vanilla bonds and convertible bonds, as well as privately placed notes. The NDRC implemented new rules in September 2015 requiring issuers to register plans to sell offshore bonds before and after pricing them. However, bankers are still confused as to precisely what types of securities and issuers fall under the new regime.  The rules governing offshore debt issuance are very ambiguous and have some grey areas. NDRC may need to streamline the regulations,  another DCM banker said.

Ramey left Kentucky for the U.S. capital in the 1940s to help with the war effort during World War Two and represented the District of Columbia when she was crowned Miss America.

The dollar index against a group of major currencies was flat at 97.187. The index had climbed to a two-week high of 97.560 late the previous week after the Fed raised interest rates and kept the door open for another hike in 2017. But its rally was tempered by Friday's weaker-than-expected housing and consumer sentiment data. The market is looking to comments by New York Fed President William Dudley for potential support for the greenback. Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, is due to take part in a roundtable with local business leaders in Plattsburgh, New York.  In the wake of Friday's weak U.S. data, Dudley could provide insight into whether the Fed is still poised to continue normalising monetary policy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  My view is that Dudley won't sound too dovish, and thus allow the dollar's gradual rise to resume.  Dudley could help clarify why the Fed appeared to ignore a series of soft inflation readings as it marched on with tighter policy last week. The dollar was up 0.15 percent at 111.020 yen. It had set a two-week peak of 111.420 on Friday before the U.S. data-induced retreat. The euro treaded water at $1.1198 after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday. The common currency showed little reaction to French President Emmanuel Macron winning a commanding majority in his country's parliamentary election on Sunday. Analysts said polls had favoured Macron and that his victory had been mostly factored in. The pound was little changed at $1.2770. It hardly budged on news that several people were injured in north London early on Monday after a van rammed into worshippers leaving a mosque. The currency has been through a turbulent month, sinking to a near two-month low of $1.2636 on June 9 on the British elections shock, but rallying last week as the Bank of England came close to hiking rates after a split vote in its monetary policy committee. Sterling has been confined to a narrow range over the past few days but faced potential volatility ahead as Britain begins its negotiations to exit the European Union on Monday.  While medium-term GBP appreciation is still likely, the tail risks of a no-deal or disorderly Brexit scenarios have increased, and should weigh on GBP,  wrote currency strategists at Barclays. The Australian dollar was a shade higher at $0.7625 , inching towards a 2-1/2-month high of $0.7636 scaled on Wednesday thanks to upbeat local employment data.

One local authority department, for example, was found to have launched a PPP project to build a much bigger-than-required office building when it only had six staffers, the state-run newspaper reported on Monday citing an unnamed official at a city's finance bureau.  Some governments were also shelving all risk for PPP projects by guaranteeing losses, or providing commitments to persuade financial institutions to dole out financing, the newspaper said.   These actions disrupt the market order and also exacerbate financing risks. These loopholes must be closed in order to eliminate hidden dangers,  it said.  The Ministry of Finance with other relevant departments were taking action to implement clear policies to govern such behavior.  China has been encouraging the use of PPP to alleviate the debt burdens of its local authorities, who in the past have  used debt to finance projects such as bridges and municipal works with less-than-robust analysis on future returns.  It has also launched a market in asset-backed securities (ABS), a financing instrument via which a wide range of assets such as loans, real estate, toll ways and scenic parks have been converted into tradable bond-like securities. China's growing debt has been singled out by analysts and policy makers as one of the biggest risks to its economy, prompting authorities to tighten regulations over the past year to curb risky and speculative forms of lending.

Moon campaigned on a program of cutting South Korea's traditional reliance on coal and nuclear for the bulk of its power, but has not previously commented on the commitment to end nuclear power since being elected in early May.  We will end the nuclear-oriented power generation plan and pave the way for a nuclear-free era,  Moon said at an event marking the closure of the Kori No.1 nuclear reactor in Busan, some 300 kms (186 miles) southeast of Seoul.  We will withdraw existing plans to build new nuclear power plants and not extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants.  South Korea's oldest nuclear reactor Kori No.1 was permanently shut down at midnight on Sunday after reaching the end of its 40-year-lifespan, the first South Korean nuclear power plants to be closed permanently. South Korea has 25 nuclear reactors, supplying about a third of the country's total electricity. During his campaign, Moon vowed to review plans to add new eight nuclear reactors, including the part-completed Shin Kori No.5 and Kori No.6. Moon said he will soon reach a consensus on the Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 reactors after fully considering their construction costs, safety and the potential costs of paying compensation. He also said the government will seek to shut down the country's second-oldest nuclear reactor, the Wolsong No.1, as soon as possible depending on the country's power supply conditions. Public support for nuclear power has been undermined by a local scandal in 2010 over forged certificates for spare parts and the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in neighbouring Japan. South Korea is seeking to scale back reliance on nuclear, and Moon has said he will support renewables and liquefied natural gas sectors in a bid to boost clean and safe energy. The new government plans to increase the use of renewables to 20 percent of the country's total power generation by 2030.

The Nikkei business daily, citing government and ruling party sources, said Abe would rejig his cabinet in August or September. Abe will probably retain Finance Minister Taro Aso and close ally Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, but it was not clear if he would replace Defence Minister Tomomi Inada, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida or Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara. A slew of fresh public opinion polls showed support for Abe's cabinet slumping sharply, with Mainichi newspaper reporting that his ratings had fallen 10 points to 36 percent, the biggest drop since he took office in December 2012.  Non-support for Abe rose to 44 percent, the first time it surpassed the percentage of backers since October 2015, after parliament enacted controversial security laws expanding the scope for military activities overseas, the Mainichi said. Last week, the education ministry unearthed documents that the opposition said suggested Abe wanted a new veterinary school run by a friend to be approved in a state-run special economic zone. The ministry had said it could not find the documents but reopened the probe under public pressure. Abe has repeatedly denied abusing his authority to benefit his friend.  Opposition politicians and the media have identified Abe's friend as Kotaro Kake, the director of the Kake Educational Institution, which wants to open a veterinary department. The government has not approved new veterinary schools for decades because of concern about a glut of veterinarians. Almost three-quarters of voters in the Mainichi survey said they were not persuaded by the government's insistence there was nothing wrong with the approval process. The institution has said it had acted appropriately Voters were split over last week's enactment by parliament of a controversial law that will penalize conspiracies to commit terrorism and other serious crimes. But many expressed distaste for the ruling coalition's tactics in rushing the bill through parliament. The ruling bloc took the rare step of skipping a vote in committee and going directly to a full session of parliament's upper house.  Almost 70 percent of voters said the bill had not been sufficiently debated, according to the Mainichi survey. Ruling Liberal Democratic Party support still far outstripped that of the opposition Democratic Party, the polls showed.

A Syrian army statement released on Syrian state television said the plane crashed and the pilot was missing in the first such downing of a Syrian jet by the United States since the start of the conflict in 2011. The army statement said it took place on Sunday afternoon near a village called Rasafah. The  flagrant attack was an attempt to undermine the efforts of the army as the only effective force capable with its allies ... in fighting terrorism across its territory,  the Syrian army said.  This comes at a time when the Syrian army and its allies were making clear advances in fighting the Daesh (Islamic State) terrorist group,  it added. Related CoverageU.S. says it downed Syrian warplane that attacked U.S.-backed fightersThe U.S. Central Command later issued a statement saying the Syrian plane was downed  in collective self-defense of Coalition-partnered forces,  identified as fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) near Tabqah. It said that  pro-Syrian regime forces  had earlier attacked an SDF-held town south of Tabqa and wounded a number of fighters, driving them from the town.  Coalition aircraft in a show of force stopped the initial advance. When a Syrian army SU-22 jet later dropped bombs near the U.S.-backed forces, it was immediately shot down by a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet, the statement said.

Mohr/Handout/File Photo via REUTERSBefore it downed the plane, the coalition had  contacted  its Russian counterparts by telephone via an established  de-confliction line  to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing.  The coalition does  not seek to fight the Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces  but would not  hesitate to defend itself or its  partnered forces from any threat,  the statement said. The U.S.-led coalition has in recent weeks escalated its aerial bombing campaign in northern Syria and Raqqa province. U.S.-backed forces have encircled the city of Raqqa and captured several districts from the militants. The Syrian army, which has been taking territory from retreating Islamic State militants in the eastern Aleppo countryside, has moved into Raqqa province and seized back some oil fields and villages that had been under the militants' control for almost three years. An SDF official told Reuters the Syrian army had been engaged in skirmishes in recent days with U.S.-backed forces near the town of Maskaneh close to the borders of Raqqa province, much of which is now held by U.S.-backed groups fighting Islamic State. The Syrian army backed by Iranian-backed militias has also been in competition in southeastern Syria with U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels who are also trying to recapture territory from Islamic State. On several occasions in recent weeks, warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have also struck pro-government forces to prevent them advancing from a U.S.-controlled garrison in southeastern Syria at a spot where the country's borders join with Iraq and Jordan. Washington also described those strikes as self-defense. (Fixes headline to make clear that Syrian army jet downed.)

Effective July 3, the government will tighten loan limits for home buyers to 60 percent of a property's value from the current 70 percent in regions showing signs of overheating including Seoul, the finance ministry and financial regulator said in a statement. Also in Seoul, debt repayments will be limited to 50 percent of borrowers' annual income. The government will also restrict the resale of newly built apartments in Seoul and some parts of Busan until registration of property ownership is complete, to cool speculation in those regions, it said. Rather than nationwide measures, the government is trying a targeted approach aimed at cities with the most heated property prices to reduce the impact on the construction sector, which grew almost five times faster than the gross domestic product in the first quarter.  This is in line with what the market had expected for weeks,  Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment said.  Although mortgage rules are being tightened, it may not be enough to cool the property market demand as some regions had supply shortage problems,  Kim said. The central bank’s eight rate cuts since 2012 helped send home prices and household debt to record levels. The average price of a Seoul apartment in March exceeded 600 million won ($529,918.30) for the first time, an increase of more than 20 percent from four years earlier. Apartment prices in Seoul rose 0.3 percent in the week of June 12 from a week earlier, the fastest clip since 2009, according to Kookmin Bank data.  Curbing the property market speculation would limit overall household debt growth. I don't see debt growth worsening under such policy direction,  Kim at Hana said. At 92.8 percent of the GDP, South Korea’s household debt even exceeds that of the U.S. and Japan, Bank for International Settlement data shows.

Twenty years after Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, scores of mainland professionals are filling the elite financial ranks of Hong Kong, while a series of lay-offs at Western banks has led to an exodus of expatriates. The largest increase in mainland staff over the past decade has come in investment banks, with 80 percent seeing an increase of at least 20 percent, according to a 2015 Financial Services Development Council survey.  It has a much better environment than Beijing where I used to work,  said Hong Hao, a managing director at BOCOM International, who has lived in Hong Kong for five years.  The food is good, and the tax rate is also good.  Tax rates in Hong Kong are around 15-17 percent, while they can be as much as 45 percent in mainland China. Chinese initial public offerings (IPO) dominate the Hong Kong market, the world's largest IPO market in 2016 when mainland offerings represented 80 percent of all new listings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Hong Kong's financial services industry accounts for 18 percent of the territory's economy, compared with just 10.4 percent in 1997 when the city returned to Chinese rule. Expat Customers Fall Evan Zhang, a 26-year-old from Guangdong province, is one of those new kids on the block in Hong Kong. For Zhang, one of the younger hires at CITIC Securities International, the increasing outward flow of Chinese capital in recent years is an opportunity.  With Chinese people more willing now to allocate assets overseas, and overseas investors willing to invest in China, I can play a go-between role to help them,  he said. As top banks such as Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Bank of America trim their Asia headcount, businesses across Hong Kong have taken a direct hit. Bo Innovation, a Michelin-star restaurant, said its Western expat customers fell roughly 10 percent in the last 10 years, according to owner and executive chef Alvin Leung. Mainland clients increased by about the same percentage, he added. Western companies are also increasingly turning to more affordable locations such as Quarry Bay, at a time when Chinese companies are boosting their presence in the prime Central district, according to Tom Gaffney, a managing director at real estate services firm CBRE. The value of a typical expat package for middle managers in Hong Kong, has fallen by two percent in U.S. dollar terms over the past five years, while the value of their benefits has fallen five percent over the same period, according to consultancy firm ECA International.  I have seen an enormous change in the expat landscape and packages offered,  said Christine Davis, a manager at international relocation firm The Santa Fe Group who was an expat in Hong Kong in 1999-2001 and again since 2011. Everything was paid for by hosting companies in the past, she said, but now expat terms had been reduced  drastically . Hong Kong dropped two places to 13th in the world in HSBC's 2016 Expat Explorer Survey, which measures various aspects of expat life. Easier to Recruit The new expat environment is making its easier to recruit talent. Several Chinese brokerages, asset management firms, and a Big Four Chinese bank told Reuters in recent months they intend to expand and hire more people in Hong Kong.  When I first joined the company 14 years ago, we could barely recruit the right people as we couldn't offer a good salary,  said Chen Shuang, chief executive of China Everbright Ltd, the Hong Kong investment arm of state-owned China Everbright Group.  But now, it's much easier to recruit top talent, even those from large Wall Street banks, which was unimaginable in the past.  Some senior Chinese bankers, such as managing directors and department heads, now earn more than their Western counterparts, which offer compensation of about $1 million a year, including base salary and cash bonus, according to executive recruiter Bernard Yeo of Bo Le Associates. On the flip side, junior Chinese bankers are typically paid 20 to 30 percent less than their foreign counterparts and enjoy a less generous package that excludes housing, school fees, and club memberships enjoyed by many Western expats, Yeo said. The changing demographics of the financial industry is reflected in the local economy. Restaurants featuring provincial mainland Chinese cuisine, like Old Beijing restaurant and San Xilou, which offers spicy Sichuanese fare, are doing well, restaurant managers say. So are serviced apartment companies, English learning programs, and Audis, a popular car brand among Chinese. In contrast,  Trattoria Doppio Zero, a popular Italian restaurant in the central business district, has seen over a 10-percent drop in its customers the last three years, said manager Jeffrey Ko.

But looks can deceive. In fact, it was the Athletics who completed a surprising four-game sweep on Sunday with a 4-3 win at a sweltering Oakland Coliseum amid 90-degree heat. Khris Davis' two-run homer, his 18th of the season, broke a 2-2 tie in Oakland's four-run third inning. Sean Doolittle earned the save, and Jharel Cotton (4-7, 5.40 ERA) gave the kind of quality start the A's needed against the high-powered Yankees. The A's are tough at home with a 22-13 record, but horrendous away at 9-25.  This feels really good,  Doolittle said of the sweep.  To put four games together against a team that's that good, one of the best teams in the American League, to come away with a four-game sweep is really big for us.  Now the A's will look to keep bashing the big boys when they open a four-game set at home against American League West-leading Houston on Monday. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AthleticsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchAfter missing more than a month due to inflammation on his rotator cuff, Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman returned on Sunday, and retired the side in order in the eighth.  They wanted me to go out there and pitch an inning, regardless of the situation in the game,  Chapman said, using an interpreter. The Yankees' Matt Holliday returned after being scratched on Saturday due to allergy symptoms and crushed a solo home run in the second inning, his 14th of the year. Davis described the sweep as a  confidence-boost for sure, just because they're a great team on the other side. They've got a lot of power guys. We just battled and battled, and it just showed how relentless we can be.  New York dropped its sixth consecutive game and completed a disappointing West Coast trip 1-6. The Yankees were swept for the first time this season, joining the rest of the American League in that department. But Yankees manager Joe Girardi doesn't sound worried about his team.  I don't look at things in a snapshot,  Girardi said.  I look at how you've played over the course of a season and we've really played well, and it's a very talented group.  Cotton, who entered the game on a four-game losing streak, allowed six hits and three earned runs, struck out six and walked one. It marked his second longest start of the season. He threw 103 pitches, and could have thrown a few more.  Towards the end I wanted to win for the team so badly I just wanted to pitch as long as I can go,  Cotton said. Cotton described the outing as a way to build momentum. He said A's regular catcher Stephen Vogt, who served as the designated hitter on Sunday, advised him to attack the Yankees' hitters and not to nibble because they'll just  foul you off.  Doolittle overcame a two-base throwing error by shortstop Chad Pinder to earn the save. The A's jolted Yankees rookie right-hander Luis Cessa (0-1), making his first start of the season, in the third to take a 4-2 lead. Davis had the telling blow, a prodigious shot to center -- just his second home run in his last 19 games. Josh Phegley started the uprising with a single, and Matt Joyce and Pinder followed with back-to-back doubles, the latter one tying the game. Cessa held the A's without a hit in the first two innings, but wound up allowing five hits and four earned runs over four innings. Holliday opened the scoring with a shot to center to lead off the second. Aaron Judge tacked on his 53rd RBI of the season in the third, scoring Brett Gardner, who doubled. Holliday sat out Saturday's game suffering from allergy symptoms. NOTES: Before rejoining his teammates in Oakland, New York LHP Aroldis Chapman had a rehab outing with Double-A Trenton on Friday. Chapman has seven saves in eight tries this season. ... Yankees top prospect SS Gleyber Torres, who has been sizzling at Triple-A Scranton, has been placed on the 7-day minor league disabled list with a hyperextended left elbow. Torres will undergo more evaluation on Monday. ... The A's fell to 4-12 on replay challenges this season after CF Jaycob Brugman's out call at second base was confirmed in the fourth inning on an attempted stealing. ... The 90-degree game-time temperature was the hottest for an A's home start since June 20, 2008. ... The Yankees (38-29) have lost a season-high six consecutive games, the longest current losing skid in the American League. Only National League teams Arizona and Los Angeles have not been swept this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED6JROI60V"},

Signs of faltering demand stoked weak sentiment, prompting price levels comparable to when the output cuts were first announced late last year. Brent crude futures were down 11 cents, or 0.23 percent, at $47.26 per barrel at 0035 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 11 cents, or 0.25 percent, at $44.63 per barrel. Prices for both benchmarks are down by almost 13 percent since late May, when producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) extended their pledge to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by an extra nine months until the end of the first quarter of 2018. Traders said that the main factor driving the low prices was a steady rise in U.S. production undermining the OPEC-led effort to tighten the market.  The U.S. oil rig count continued to rise, up by 6 last week ... Since its trough on May 27, 2016, producers have added 431 oil rigs,  Goldman Sachs said late on Friday. The U.S. bank said that if the rig count stayed at current levels, U.S. oil production would increase by 770,000 barrels per day between the fourth quarter of last year and the same quarter this year in the shale oil fields of the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara. Supplies from within OPEC and other countries officially participating in the cuts, like Russia, also remain high as some countries have not fully complied with their pledges. There are also indicators that demand growth in Asia, the world's biggest oil consuming region, is stalling. Japan's customs-cleared crude oil imports fell 13.5 percent in May from the same month a year earlier, to 2.83 million barrels per day, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday. India, which recently overtook Japan as Asia's second biggest oil importer, saw May's demand for oil fall by 4.2 percent in May, compared with the same month last year In China, which is challenging the United States as the world's biggest importer, oil demand growth has been slowing for some time, albeit from record levels, and analysts expect growth to slow further in coming months.  Reducing the glut of oil will be challenging,  ANZ bank said on Monday. (Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-idUSL3N1JG05W"},

There were no more immediate details on the blast in Diraz village, which is home to Ayatollah Isa Qassim and has been a flashpoint for violence. Five people were killed during a police raid on the village on May 23. The government said the aim of the raid in May was to arrest suspected militants and others wanted on security charges. At least 286 were detained as they confronted advancing police, who used tear gas and birdshot. Activists from the country's Shi'ite Muslim majority accused the Sunni-led authorities of using excessive force to intimidate the sect and its spiritual leader. A U.N. human rights chief has urged an investigation into the raid, which he called a crackdown on dissent. Qassim faces expulsion from the kingdom after authorities revoked his citizenship last year for alleged links to Iran and fomenting violence, charges he has denied.

It should make them relevant in the discussion about a return to the postseason. The Royals cut the margin to the leaders in the American League Central by three games during the trip, topped by Sunday's 7-3 rout of the Los Angeles Angels in the finale. The Royals had 10 hits on the day, the fourth time in five games with double-digit hits, and scored 52 runs on the nine-game West Coast swing, including 18 home runs. Jason Vargas won his 10th game of the season, the most in the AL, and the defense maintained its spot atop baseball for fewest errors. Gone is discussion of April, when the team went 7-16 and averaged 2.7 runs a game.  It's the same team, with the same guys,  said third baseman Mike Moustakas, who had a three-run double in the third, one of two big hits -- the other Salvador Perez's three-run home run in the fourth.  We're just playing better in every area and finally getting wins.  It should also turn talk into the division race and away from the team being broken up before the trade deadline. Moustakas, Eric Hosmer, Lorenzo Cain, Alcides Escobar and Vargas are all free agents and have been the subject of trade talks as other teams look to add pieces to their postseason hopes. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at AngelsKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchThe Royals know the talk won't stop.  People are going to say what they think, Moustakas said.  The big thing is that we don't care. These things are out of our control. We're just focused on winning as we always have. Everybody in this clubhouse loves being a Kansas City Royal. We love each other, love being here.   I know what this team is capable of,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  We feel good about this team. Even when we were winning a World Series, not a lot of people were talking about what a good team we were. I just don't pay attention to it.  Virtually every Royal has had a bat in this offensive run. Moustakas is hitting .360 in his last 13 games, with nine extra-base hits and 16 RBIs. He has 31 RBIs over the last 29 games. Perez was 3-for-5 Sunday to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. In that span, he has an extra-base hit in eight games, including five doubles and three home runs. Lorenzo Cain had a double and hit .416 on the trip with 13 runs scored, six home runs and 11 RBIs, and Eric Hosmer's sacrifice fly in the win was the 500th RBI in his career. He hit .323 on the trip and is hitting .350 since May 1. The Angels jumped on Vargas (10-3), who came in with a 2.10 ERA, for two runs in the first, but the one-time Angel settled down thereafter. He worked out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the sixth, allowing just a scoring fly ball. He allowed eight hits and walked two in six innings.  I thought Jason pitched great,  Yost said.  He was just a little off in the first inning but settled down and did what he's done all year. He labored a bit in the sixth but limited the damage. Angels center fielder Cameron Maybin singled to start the bottom of the first, extending his streak of reaching base to 23 consecutive games, and scored on Kole Calhoun's double off the top of a low fence in right field. Calhoun scored on an Andrelton Simmons single. The Royals took over in the third against Angels starter JC Ramirez (6-5). Rookie second baseman Ramon Torres doubled and Ramirez walked Cain and Hosmer on full-count pitches to load the bases. Moustakas sent all three home with a booming double to the right-field gap. Alex Gordon singled and Torres was hit to end Ramirez's day in the fourth. Reliever Kenyan Middleton fared no better, allowing a single to Jorge Bonifacio to load the bases, a scoring fly ball to Hosmer, and Perez's shot over the center field fence to make it 7-2. The Angels had 12 well-spaced hits and stranded nine. They are now 7-31 when they score three runs or less.  We have the guys capable of scoring more runs than we have,  shortstop Simmons said.  We get chances and we just don't string hits together.  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Ramirez pitched deep into a lot of counts early -- all six outs in the first two innings came on strikeouts -- and by the fourth inning he was up to 89. In comparison, Vargas went six innings and threw 94 pitches.  He had to work for every out, and (the walks) came on deep counts. It really came down to the Royals getting two big two-out hits,  Scioscia said. NOTES: The Angels begin an eight-game road trip Monday, three games at New York and Boston before returning to Southern California for two road interleague games against the Dodgers. ... The Royals return home for a brief six-game stand versus Boston and Toronto. ... Royals manager Ned Yost gave rookie second baseman Whit Merrifield the day off and started rookie Ramon Torres, his fourth appearance since being recalled. He was 2-for-4 and reached base three times....... Angels CF Mike Trout will make the Angels' road trip that starts in New York, near his New Jersey hometown. He hopes to get approval to start swinging a bat this week. He underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his thumb in late May. ... The Angels have a decision to make on the status of RHP Doug Fister. He was signed to a minor league deal with hopes of reviving career that paused when he didn't get an offer when he became a free agent after last season. He has allowed seven runs in 15 2/3 innings in three starts with Triple-A Salt Lake City. He has a June 21 opt-out date on his minor league deal. The Angels could grant his release or negotiate an extension of his minor league deal. Fister has a 77-76 record in eight seasons with four teams.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED6JROET0U"},

The dollar index against a group of major currencies was down 0.05 percent at 97.108. The index had climbed to a two-week high of 97.560 late the previous week after the Fed raised interest rates and kept the door open for another hike in 2017. But its rally was tempered by Friday's weaker-than-expected housing and consumer sentiment data. The market is looking to comments by New York Fed President William Dudley for potential support for the greenback. Dudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, is due to take part in a roundtable with local business leaders in Plattsburgh, New York.  In the wake of Friday's weak U.S. data, Dudley could provide insight into whether the Fed is still poised to continue normalising monetary policy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  My view is that Dudley won't sound too dovish, and thus allow the dollar's gradual rise to resume.  Dudley could help clarify why the Fed appeared to ignore a series of soft inflation readings as it marched on with tighter policy last week. The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 110.955 yen. It had set a two-week peak of 111.420 on Friday before its U.S. data-induced retreat. The euro was little changed at $1.1204 after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday. The pound was steady at $1.2777. Sterling has been confined to a narrow range over the past few days as political and economic worries have been counterbalanced largely by a split in the Bank of England's monetary policy committee on whether to immediately raise interest rates. The Australian dollar was flat at $0.7617, still in reach of a 2-1/2-month high of $0.7636 scaled on Wednesday thanks to upbeat local employment data.

The size of his majority - already assured according to official figures and set to be over 350 seats in the 577 seat lower house according to projections - means Macron and his year-old centrist party can now count on lawmakers to give his government powers to wave the reform through without lengthy negotiations in parliament. He has routed the left, yet he needs to handle France's muscular unions with care. At stake is not only the injection of flexibility into the labor market he has promised. The way he handles his labor reforms will also set the tone for more reforms in the coming years, including a revamp of jobless benefits and retirement systems. Though uneasy about Macron's program and fearful that it is being rushed, most unions are relieved his government has so far been careful to consult closely with them, and that it has promised to come up with detailed proposals in the coming weeks. The question now is whether he will keep taking their input on board, said Jean-Claude Mailly, head of France's third biggest union, Force Ouvriere (FO).  Is he going to say, 'you don't agree, well, I'm going to push (the reform) through by force'?,  Mailly asked in an interview with Reuters.  If so, one thing's for sure, his presidency is going to get off to a bad start on labor relations and there will be tensions,  he added. Even France's most reform-friendly and biggest private-sector union, the CFDT, refuses to rule out protests if its counter-proposals are ignored.  We reserve the possibility like everyone to give our point of view democratically. If we have to hold protests, we will. If we have to mobilize in companies, we'll do it,  CFDT head Laurent Berger told Reuters in an interview. Well-Chosen Minister Working in the government's favor is the fact that the unions know and respect new Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud, a former head of human resources at food group Danone who has also held a variety of posts in public and private institutions. That is a big difference from her predecessor Myriam El Khomri, who faced a steep learning curve when former President Francois Hollande tasked her with launching a previous labor reform that sparked weeks of strikes and protests. Not only is Penicaud no fresh-faced newcomer, her team is also steeped in the subtleties of French labor relations - with a head of staff from the national employers association and a deputy who was a top FO union negotiator. However, the leak in early June of a ministry document suggesting the reform could be more radical than previously floated left the government scrambling to assure unions that the paper was merely for reflection and not an official position. FILE PHOTO: French Force Ouvriere (FO) trade union head Jean-Claude Mailly arrives for a meeting about French labour law reforms at the Hotel Matignon in Paris, France, June 29, 2016.Jacky NaegelenNow, unions are anxiously awaiting detailed proposals, and they make no secret of their opposition in part or in full to some of the ideas outlined already.  The indispensable starting point has to be a period of sincere dialog. We'll see in the coming weeks if it's sincere,  the CFDT's Berger said. FO's Mailly said that the unions were all against a proposal to let employers call workplace referendums on labor issues, which he said amounted to  short-circuiting  the unions. Unions are also anxious about plans to allow for more decisions about labor conditions to be decided at the company level rather than the sector level, which would also potentially weaken unions. A further flashpoint is plans to set a limit on dismissal payouts that labor courts can order employers to pay. FILE PHOTO: French Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud arrives at the Elysee Palace to attend the weekly cabinet meeting in Paris, France, May 24, 2017.Benoit TessierUnion Unity? Although France's has one of the lowest rates of unionization among developed countries, unions have wielded considerable clout hammering out collective agreements that cover most employees. However, in recent years their sway has gradually ebbed as strikes have become less frequent, less disruptive and less successful. Division among the unions made it easier last year for Hollande to push through his more measured labor reform, which the CFDT supported but the Communist-rooted CGT unsuccessfully fought with weeks of strikes. While the other unions are working to coordinate their positions, there is still bad blood between members of the CGT and the CFDT, which earlier this year displaced the CGT has France's biggest private-sector union.   If (the CGT) sees a risk of becoming isolated, it will have to move closer to the other unions. But it is not clear it is ready to go down that path?  said Jean-Dominique Simonpoli, head of the Dialogues labor think tank and himself a former CGT member. The scale of Macron's victory may even inspire some hardliners to dig in for a tough fight to prove they remain relevant. Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the far left France Unbowed party, was among those promising a  social struggle  if Macron bulldozed workers' rights, which are cherished by many in France.  I hereby inform the new powers that be not a foot of ground will be given up in the labor law struggle,  Melenchon said in a fiery speech after winning a parliamentary seat for Marseille.

Larson's latest win came after he led nearly half of the 200-lap race.  I can't thank these guys enough,  Larson said.  The 3 Chevy was really, really fast, and it was cool to win it. What a great Father's Day present for myself and all the other fathers out there. My dad is here today, too, so I'm looking forward to celebrating with him.  We've been so close to so many other wins. This is our second Cup win of the year, but we've had six second-place finishes. All in all, it's a good season, so far, and we'll continue to keep building on what we've got.  Chase Elliott finished second for a third consecutive race at Michigan. Joey Logano was third, Denny Hamlin took fourth and Jamie McMurray rounded out the top five.  I am really proud of our effort today,  Elliott said.  I thought we way improved from where we were last year, as far as those late-race restarts go, and was able to hang with them and, really, just kind of rely on the guy behind you.  Larson and Martin Truex Jr. combined to lead all but six of the first 150 laps before a caution for a Ryan Sieg spin. Kyle Busch then took over by taking the lead with a two-tire pit stop. Larson had dropped back several positions early in the third stage that made up the final 90 laps of the race.  I think, restarted third or fifth that time and got loose off of (turn) two, and I got freight-trained down the backstretch,  Larson said.  Just really hard to restart on the bottom, unless you are on the front row and you can get clear of them. Just had to keep fighting all day.  After Martin Truex Jr. lost the lead to Busch, he dropped to the back of the top 10. But as Truex fell back, Larson recovered and eventually got back up to second. Larson took his final lead when a push from Ryan Blaney propelled him past Busch on a restart with under 20 laps remaining. The yellow flag waved two more times, for a Clint Bowyer wreck with 13 laps to go and again with nine laps remaining when Blaney didn't get up to speed on the previous restart and caused an accordion incident that also involved Kevin Harvick, Daniel Suarez and Danica Patrick. Truex got back up to sixth by the finish. Busch slid back to seventh. Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jimmie Johnson finished eighth through 10th. Truex won both of the two 60-lap stages that made up the first 120 laps of the 200-lap race, claiming his ninth and 10th stage wins through the first 15 races of the 2017 season. And in both of those stages, he claimed wins after passes on Larson.  We had the best car out there, without a doubt,  Truex said.  Just inside-lane restarts at the end killed us, so just stings when you have to race like that, you know? You get just in a bad spot, and there's nothing you can do about it. We seen it the last couple restarts, so just wrong place.  Probably should have took two tires that last time we pitted; we took four. That killed us. Just wrong lane on the restart every single time all day long and couldn't use the best car to win.  In the second stage, Truex got by Larson in the closing laps. Busch also passed Larson near the end of the second stage, relegating Larson to third. Matt Kenseth ran a close second to Larson through most of the second stage, but after Kenseth slid through his pit box during a green-flag cycle of stops on lap 108, he wound up trailing Larson by six seconds after the round of pit stops completed. He also lost positions -- second to Truex and third to Busch. Truex claimed the first-stage win after taking the lead from Larson on lap 35. Once Truex took the lead, he pulled away, building a margin of about four seconds over Larson, who finished second in the first stage after starting on the pole and leading the first 34 laps. In lapped traffic, though, Larson closed back up on Truex to finish the opening stage just two seconds back. Larson beat Truex off pit road between the first two stages to retake the lead for the start of stage two. While Larson led the opening laps, both Truex and Busch spent time right behind him in second, trading the second position back-and-forth. Clint Bowyer did get up to second on the restart that followed a lap-six debris caution, but Truex quickly retook the spot. NOTES: Jimmie Johnson, A.J. Allmendinger and Landon Cassill had to start in the back after going to backup cars because of separate practices on Saturday.

Yet with the current Big Three of the rankings -- Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day -- all making early exits outside the cut line, home-grown veteran Stricker was the uncontested crowd favorite at Erin Hills.  It was really cool,  Stricker told reporters about the stirring support he received all week and the final hole ovation at the state's first hosting of a U.S. Open. Yeah, I don't get those very often. So it was pretty cool to get that, and to play well today on top of it was extra special.  Stricker paid back his supporters on Sunday with a three-under-par 69 in windy conditions on the long, links-style layout. A 12-times winner on the PGA Tour and the U.S. captain for this autumn's Presidents Cup, Stricker was denied a request for a special exemption into the field and had to qualify.  I'm glad I made it here. I'm glad I qualified and was able to play. It was a pretty special week all around. We had a great time. My wife was on the bag. My kids were here. And it was a very special week to be here,  he said. Jun 18, 2017; Erin, WI, USA; Steve Stricker plays his shot from the eighth fairway during the final round of the U.S. Open golf tournament at Erin Hills. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY SportsIn the end, the 50-year-old Stricker marveled at the way the young, big hitters handled Erin Hills, which at around 7,800 yards was the longest course ever for a U.S. Open.  At the start of the week I was thinking five-under would maybe win this thing, and I was pretty far off,  he said.  I don't know if I have 14-under in my bag to play. These guys play a different game.  Without much wind until Sunday and with rains during the week softening the greens for long-distance approach shots, scores were lower than expected. Still, Stricker was struck by the players' power.  A three-wood 300 yards yesterday for Justin Thomas,  he said, referring to Thomas's approach to the par-five 18th that led to an eagle for a U.S. Open record score of nine-under 63.  I don't hit my driver 300 yards. These guys have a lot of firepower.  This is the new age of golf. They bomb it. If they hit it crooked, they'll bomb it again. They've got no fear and they're gutsy players, and they're little bulldogs and they're just relentless.

IHS Markit said its index measuring how households feel about their personal finances fell to 45.8 in June from 47.1 in May, the most pessimistic in three months and one of the lowest readings since the end of 2013. The firm's overall Household Finance Index, measuring how people feel about their current situation, rose to 43.8 from 42.6 but remained below the 50.0 no-change level. Britain's main measure of inflation hit 2.9 percent in May, its highest level in nearly four years after last year's Brexit vote hammered the value of the pound, and growth in wages is lagging behind, official data showed last week. That is eating into the spending power of consumers who typically drive British economic growth.  June’s survey reveals that UK household finances remain under intense pressure from rising living costs,  said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit.  While the squeeze moderated slightly since last month, worries about the outlook have deepened.  The survey also showed 58 percent of respondents expected higher interest rates in 12 months time, more than double the figure seen after the Bank of England cut interest rates last August following the Brexit vote. The BoE kept rates at their record low of 0.25 percent last week but three members of its eight-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rate hike, surprising investors and raising speculation that an increase in borrowing costs might come sooner than previously expected.

The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Mariners, and Texas lost for just the second time in nine games. Seattle did all its first-inning damage with two outs. Kyle Seager's RBI double got the Mariners on the board and started a big day for him. A passed ball scored Mitch Haniger from third, and Danny Valencia followed with a two-run homer into the Seattle bullpen to up the lead to 4-0. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at RangersSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchTexas got two of the runs back in the second on a two-run homer from Carlos Gomez off Christian Bergman (4-4). But those were the only runs Bergman allowed in his 5 2/3 innings as Texas managed just four hits off him. He struck out one and walked two. The Mariners tacked on a run against Darvish (6-5) in the third on a double from Seager, who went 3-for-5 with three doubles and three RBIs. Darvish, who came into the game with a 5-0 lifetime record against the Mariners at Globe Life Park, lasted just five innings and was charged with five runs on eight hits. He struck out six in matching his shortest outing of the season while getting the loss. The Rangers rallied in the seventh as Robinson Chirinos scored on a wild pitch. But with the bases loaded, Nick Vincent, the third Seattle pitcher in the seventh, got Nomar Mazara to fly out to center to cap a frame that included three walks, a hit batter, a balk and a wild pitch. Seager got that run right back in the top of the eighth, doubling home Robinson Cano. An Elvis Andrus throwing error scored Seager and provided the Mariners more insurance. Ben Gamel and Cano each had two hits for Seattle. Gomez went 1-for-3 with two RBIs and scored a run for Texas as six Seattle pitchers combined to hold the Rangers to just four hits. The Rangers went 0-for-1 with runners in scoring position, with that coming on the Mazara at-bat. NOTES: Seattle signed 1B Evan White, its top pick from last week's draft. White, from Kentucky, was the 17th overall pick in the draft. ...Texas is still undecided on a Tuesday starter against Toronto, but RHP Nick Martinez is expected to get the nod. ...Seattle promoted RHP Max Povse from Double-A Arkansas for bullpen depth. To make room for Povse, the Mariners sent RHP Rob Whalen to Triple-A Tacoma. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-rangers-recap-idUSMTZED6JROBH0T"},

The normally busy Andino mall was eerily quiet as people placed flowers on the main floor of the upscale retail center, which on Saturday afternoon was the scene of chaos and terror as the device exploded inside a toilet stall on the second floor. President Juan Manuel Santos denounced the  cowardly terrorist act  and offered a reward of 100 million pesos ($34,258) for information leading to capture of those responsible. He said investigators are working on three hypotheses but declined to provide any information while the probe is underway. No one has claimed responsibility for the deadly act.   The objective of terrorism is to sow fear, and our response to that is to show unity and bravery to confront it,  said Santos following a security council meeting with members of the armed forces and ministers.   Colombians must unite and show solidarity to confront such cowardly acts.   He asked residents to be vigilant but not let the attack cower them. Santos later visited Andino's food court to have lunch with his son.  Police said the device was placed behind a toilet bowl. Half a dozen forensic police dressed in white overalls were at the scene on the second floor as scores of uniformed officials and intelligence personnel scanned the mall.   One of the victims was a 23-year old French woman identified as Julie Huynh who had been volunteering in a poor area of the city. Colombians Ana Maria Gutierrez, 27, and Lady Paola Jaimes Ovalle, 31, also died. A fourth woman remains in intensive care.   It was incredible, I heard the explosion, but I never imagined that it was an attack, that it could be so horrible, I can't sleep,  said Maria Vasquez, 56, as she looked toward the door of the restroom on Sunday.

Children could have been hurt as they go to the toilet with their mothers,  said Pedro Alvarez, as he placed a paper flower at the information desk.  Many stores remained shut as people milled around in silence.  Photographs on social media late on Saturday showed a woman slumped against the wall in a pool of blood and what appeared to be a shard of metal piercing her back. In front of her was another woman with her leg torn apart above the knee.

Security has improved in Bogota over the past decade as police and military increased surveillance and put more armed officials on the streets. At one time all bags were checked at the entrance to shopping malls, but that has been vastly scaled back in recent years.  Bomb dogs still check cars at parking facilities in the capital. A peace accord signed last year with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's biggest guerrilla group, raised confidence bomb attacks might cease.  The country's second-largest insurgent group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), in February detonated a bomb in Bogota, injuring dozens of police. The Marxist ELN, currently negotiating a peace accord with the government, on Saturday condemned the attack against civilians. Authorities have said there have been threats of attacks in Bogota by the so-called Gulf Clan, a group of former right-wing paramilitary fighters who traffic drugs.

With Britain's negotiations on the terms of its departure from the EU set to begin on Monday, the country risks skills shortages and losing business if it ends freedom of movement without a new plan for attracting workers, the report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said.  If the Government does not provide a user-friendly, flexible and affordable immigration system for EU nationals post Brexit... significant numbers of employers will be forced to relocate or focus future growth outside the UK,  said Gerwyn Davies, CIPD labor market adviser.  With the Brexit negotiations starting this week, there is still little clarity on the immigration system that the UK will adopt after Brexit.  The report found that a quarter of organizations would be negatively impacted by a restriction on EU migrants to only those who have job offers.  And one in five businesses said that they would target future growth outside the UK or even relocate as a result of the Brexit vote. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said that the vote one year ago was partly a vote for Britain to control its borders, and has said that Britain will leave Europe's single market, as membership is incompatible with restricting immigration. However the report warned against the government targeting an arbitrary limit of the absolute numbers of migration, such as a pledge to bring immigration into the tens of thousands.  An overly blinkered approach focused on simply cutting immigration to tens of thousands and focusing only on high skilled employees could leave employers high and dry, especially those who rely on EU migrants to fill low-skilled jobs,  Davies said.

Edwin Encarnacion had three hits, including two home runs, and drove in each of Cleveland's five runs as the Indians left Minnesota with a 5-2 win on Sunday, a four-game series sweep and control of the American League Central.  We weren't playing very good team baseball before that last series (at home) and I think it was kind of a wake-up call,  Cleveland outfielder Bradley Zimmer said.  You look around and you realize, in my opinion, we have the best team in the league, and I think if we play up to our potential and everyone does what they've been doing and contributes offensively, defensively, guys in the bullpen, I think we'll be just fine.  Jose Ramirez had three hits on Sunday for his sixth straight multi-hit game for the Indians, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-5 before facing their division rivals. Related CoveragePreview: Indians at TwinsCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchCleveland began the weekend series trailing Minnesota by two games in the Central but left with a two-game lead after equaling their season high with a five-game winning streak. The Indians are 8-2 this season against the Twins, including a 7-0 mark at Minnesota's Target Field. Trevor Bauer (6-5) was lifted after a leadoff walk in the eighth. He gave up two runs on four hits and struck out eight batters. Cody Allen walked one, but kept the Twins off the board in the eighth and Andrew Miller recorded his first save of the season.  We just want to get back to playing how we know we're capable of playing,  Bauer said.  We haven't done that consistently this year, and we're working through a lot of things as a team trying to figure out what it's going to take to get us back to that. Standings are what they are. The only way they change is to go out there and win games, and in order to do that we've got to play how we know we can play.  Kyle Gibson (4-5) worked around trouble in six innings for Minnesota. He surrendered three runs on eight hits and three walks. The Twins trail the division leaders by more than one game for the first time since the beginning of May.  I think we just played a pretty good team that played well in the last game against L.A. and kind of got going a little bit, and came in here ready to play,  Gibson said.  I don't think the feeling really changes being down one or two games. I don't think that's a big deal to us. We've still got a lot of season to go and we're confident in who we are, confidence in the offense we have. If us pitchers can just keep rolling a little bit, throw the ball a little bit better, I think we'll be in a good spot.  Bauer kept Minnesota off-balance, using his fastball and snapping curve to give up just two hits and a walk through six innings. All three baserunners came in the second inning, but Max Kepler was thrown at home by Zimmer as the game remained scoreless. Bauer retired the next 15 batters he faced. He hit Kennys Vargas with a pitch with two outs in the seventh and Vargas scored on Eddie Rosario's single to center. The Twins had pitched around Encarnacion for much of the series, but he hammered the first pitch he saw in the fourth to the second deck in left field. Encarnacion followed with another second-deck shot in the sixth after Ramirez walked. Encarnacion added an RBI single in the seventh and a sacrifice fly to score Ramirez in the ninth.  Collectively, it's a frustrating series,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  You let four games go to, at least for now, your chief competitor. Somehow, we got to get past it and learn from it. They played better. There's no question, they did everything better.  I don't know if you want to use it as a measuring stick or whatever you want to do, but hopefully these guys learn what it takes to go out there and hopefully we're better for it.

Lynparza, which is already approved for ovarian and recently produced good results in breast cancer, is currently in clinical development against prostate tumors. Researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London said on Monday their new test was able to pick out which men with advanced disease were likely to benefit from the drug, while also checking that those taking it were responding.  In addition, the test can quickly detect if prostate cancer is evolving genetically and might be becoming drug-resistant. They hope this will allow Lynparza to become a standard weapon for advanced prostate cancer that would be targeted selectively at the men most likely to benefit. The development of the new test, details of which were reported in the medical journal Cancer Discovery, marks a step forward for so-called liquid biopsies, which involve simple blood sampling as opposed to an invasive tissue biopsy. AstraZeneca's drug, also known as olaparib, is the first in a new class of anti-cancer agents called PARP inhibitors that block enzymes involved in repairing damaged DNA, thereby helping to kill cancer cells. Lynparza - abandoned at one stage by AstraZeneca but revived by CEO Pascal Soriot when he took over in 2012 - became the first PARP drug to reach the market when it won U.S. approval for ovarian cancer at the end of 2014. It now faces competition from rival products made by Tesaro and Clovis Oncology that are also approved for ovarian cancer. The ICR team believe their test could potentially be adapted to monitor treatment with PARP inhibitors for other cancers.

Fuentes picked an opportune time to hit his first career home run, hitting a tiebreaking homer to dead center field in the top of the 10th inning to help the Diamondbacks complete a 5-4, come-from-behind win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.  It's very special,  Fuentes said.  Even more today since it's Father's Day, so shoutout to my father.  The Diamondbacks (44-26), completing a sweep of the Phillies (22-46), won their seventh straight. They're finding all different ways to do so. Trailing 4-3 entering the ninth, Arizona took advantage of Philadelphia closer Hector Neris, who had trouble locating his pitches. He walked Nick Ahmed to start the inning before giving up a single to David Peralta that allowed Ahmed to advance to third. Gregor Blanco followed Peralta with a single of his own to score Ahmed and knot the score at 4.  His split is hot and cold,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said of Neris.  For every two good ones he throws, he throws two bad ones. It's hard to figure out what he's doing. He walked that leadoff hitter and that's the guy that scored. He's tough to figure out.  Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at PhilliesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchThe ninth-inning comeback set up for Fuentes' heroics. Phillies reliever Jeanmar Gomez (3-2) was tasked with pitching the 10th. After getting a groundout to start the inning, Gomez left a changeup elevated and Fuentes hit his first home run in his 150th career plate appearance.  They were resilient,  Lovullo said.  We had a couple tough moments today and these guys didn't let that affect them. I said from the beginning, overcoming tough moments, cycling it through and then coming out the other end is something that winning teams do, and we do that very well. We didn't feel like we were out of the game at any point today.   We expect to win,  Fuentes said. Archie Bradley (3-1) picked up the win after working out of trouble in the bottom of the ninth. Fernando Rodney picked up his 20th save. The Phillies took the lead in the sixth when pinch-hitter Ty Kelly smashed a go-ahead double to break a 3-3 tie and give the Phillies a 4-3 lead. Initially, the double scored two, but the Diamondbacks challenged the call and shortstop Freddy Galvis was ruled out at home plate. Pat Neshek and Joaquin Benoit protected the one-run lead in the seventh and eighth, respectively, before Neris stumbled. Phillies starter Ben Lively became the first Phillies pitcher since 2001 to start his career with four consecutive quality starts. Lively struggled early. He allowed three runs in the first inning on two home runs, one by Paul Goldschmidt and one off the bat of Micah Owings. But he settled down, allowing just the three runs and eight hits. He walked one and struck out six. Arizona's Robbie Ray wasn't at his best. He allowed four runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked four and struck out seven. Ray entered Sunday having gone 5-0 in his last five starts, allowing just one run in 37 innings. But the Phillies solved him early and scored a run in each of the first three innings.  I think there might have been a little overall fatigue,  Lovullo said.  He was exerting a lot of energy early. It was very hot and humid out there. He had an at-bat where he had to run the bases. I just think he got a little winded and tired.  Aaron Altherr and Maikel Franco hit solo home runs in the first and second innings, respectively. The Phillies tied the score at 3 in the third on an Altherr groundout into a double play. While the Phillies were chipping away at Ray, Lively settled in. After the three-run first inning in which he threw 33 pitches, Lively surrendered just four hits in his next five innings, striking out five in the process. He entered the game with just five strikeouts this year. His outing, however, was wasted.  We couldn't hold the lead,  Mackanin said.  We're not putting up enough crooked numbers. We had opportunities to win that game.  NOTES: Phillies 1B Tommy Joseph extended his hitting streak to 14 games, the longest active streak in the majors, with a single in the fifth inning. ...

The figures are based on property advertised between May 14 and June 10, covering mostly the final weeks before a June 8 national election which saw Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lose her parliamentary majority. Rightmove said average asking prices for property sold on its website dropped 0.4 percent in June, normally a month which sees a seasonal price rise, after rising 1.2 percent in May.  The price of property coming to the market had increased in June in every year since 2009, so buyers' confidence has clearly been affected by inflation outstripping their pay packets and current political events,  Rightmove director Miles Shipside said. May has so far been unable to secure support for her Conservative Party from its most likely parliamentary ally, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. Figures last week showed consumer price inflation jumped to its highest in nearly four years at 2.9 percent in May - squeezing households' disposable income - while wage growth has lagged behind. In a move likely to make prospective home-buyers' even warier, three of the Bank of England's eight policymakers voted to raise interest rates last week, the closest the central bank has come to increasing borrowing costs since 2007. Prices in most of England and Wales rose, Rightmove said, but a 2.4 percent drop in London plus smaller declines in parts of central and southeastern England, weighed on the overall average. Compared with a year earlier, asking prices across Britain were 1.8 percent higher, the smallest annual increase since April 2013. Other house price measures have also shown price rises levelling off since Britain voted to leave the European Union almost a year ago. Mortgage lender Nationwide reported three successive monthly falls in house prices for the first time since 2009, while rival Halifax says annual growth is the lowest since 2013.

In the gritty northern coal town of Luliang, taxi and delivery drivers were queued up at a Sinopec outlet after it slashed pump prices by 1.4 yuan ($0.21) per liter, or nearly a quarter, one recent weekend.   We all know Sinopec has higher gas quality but it was so expensive, so before I went to independent stations to fill my vehicle,  one driver surnamed Zhang told Reuters as he waited to gas up his dusty, gray 7-seat van.  Now I switch to Sinopec and will keep visiting here as long as Sinopec offers discounts like this.  Nearby gas stations run by PetroChina and local private operator Taihua each offered the same discount, promoting the bargain prices with eye-catching red banners, free car washes, and credits in pre-paid petrol cards. Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said price cutting was  the most common approach in market competition . He didn't elaborate.  Rare Discounts Such basement prices are rare for Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS), and PetroChina, the listed subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation.  In late March, both were selling high grade fuel at a discount of just 0.20-0.40 yuan per liter.  FILE PHOTO: Banners showing discounts of gasoline prices are pictured at a Sinopec gas station in Qingdao, Shandong province, China March 27, 2017.Stringer As the independents deepened discounts to unbearable levels, Sinopec responded by launching targeted attacks to reclaim lost sales,  said a state oil marketing official. Price battles were rare before 2013 as rigid government price controls capped margins. As recently as 2010, gas stations rationed diesel fuel as shortage hit.    But the plunge in global oil prices since 2014 and the sudden rise of independent refineries known as teapots transformed the market by flooding the country's 90,000 petrol stations with cheaper fuels. Short of retail infrastructure and barred from exports, teapots sell oil mostly to the country's 40,000-plus private petrol stations, many run by families or independent fuel dealers   The huge surplus the teapot oil plants have created is eroding the 80-percent market share the two oil giants used to hold several years ago,  said Yan Kefeng, veteran oil researcher with IHS Markit.  Sinopec and PetroChina now control around two-thirds of retail sales and independents about a quarter, according to Yu Chang, a former retail director with Shell China and the founder of AutoGo, a fuel retailing e-platform.  The battle has also drawn in global players such as BP, Shell, Total (TOTF.PA) and Exxon (XOM.N). Foreign firms now own and operate nearly 4,000 stations accounting for about 8 percent of sales, mostly in joint-ventures with Sinopec or PetroChina.   There has been price volatility in the fuel retailing market with seasonal demand and supply changes,  Shell wrote in an email. Shell has rapidly boosted its retail network in China and now has a total of 1,200 sites.  Margin Hit While margins have taken a hit, Sinopec and PetroChina are far from losing money in their retail businesses, thanks to their market dominance in key consuming regions in the south and east where there is little need for discounts and wealthier motorists are less sensitive to price cuts.  Compared to 5.24 yuan a liter in Luliang, Beijing motorists pay around 6.66 yuan for 95-octane, euro-5 quality gasoline. Beijing prices are some 12 percent above the premium gasoline in California, but about half that of Singapore prices.    Sources at rivals say Sinopec may also be leading the charge as it aims to stem falling retail fuel sales and bolster its retail business ahead of a planned multi-billion-dollar IPO.  Even with the hit in sales, Sinopec's network of 30,000 fuel stations and more than 23,000 convenience stores is considered a jewel in the crown. The division is estimated by analysts to be worth as much as $58 billion. Reporting by Beijing newsroom and Chen Aizhu","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-petrol-idUSL3N1JC28Z"},

Faria joined a couple of small lists in the history books Sunday when he took advantage of five Tampa Bay home runs, led by Steven Souza Jr.'s first career grand slam, to become 3-0 after his first three starts in the majors. Logan Morrison tagged two home runs as the Rays defeated the Detroit Tigers, 9-1. After the game, the Tigers optioned starting pitcher Buck Farmer (2-1) to the minors. Faria became just the fifth pitcher since at least 1913 to win his first three starts in the majors with one or less runs in at least six innings. He joined Jeremy Hellickson as the only Tampa Bay pitcher to win his first three starts with a seven-inning outing in which he allowed six hits, walked one and struck out nine with his low-90s fastball and sharp-breaking slider. Faria joined Andy Rincon (St. Louis, 1990), Wayne Simpson (Cincinnati, 1970), Stu Miller (St. Louis, 1952) and Alex Main (Detroit, 1914) as the only pitchers to win their first three major league starts allowing one or fewer runs while pitching at least six innings.  Jake Faria just continues to get it done,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  I don't think it was very easy for him. There was a lot of 'fell behind.' He didn't get ahead of a ton of hitters like maybe we saw in his previous two starts. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at TigersTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch But he found a way to get back into the count and make pitches. That's pretty telling and shows a lot about a young pitcher, being able to do that.  It's not the easiest thing in the world to pitch with a big lead. Because everybody's sitting there saying. 'Just throw strikes, throw it over the plate.'  When you start doing that and not focusing on the pitch that you're trying to attack with, that's when the lead goes from 7-1 to 7-4. Especially with this lineup. They get a couple of guys on base anybody can hit it out of the park.  Detroit now departs for a series at Seattle and then San Diego following a homestand that ended 2-4 and frustrated Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.  It was a crappy homestand quite frankly,  he said.  We gotta play better than this. I gotta manage better, we gotta coach better, we gotta play better, we gotta hit better, we gotta pitch better. Simple. We're not going to make any strides if we keep playing like this.  We need to play better.  It's similar to last year. Similar every year I've been here, where we get off to a good start and we kind of tread water for a while.  We do need to get on that run. We haven't hit it yet. I've been pretty steadfast in saying, as much as I want to go on the run and as frustrating it can be that it hasn't happened, I still believe that it will.  Chase Whitley pitched the eighth and Tommy Hunter the ninth for Tampa Bay. Morrison's two home runs put him at 21 for the season. His first was a two-run blast to right in the first and the second a solo shot in the seventh. Farmer served up two home runs in the third inning as the Rays jumped out to a 7-1 lead. Derek Norris lined a flat 1-2 slider over the left-center field fence leading off the inning for his eighth home run. Farmer gave up five hits and a walk plus a hit batter in 2 1/3 innings. Corey Dickerson singled to left, Evan Longoria was hit by a pitch, Morrison walked and Souza Jr. hit a 2-2 slider over the fence in left center for his first career grand slam and 13th home run this season. Justin Upton lined a single to center with two outs in the first for Detroit's first run. Alex Avila singled and Miguel Cabrera walked ahead of Upton's hit. Dickerson singled with one out in the first and one out later Morrison lined a 1-2 pitch off the metal fencing atop the wall in right to stake the Rays to a 2-0 lead. Longoria belted his 10th home run of the season with one out in the seventh off reliever Chad Bell and was followed on the next pitch by Morrison's second homer of the game. NOTES: RHP Anibal Sanchez will be brought back from a voluntary minor league assignment Monday night to start for Detroit at Seattle. It's his first start of the season for the Tigers. ... Tampa Bay C Wilson Ramos (ACL surgery) didn't play Sunday after catching back-to-back games for the first time during his rehab stint.  We're getting closer,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  We're getting excited.  ... 2B Daniel Robertson is the first rookie Rays middle infielder to have at least two hits and two RBIs in consecutive games since Josh Wilson in 2007.

But in every other way, he has turned into a throwback ace pitcher for the New York Mets. DeGrom followed up a complete-game victory by earning the win with eight innings of three-hit ball Sunday, when he homered for the New York Mets' first run in a 5-1 victory over the Washington Nationals at Citi Field. The win allowed the Mets (31-37) to avoid being swept in the four-game series by the division-rival Nationals. Of the last nine wins deGrom has earned since last July, seven have come after a New York loss.  Those kind of guys, they stop losing streaks,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  You lose three in a row, who shows up? Jake deGrom. And that means a lot, because when he's out there, the offense kind of relaxes a little knowing, hey, look, we don't have to score a ton. We just have to score a few runs and he's going to hold them.  On Sunday, all the Mets needed was one more run than deGrom produced himself. DeGrom, who played shortstop in college before converting to pitcher upon being drafted by the Mets in 2010, led off the third with a game-tying opposite-field homer to left.  I was running pretty hard, so now, I didn't know it was gone,  deGrom said with a grin.  But that's where I seem to hit baseballs in batting practice, so I knew if I got it over there, it would have a chance.  Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at MetsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchDeGrom, who allowed an unearned run in the first, was at his best after the homer. He retired 15 of the 17 batters he faced over his final five innings, a stretch in which he allowed just four balls to leave the infield and began to entertain thoughts of a second straight complete game. DeGrom tossed a five-hitter for his second major-league complete game Monday night, when the Mets beat the Chicago Cubs, 5-1. On Sunday, he threw just 50 pitches between the fourth and seventh, including six pitches in the sixth, to reach the eighth at 94 pitches. An 11-pitch eighth, during which pinch hitter Stephen Drew singled for the Nationals' first hit since the third, ended any hopes of going the distance. DeGrom -- who underwent Tommy John surgery shortly after being drafted and threw more than seven innings just twice in 58 minor league starts -- was lifted after throwing 105 pitches, a call he didn't argue with even though he said Monday he expects to pitch a complete game every time.  I definitely would have liked to finish that game,  said deGrom, who walked two and struck out six.  But it was hot out there today and I definitely think that's the right call.  Addison Reed allowed one hit in the ninth in a non-save situation as the Mets pulled within 10 1/2 games of the National League East-leading Nationals (42-27).  We knew (deGrom) was going to be tough going into today because they didn't want to be swept at home,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.  You've got to put it on deGrom. He even helped himself out.  The Mets took the lead in the fourth when Lucas Duda singled, went to second on T.J. Rivera's single and scored when Matt Wieters dropped the throw home on Travis d'Arnaud's single. Michael Conforto followed with an RBI single. Conforto had another RBI single in the sixth for the Mets, who completed their scoring with a run-scoring single by Curtis Granderson in the seventh. Rivera had four hits for the Mets. The Nationals scored their run in the first, when Brian Goodwin reached on an error by Wilmer Flores, took second on a single by Bryce Harper, advanced to third on a passed ball and scored on Ryan Zimmerman's sacrifice fly. Trea Turner tied a Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise record with four stolen bases. He is the first player to achieve the feat since the team relocated from Montreal in 2005. Turner is tied for second in the National League with 25 stolen bases. He credits Nationals first base coach Davey Lopes, who stole 557 bases in his career, for his success on the basepaths.  He gives you the confidence to run, but that's something I've never really had,  Turner said. Right-hander Joe Ross (3-3) took the loss after allowing four runs (two earned), nine hits and one walk while striking out four in six innings. NOTES: The Nationals placed RHP Shawn Kelley (right trapezius strain) on the 10-day disabled list and recalled RHP A.J. Cole from Triple-A Syracuse. ... SS Trea Turner is the first Nationals/Expos player to steal four bases in a game since OF Marquis Grissom did it on July 21, 1992. ...

Making his first start since May 22 after being demoted to the bullpen, Jimenez (2-2) kept the Cardinals' lineup in check. Over the course of a 106-pitch performance in sweltering heat and humidity, he allowed a pair of earned runs on four hits to earn his first victory since April 19. He struck out three and walked four.  He was good,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  I can't tell you how few pitchers in baseball would have pitched seven innings in that type of weather.

The Orioles finished the three-game series with 10 home runs, which is the most they have hit in a series this season. Smith, the leadoff man, put the Orioles (34-34) in front right away by knocking a 3-2 pitch from Lynn over the wall in center.

Most victims were caught in their vehicles on the road while fleeing flames that were destroying their homes. The prime minister said the death toll could rise as firefighters inspected charred remains of some buildings in remote villages. Police said a lightning strike on a tree probably caused the blaze on Saturday in a region hit by an intense heat wave and dry, gusty winds, which has fanned the flames. The prime minister said the emergency services acted as fast as they could but acknowledged that some of the efforts like alerting the population might have been hindered because the blaze had ruined phone lines and communications towers.  What happened was cables and communications towers were destroyed by the fire, even their first replacements melted,  he said.  But nothing compromised the firefighting efforts.  Most communications have been restored, but Costa called on residents listen to the radio and heed any official advice. The government declared three days of mourning and sent two army battalions to help the emergency services. The European Union said it would provide firefighting aircraft. France has offered three planes and Spain has sent two, authorities said. Speaking in the Vatican, Pope Francis, who visited Portugal last month, mentioned the victims in his weekly address.

He had struck out eight batters while allowing one run to that point -- and only needed 106 pitches to do it -- so Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell gave Nelson a shot at the team's first complete game since 2015.  It was pretty cool going out there and they played the walk-out song, which was kind of neat,  Nelson said.  But at the same time, you have to take a step back and not let your adrenaline take over. You have to relax and don't try to do too much, try not to overthrow and execute your pitches.  Nelson (5-3) did just that, adding two more to his strikeout total for the day, and locked down the first complete game of his career as the Brewers beat the San Diego Padres 2-1.  All the credit is for him,  said catcher Manny Pina, who helped Nelson's cause with a go-ahead home run in the sixth inning.  Every inning, he was talking between innings. He was explaining to me a little what he was trying to do every time. So when I hit that ball, I told him, 'Hey, this is your chance to win the game. Let's do this.'  Related CoveragePreview: Padres at BrewersSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchWhile Nelson was dealing, the Brewers' offense was failing to make the most of early opportunities against Padres starter Luis Perdomo. Milwaukee put runners in scoring position in four of the first five innings but had nothing to show for it thanks to three double plays by the Padres. They finally broke through in the sixth on solo home runs from Hernan Perez and Pina.  We should have scored more runs, frankly,  Counsell said.  We left some opportunities out there that we needed to cash in on. I thought we had an opportunity for more runs, that's for sure. But the home runs were big. That's how we're scoring right now.  Perdomo (1-4) gave way to a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning after holding Milwaukee to two run, eight hits and two walks while striking out four in six innings.  It was a battle,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  I thought he did a great job getting out of some really threatening innings and just giving up the two solo home runs. He was in trouble in the first, the second, the third, the fifth. He navigated a lot of trouble today.  Some good defense behind him. That was a great catch by Franchy Cordero out in center field. He ran a long way to make that catch. A really nice double play to get out of the earlier inning as well.  He didn't throw strike one as much as I would have liked to have seen. But I thought, overall, he gave us a chance to win a baseball game. He did a good job battling.  Nelson, meanwhile, kept on going. He batted for himself in the seventh and came back out for the eighth inning at 96 pitches. He struck out Cordero to open the inning and served up a single to Wil Myers. But he was bailed out when Yangervis Solarte chopped into a double play to end the inning. In the ninth, Nelson got Hunter Renfroe looking for the first out and Cory Spangenberg followed by lining out to first. Erick Aybar was next and struck out on three straight pitches, clinching the complete game for Nelson and the Brewers' first series victory since sweeping the Mets on May 12-14.  He certainly got better as the game went along,  Counsell said.  That's why I kept putting him back out there. I felt like he got better as the game went. The command improved. He was pounding the zone for strikes. He earned his way out there the last couple of innings, that's for sure.

When they get hit in the mouth, at that time they'll know what's going on.  Khamenei and other senior Iranian officials have ramped up their criticism of the United States in recent weeks after Trump went on an official visit last month to Saudi Arabia, Iran's main regional rival.  During that visit, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. He has also criticized the nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers, including the United States, that led to the lifting of most sanctions against Iran, in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. Trump has said Washington would review the deal but stopped short of pledging to scrap it. Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and enmity to Washington has long been a rallying point for hardline supporters of Khamenei in Iran. Khamenei has accused the United States and its regional ally Saudi Arabia of funding hardline Sunni militants, including Islamic State, which carried out its first attack in Iran earlier this month, killing 17 people. Riyadh has denied involvement in the suicide bombings and gun attacks on Iran's parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Khamenei said in his speech on Sunday that any efforts to destabilize the Islamic Republic would not succeed.

The outcome falls well short of the National Front's (FN) target of a  massive  presence in parliament and also misses its objective of having enough troops to form a parliamentary group, meaning its voice in the lower house will be limited. Nevertheless, the anti-establishment party fared better than pollsters forecast over the past few days and has a greater presence in parliament than the past five years, when it had only two MPs. Only a month ago the anti-immigration FN leader challenged Macron for the presidency in a run-off vote that underlined the widespread disillusion with mainstream parties. Her defeat was cheered by European leaders who had feared another populist upheaval in the wake of Britain's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president.  On Sunday she was swift to say the record-high abstention rate in the parliamentary election weakened Macron's legitimacy.  We shall fight with all our strength the harmful projects of the government, which is only in place to implement the roadmap sent by Brussels,  she said in a televised address in her northern fiefdom of Henin-Beaumont. But without enough lawmakers to form a parliamentary group -- a target both the party itself and observers until recently expected it to meet -- the FN will little speaking time in the chamber, no say over parliament's agenda and its committees, and fewer financial resources than other parties.  Turbulent Times Ahead  Le Pen's failed presidential bid opened up rare public infighting among senior party lieutenants, of which there was further evidence on Sunday night and which is likely to intensify now that the parliamentary election is over.

We should not claim victory because we suffered quite a blow,  said Collard, who won his seat by a mere 123 votes.  We are going to need to think seriously about ... how we are organized.  One key issue will be the party's stance on the euro currency.  FILE PHOTO: French deputy Gilbert Collard attends a French National Front (FN) political debate in Paris, France November 8, 2016.Jacky NaegelenA fierce nationalist, Le Pen stuck during the presidential run-off race to promises to exit the euro currency, long at the heart of her economic platform, even though most French citizens and some of her top allies like Collard oppose the move. The FN's elected lawmakers represent both sides of that debate even if Le Pen's deputy Florian Philippot, who was a key architect of the anti-euro manifesto, failed to get elected. She has promised to overhaul the party and debate issues like the single currency.   There are turbulent times ahead for the FN,  said Nice university researcher Gilles Ivaldi, a specialist of the FN.  The FN managed to minimize its losses, which wasn't a given but there are a lot of difficulties ahead ... the party is divided ideologically.  The FN will hold a major congress at the end of this year or beginning of next.     Those elected alongside Le Pen include her partner Louis Aliot in the south-west and, in the north, Sebastien Chenu, the head of the  Idea-Image  cell that was key to her presidential campaign strategy.

Phillips, an Atlanta native who joined the club this spring, responded with the game-winning walk-off hit for the second straight game. On Sunday, he poked a single through a five-man infield in the ninth inning lift the Atlanta Braves to a 5-4 win over the Miami Marlins  (Saturday) was crazy, but today was one of those epic things,  Phillips said moments after being drenched with blue liquid during a postgame television interview.  I never thought I'd have back-to-back walkoffs.  The heroics came with his father, James, and two of his children in the stands for Father's Day.  I was just looking for a ball out over the plate so I wouldn't roll over it and hit into a double play,  Phillips said.  When that inning started, I thought, 'Oh, snap, I think I'm going to do it again. I'm going to have another chance. That would be nice, especially on Father's Day.'  The last Atlanta player with game-ending RBI in back-to-back games was Ozzie Virgil on Sept. 18-19, 1988. The rally began against Miami rookie Drew Steckenrider (0-1) when Johan Camargo reached on a one-out single that third baseman Derek Dietrich could not field. Ender Inciarte lobbed an opposite-field single to left, sending Camargo to third. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BravesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchThe Marlins brought left fielder Marcell Ozuna in for an extra infielder, but Phillips found a hole between shortstop J.T. Riddle and the second base bag that drove in Camargo with the winning run. It was the eighth career walk-off hit for Phillips and the 11th time Atlanta has won a game in its last at-bat this season.  I've been talking about these guys for a long time,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  You keep the game manageable and these guys have a knack of figuring out a way to win. If we can stay in one, I like our chances.  Atlanta (31-37) won two of three games in the series and moved ahead of Miami (30-38) into second place in the National League East. Steckenrider, who went to high school in Atlanta, was placed in a tough situation because of Miami's depleted bullpen. It was only his fourth major league appearance and first in a high-pressure situation.  Probably a tough situation for (Steckenrider) to be in today,  Miami manager Don Mattingly said.  The bullpen gets to a point where you use a lot of guys, so he's in that situation today. Still, he's got to throw strikes. He's calm out there, so it's not really a bad situation, just not so good right now.  The winning pitcher was Jim Johnson (5-1), who pitched a scoreless ninth inning in relief. Neither starting pitcher received a decision. Atlanta right-hander Mike Foltynewicz bounced back from his worst outing of the season -- eight runs in 3 1/3 innings against Washington -- to give up two innings over six innings. Foltynewiciz allowed seven hits and two walks, with four strikeouts and received no decision. Miami's Jose Urena, who was seeking his fifth straight win, pitched six innings and allowed two runs on three hits and two walks, with four strikeouts. Urena retired 12 of 13 batters from the second through fifth innings. The Marlins broke through for two runs in the sixth inning against Folytnewicz. With one out, Justin Bour ripped an 0-2 pitch just out of the reach of Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson to drive in Dee Gordon and Christian Yelich. Atlanta scored four times in the seventh to take a 4-2 lead. Rio Ruiz had a sacrifice fly, Johan Camargo drove in a run with a pinch-hit single and Nick Markakis added a two-run opposite-field single. Miami tied the game a 4-4 against reliever Jose Ramirez in the eighth inning. Christian Yelich walked and Ozuna hit a long two-run homer, his 18th, into the visitor's bullpen in left field.  Recently we've been scoring,  Mattingly said.  Since the end of May, we've been playing really well, being pretty good offensively.  Both teams wasted early opportunities. Atlanta loaded the bases with no out in the second inning, but the bottom of the order couldn't provide an RBI. Miami had runners on the corners with one out in the third when Giancarlo Stanton struck out into a double play, with J.T. Riddle being erased in a rundown while trying to score from third base. NOTES: Atlanta LF Matt Kemp returned to the starting lineup. He left the game on June 14 with left hamstring tightness and missed two starts. ... Miami RHP Jose Urena tied a club record when he hit three batters on Sunday. It was the 10th time it has occurred, the last coming on May 27, 2016, when Adam Conley hit three Braves. ... Miami CF Christian Yelich extended his season-best hitting streak to nine games with a single in the fourth inning. ... Marlins 2B Dee Gordon now has an eight-game hitting streak in Atlanta. ...

Justin Turner hit a three-run homer, Logan Forsythe added a two-run shot, and left fielder Enrique Hernandez made a game-saving catch in the eighth inning, helping the Dodgers hold on for an 8-7 victory over the Reds on a wild Father's Day afternoon at Great American Ball Park. The Dodgers (44-26) swept the Reds at Great American Ball Park for the first time since August 2015 and have beaten them eight straight times dating to last season.  It got a little close for us,  said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  Our bullpen has been lights out all year. Like I've been saying, (the Reds) have a really good offensive club. They put together some good at-bats. To get out of here with three (wins) is huge.  The Dodgers led 8-1 in the sixth, but the Reds rallied back against their bullpen. Adam Duvall hit a solo shot in the sixth off Grant Dayton, Scooter Gennett added a three-run homer in the seventh off Josh Fields, and Eugenio Suarez went deep off Pedro Baez in the eighth to cut the deficit to 8-6. Billy Hamilton's two-out, RBI double also in the eighth made it a one-run game. Then, with two runners on, Joey Votto made a bid to put the Reds ahead with a deep drive to left field. But Hernandez made the catch before colliding with the wall to end the inning. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at RedsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchJansen closed out the win in the ninth for his 15th save to complete the three-game sweep. Cincinnati (29-39) has lost a season-high nine straight games, its longest streak since an 11-game skid in May of last year.  We made it a game, but hats off to the Dodgers,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  They won the game. We didn't lose it. It ended up being a better game -- a more entertaining game -- than anybody anticipated.  Los Angeles homered seven times in the series. Kenta Maeda (5-3) started for the Dodgers on Sunday and allowed one run and only three hits with a walk and five strikeouts.  The team wanted me to be aggressive and the pound the zone and that's what happened,  Maeda said, via an interpreter.  I was able to get into a rhythm and didn't change my plan with runners on base.  The story for Cincinnati following Sunday's game was the possibility that it was the final appearance for 40-year-old right-hander Bronson Arroyo, who missed more than two seasons following elbow and shoulder surgeries. Arroyo lasted only three innings, with five earned runs on seven hits with no walks and three strikeouts. Following the game, Arroyo revealed he's been experiencing shoulder soreness.  We tried to patch it up and it worked for a while, but I've been hit around the yard for a while now,  Arroyo said.  It gets stiff. The cortisone isn't working anymore. Have I thought 'This time might be my last time on the field'? Yeah.  Arroyo (3-6) who gave up nine earned runs in his last start including a six-run second inning, struck out three batters in the first inning on Sunday. After getting two quick outs in the second inning, things unraveled for him. Austin Barnes singled, Hernandez doubled, then Maeda lined a double to left driving in two runs to put the Dodgers in front 2-0. Joc Pederson's RBI single made the score 3-0. Forsythe launched a 2-1 pitch from Arroyo into the left-center field bleachers to give the Dodgers a five-run lead. It was his second home run this season. Maeda retired the first nine batters he faced before Billy Hamilton led off the third with a single. A one-out walk to Joey Votto and single by Adam Duvall loaded the bases with one out. Maeda hit Scott Schebler to drive in a run. But Yasiel Puig's sliding grab of Eugenio Suarez's hard liner to right helped Maeda escape the inning with just the one run allowed. The Dodgers scored eight runs after two outs, including Turner's three-run homer off Wandy Peralta in the sixth. It was Turner's third homer this season. That proved to be enough offense for the Dodgers.  The ballclub is playing really well,  said Jansen.  Every day, someone else is stepping up. We're doing a great job, just need to keep it up.

The frontier runs for 104 km (65 miles) through farmland, woods and low hills, in an area known as the Suwalki Gap. If seized by Russia, it would cut off Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Over two days, U.S. helicopters and British aircraft took part in exercises that also involved troops from Poland, Lithuania and Croatia in a simulated defense of the potential flashpoint.  The gap is vulnerable because of the geography. It's not inevitable that there's going to be an attack, of course, but ... if that was closed, then you have three allies that are north that are potentially isolated from the rest of the alliance , U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges told Reuters. Russia denies any plans to invade the Baltics, and says it is NATO that is threatening stability in Eastern Europe by building up its military presence there and staging such war games. But Hodges, who commands U.S. forces in Europe, said it was crucial for the alliance to show it was ready.  We have to practice, we have to demonstrate that we can support allies in keeping (the Gap) open, in maintaining that connection,  he said. U.S. army soldiers leave Black Hawk helicopter during Suwalki gap defence exercise in Mikyciai, Lithuania, June 17, 2017.Ints KalninsGame Changer Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in the Black Sea has changed NATO's calculations, seeing Russia increasingly as an adversary. Before then, no forces from other alliance members were stationed in the Baltic states; now four battlegroups totaling just over 4,500 troops have been  deployed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The Poles have been pushing other NATO allies to use some of these troops to secure the vulnerable Suwalki corridor and deter potential Russian aggression. But while 1,500 troops took part in this weekend's exercises, a Lithuanian commander cautioned that it would take more to defend the gap in the event of a genuine conflict. Slideshow (6 Images) This is only a small-scale drill compared to what would be needed in case of a real attack, but it is important for us because it shows that allies share our worries , said Brigadier General Valdemaras Rupsys, head of Lithuania's land forces.          Simulating a covert insertion of forces, three American helicopters landed in a field in rural Lithuania on Saturday, startling grazing horses and cows, in an area several hours' drive from where a U.S. battalion is stationed at Orzysz base in Poland.  The training helps present a credible defense force that hopefully will deter aggression, but if not, we'll be prepared to move to defend the borders of NATO,  said Lt. Col. Steven Gventer, who leads the U.S. battlegroup in Orzysz. NATO officials believe Moscow will hold its own exercise in Russia and Belarus on a much greater scale in September, possibly involving 100,000 troops, under the codename  Zapad  (West). Baltic officials believe Moscow will also rehearse an attack on the Suwalki Gap during Zapad.  I think it's important for the soldiers to train on land that they may have to defend some day,  said Major General John Gronski, deputy commander, U.S. Army Europe, observing the exercise in Lithuania.

Oracle had entered the series with a one-point advantage from an earlier regatta, which New Zealand wiped out after winning the first race on Saturday. The Kiwi team continued to excel in light-wind sailing and again showed superior speed and slick maneuvers, whipping their 50-foot foiling catamaran around the course at a maximum speed of 38.5 kph.

Both teams sailed well on Sunday, with fewer obvious mistakes than in Saturday's races, and the differences in performance came down to pure speed.   Slideshow (3 Images) Today was a really good day for us and we feel like we improved a lot on yesterday,  Burling told a news conference.  The New Zealand team are a fast, well-oiled machine with their aerodynamic pod of four 'cyclor' sailors, who supply the energy needed to power the boat's massive wing sail by pedaling on bikes.  The team's light wind expertise is due in part to an efficient package of hydrofoils that lift the boat out of the water at high speed.  The Kiwis have geared up very well, their light air package with their rudders and their foils are very efficient in that light wind,  said Jonathan ‘Jono’ Macbeth, sailing team manager and grinder for Britain's Land Rover BAR,  The Kiwi's control system, which is manned by skipper Glenn Ashby, means that they can also be fast and accurate going into maneuvers and coming out.  Oracle Team USA's track record of performing when their backs are against the wall and the intervening five days should set up a fascinating showdown to the competition as both teams race to modify their boats and improve performance.  There’s a long, long way to go in this regatta and, as we saw last time in San Francisco, things can change very quickly,  said Macbeth, whose team lost to New Zealand in an earlier round.

At around 12:45 a.m. on June 18 as a vehicle belonging to the Central Security Forces transported a group of officers and conscripts an improvised explosive device planted on the roadside went off,  the ministry said.  This led to the martyrdom of First Lieutenant Ali Abdelkhaliq and the injury of four others, an officer and three conscripts, who have been taken to hospital for treatment.  A recently emerged Egyptian militant group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on its Telegram messaging account late on Sunday.  The Hasm movement, which has claimed several attacks in Cairo in recent months, said today's attack is to  emphasize that the central security forces targeted today have received a part of the punishment for what they have committed.  Hasm, the Arabic word for decisiveness, has accused security forces of killing  peaceful protesters  and  assaulting and oppressing  protesters who have demonstrated against the plan to cede two inhabited Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, the statement added.  The group said the executors of Sunday's attack have returned safely to their bases and promised to carry out more attacks in the coming days. Parliament voted on Wednesday to back a treaty to handover the two uninhabited islands of Tiran and Sanfir and Sisi is expected to ratify the decision soon. The plan triggered street protests over the past few days from a small groups of Egyptians, who say their country's sovereignty over the islands dates back to a treaty from 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded. The bomb was detonated remotely, and an initial examination suggested it was detonated using a mobile phone SIM card, a senior Interior Ministry official told state news agency MENA.  A joint task force made up of several police units is questioning tenants of flats overlooking the site of the attack to try to identify and arrest the culprits, the official said. Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State group in the restive Sinai Peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013.  The group has also increasingly carried out attacks in the mainland on security forces and Coptic Christian civilians in recent months, killing around 100 Copts since December. Other militant groups such as Hasm, which the government says are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, are active in Cairo and other cities where they have targeted security forces, judges, and pro-government figures. The Brotherhood, outlawed in 2013 after the military ousted one of its leaders, Mohamed Mursi, from the presidency following mass protests, maintains that it is a peaceful organization. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the general who led Mursi's ouster, was elected president in 2014.

Opponents had urged voters not to allow so much power to be concentrated in the hands of one party and warned Macron's lawmakers would serve simply as an army of 'godillots', or yes men. Macron says they reflect French society. Here are some of his candidates who are newcomers to national politics and won seats. Herve Berville, Economist Herve Berville, 27, is a Rwandan-born economist who survived the east African country's 1994 genocide and was adopted by a French family in Brittany, western France. The London School of Economics masters graduate with an easy smile will break the mold in a national assembly long dominated by white men. Berville won 64 percent of the vote, trouncing his conservative rival.   The challenges that await us are immense. Our country needs a clear majority so that the government can act,  Berville appealed in one Facebook posting ahead of the second round. Mounir Mahjoubi, Tech Entrepreneur In his run for parliament, Mounir Mahjoubi, the 33-year-old son of Moroccan immigrants, saw off Socialist Party chief Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, who had held Paris' working class 19 arrondissement seat for two decades. Weeks ago Mahjoubi was an unknown in France. Now he is the youngest member of Macron's government, the computer whizzkid who shaped Macron's digital campaign and helped counter a massive hacking attack days before the presidential election. The tech entrepreneur's reward: the job of junior minister for digital affairs.   We're younger, we're campaigning differently, we are what France looks like,  Mahjoubi told Reuters as he canvassed support ahead of the June 11 first round.  Cedric Villani, Mathematician With his shoulder-length hair, colorful ascot ties and spider brooches, Cedric Villani, a prize-winning mathematician is among the most recognizable faces on the campaign trail. In 2010 he won the maths equivalent to the Nobel prize, the Fields Medal, for what the award called  proofs of nonlinear Landau damping and convergence to equilibrium of the Boltzmann equation . His more digestible work 'Birth of a Theorem: a mathematical adventure', is a journey through his unproductive lulls and late-night breakthroughs on the path to discovery. He entitled an online lecture 'Why is maths so sexy'.  Villani won 47.46 percent in the first round, falling just short of the threshold to win his constituency without a run-off. In the second round, he trounced his conservative opponent with nearly 70 percent of the vote. Brune Poirson, Academic High-Flyer Brune Poirson, 34, was elected in the Vaucluse county in southeastern France, beating the Front National's Herve de Lepinau by 421 votes in a stronghold for the far-right party. Marion Marechal-Le Pen, the niece of party leader Marine Le Pen and granddaughter of its founder, previously held the seat. Poirson, who has a master's degrees in political science from both Harvard and the London School of Economics, and previously worked as an adviser on corporate social responsibility, said she decided to become a candidate for LREM after seeing a video Macron sent to party members in January urging more women to put themselves forward as candidates.  Aurore Berge, Local Elected Official Thirty-year old Aurore Berge switched from the conservative The Republicans party to Macron's LREM party earlier this year. She had been part of ex-prime minister Alain Juppe's campaign team during his failed bid to become the conservative candidate for the presidential election. Berge came under fire from past allies during the campaign for jumping ship. But, in a sign of how much loyalties and labels are blurred in a fast-changing political landscape, Juppe backed her election bid, even though they are now in rival camps.    Berge, who has served as a local elected official in the same area west of Paris, was in the spotlight in May last year when she denounced sexist comments from fellow local councillors.

The result, based on official figures and pollster projections, redraws France's political landscape, humiliating the Socialist and conservative parties that alternated in power for decades until Macron's election in May. Three pollsters projected that Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) and its Modem allies would win 355 to 365 seats in the 577-seat lower house, fewer than previously forecast.  They predicted the conservative Republicans and their allies would form the largest opposition bloc with 125 to 131 seats, while the Socialist Party, in power for the past five years, and its partners would secure 41 to 49 seats, their lowest ever in the postwar Fifth Republic. Official figures with 90 seats still left to be decided showed LREM had already won its majority.  This is an opportunity for France. One year ago no one would have imagined such a political renewal,  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a statement. Voter turnout was projected to be a record low at about 42 percent. The high abstention rate underlines that Macron will have to tread carefully with reforms in a country with muscular trade unions and a history of street protests that have forced many a past government to dilute new legislation. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner said it signaled voters  had not wanted to hand Macron a blank check.  Related CoverageFrance elects record number of women to parliamentNevertheless, the scale of victory gives the president, a pro-European Union centrist, a strong platform from which to make good on campaign promises to revive France's fortunes by cleaning up politics and relaxing regulations that investors say shackle the euro zone’s second-biggest economy. Political Routing Victory for Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon, marks the routing of the old political class.  Having never held elected office, he seized on the growing resentment toward a political elite perceived as out of touch, and on public frustration at its failure to create jobs and spur stronger growth, to win the presidency. French President Emmanuel Macron waves as he attends a ceremony marking the 77th anniversary of late French General Charles de Gaulle's resistance call of June 18, 1940, at the Mont Valerien memorial in Suresnes, near Paris, France, June 18, 2017.Bertrand Guay/PoolHis year-old party then filled the political space created by the disarray within the Socialist Party and the Republicans, with Sunday night capping a sequence of events that a year ago looked improbable.  Tonight, the collapse of the Socialist Party is beyond doubt. The president of the Republic has all the powers,  Jean-Christophe Cambadelis said after announcing he would step down as Socialist Party chief.  He said the party would have to rebuild itself from the top down. Cambadelis was knocked out of the running for parliament in last week's first round of voting.   Far-right leader Marine Le Pen won a seat in the National Assembly for the first time. Her National Front party clinched at least eight seats in total, a result she celebrated but which may disappoint supporters who a month ago dreamed of entering the Elysee.   We are the only force of resistance to the dilution of France, its social model and identity,  Le Pen said in a televised address in her northern fiefdom of Henin-Beaumont. Slideshow (14 Images) We shall fight with all our strength the harmful projects of the government, which is only in place to implement the road map sent by Brussels.  Francois Baroin, who led the Republicans' campaign, said the conservatives would emphasize their differences with Macron, especially on taxes.     Social Resistance The scale of LREM's projected win means Macron will enjoy an absolute majority even without the support of alliance partner Francois Bayrou and Modem, lending him a freer hand for reforms and room for a government reshuffle should he choose to carry one out. Modem currently has two ministers in the Cabinet.  Macron's rivals went into the second round trying only to limit the scale of the newcomer's win. They urged voters not to allow too much power to be concentrated in the hands of one party and warned Macron's MPs would be mere yes-men who would rubber-stamp legislation. It appeared the message had some impact. Opinion polls before the vote had projected Macron could win as many as 470 seats. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who won his Marseille seat, promised  social resistance  to Macron's reform agenda and said the high abstention rate meant the president lacked the legitimacy to destroy the labor code. Melenchon's resurgent France Unbowed and the Communist Party were on course to win 26 to 30 seats. In a combative speech, which contrasted sharply with the defeated tone of the Socialist Party, Melenchon reached out to disappointed left-wingers.  It is France Unbowed which will call the country, when the moment comes, to social resistance,  Melenchon said.  I hereby inform the new powers that not a foot of ground will be given up in the labor law struggle.

Having begun the campaign as underdog, but by then already front-runner for the presidency, he was repeatedly asked on morning radio shows how he could possibly govern without a party and a parliament majority.   I must tell you that I'm astonished to hear some commentators pretend or hope that we won't be able to have a majority,  he told reporters, before explaining how French presidents had in the past defied the same doubts. Macron probably had in mind his political history class from Sciences-Po where - like generations of French leaders before him - he was taught about the subtleties of the Fifth Republic's constitutional system. The regime was designed by wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who was anxious that the pre-war parliamentary squabbling he blamed in part for France's fall to Nazi Germany could not be repeated.  Known as the  fait majoritaire  theory, it is based on a two-round eliminator system for all elections. Macron was duly elected president via a combination of strong first round support and the backing in the second round of those who did not want a victory for his run-off opponent, the far-right's Marine Le Pen. With legislative elections often following the presidentials, the same system has the effect of blocking parties on the edges of the political spectrum, and gives voters an incentive to opt for the sitting president's candidate.  From the first round of the presidential election, we entered an implacable, inevitable mechanism which would lead to the triumph of the one who was chosen to defeat Marine Le Pen,  analyst Jerome Sainte-Marie of pollster PollingVox said. Macron's rivals did not see that the system could help a party created only a year ago, which had never fielded candidates in a parliamentary election before, and whose leader, at 39, had been unknown to the public three years ago. But another move by Macron took political experts by surprise and helped amplify his majority on Sunday night to 350 seats or more in the 577 lower house according to projected results. Partial official figures showed he had already reached a majority with 90 seats left to count. By choosing a young conservative mayor for prime minister, he sowed division and discouragement in an already humiliated Republicans party. It was the first time a president had chosen a prime minister from outside his political family without being forced to, and the move chimed with French voters' weariness of the Socialists after a chaotic five years in power.  It also undermined the right's argument that Macron was just a continuation of unpopular Socialist President Francois Hollande, under whom he had served as economy minister from 2014 to 2016. Macron repeated the tactic in his ministerial appointments, stealing leading moderates from both The Republicans and the Socialist party. He also chose not to contest selected seats, including one where Socialist former prime minister Manuel Valls won on Sunday night without the endorsement of his party, thereby driving home divisions in the traditional parties. However, analysts warn Macron must not let his self-confidence get the better of him. Macron has said he wants to embody a  Jupiterian  vision of the presidency - whereby the president, very much like the Roman god of gods, speaks rarely except to issue orders. He has for instance refused to answer journalists' questions about a minister accused of nepotism.  The ivory tower effect has always been a danger for the Elysee palace's occupant,  political analyst Thomas Guénolé of Sciences-Po university.  Most have fallen into the trap.      Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier; Editing by Andrew Callus","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-idUSKBN19910B"},

A Danish media report said the waves late on Saturday might have been caused by an earthquake creating a landslide into the sea, which in turn would have generated a swell. Police in Greenland, which is part of Denmark with self-government over domestic affairs, had no comment on the cause. The Greenland government said the small village of Nuugaatsiaq in the northwest was flooded, while two other places in the same region, Uummannaq and Illorsuit, were also affected. Nuugaatsiaq was evacuated but four people were still missing, Greenland's police said in Sunday's statement. Local media also reported several casualties. The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) registered an earthquake with magnitude of 4 in the area, the Danish news agency Ritzau reported. GEUS senior researcher Trine Dahl Jensen told Ritzau that it was a  good guess  that the waves were triggered by a landslide because of the quake.  You have seen that in Greenland before,  Jensen said.  Liselotte Boehm of Greenland's police told Danish broadcaster TV2 she could not confirm the cause.  What we know is that some big waves have caused flooding,  she said. Denmark has sent emergency workers to support the Greenland police.

Henderson displayed a mix of power and precision to card a bogey-free final round of three-under 66 on the Blythfield Country Club course, which played to a par of 69 over the weekend due to flooding on the third hole. “I played really steady golf. It’s cool to be able to make those putts under pressure,” Henderson told Golf channel after sinking a three-foot par putt at the last to finish at 17-under 263. American Lexi Thompson for the second consecutive week was unable to convert a 54-hole lead into victory. She carded 69 to tie for second with compatriot Michelle Wie (65) at 15-under. Eight players were tied for the lead at one stage of the final round but Henderson broke clear with three birdies in five holes around the turn. “I was surprised when I looked at the leaderboard and had a two-shot lead on the 18th green but I’m super happy,” Henderson said. She is the 15th different winner on the LPGA Tour in 15 tournaments this season, the longest streak without a repeat champion since 1991. Henderson, now 19, burst onto the LPGA scene by winning the Portland Classic by eight strokes in 2015, becoming the third player to triumph before turning 18 after Thompson and Lydia Ko. She added two more victories last year, including the Women’s PGA Championship major. Sunday also marked the continued improvement of former child prodigy Wie, whose runner-up finish came after a tie for third in her previous start. Wie, 27, has four career victories, including the 2014 U.S. Women’s Open.

But he struggled in the final two rounds.  It means a lot, first time play in a major and make the cut,  Li told Reuters after signing his final-round scorecard.  I think that's good enough for my career as the first time.  I have a lot of hard times in a major. I get a lot of experience in the last couple of days,  Li added. Li said he enjoyed the experience despite struggling in the final two rounds and reckoned it would help his confidence in the long run.  I think I'll be more comfortable playing in the big events, and help me play better the next time,  he said. Li, who turned professional at age 16 and won the Volvo China Open last year on the European Tour, said he started pressing in the third round.

Police said on Sunday the number of people feared to have died in the blaze would rise from the current total of 58, which includes 30 confirmed fatalities, as they carry out a full forensic and systematic search of the building. They said they would provide an updated figure on Monday. Prime Minister Theresa May, criticized for keeping her distance from angry residents during her visit to the charred remains of the 24-story Grenfell Tower, said on Saturday the response to the disaster had been  not good enough . Her government is trying to make up ground in reacting to a fire that trapped people in their beds in the early hours of Wednesday, with many unable to escape as the flames raced up the building, cutting off exit routes and forcing some to jump. May and her ministers have said they will do all they can to help those left homeless after the blaze and make sure other high-rise buildings, usually home to poorer people, are checked and safe.  But with Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, emboldened by a better-than-expected result in an early election that wiped out the Conservatives' majority, May's government has been forced to justify spending cuts at a time when talks to leave the European Union are beginning.   If something needs to be done to make buildings safe, it will be done,  finance minister Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.  Let's get the technical advice properly evaluated by a public inquiry and then let's decide how to go forward.  May has announced a fast-tracked public inquiry into the fire and said on Sunday every household affected by the blaze would receive a minimum payment of 5,500 pounds ($7,000) from a 5-million-pound emergency fund.

On the streets, there is anger over a block renovation project that did not install safety devices such as sprinklers. Suspicions have grown that flammable materials were used to clad the building and accelerated the spread of the fire.  Years of Neglect  Slideshow (18 Images)After a church ceremony to pay respect to those who died in the fire, London mayor Sadiq Khan said he found  a community frustrated and angry .  Angry not simply at the poor response in the days afterwards from the council and the government, but the years of neglect from the council and from successive governments,  he added. But the Conservative leader of the local council, Nick Paget-Brown, said he and others had been working hard.  It's not true to say there are no councillors around, it's not true to say Kensington and Chelsea council is not evident. It is,  he said. Labour's Corbyn, who unlike May was quick to meet local residents and was praised for showing empathy, led calls for the government to drop its spending cuts - demands that Hammond said he was listening to.  In the wake of (the) Grenfell fire we have to recognize that something has gone badly, badly wrong in this country, that predominantly poor people die in a towering inferno because possibly in the long term (there had been a) lack of public investment,  Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday program.

At least 72 people have been killed since hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in protests that began in April demanding elections, the release of opposition prisoners and calling on President Nicolas Maduro to accept foreign aid to alleviate food and medicine shortages. The opposition has criticized foreign sales of non-lethal security equipment to Maduro's government, saying the gear is used to repress protests and eats up funds that should be spent on food and medicine. General Antonio Benavides, the national guard commander, said equipment such as armored vehicles, water cannons and tear gas supplied by countries including China helped prevent casualties and rights violations.  Never again will the armed forces be sent to the streets with weapons of war used on the Venezuelan people, whether or not they are from the opposition,  Benavides said, contrasting the situation with the 1989  Caracazo  riots when forces used live ammunition and hundreds died.   Right now we have the best equipment in Latin America. ... It's the best technology, preserving the rights of those who use it, but also of the protesters,  Benavides said in an interview with Televen TV network. The national guard is a branch of Venezuela's armed forces in charge of public order, working alongside the country's police forces.  Demonstrators clash with riot security forces while rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, June 10, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsBenavides said 600,000 protesters had taken part in marches since the protests began in April. He said the forces were operating under difficult conditions and faced petrol bombs, gunfire and smoke, and acknowledged that occasionally his forces lost control.  One national guard member was shot dead by a sniper in the protests, 45 have been suffered gunshot wounds, and 252 have suffered other injuries, Benavides said. The group Human Rights Watch on Friday said security forces engaged in arbitrary arrests and detainee abuse that in some cases amounts to torture during the protests.   They have fired teargas canisters directly toward demonstrators, journalists, health facilities and homes,  the group said, citing video and photographic evidence.  Benavides defended the use of VN-4 armored personnel carriers, made by China's defense conglomerate China North Industries Group Corp, or Norinco, as well as water cannons known as  Whales  and vehicular barriers dubbed  Bats  by protesters. He also defended the use of tear gas on protesters, saying it is an irritant but not toxic. The national guard this month was criticized by Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino for what he called isolated atrocities on the streets. Brazilian firm Condor Non-Lethal Technologies on Friday confirmed it had two contracts to supply tear gas to Venezuela. But Brazil's defense ministry said the canisters have not been shipped, and Colombian airline Avianca said it would not transport them.

Reuters has been unable to confirm the reports. Neither Beyonce, one of the world's most popular singers, nor her husband, the rap star and entrepreneur Jay Z, has made any announcement about the birth. Social media was abuzz in February when the 35-year-old singer, whose full name is Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, posted a photo of herself wearing a long veil and lingerie and caressing a noticeable baby bump.

The migrants were picked up in seven separate rescue operations aboard three dinghies and four wooden craft, Italy's coastguard said on Sunday. Save the Children SAR team leader Gillian Moyes, onboard the rescue vessel Vos Hestia, said the past few days had been extremely busy, following a pattern seen in recent weeks.  We are seeing increasing numbers of people, large scale rescues with multiple boats,  she said. She added there was insufficient capacity in search and rescues to deal with the situation unfolding in the Mediterranean. On Saturday, hundreds of migrants, some drifting in rubber dinghies off the coast of Libya, were picked up by Spanish and Italian ships. A Spanish navy ship was dispatched to help two migrant boats struggling to stay afloat near Libya on Saturday afternoon, and at sundown it found three other rubber dinghies transporting migrants in the area, Spain's Defence Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. In total 526 people, including eight pregnant women and nine children, were picked up in that rescue, aided by a ship belonging to a non-governmental organisation, the ministry said. The migrants were headed to an Italian port, it added. Around 800 migrants were rescued from rubber boats in six operations in the Mediterranean on Saturday, the Italian coastguard said. Libya's coastguard had already intercepted 906 migrants on board damaged wooden and rubber boats on Friday, and earlier in the week humanitarian rescue ships picked up more than 1,000 migrants off Libya's shores. The sea crossing between Libya and Italy has been attempted by an increasing number of migrants trying to reach Europe this year. Arrivals of migrants to Italy are up almost 18 percent on the same period last year at more than 65,000, Italy's Interior Ministry said last week.

Congressional and administration staff have begun to examine options to address profit-shifting schemes that include so-called transfer pricing, earnings stripping and tax inversions.  A decision on how to handle these in tax legislation could come before Congress leaves town for its one-week July 4 recess on June 29, officials and lobbyists said. Lawmakers say the current tax code incentivizes profit shifting overseas because of the high 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate and rules that allow companies to hold profits abroad tax free until returned to U.S. soil. Without effective measures against tax avoidance, experts and lobbyists said tax legislation could trigger a new exodus of income and assets abroad. Because Trump and Republicans in Congress also want to end U.S. taxes on foreign earnings, companies could eliminate their U.S. tax bills altogether without restrictions.   Tax reduction strategies have been employed for decades by companies including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Independent analysts estimate the federal government misses out on more than $100 billion a year in corporate tax revenues as a result of tax reduction maneuvers. That is equal to one-third of the $300 billion in annual corporate tax revenues. Many schemes seek lower corporate tax bills through  transfer pricing  - using transactions between business units to shift income abroad. The shift often coincides with the transfer of intangible assets such as intellectual property to low-tax nations where companies can expect single-digit tax rates.   Last week, Senate Finance Committee Democrats asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to leave in place regulations adopted under President Barack Obama to combat earnings stripping and tax inversions. Companies use earnings stripping to shift income abroad as tax-deductible interest payments to foreign affiliates. Inversions are international mergers in which U.S. companies move their headquarters to foreign countries with low taxes, if only on paper, to lower their U.S. tax bills. Companies have accumulated some $2.6 trillion in abroad, equivalent to more than three-quarters of the $3.3 trillion in annual government receipts expected this year. Border-Adjustment Tax But the most effective measures against corporate tax avoidance schemes, including House Speaker Paul Ryan's controversial border-adjustment tax, or BAT, have proved unpopular, raising the possibility that tax legislation could simply cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent to reduce the advantages offered by foreign tax havens. Aside from BAT, which taxes imports but not exports, tax reform discussions are also looking at a minimum tax on profits from tax havens, a tax on intangible income and other measures to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries where they do little actual business, according to aides and lobbyists. Lobbyists said none of the options have enjoyed consensus support in Congress. Meanwhile, the idea of a simple rate cut does not sit well with House Republican leaders.    Even with a low rate, we'll continue to see U.S. jobs and research and headquarters move overseas,  said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a leading BAT proponent. Experts warn that the 15 percent rate sought by Trump is well above a 5 percent effective rate that some corporations pay in countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Brady and Ryan are expected to address the issue in coming weeks with Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. The six are trying to forge legislation that could be unveiled as early as September. Trump has pledged the biggest tax overhaul since Ronald Reagan. But Republican infighting over healthcare has delayed the timetable. Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tax-idUSKBN1990HC"},

Fleetwood had missed six of seven cuts in his major championship resume, finishing tied for 27th at the 2015 U.S. Open for his best result before this year's Open. But the long-hitting 26-year-old from Southport outside Liverpool is firing on all cylinders at links-styled Erin Hills and stands one shot from the lead as Sunday's final round began.  Tommy's got momentum this year. The big catalyst has been the win that he had at Abu Dhabi at the start of the year,  McGinley told Reuters before Fleetwood's final-round tee time.  It's always great to win early in a season because it sets you up for the year. It's almost like 'Well, whatever I do for the rest of the year, it's going to be a good year.'  That takes the shackles off and then you kind of go, and that's what he's done.  The victory was his second on the European Tour following  his maiden title in a playoff at the 2013 Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles.  Then he went on to (WGC) Mexico and holed that monster putt from about 80 feet on the last green, which took him into second on his own, won him a check of nearly a million dollars and propelled him right up the Order of Merit and world rankings.  And he's carried on from there,  said Ireland's McGinley, captain of the victorious 2014 European Ryder Cup team. Fleetwood has posted three successive subpar rounds at Erin Hills, opening with a five-under 67 and following with a 70 and 68 to be in prime position to battle for his first major title. McGinley said he likes the makeup of the promising player.  He hits the ball a long way, he's gritty, he's tenacious,  said McGinley.  He's got a big heart and very much the modern player.  He's very strong, goes to the gym a lot, works hard, very conscientious. He's quiet, unassuming, respectful. A really nice guy. Well brought up, good parents.  A really nice, respectful, good boy.

Boeing is expected to launch the 190-230 seat 737 MAX 10 with more seats and a modified landing gear at the opening of the Paris Airshow on Monday, adding a larger, new version to its narrowbody medium-haul family to plug a gap against Airbus.  We are working very closely with a large number of customers, with offers on the table,  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a briefing. He dismissed concerns by some financiers about fragmentation of the Boeing 737 MAX family into what would now be five separate models, potentially making some harder to finance.  There is significant demand for each model,  he said. Speaking before the world's largest air show at Le Bourget from June 19 to 25, McAllister offered a glimpse of new Boeing market forecasts due to be published on Tuesday. The world will need 41,000 commercial jets over the next 20 years, he said, a 4 percent increase from last year's Boeing forecast. By comparison, Airbus last week forecast 34,899 jets over the same period, which was 6 percent above its own 2016 forecast. Boeing will unveil detailed figures on Tuesday.  Services Push Workers move a Boeing 737 MAX on static display, before the opening of the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France June 17, 2017.Pascal RossignolBoeing is working to complete a three-year study on the potential for a so-called  mid-market  jet that would sit between the existing narrowbody and widebody categories. The company is working on a cost and business case for such a plane.  I would like to do it as quickly as we can,  McAllister said, but added:  I would rather take the time to do it right.  Airbus has dismissed the case for such an aircraft, saying its A321neo, which can seat up to 240 people in an all-economy layout, mostly fits the gap. Boeing says the potential market spans 200 to 270 seats and requires an all-new plane. Empennage of a Boeing 737 MAX and a 787 are seen on the static display, before the opening of the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France June 17, 2017.Pascal RossignolMcAllister, a former General Electric (GE.N) executive who was appointed in November, said there was huge potential for new digital technologies in production and in providing aftermarket services. Such services, which are key to engine makers and are now working their way into aircraft manufacturing, will be part of the decisions on whether to launch the mid-market jet. The Boeing official called for greater efficiency from suppliers including Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N), which builds the fuselage of 737 jets and parts of the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing is involved in pricing negotiations with its former subsidiary, formed in 2005 from the sale of its Wichita base.  We are still negotiating with Spirit. I expect the same accountability from the supply chain as we place on ourselves,  McAllister said. Spirit said in May talks were taking longer than expected and that there was still a gap on 737 and 787..    On the 777 mini-jumbo, whose production is slowing before the transition to a new model due to enter service in 2020, McAllister said the plane was sold out for 2017 but the firm had  some holes to fill  in the order book in 2018 and 2019.

Fujimori, the daughter of jailed former President Alberto Fujimori, lost to Kuczynski in last year's razor-thin election.

JLR, which employs more than 40,000 people globally, said it would hire 1,000 electronic and software engineers as well as 4,000 additional personnel including in manufacturing, most of whom will be based in Britain. The recruitment process will take place over the next 12 months, just as Britain begins talks to leave the European Union, which carmakers have warned must result in a deal which retains free and unfettered trade to protect jobs. The carmaker, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, will build its first electric vehicle, the I-PACE, in Austria but has said it wants to build such models in Britain if conditions such as support from government and academia are met. Automakers are racing to produce greener cars and improve charge times in a bid to meet rising customer demand and fulfil air quality targets but Britain lacks sufficient manufacturing capacity, an area ministers have said they want to build up. JLR, which builds just under a third of Britain's 1.7 million cars, has said half of all its new models will be available in an electric version by the end of the decade, requiring new skills among its staff. Sunday's announcement comes as May is still trying to seal a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to support her government a week and a half after unexpectedly failing to win an outright majority at a national election. The news is a welcome bright spot as the prospect of greater political uncertainty before Monday's start to Brexit talks has seen business confidence tumble in recent days, according to surveys and business groups.

It took Afghan security forces most of the day to kill the last gunmen, who had barricaded themselves in a kitchen in the compound, according to police.  The attack, claimed by the Taliban, began around 6:30 a.m. (0200 GMT) when one bomber detonated a car packed with explosives at the gate of the police headquarters in Gardez city, capital of Paktia province, said Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. Around six attackers stormed the gate after the blast, with at least two quickly killed by police. The others held out against Afghan special forces that had responded to the attack, he said. Paktia police chief Toryalai Abdani put the toll at six police killed and 12 wounded.  Doctors at the city hospital said they had received the bodies of at least five police, as well as at least 30 wounded people, including 21 civilians.

He was called up from Nashville on May 24 and had an 8.56 ERA in five relief appearances for the A's over 13 2/3 innings. He's 1-2 with a 3.89 ERA for Nashville in eight games, including four starts. INF/DH Ryon Healy had his third career multi-homer game -- all coming this month -- on Saturday in a 5-2 victory against the New York Yankees at the Oakland Coliseum. Healy, who went 3-for-4, hit a solo homer in the second inning and a solo blast in the fourth, both into the left-center-field seats and off Yankees RHP Masahiro Tanaka. Healy hit two homers against the Washington Nationals on June 3 and two homers against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 5, both games at the Coliseum. Healy now has 17 home runs and is tied for the team lead with 1B Yonder Alonso and LF Khris Davis. He has 14 home runs in his past 40 games after hitting three in his first 27. In the month of June, Healy has eight home runs in 16 games. He also has 42 RBIs, one behind Davis' team-high 43.  Trusting the process,  Healy said.  It's a day-to-day grind. There's been a lot of days this season where I feel terrible in the cage and I just have to go out and clear my mind and just battle, compete in the box. Really emphasize getting a good pitch to hit and putting my best swing on it.  INF/OF Chad Pinder was a late scratch from the lineup Saturday against the Yankees because of an illness. Pinder was slated to start at shortstop and hit second. INF Adam Rosales took his spot in the lineup and in the field. Pinder is batting .236 with eight doubles, eight home runs and 21 RBIs in 41 games. RHP Michael Brady was selected from Triple-A Nashville before Saturday's game against the Yankees. This marks Brady's first career call-up to the major leagues. He has started and relieved in the minor leagues but will be in the A's bullpen. Brady was drafted by the Marlins in 2009 out of the University of California as an infielder but switched to pitcher in 2010. He signed a minor league contract with Oakland on Nov. 15, 2016. Brady is 26-38 with a 3.10 ERA in 283 career minor league appearances, all but 40 in relief. He struck out 515 and walked 85 in 508 innings. RHP Jesse Hahn (3-4) struggled Saturday with his command but improved to 2-0 in three starts since returning from a stint on the disabled list with a strained right triceps. Hahn gave up two runs on three hits over five innings with six strikeouts and three walks in a 5-2 victory against the Yankees at the Oakland Coliseum. The Yankees had runners on base in four of Hahn's five innings, but he stranded five of them. Hahn exited after throwing 105 pitches.  I think I can be a little more efficient there, keep my pitch count down so I can go a little deeper in that ballgame, but everything worked out in our favor,  Hahn said. 3B Matt Chapman went 2-for-4 with a double and a run scored in his third career major league game on Saturday, a 5-2 victory against the Yankees. The rookie had his first multi-hit game and first extra-base hit in the big leagues. He's batting .273 with three RBIs. RHP Chris Bassitt (Tommy John surgery) threw a 25-pitch bullpen session Saturday. Bassitt's recovery appears to be back on track after his rehab stint at Triple-A Nashville was shut down last month.  He threw great,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  This is as good as he's felt throughout this whole process. You're going to have some hurdles along the way when you have Tommy John, and some aches and some pains and so forth. I think it was prudent that we shut him down for a while because that's as lively as I've seen the baseball come out of his hand since he started this process.  Melvin said he still hopes to have Bassitt pitch for the A's this season but that he might be limited to a relief role after being shut down for so long.  RHP Santiago Casilla was hit in the left shoulder by a foul ball in the A's dugout on Saturday during a 5-2 victory against the Yankees. Casilla, the A's closer, had X-rays, which were negative.  He's OK,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He's a tough guy, but that was pretty scary for a minute because it came in there pretty good.  Melvin said Casilla was unavailable to pitch Saturday even before being hit by the foul ball. RF Matt Joyce hit his fifth career leadoff home run on Saturday in a 5-2 victory against the Yankees. Joyce launched RHP Masahiro Tanaka's first-pitch fastball into the seats in right field for his eighth home run of the season. Joyce's leadoff homer was his first since Sept. 24, 2013, against New York at Yankee Stadium off RHP Hiroki Kuroda. He reached base safely in a game five times for the first time since June 29, 2014, against Baltimore when he had five hits.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6IR5XP3C"},

Most victims were caught in their vehicles on the road while fleeing flames that were destroying their homes. The prime minister said the death toll could rise as firefighters inspected charred remains of some buildings in remote villages. Police said a lightning strike on a tree probably caused the blaze on Saturday in a region hit by an intense heat wave and dry, gusty winds, which has fanned the flames. The prime minister said the emergency services acted as fast as they could but acknowledged that some of the efforts like alerting the population might have been hindered because the blaze had ruined phone lines and communications towers.  What happened was cables and communications towers were destroyed by the fire, even their first replacements melted,  he said.  But nothing compromised the firefighting efforts.  Most communications have been restored, but Costa called on residents listen to the radio and heed any official advice. The government declared three days of mourning and sent two army battalions to help the emergency services. The European Union said it would provide firefighting aircraft. France has offered three planes and Spain has sent two, authorities said. Speaking in the Vatican, Pope Francis, who visited Portugal last month, mentioned the victims in his weekly address.

It is a real inferno, we have never seen anything like that,  the mayor of Pedrogao Grande Valdemar Alves told reporters, adding that more than 20 villages had been affected. Alongside 62 confirmed dead, another 54 people have been injured and taken to hospitals. Four are in a serious condition. More than 600 firefighters were still battling the flames on Sunday. Several local highways were shut for safety reasons. The authorities said very low smoke clouds prevented helicopters and fire planes dropping water on the flames efficiently for most of the day. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited the site at night and expressed his condolences. He said that  it was not possible to do more than what has been done  in prevention and responding to the fire. Some local residents said they had been left without firefighters for hours as their homes burned. Many blamed poor forestry reserve planning and depopulation of remote villages that left many wooded areas untended.

The BIS said the pace of globalization had been slowed by the global financial crisis, and that challenges created by an uneven distribution of wealth are known, but there was no basis to say it was going into reverse.   Arguments that question the benefits of globalization have been receiving greater attention in the public debate,  head of the BIS, Jaime Caruana, said in a pre-released chapter of its annual report.  This shows that we risk forgetting the lessons of the past and taking for granted the gains in living standards, productivity and prosperity achieved over the last half-century.   The report said there was strong empirical evidence that globalization was also not actually the main cause of increased within-country income inequality; technology was. Globalization itself has seen  global value chain  trade between emerging markets more than double since 2001 with China alone now responsible for 19 percent of that compared to 7 percent at the start of the century. And although global trade is growing at a slower rate than the world economy for one of the only times since the mid-1800s, large multinational firms still account for around 90 percent of trade in the United States. Dollar-denominated credit to firms and governments in emerging markets has also doubled since the outbreak of the financial crisis to $3.6 trillion, as global interest rates have tumbled.  Over the last two decades there has also been significant rise in the co-movement of global asset prices. For example, the correlation of advanced economy sovereign 10-year bond yields have more than doubled relative to the previous two.      Some of the options the BIS report cites to address the problematic effects of globalization include government policies to foster more adaptability, such as retraining programs and employment initiatives in affected regions. Banking systems also have to be made strong enough so any financial busts can be cleared up quickly. It also called for globally applicable regulations and for beefed-up currency swap lines between the world's big central banks.

The BIS said the pace of globalization had been slowed by the global financial crisis, and that challenges created by an uneven distribution of wealth are known, but there was no basis to say it was going into reverse.   Arguments that question the benefits of globalization have been receiving greater attention in the public debate,  head of the BIS, Jaime Caruana, said in a pre-released chapter of its annual report.  This shows that we risk forgetting the lessons of the past and taking for granted the gains in living standards, productivity and prosperity achieved over the last half-century.   The report said there was strong empirical evidence that globalization was also not actually the main cause of increased within-country income inequality; technology was. Globalization itself has seen  global value chain  trade between emerging markets more than double since 2001 with China alone now responsible for 19 percent of that compared to 7 percent at the start of the century. And although global trade is growing at a slower rate than the world economy for one of the only times since the mid-1800s, large multinational firms still account for around 90 percent of trade in the United States. Dollar-denominated credit to firms and governments in emerging markets has also doubled since the outbreak of the financial crisis to $3.6 trillion, as global interest rates have tumbled.  Over the last two decades there has also been significant rise in the co-movement of global asset prices. For example, the correlation of advanced economy sovereign 10-year bond yields have more than doubled relative to the previous two.      Some of the options the BIS report cites to address the problematic effects of globalization include government policies to foster more adaptability, such as retraining programs and employment initiatives in affected regions. Banking systems also have to be made strong enough so any financial busts can be cleared up quickly. It also called for globally applicable regulations and for beefed-up currency swap lines between the world's big central banks.  Instead of retreating from the ties of global trade and finance, we should reinforce them. Instead of loosening them, we should make them more resilient,  Caruana said.

The Social Democrat Party (PSD) and its coalition allies withdrew their support for Grindeanu, 43, last Wednesday, saying he has failed to implement the PSD's broad governing agenda since it won a parliamentary election last December.  Grindeanu refused to resign and was expelled from the party. Independent observers said the PSD is likely unhappy with Grindeanu's failure to relax Romania's anti-corruption rules earlier this year and wanted to oust him to ensure a different premier does more to protect party seniors facing graft charges. Romania is seen as one of the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since its 2007 entry.   Grindeanu's removal seems to be at the forefront of an effort by the ruling coalition to relaunch a drive to weaken the anti-corruption fight,  said commentator Mircea Marian. At stake could be the future of PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, who has received a two-year suspended sentence in a vote-rigging case and is now on trial in a separate abuse of office case. After a recent constitutional court ruling, the government has to propose a cap on financial damages caused by abuse of office offences, a level which could be decisive in Dragnea's case.  This threshold is among reasons why Grindeanu had to be removed,  said political analyst Cristian Patrasconiu. A push this year by Grindeanu's government to decriminalize several corruption offences triggered the biggest street protests in Romania since the collapse of Nicolae Ceausescu's communist rule in 1989. The government was forced to rescind the decree, and its architect, Justice Minister Florin Iordache resigned, citing a need to appease public opinion but saying he had done nothing wrong.  Clearly Grindeanu is perceived by PSD leaders as lacking a firm hand,  said Marian.  So they are looking for a prime minister tough enough to handle and defuse any potential street protests (in the future).  The PSD and its junior coalition ally have enough deputies for the no-confidence motion to succeed, when it is put to a vote on Wednesday.  Neither grouping has said anything about their plans regarding anti-corruption policy, but both reject accusations they want to relax the rules for political gain.  This is a vote against a pseudo-government, one without any legitimacy. A government which believes it can exert power in its own name,  Social Democrat senator Mihai Fifor told parliament on Sunday.

The new wing design adds to other modifications presented earlier this year, including new stairways and cabin rest area to fit in more seats, with Airbus dubbing the enhanced version the  A380plus . Airbus announced the plan at the Paris Airshow, where it revealed the new wingtips and new  A380plus  branding on the fuselage and wing of an A380 belonging to the Air and Space Museum at Le Bourget airport. Reuters had previously reported the plans, which the planemaker hopes will help revive weak sales of the double-decker jet.  The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time,  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in a statement.  Overall, the changes will lead to a 13 percent reduction in cost per seat compared with the current A380, Airbus said.  The  A380plus  will also have an increased maximum take-off weight of 578 tonnes, meaning it can either carry 80 more passengers or fly a further 300 nautical miles.   Airbus said it would also offer longer time between maintenance checks, meaning the plane can fly more and thus cutting maintenance costs.

The new wing design adds to other modifications presented earlier this year, including new stairways and cabin rest area to fit in more seats, with Airbus dubbing the enhanced version the  A380plus . Airbus announced the plan at the Paris Airshow, where it revealed the new wingtips and new  A380plus  branding on the fuselage and wing of an A380 belonging to the Air and Space Museum at Le Bourget airport. Reuters had previously reported the plans, which the planemaker hopes will help revive weak sales of the double-decker jet.  The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time,  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in a statement.  Overall, the changes will lead to a 13 percent reduction in cost per seat compared with the current A380, Airbus said.  The  A380plus  will also have an increased maximum take-off weight of 578 tonnes, meaning it can either carry 80 more passengers or fly a further 300 nautical miles.   Airbus said it would also offer longer time between maintenance checks, meaning the plane can fly more and thus cutting maintenance costs.

Some 1.5 million people are on the brink of famine in the northeast, where the jihadist group has killed more than 20,000 people and forced 2.7 million to flee during its eight-year uprising to create an Islamic caliphate. A program was launched on June 8 by Yemi Osinbajo, acting president while President Muhammadu Buhari is in Britain on medical leave, to distribute grain to 1.8 million people still displaced by the insurgency, many of whom live in camps.  Over 1,000 trucks of assorted grains are now on course, delivering the grains intact to beneficiaries since the commencement of the present program as against the reported diversion of over 50 trucks in every 100 trucks sent to the northeast,  said Osinbajo's spokesman Laolu Akande in an emailed statement late on Saturday.  The issue of diversion of relief materials, including food and related matters, which has dogged food delivery to the IDPs [internally displaced people] would be significantly curbed under the new distribution matrix.  Akande said 1,376 military personnel and 656 armed police would guard the food as it was moved from warehouses and distributed to displaced people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe - the three states worst hit by the insurgency. Boko Haram controlled an area of the northeast around the size of Belgium in early 2015 but has since been pushed out of most of the territory by Nigeria's army and troops from neighboring countries.  But the Islamists continue to carry out attacks in the northeast and neighboring Cameroon and Niger.  Boko Haram killed 14 people in bombings and shootings in the northeastern city of Maiduguri on June 7, in a large-scale attack quelled by the army after several hours.  A U.N. official said this month the World Food Programme had scaled back its emergency plans in the northeast because of lack of funds, now aiming to supply food to 1.4 million people instead of the 1.8 million previously intended. The U.N. says it needs $1.05 billion this year to deal with the crisis in northeast Nigeria - which, along with Somalia and South Sudan, is one of three humanitarian emergencies unfolding in Africa - but has only received about a quarter of that sum.

The capital reduction is the first phase of a plan to revive DSI's fortunes amid a slump in the Gulf's construction market as governments have cut back on project spending as a result of the fall in oil prices. Strategic investor Tabarak Investment has become DSI's biggest shareholder after acquiring the shares of former chief executive Khaldoun Tabari, DSI confirmed last week. Tabarak's stake stands at about 18 to 20 percent after the sale, Zawya, a Thomson Reuters service, reported on June 11, citing a source. The second phase of DSI's restructuring plan involves a 500 million dirham ($136 million) capital increase by Tabarak. DSI's capital reduction plan was one of the conditions for investment by Tabarak. The firm on Sunday didn't reveal specific information on where the capital injection will be spent.  The intention is to spend the money on projects where we can complete these projects and generate more cash and profit from those projects,  said Chief Executive Wael Allan. He added that the company was closing in on three potential new contracts, including one in the waste water business and two opportunities within mechanical, electrical and plumbing. DSI's business had not been affected by Qatar's diplomatic rift with some of its Gulf neighbours, although the company was not bidding for new business in that country, said acting Chief Financial Officer Feras Kalthoum. Last year DSI won a 340 million riyal ($93 million) contract for Qatar Rail's Doha Metro project. Kalthoum said the company had not received any official guidance about doing business in Qatar. Another part of the company's plans include refinancing or restructuring a portion of its debt, with executives saying the initial focus was on around 1 billion dirhams of funded and unfunded corporate debt in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The company was in the process of meeting with creditors with a view to unveiling a plan within the next 60 to 90 days to refinance or restructure its debt, Kalthoum said, adding that options under consideration included issuing a sukuk or raising a syndicated loan to cover a portion of the amount. A plan on refinancing or restructuring its debt in Qatar would have to wait until the  dust settles  on the regional rift, he said. $1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham $1 = 3.6600 Qatar riyals Reporting by Tom Arnold; Editing by Saeed Azhar and Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/dsi-stocks-idUSL8N1JF0II"},

The German manufacturer's 19th outright win at the Circuit de la Sarthe followed a night of drama with Toyota's top two cars retiring and the number one Porsche also suffering a terminal problem while leading with four hours to go. That left the number two Porsche, shared by German Timo Bernhard and New Zealanders Brendon Hartley and Earl Bamber, to move surprisingly back into contention after being at the back of the field on Saturday. The trio's chances had been written off by team bosses when the car suffered front axle problems and spent 90 minutes in the garage before rejoining some 22 laps adrift of the leading Toyota.  It can be the cruelest race or it can be the best race ever. You never know,  said Bernhard, a winner with Audi in 2010, who did the final stint to take the chequered flag.  Every lap counted, every second, to get back to P1.  The goal was to get maximum manufacturers' and drivers' points,  he said of the feeling on Saturday.  Then this morning we saw that actually we can do a little bit more, maybe the podium.  Bamber had won with Porsche in 2015 but Sunday was a first for Hartley, the only driver in the two crews yet to taste overall victory at Le Mans.

Kennedy airport in New York, forcibly confiscating a diplomatic package which it said raised questions about the city as the seat of the United Nations.    The North's Foreign Ministry spokesman said a delegation of the North returning from a U.N. conference on the rights of persons with disabilities  was literally mugged  at the John F. Kennedy airport in  an illegal and heinous act of provocation.   Diplomats of a sovereign state are being robbed of a diplomatic package in the middle of New York where the headquarters of the United Nations is located and that serves as the venue for international meetings including the United Nations General Assembly,  the spokesman said.   This clearly shows that the U.S. is a felonious and lawless gangster state,  the spokesman said in comments carried by the North's official KCNA news agency.  The international community needs to seriously reconsider whether or not New York, where such an outrageous mugging is rampant, is fit to serve as the venue for international meetings,  KCNA said.  The State Department and White House had no immediate comment on the North Korean statement. KCNA said the incident took place on June 16 when more than 20 officials who claimed to be from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and police  made a violent assault like gangsters to take away the diplomatic package from the diplomats.  The diplomats were in possession of a valid diplomatic courier certificate, KCNA said. The claim comes amid diplomatic tensions after the North released American student Otto Warmbier whose parents said he was in a coma after being held by the North for 17 months. Warmbier, 22, who arrived in the United States on Tuesday, is stable but  shows no sign of understanding language, responding to verbal commands or awareness of his surrounding,  a doctor at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said. The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions against North Korea for the reclusive state's nuclear and ballistic missile activities. The North, which is a member state of the United Nations, has rejected the resolutions as infringements of its right to self defense and space exploration.

Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin declined to say how many of the seven missing sailors had been recovered, but Japanese media said all had died. “Out of concern for the families and the notification process, I will decline to state how many we have found at this time,” Aucoin told a news conference. The search at sea had ended, Aucoin said. The USS Fitzgerald could have foundered, or even sunk, but for the crew's desperate efforts to save the ship, he said.  The damage was significant. There was a big gash under the water,  Aucoin said at Yokosuka naval base, home of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the docked Fitzgerald behind him.     A significant portion of the crew was sleeping  when the destroyer collided with the Philippine-flagged container ship,  destroying the commander's cabin, he said. The Fitzgerald is salvageable, he said, but repairs will likely take months.  Hopefully less than a year. You will see the USS Fitzgerald back,  Aucoin said. Multiple U.S. and Japanese investigations are under way on how a ship as large as the container could ram into the warship in clear weather.  Aucoin was asked if damage on the starboard side indicated the U.S. ship could have been at fault, but he declined to speculate on the cause of the collision. Maritime rules suggest vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard.  Limping Into Port     The Seventh Fleet said in a statement earlier on Sunday:  Divers were able to access the space and found a number of bodies.  They were transferred to a U.S. naval hospital for identification, it said. The Fitzgerald collided with the merchant vessel more than three times its size some 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka early on Saturday. Three people were medically evacuated to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka after the collision, including the ship's commanding officer, Bryce Benson, who was reported to be in stable condition, the Navy said. Personnel are seen on the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald which has been damaged by colliding with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel, at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, June 18, 2017.Toru HanaiThe other two were being treated for lacerations and bruises. The Fitzgerald limped into port on Saturday evening, listing around 5 degrees, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Yokosuka said. The flooding was in two berthing compartments, the radio room and auxiliary machine room, he said. There were 285 crew onboard, the spokesman said. Benson took command of the Fitzgerald on May 13. He had previously commanded a minesweeper based in Sasebo in western Japan. Slideshow (12 Images)'Professional Negligence' Japanese authorities were looking into the possibility of  endangerment of traffic caused by professional negligence , Japanese media reported, but it was not clear whether that might apply to either or both of the vessels. The U.S. Navy said the collision happened at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT Friday), while the Japanese Coast Guard said it was 1:30 a.m. local time. Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ACX Crystal, said in a statement on Saturday it would  cooperate fully  with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident. At around 29,000 tons displacement, the ship dwarfs the 8,315-ton U.S. warship. It was carrying 1,080 containers from the port of Nagoya to Tokyo. None of the 20 crew members aboard the container ship, all Filipino, were injured, and the ship was not leaking oil, Nippon Yusen said. The ship arrived at Tokyo Bay later on Saturday. The waterways approaching Tokyo Bay are busy with commercial vessels sailing to and from Japan’s two biggest container ports in Tokyo and Yokohama. But such collisions at sea are rare in an age of advanced navigational technology.  Naval historians recall possibly the last time a warship was hit by a larger vessel in peacetime was in 1964 off the coast of Australia’s New South Wales. The HMAS Melbourne, an aircraft carrier, collided with the destroyer HMAS Voyager, shearing the much smaller vessel in half and killing 82 of the Voyager's crew. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a message to U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday saying he was “in deep sorrow” over the Fitzgerald incident. He added that he “highly respects people involved in the U.S. military who every day make a big contribution for protecting peace for our nation and the region under the strong U.S.-Japan alliance.”  Reporting by Tim Kelly and Linda Sieg; Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Bill Tarrant","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-navy-asia-idUSKBN199020"},

The Treasury excludes any suggestion of a banking resolution,  a Treasury source said. According to La Stampa daily the European Commission will tell Italy in coming days it cannot inject public money to rescue Veneto Banca [VBANC.UL] and rival Banca Popolare di Vicenza [BPVS.UL]. Citing sources at the Italian Treasury and EU institutions, the newspaper said Rome's plan of using a precautionary recapitalization to save the two lenders by using more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 bln) of public funds was no longer viable. Instead the branches and assets of the two banks would be hived off into a  good  bank while the non-performing loans would be placed in a  bad  bank, it said. Related CoverageItaly rules out resolution for Veneto banks: Treasury sourceA spokesman for the Commission said he could not confirm the report.  The Commission and the Italian authorities are working closely together to ensure a viable solution .     Rome has been trying for months to reach an agreement over a bailout to avoid their liquidation.     Talks with the European Commission have dragged on because Brussels wants private investors to pump 1.25 billion euros into the banks before any taxpayer money can be used to avert them being wound down.     But La Stampa said Rome had failed to find lenders willing to provide the private capital requested by the Commission.     It said talks with Italy's main banks in recent days had spoken of a resolution - the EU procedure to wind down a failing lender - of the two Veneto lenders and their sale at a symbolic price.     Earlier this month European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue by Santander.     La Stampa said it was still not clear who might buy the performing assets of the two Veneto lenders but said talks were most advanced with Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo.     However it cautioned that Italy's biggest retail bank was concerned about stretching its balance sheet and jeopardizing dividends, adding that any acquisition might prompt the European Central Bank to ask for a capital increase.     The Italian Treasury and Intesa Sanpaolo were not immediately available for comment.

The Treasury excludes any suggestion of a banking resolution,  a Treasury source said. According to La Stampa daily the European Commission will tell Italy in coming days it cannot inject public money to rescue Veneto Banca [VBANC.UL] and rival Banca Popolare di Vicenza [BPVS.UL]. Citing sources at the Italian Treasury and EU institutions, the newspaper said Rome's plan of using a precautionary recapitalization to save the two lenders by using more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 bln) of public funds was no longer viable. Instead the branches and assets of the two banks would be hived off into a  good  bank while the non-performing loans would be placed in a  bad  bank, it said. Related CoverageItaly rules out resolution for Veneto banks: Treasury sourceA spokesman for the Commission said he could not confirm the report.  The Commission and the Italian authorities are working closely together to ensure a viable solution .     Rome has been trying for months to reach an agreement over a bailout to avoid their liquidation.     Talks with the European Commission have dragged on because Brussels wants private investors to pump 1.25 billion euros into the banks before any taxpayer money can be used to avert them being wound down.     But La Stampa said Rome had failed to find lenders willing to provide the private capital requested by the Commission.     It said talks with Italy's main banks in recent days had spoken of a resolution - the EU procedure to wind down a failing lender - of the two Veneto lenders and their sale at a symbolic price.     Earlier this month European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue by Santander.     La Stampa said it was still not clear who might buy the performing assets of the two Veneto lenders but said talks were most advanced with Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo.     However it cautioned that Italy's biggest retail bank was concerned about stretching its balance sheet and jeopardizing dividends, adding that any acquisition might prompt the European Central Bank to ask for a capital increase.     The Italian Treasury and Intesa Sanpaolo were not immediately available for comment.

Sanchez made a surprise comeback in May when grassroots Socialist supporters re-elected him as leader eight months after he was ousted in an internal party rift. Socialist delegates rubber-stamped his appointment at a meeting on Sunday, after months of turmoil following poor results in two inconclusive national elections in 2015 and 2016.  The Socialists came second behind the conservative People's Party (PP) of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in those two ballots, but their score was severely dented as voters switched to a newer leftist rival, Podemos ( We Can ).  Sanchez's attempts early last year to forge an alliance with Podemos and other parties fell flat, but on Sunday he urged rivals to unite against Rajoy in a fragmented parliament.   We have an opportunity to come together every week with other parties in parliament to reverse and to dismantle a big part of the laws passed by the PP,  Sanchez told cheering party members in Madrid.  He said he would take aim at a PP labor reform which was criticized by unions for weakening workers' rights, and added that the Socialists would form a group with other parties to coordinate which laws to block or undo.

In civil lawsuits in the United States, plaintiffs need only show that the weight of evidence is on their side, meaning they have information to tip the scales above 50 percent in their favor, as opposed to criminal cases in which prosecutors must prove claims beyond a reasonable doubt.  At least 10 women have pending civil claims against Cosby in lawsuits filed in California and Massachusetts.  Two have brought claims against the 79-year-old entertainer for sexual assault. Others, barred from doing so because their  claims were too old, have brought defamation claims against him, saying he smeared their reputations by publicly denying their accusations. The judge in the criminal case against Cosby in Pennsylvania declared a mistrial on Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked and unable to reach a unanimous verdict on charges that Cosby sexually assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004. At the time, Constand worked at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University.  David Harris, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who specializes in criminal justice, said the hung jury did not mean that a civil jury would clear Cosby of liability. “There may not be enough evidence for a criminal conviction, but that does not rule out a civil verdict,” said Harris. Approximately 60 accusations of sexual assault have been made against Cosby over a number of years, but only Constand's resulted in criminal charges because the other alleged incidents were too old to prosecute. Cosby has denied all of the accusations. Constand herself sued Cosby in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed sum.  Women bringing civil cases would also likely find it easier to introduce testimony from other accusers to support claims that Cosby engaged in a pattern of assault, said Douglas Wigdor, a plaintiffs' attorney who represents clients in sexual harassment cases. Little testimony about other accusations against Cosby was allowed in the Pennsylvania trial because of the strict standards for admitting evidence in criminal cases.  Prosecutors had sought to have 13 other accusers testify in Constand's case, but the judge allowed only one, finding that more would unfairly prejudice the jury. Challenges All Around Bill Cosby leaves the Montgomery County Courthouse with his publicist Andrew Wyatt (3rd L), after a mistrial was declared in his sexual assault trial when the jury declared it could not reach a verdict in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S. June 17, 2017.Lucas JacksonEven with the lower standard of evidence in civil cases, Rodney Smolla, dean of Delaware Law School, said that plaintiffs bringing defamation claims faced a significant legal challenge.  In addition to proving that Cosby assaulted them, Smolla  said, they would have to establish that he said something about them beyond denying the allegations, such as calling them known liars or promiscuous. “The defamation case is this clever way of saying, If I say you raped me and you say it didn’t happen, then you’re defaming me by calling me a liar,” he said. “And that in itself is a difficult defamation case. It’s not a classic defamation case.” Smolla said the outcome of any civil case would depend on how jurors behave in terms of how seriously they take the case, how they relate to one another and how they deal with holdout jurors. “That is the human side of the legal system that can be hard to predict,” he said. Damages vs Jail Paul Callan, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson in a civil case against her ex-husband, former football star O.J. Simpson, after he was found not guilty of her murder, said courts are much stricter in excluding evidence in criminal cases because a conviction could lead to incarceration.  “In civil cases, the battle is over money damages, as opposed to sending someone to prison,  Callan said.  In my experience, the courts tend to be far more liberal in allowing both sides to introduce a greater volume of evidence than the stricter rules in criminal cases.  While Simpson was acquitted in the 1995 criminal case, a jury in the civil case ordered him to pay $25 million in punitive damages to the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman, who were together when they were killed. The jury also awarded $8.5 million in compensatory damages to Goldman's family. Before it could decide the awards, the jury in the civil case had to determine if O.J. Simpson was the killer. Callan said the $33.5 million awarded in the case reflected the jury's reaction to a double homicide and was larger than a potential award to someone who has civil claims against Cosby.  But in the aggregate, he said, Cosby could face a comparable award because of the number of alleged victims. (Story refiles to delete extraneous word in the fifth paragraph.)

(Reuters) - Pennsylvania prosecutors vowed to retry comedian Bill Cosby on sexual assault charges after a jury on Saturday failed to render a unanimous verdict despite 52 hours of deliberations in a case that echoed accusations made by dozens of women against him. Judge Steven O'Neill, of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, declared a mistrial on Saturday morning following a note from jurors saying that they were hopelessly deadlocked on three counts of aggravated sexual assault. The result was a victory for Cosby, 79, who had faced years in prison for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting college administrator Andrea Constand at his home near Philadelphia in 2004. But prosecutors immediately said they would seek a second trial, which O'Neill suggested could start within four months.  She's entitled to a verdict in this case,  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said at a news conference. Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, told reporters that the trial's outcome had  restored  his client's legacy. But Cosby's reputation remains in tatters, following a slew of sexual assault allegations from about 60 women that have destroyed the  America's dad  image he built as star of the long-running 1980s TV comedy  The Cosby Show.  Constand's claim was the only one to lead to criminal charges, with many of the others dating too far back to allow for prosecution. The entertainer had no visible reaction in court. As news reporters streamed out of the room, several other Cosby accusers, some in tears, waited in line to hug Constand, who smiled broadly and maintained her composure. 'You're Not Off the Hook' Outside the courthouse, as Cosby stood silently behind them, members of his team criticized the case against him.  This is what happens - juries are stuck when a prosecutor seeks to put someone in prison for things that are simply not presented in the courtroom,  said Angela Agrusa, one of Cosby's lawyers. In a statement read aloud by one of Cosby's aides, his wife, Camille, who attended only a couple of hours of the trial, took aim at the prosecutors and the judge.  How do I describe the district attorney? Heinously and exploitatively ambitious,  Camille Cosby said in the statement.  How do I describe the judge? Overtly arrogant and collaborating with the district attorney.  The mistrial was a blow to the dozens of women who have said they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, including several who attended the trial wearing buttons that read  We Stand in Truth.  Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy model who has accused Cosby of drugging and raping her decades ago, had a message for him.  You're not off the hook, buddy,  she said outside the courtroom. Constand did not speak to reporters, but her attorney, Dolores Troiani, said Constand was a  very spiritual person who believes everything happens for a reason.  Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (C) waves as he departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles MostollerCosby has denied all of the women's claims, saying that any sexual encounters were consensual. He still faces several civil lawsuits from at least 10 accusers. Cosby's starring role as beloved dad Heathcliff Huxtable in  The Cosby Show,  along with years of family-friendly standup comedy routines, made him a household name. He became an in-demand product endorser, appearing in commercials for Jell-O, Coca-Cola and Ford. He co-starred in the 1960s espionage show  I Spy,  the first black performer to star in a weekly American TV dramatic series.  But his live performing career stalled in 2015, as multiple accusers began going public with their stories. Jurors Revisited Testimony In Norristown, Pennsylvania, the jury struggled for days to agree on which version of the night in question to believe: Constand's or Cosby's. Slideshow (20 Images)Constand, then 31, met the married Cosby 15 years ago through her job as an administrator with the women's basketball team at Temple University in Philadelphia, where Cosby was a trustee and the school's most renowned alumnus. She testified that Cosby acted as a mentor before offering her unidentified pills one night that left her unable to stop his advances. Cosby's defense lawyers, however, argued that Constand's account could not be trusted after they pointed to numerous discrepancies in her statements to police in 2005, when she first reported the encounter, which occurred nearly a year earlier.  In more than a dozen notes to the judge, the jurors asked to revisit huge chunks of trial testimony, including Constand's account from the witness stand, her statements to police from 2005 and Cosby's sworn depositions taken in 2005 and 2006, when Constand filed a civil lawsuit against him. Cosby chose not to testify at the trial. By Thursday morning, after nearly 30 hours of discussions spanning three days, the jurors told O'Neill they were at a stalemate. The judge instructed them to keep working, but despite marathon 12-hour sessions, the jury said on Saturday it was at an impasse. The trial drew intense media attention, with more than 100 credentials issued for print, online, television and radio reporters. The case itself has followed a long path to prosecution. In 2005, prosecutors declined to charge Cosby based on Constand's account, and she filed a lawsuit that Cosby settled for an undisclosed sum. His depositions in that case, however, were unsealed by a federal judge in 2015, revealing his admissions that he had given sedatives to young women in the 1970s and prompting prosecutors to reopen the case. He was eventually charged in December 2015, just days before the statute of limitations was set to expire. Although the district attorney has vowed to try the case again, Steele may have difficulty in winning an eventual conviction, according to former prosecutors and defense lawyers. Cosby's legal team has now seen the prosecution's whole case and can home in on inconsistencies the second time around, they say.

The frontier runs for 104 km (65 miles) through farmland, woods and low hills, in an area known as the Suwalki Gap. If seized by Russia, it would cut off Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Over two days, U.S. helicopters and British aircraft took part in exercises that also involved troops from Poland, Lithuania and Croatia in a simulated defense of the potential flashpoint.  The gap is vulnerable because of the geography. It's not inevitable that there's going to be an attack, of course, but ... if that was closed, then you have three allies that are north that are potentially isolated from the rest of the alliance , U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges told Reuters. Russia denies any plans to invade the Baltics, and says it is NATO that is threatening stability in Eastern Europe by building up its military presence there and staging such war games. But Hodges, who commands U.S. forces in Europe, said it was crucial for the alliance to show it was ready.  We have to practice, we have to demonstrate that we can support allies in keeping (the Gap) open, in maintaining that connection,  he said.

Before then, no forces from other alliance members were stationed in the Baltic states; now four battlegroups totaling just over 4,500 troops have been  deployed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The Poles have been pushing other NATO allies to use some of these troops to secure the vulnerable Suwalki corridor and deter potential Russian aggression. But while 1,500 troops took part in this weekend's exercises, a Lithuanian commander cautioned that it would take more to defend the gap in the event of a genuine conflict. Slideshow (6 Images) This is only a small-scale drill compared to what would be needed in case of a real attack, but it is important for us because it shows that allies share our worries , said Brigadier General Valdemaras Rupsys, head of Lithuania's land forces.          Simulating a covert insertion of forces, three American helicopters landed in a field in rural Lithuania on Saturday, startling grazing horses and cows, in an area several hours' drive from where a U.S. battalion is stationed at Orzysz base in Poland.  The training helps present a credible defense force that hopefully will deter aggression, but if not, we'll be prepared to move to defend the borders of NATO,  said Lt. Col. Steven Gventer, who leads the U.S. battlegroup in Orzysz. NATO officials believe Moscow will hold its own exercise in Russia and Belarus on a much greater scale in September, possibly involving 100,000 troops, under the codename  Zapad  (West). Baltic officials believe Moscow will also rehearse an attack on the Suwalki Gap during Zapad.

At one of the most important junctures for Europe and the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, May's government is reeling from a crisis of her own making - the loss of her parliamentary majority in a June 8 snap election she did not need to call. Such is the collapse of May's authority that her entire Brexit strategy is being picked apart in public by her ministers, her lawmakers and her allies on the eve of formal negotiations which begin in Brussels on Monday at 0900 GMT. Despite signals from both France and Germany last week that  Britain would still be welcome to stay if it changed its mind,  Brexit minister David Davis insisted on Sunday there would be no turning back.     As I head to Brussels to open official talks to leave the EU, there should be no doubt — we are leaving the European Union,  said Davis, who will launch the talks with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.  Now, the hard work begins. We must secure a deal that works for all parts of the United Kingdom, and enables us to become a truly global Britain.  Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy. But the other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. They also have a strong incentive to deny the UK a deal so attractive it might encourage others to follow the British example. With May still hammering out the details of a post-election deal to stay in power with the support of a small Northern Irish party, there are fears of a disorderly exit that would weaken the West, imperil Britain's $2.5 trillion economy and undermine London's position as the only financial center to rival New York. Compounding the pressures on the British leader, she has been widely accused of failing to show enough empathy with victims of a horrific tower block fire in London last week. One European diplomat in London said the political upheaval was such that it was difficult to know what to write back to his capital, pouring scorn on May's campaign slogan of 'strong and stable leadership'. Related CoverageBritish minister Leadsom says possible to strike Brexit deal in time frame What can you say of meaning about such chaos?  the diplomat asked.  I suppose it isn't quite a strong and stable Brexit yet.  What Kind of Brexit? Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: only 15 years ago, British leaders were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of a motley crew of skeptics on the fringes of both major parties. But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron prompted Britain to vote by 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 23 referendum last year. Leaving the EU - the biggest blow since World War Two to  European efforts at forging unity - is now the official consensus of both the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party. FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to travel to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen's permission to form a minority government, in London, June 9, 2017.Toby Melville/File PhotoAmid such upheaval, though, there is little agreement on what kind of Brexit May should try for - even assuming she can hold onto her job.  The United Kingdom's political tectonic plates are moving at the very moment when we are negotiating Brexit,  said Anand Menon, professor of politics at King's College London. Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU: leaving its single market, which enshrines free movement of people, goods, services and capital, and proposing limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. Opponents describe that as a  hard Brexit . They argue instead for a  soft  version, prioritizing some form of continued access to the single market in order to minimize economic damage. While European leaders try to gauge what to expect from Britain, May is so weakened that her own finance minister and the partners on whom she will rely for her majority, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, are giving her public guidance.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations,  finance minister Philip Hammond said. Slideshow (4 Images)Dog's Breakfast While Britain's economy has shown unexpected resilience since the Brexit vote, there are signs of weakness. Business leaders say the uncertainty means they are having to plan on the assumption that Britain leaves without a proper deal.  Everything is all over the place,  said a senior executive responsible for Brexit preparations at a FTSE 100 company.   It's a bit of a dog's breakfast at the moment because there is a lot of maneuvering and a lot of moving parts.   Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending. Opponents of Brexit fear that ditching a 60-year strategy of trying to hedge European integration with a special relationship with Washington or a brittle Commonwealth of former colonies would undermine what remains of Britain's global influence. The first issue at the Brussels talks will be the status of millions of EU citizens living in the United Kingdom and British residents of the other 27 countries, including their right to stay, to work, and to access medical care. The extent of Britain's exit bill needs to be decided, with the EU27 expected to seek tens of billions of euros they see as London's fair share of programs to which it has committed. The situation in Ireland - where the only land border between the EU and United Kingdom will lie - will also be discussed. May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship before Britain leaves, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of Brexit. The EU wants to deal with the first phase of divorce talks before moving on next year to discuss trade, though EU officials acknowledge that the agreements to be reached before Britain leaves can only be concluded as a whole package simultaneously. Three days after the talks begin, May is due to travel to Brussels for an EU summit - a chance for the other 27 leaders to take stock of their negotiating partner in the sharply altered climate brought about by the dramas of the past two weeks.

The temporary ban comes into effect on July 11, Demerdash told Reuters on Sunday, adding that the memo received from Saudi Arabia did not specify the levels of residues detected or name the companies that have committed violations.  Egypt will not face large losses due to the ban as the exporting season for strawberries ended on April 10,  Demerdash said. He added that strawberries represent 5-10 percent of the country's total agricultural exports.  Since a currency float in November, which roughly cut the pound's value in half, Egyptian exports have been welcomed in new markets due to their increased competitiveness.  Exports of Egyptian vegetables, fruits and legumes amounted to $2.2 billion last year. The main fruit exports include oranges and strawberries. A series of bans of Egyptian exports however has hurt the image of an import-dependent country seeking to step up exports and curb imports in an effort to narrow its trade deficit.  Exports could also help bring in desperately needed foreign currency that has been low in supply as a result of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that drove away tourists and investors.

Rosneft and its partners plan to invest 480 billion rubles ($8.4 billion) in developing Russia's offshore energy industry in the next five years, part of a drive to boost output from new areas. The company has sought tie-ups with several global oil players to develop Russia's offshore regions. But a deal to work in the Kara Sea in the western Arctic with U.S. company Exxon Mobil was suspended in 2014 after the imposition of Western sanctions against Moscow.   The result of the drilling at the Khatanga license block allows Rosneft to be considered the discoverer of (oil) fields in offshore Eastern Arctic,  the company said in a statement. Most Russian oil output comes from western Siberia, where fields are depleting, pushing producers to look for new regions. Sanctions complicate the process, barring Western companies from helping with Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil projects. The Arctic offshore area is expected to account for between 20 and 30 percent of Russian production, one of the world's largest, by 2050. Rosneft owns 28 blocks in the Arctic offshore area with combined estimated resources of 34 billion tonnes of oil equivalent.  There is only one offshore platform in the Russian Arctic, Prirazlomnoye, operated by Gazprom Neft, which plans to produce 2.6 million tonnes (52,000 barrels per day) this year.

Rosneft and its partners plan to invest 480 billion rubles ($8.4 billion) in developing Russia's offshore energy industry in the next five years, part of a drive to boost output from new areas. The company has sought tie-ups with several global oil players to develop Russia's offshore regions. But a deal to work in the Kara Sea in the western Arctic with U.S. company Exxon Mobil was suspended in 2014 after the imposition of Western sanctions against Moscow.   The result of the drilling at the Khatanga license block allows Rosneft to be considered the discoverer of (oil) fields in offshore Eastern Arctic,  the company said in a statement. Most Russian oil output comes from western Siberia, where fields are depleting, pushing producers to look for new regions. Sanctions complicate the process, barring Western companies from helping with Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil projects. The Arctic offshore area is expected to account for between 20 and 30 percent of Russian production, one of the world's largest, by 2050. Rosneft owns 28 blocks in the Arctic offshore area with combined estimated resources of 34 billion tonnes of oil equivalent.  There is only one offshore platform in the Russian Arctic, Prirazlomnoye, operated by Gazprom Neft, which plans to produce 2.6 million tonnes (52,000 barrels per day) this year. Analysts say oil production in the region - apart from Prirazlomnoye - is years away and may start only in the mid-2020s Rosneft has been working in the Laptev Sea since 2014. It values the hydrocarbon resources of the sea at around 9.5 billion tonnes of oil equivalent.

The riyal QAR=, officially fixed at 3.64 to the dollar since 2001, has been offered as low as 3.6680 since Saudi Arabia and other Arab states cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism. That was not a big move in absolute terms, less than 1 percent, but it marked the weakest spot market rate since July 2005, Thomson Reuters data shows.  Furthermore, previous dips in the riyal QAR= were usually one-day affairs, but this time the Qatari currency has been quoted significantly weaker than its peg for two weeks. Gulf bankers inside and outside Qatar, however, said they did not think the spot market quotes showed any change in Qatar's determination or ability to maintain the peg. Instead, they said, the fluctuations seemed to be the result of the way in which economic sanctions against Qatar have distorted trading between banks. Many Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Bahraini banks have cut back or suspended trading with Qatari institutions, fearing the displeasure of their governments. International banks have become more cautious because of political risk. This has slowed foreign exchange trade, particularly between banks operating onshore and offshore, and caused bottlenecks in the supply of dollars to offshore institutions, pushing down the riyal.  The fact that the spot quote has gone below the peg is due to low liquidity, not a change in Qatar's policy,  said a treasury manager at a Saudi bank, speaking on condition of anonymity because of political sensitivities.  He noted that in the past, the Saudi riyal SAR= had also fluctuated by significant margins around its dollar peg because of temporary liquidity squeezes, even though Riyadh's central bank had maintained the peg. A Dubai-based fixed income portfolio manager said he didn't view the move of the spot rate off the peg as alarming.  It might be a sign of a little speculative pressure, hard to say. It doesn't seem like banks have had massive outflow pressure from Qatar,  he said. Central Bank The emir's 2001 decree establishing the peg said the  central bank would  buy the dollar at a rate not exceeding 3.6385 riyals and sell the dollar at a rate not exceeding 3.6415 riyals to the banks operating in the State of Qatar . It is continuing to do this, bankers said. A treasury banker at a Qatari bank in Doha said his institution remained able to obtain dollar supplies it needed from the central bank.  We can buy dollars from the central bank,  he said.  We are selling dollars in the market at 3.6415.  Because links between onshore Qatari banks and offshore banks in centers such as Bahrain and London have been damaged by the sanctions, however, these supplies are not reaching all corners of the market promptly. Some traders said they were surprised the central bank had not acted immediately to quash any speculation about a change to the peg by releasing huge amounts of dollars into the market. In his only public statement since the crisis erupted, central bank governor Skeikh Abdullah bin Saoud Al-Thani declared last week that Doha had  sufficient foreign currency reserves to meet all requirements  but did not explicitly mention the peg. However, bankers in the Gulf noted the emir's decree did not commit the central bank to massive intervention as soon as the spot rate moved off the peg; it merely said the bank had the right to determine the volume and timing of dollar sales. Skeikh Abdullah has rarely talked publicly about the peg in the past, and may be reluctant to do so now as that could draw the currency market's attention, raising pressure on the riyal. His strategy may be working; after falling sharply in the offshore forwards market QAR1Y=W, which banks use to hedge exchange rates 12 months from now, the riyal has come off its lows in the past few days. The central bank has $34.5 billion of net foreign reserves and the government may have more than $200 billion of additional liquid assets in its sovereign wealth fund. So for now, Qatar seems in no danger of running out of money to defend the peg.  There is no reason for the riyal to be de-pegged in the short term,  said the Qatari banker.  They have enough resources.

Abe has repeatedly denied abusing his authority to benefit his friend. His grip on power is not in danger, given his ruling coalition's huge majority in parliament, but the affair looks unlikely to fade away. The education ministry unearthed documents last week that the opposition said suggested Abe wanted a new veterinary school run by a friend to be approved in a state-run special economic zone. The ministry had earlier said it could not find the documents but reopened the probe under public pressure. Opposition politicians and the media have identified Abe's friend as Kotaro Kake, the director of the Kake Educational Institution, which wants to open a veterinary department. The government has not approved new veterinary schools for decades because of concern about a glut of veterinarians. Nearly 85 percent of voters responding to a Kyodo news agency survey said they did not think the government probe had uncovered the truth of the affair and almost 74 percent were not persuaded by the government's insistence that there was nothing wrong with the approval process. The institution has said it had acted appropriately.  Voters were split over last week's enactment by parliament of a controversial law that will penalize conspiracies to commit terrorism and other serious crimes, with 42.1 percent in favor and 44 percent against the legislation, Kyodo said. The government says the new legislation is needed so Japan can ratify a U.N. treaty aimed at global organized crime and prevent terrorism in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Opponents say it will allow police to trample on civil liberties by expanding the scope for surveillance.  The ruling coalition pushed the law through parliament last week, taking the rare step of skipping a vote in committee and going directly to a full session of parliament's upper house. Almost 68 percent of voters expressed dislike of that rarely used tactic, Kyodo said.

The proposed amendment to the country's securities law was drawn up by the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) and other government offices and submitted to the cabinet by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon. It now heads to parliament, where it is expected to be fast-tracked, giving it priority over other bills, an ISA spokeswoman said. The draft law also prohibits any type of trading forum that sells to overseas clients - even if they do not offer binary options - without receiving a license from the country where clients reside.  Breaking the law will be punishable by up to two years in prison and if money laundering is involved, punishment could reach 10 years in prison.   Beyond the severe economic harm to citizens around the world, marketers of binary options are increasingly causing reputational damage and inflaming anti-Semitism towards Jews and Israelis,  ISA Chairman Shmuel Hauser said in a statement. Israeli regulators have received many complaints regarding losses suffered by binary option traders in various countries, the statement said.  Binary options involve placing a bet on whether the value of a financial asset - a currency, commodity or stock - will rise or fall in a fixed timeframe, sometimes as short as a minute. Israel already banned the domestic sale of binary options last year, the first country to do so. The owner of an Israeli binary options firm was arrested on suspicion of fraud and extortion last month after an investor abroad reported losses of more than $500,000 to the online company, the first arrest since authorities announced a crackdown. A Reuters special report published in September shed light on the rapid rise of the industry in Israel.

Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin declined to say how many of the seven missing sailors had been recovered, but Japanese media said all had died. “Out of concern for the families and the notification process, I will decline to state how many we have found at this time,” Aucoin told a news conference. The search at sea had ended, Aucoin said. The USS Fitzgerald could have foundered, or even sunk, but for the crew's desperate efforts to save the ship, he said.  The damage was significant. There was a big gash under the water,  Aucoin said at Yokosuka naval base, home of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the docked Fitzgerald behind him.     A significant portion of the crew was sleeping  when the destroyer collided with the Philippine-flagged container ship,  destroying the commander's cabin, he said. The Fitzgerald is salvageable, he said, but repairs will likely take months.  Hopefully less than a year. You will see the USS Fitzgerald back,  Aucoin said. Multiple U.S. and Japanese investigations are under way on how a ship as large as the container could ram into the warship in clear weather.  Aucoin was asked if damage on the starboard side indicated the U.S. ship could have been at fault, but he declined to speculate on the cause of the collision. Maritime rules suggest vessels are supposed to give way to ships on their starboard.  Limping Into Port     The Seventh Fleet said in a statement earlier on Sunday:  Divers were able to access the space and found a number of bodies.  They were transferred to a U.S. naval hospital for identification, it said. The Fitzgerald collided with the merchant vessel more than three times its size some 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka early on Saturday. Three people were medically evacuated to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka after the collision, including the ship's commanding officer, Bryce Benson, who was reported to be in stable condition, the Navy said. Personnel are seen on the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald which has been damaged by colliding with a Philippine-flagged merchant vessel, at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, June 18, 2017.Toru HanaiThe other two were being treated for lacerations and bruises. The Fitzgerald limped into port on Saturday evening, listing around 5 degrees, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Yokosuka said. The flooding was in two berthing compartments, the radio room and auxiliary machine room, he said. There were 285 crew onboard, the spokesman said. Benson took command of the Fitzgerald on May 13. He had previously commanded a minesweeper based in Sasebo in western Japan. Slideshow (12 Images)'Professional Negligence' Japanese authorities were looking into the possibility of  endangerment of traffic caused by professional negligence , Japanese media reported, but it was not clear whether that might apply to either or both of the vessels. The U.S. Navy said the collision happened at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT Friday), while the Japanese Coast Guard said it was 1:30 a.m. local time. Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ACX Crystal, said in a statement on Saturday it would  cooperate fully  with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident. At around 29,000 tons displacement, the ship dwarfs the 8,315-ton U.S. warship. It was carrying 1,080 containers from the port of Nagoya to Tokyo. None of the 20 crew members aboard the container ship, all Filipino, were injured, and the ship was not leaking oil, Nippon Yusen said. The ship arrived at Tokyo Bay later on Saturday. The waterways approaching Tokyo Bay are busy with commercial vessels sailing to and from Japan’s two biggest container ports in Tokyo and Yokohama. But such collisions at sea are rare in an age of advanced navigational technology.  Naval historians recall possibly the last time a warship was hit by a larger vessel in peacetime was in 1964 off the coast of Australia’s New South Wales. The HMAS Melbourne, an aircraft carrier, collided with the destroyer HMAS Voyager, shearing the much smaller vessel in half and killing 82 of the Voyager's crew. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a message to U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday saying he was “in deep sorrow” over the Fitzgerald incident. He added that he “highly respects people involved in the U.S. military who every day make a big contribution for protecting peace for our nation and the region under the strong U.S.-Japan alliance.”  Reporting by Tim Kelly and Linda Sieg; Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Bill Tarrant","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-navy-asia-idUSL3N1JE0AN"},

The proposed amendment to the country's securities law was drawn up by the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) and other government offices and submitted to the cabinet by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon. It now heads to parliament, where it is expected to be fast-tracked, giving it priority over other bills, an ISA spokeswoman said. The draft law also prohibits any type of trading forum that sells to overseas clients - even if they do not offer binary options - without receiving a license from the country where clients reside.  Breaking the law will be punishable by up to two years in prison and if money laundering is involved, punishment could reach 10 years in prison.   Beyond the severe economic harm to citizens around the world, marketers of binary options are increasingly causing reputational damage and inflaming anti-Semitism towards Jews and Israelis,  ISA Chairman Shmuel Hauser said in a statement. Israeli regulators have received many complaints regarding losses suffered by binary option traders in various countries, the statement said.  Binary options involve placing a bet on whether the value of a financial asset - a currency, commodity or stock - will rise or fall in a fixed timeframe, sometimes as short as a minute. Israel already banned the domestic sale of binary options last year, the first country to do so. The owner of an Israeli binary options firm was arrested on suspicion of fraud and extortion last month after an investor abroad reported losses of more than $500,000 to the online company, the first arrest since authorities announced a crackdown. A Reuters special report published in September shed light on the rapid rise of the industry in Israel.

Officials from the Saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for a comment on the report. Yemen has been torn by a civil war in which the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to roll back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. The director of the Houthi-run Health Department office in Saada said the aircraft conducted two raids on al-Mashnaq market in Shada district, which is close to the Saudi border, on Saturday, killing 25 people and wounding at least one.  Rescue teams were unable to reach the area for some time for fear of being hit by artillery shelling of the area,  the official, Dr Abdelilah al-Azzi, told Reuters by telephone. Reuters could not independently confirm the report because the area is located very close to the frontline, but several Yemeni online news outlets carried a similar report. A Saudi-led coalition air strike killed 22 people and wounded dozens when it struck a market in western Yemen near the Red Sea fishing town of Khoukha in March. Khoukha and the nearby city of Hodeidah are controlled by the Houthis who overran Sanaa in 2014 and moved south to Aden in 2015 forcing Hadi and his administration to flee into exile. The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than three million and ruined much of the impoverished country's infrastructure. The Saudi-led coalition was formed in 2015 to fight the Houthis and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh who have fired missiles into neighboring Saudi Arabia. In December, the coalition acknowledged it had made  limited use  of British-made cluster bombs, but said it had stopped using them. Nearly half of Yemen's 22 provinces are on the verge of famine, according to the U.N. World Food Programme.

Maybin homered and recorded two RBIs in Saturday’s 9-0 victory and is batting .388 with 14 extra-base hits in his last 20 games for the Angels, who embark on a daunting eight-game road trip against the New York Yankees, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers that begins Tuesday.

The Astros look to string together consecutive victories for the first time since putting the final touches on their 11-game winning streak early last week when they host the Red Sox on Sunday for the rubber match of their three-game set. Houston (46-23) moved to 42-16 on June 5 before watching the longest winning streak in the majors get snapped the following night at Kansas City - a setback that began a 3-7 tailspin for the team with the best record in baseball. The most recent of the Astros' losses over that stretch was Friday's 2-1 defeat as Boston's relievers worked 2 2/3 solid frames to extend their scoreless streak to 24 innings, but Houston tagged Rick Porcello for seven runs in Saturday's 7-1 triumph. Jose Altuve, who is 7-for-10 with four doubles, a homer and five runs scored over his last three contests, sparked a pair of three-run innings with an RBI double in the first and a solo blast in the third.

The 2012 AL Cy Young Award winner has allowed at least one home run in each start and struggled with free passes over his last two outings, issuing eight. Price won his only turn against the Astros last season, giving up one run in 6 2/3 innings, but he has struggled against Altuve (6-for-17) and Brian McCann (10-for-29, three homers). Musgrove returned from a stint on the disabled list to suffer a loss against Texas on Monday after surrendering two runs on five hits and a walk in 4 2/3 frames. The 24-year-old enjoyed his finest turn of the season prior to his injury on May 26, throwing seven scoreless innings in a win versus Baltimore. Musgrove is only 2-5 with a 5.05 ERA at home in 2017 entering his first start against Boston - a far cry from the 3-1 record and 1.75 ERA he posted at Minute Maid Park in six late-season games (five starts) last year.

On Friday, Amazon.com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc , the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world. The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar, but by who is better at both. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector, a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war. German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart, which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market, with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer. The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart. Amazon's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant's business - groceries, which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart's $486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. With the deal, Whole Foods’ more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart’s 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population. Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods' notoriously high prices, enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart's customers. The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday, menswear e-tailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart may be ready. In preparation for the grocery price war, Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices, improved fresh food and meat offerings, modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles, and expanded its online grocery pickup service. Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon, told Reuters in an interview that Amazon's move does not change Wal-Mart's game plan.  We're playing offense,  he said. Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations, with 300 more planned by year end. It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores.  We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that,  Lore said. Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group, said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar advantage.  I think this acquisition is a concern,  he said. Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers. But Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers. Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores, and is targeted at younger, value-conscious shoppers. Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big.  That (Whole Foods 365) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart,  Grant said. Amazon, which reported $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $10.2 billion in the year ended March 31, has plenty to spend. Wal-Mart reported $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31. Brittain Ladd, a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy, said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future. Ladd, who left Amazon in March, said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts.

On Friday, Amazon.com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc, the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world. The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar, but by who is better at both. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector, a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war. German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart, which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market, with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer. The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart. Amazon's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant's business - groceries, which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart's $486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. With the deal, Whole Foods’ more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart’s 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population. Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods' notoriously high prices, enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart's customers. The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday, menswear e-tailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart may be ready. In preparation for the grocery price war, Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices, improved fresh food and meat offerings, modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles, and expanded its online grocery pickup service. Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon, told Reuters in an interview that Amazon's move does not change Wal-Mart's game plan.  We're playing offense,  he said. Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations, with 300 more planned by year end. It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores.  We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that,  Lore said. Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group, said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar advantage. The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal Rossignol I think this acquisition is a concern,  he said. Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers. But Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers. Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores, and is targeted at younger, value-conscious shoppers. Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big. Slideshow (3 Images) That (Whole Foods 365) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart,  Grant said. Amazon, which reported $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $10.2 billion in the year ended March 31, has plenty to spend. Wal-Mart reported $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31. Brittain Ladd, a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy, said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future.  Ladd, who left Amazon in March, said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts. It will select merchandise based on Amazon's vaunted customer data, and potentially expects the use of technology to change prices during the course of a day. Amazon declined comment on competition with Walmart but spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company has no plans to cut jobs or use technology in development at its Seattle Amazon Go store to automate jobs of cashiers.

Congressional and administration staff have begun to examine options to address profit-shifting schemes that include so-called transfer pricing, earnings stripping and tax inversions. A decision on how to handle these in tax legislation could come before Congress leaves town for its one-week July 4 recess on June 29, officials and lobbyists said. Lawmakers say the current tax code incentivizes profit shifting overseas because of the high 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate and rules that allow companies to hold profits abroad tax free until returned to U.S. soil. Without effective measures against tax avoidance, experts and lobbyists said tax legislation could trigger a new exodus of income and assets abroad. Because Trump and Republicans in Congress also want to end U.S. taxes on foreign earnings, companies could eliminate their U.S. tax bills altogether without restrictions. Tax reduction strategies have been employed for decades by companies including Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc. Independent analysts estimate the federal government misses out on more than $100 billion a year in corporate tax revenues as a result of tax reduction maneuvers. That is equal to one-third of the $300 billion in annual corporate tax revenues. Many schemes seek lower corporate tax bills through  transfer pricing  - using transactions between business units to shift income abroad. The shift often coincides with the transfer of intangible assets such as intellectual property to low-tax nations where companies can expect single-digit tax rates. Last week, Senate Finance Committee Democrats asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to leave in place regulations adopted under President Barack Obama to combat earnings stripping and tax inversions. Companies use earnings stripping to shift income abroad as tax-deductible interest payments to foreign affiliates. Inversions are international mergers in which U.S. companies move their headquarters to foreign countries with low taxes, if only on paper, to lower their U.S. tax bills. Companies have accumulated some $2.6 trillion in abroad, equivalent to more than three-quarters of the $3.3 trillion in annual government receipts expected this year. Border-Adjustment Tax But the most effective measures against corporate tax avoidance schemes, including House Speaker Paul Ryan's controversial border-adjustment tax, or BAT, have proved unpopular, raising the possibility that tax legislation could simply cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent to reduce the advantages offered by foreign tax havens. Aside from BAT, which taxes imports but not exports, tax reform discussions are also looking at a minimum tax on profits from tax havens, a tax on intangible income and other measures to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries where they do little actual business, according to aides and lobbyists. Lobbyists said none of the options have enjoyed consensus support in Congress. Meanwhile, the idea of a simple rate cut does not sit well with House Republican leaders.  Even with a low rate, we'll continue to see U.S. jobs and research and headquarters move overseas,  said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a leading BAT proponent. Experts warn that the 15 percent rate sought by Trump is well above a 5 percent effective rate that some corporations pay in countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Brady and Ryan are expected to address the issue in coming weeks with Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. The six are trying to forge legislation that could be unveiled as early as September. Trump has pledged the biggest tax overhaul since Ronald Reagan.

Citing sources at the Italian Treasury and EU institutions, La Stampa daily said Rome's plan of using a precautionary recapitalisation to save the two lenders by using more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of public funds was no longer viable. Instead the branches and assets of the two banks would be hived off into a good bank while the non-performing loans would be placed in a bad bank, it said. A spokesman for the Commission said he could not confirm the report.  The Commission and the Italian authorities are working closely together to ensure a viable solution . Rome has been trying for months to reach an agreement over a bailout of Veneto Banca and rival Banca Popolare di Vicenza to avoid their liquidation. Talks with the European Commission have dragged on because Brussels wants private investors to pump 1.25 billion euros into the banks before any taxpayer money can be used to avert them being wound down. But La Stampa said Rome had failed to find lenders willing to provide the private capital requested by the Commission. It said talks with Italy's main banks in recent days had spoken of a resolution of the two Veneto lenders and their sale at a symbolic price. Earlier this month European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue by Santander. La Stampa said it was still not clear who might buy the performing assets of the two Veneto lenders but said talks were most advanced with Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo. However it cautioned that Italy's biggest retail bank was concerned about stretching its balance sheet and jeopordising dividends, adding that any acquisition might prompt the European Central Bank to ask for a capital increase. The Italian Treasury and Intesa Sanpaolo were not immediately available for comment. Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Friday he was confident a solution for the two banks could soon be reached.

The head of the air base in Tarakan, a town in the Indonesian province of North Kalimantan on Borneo, said three Sukhoi jets that arrived on Friday would remain for a month in case radicals fighting the Philippine military in Marawi City sought to escape to Indonesia.   The militants might flee the Philippines and be forced to cross the border to Indonesia,  the Indonesian state news agency cited Colonel Didik Krisyanto as saying. The Philippine military said on Friday that some of the Islamist militants who stormed Marawi City in the south of the country last month may have mingled with evacuees to slip away during the battle that has raged for almost four weeks. The military says that up to 200 fighters, most of them from local insurgent groups that have pledged allegiance to Islamic State but also some foreign fighters, are holding out, using civilians as human shields and mosques as safe havens. The devastating collapse in security has alarmed neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia, and defense and army chiefs from the three countries are due to meet in Tarakan on Monday for a ceremony to mark the launch of patrols in the seas between the countries. A port town, Tarakan is just south of the Malaysian side of Borneo and looks out across the sea to Mindanao in the southern Philippines, a sprawling island that has been plagued by insurgencies and banditry for decades. Indonesian naval authorities had also asked local people including fishermen in border areas facing the Philippines to report any suspicious people, Antara reported.  A police mobile brigade corp had also been sent to northern areas on Sulawesi island to prevent militants from crossing the border, it said. On Monday, Indonesia will inaugurate a maritime command center in Tarakan and also hold a ceremony on an Indonesian warship with Malaysian and Philippine officials to launch patrols.   Singapore and Brunei will be attending as observers.      The commander of Tarakan's naval base, First Admiral Ferial Fachroni, told Reuters the other countries would also establish  command centers to help in the sharing of information.

The EU, which seeks to promote free speech and end capital punishment around the world, was due to make its statement last week at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, but failed to win the necessary agreement from all 28 EU states. It marked the first time the EU had failed to make its statement at the U.N.'s top rights body, rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said. A Greek foreign ministry official said Athens blocked the statement, calling it  unconstructive criticism of China  and said separate EU talks with China outside the U.N. were a better avenue for discussions. An EU official confirmed the statement had been blocked. Presented three times a year, the statement gives the EU a way to highlight abuses by states around the world on issues that other countries are unwilling to raise. The impasse is the latest blow to the EU's credentials as a defender of human rights, three diplomats said, and raises questions about the economically powerful EU's  soft power  that relies on inspiring countries to follow its example by outlawing the death penalty and upholding press freedoms. It also underscores the EU's awkward ties with China, its second-largest trade partner, diplomats said. Brussels has welcomed Beijing as an ally against U.S. President Donald Trump in the fight against climate change and trade protectionism. But as business ties grow, the bloc is struggling to speak out against a Chinese government crackdown on human rights lawyers and other activists since 2015. China's COSCO Shipping, owner of the world's fourth-largest container fleet, took a 51 percent stake in Greece's largest port last year. Hungary, another large recipient of Chinese investment, has repeatedly blocked EU statements criticising China's rights record under communist President Xi Jinping, diplomats said. One EU diplomat expressed frustration that Greece's decision to block the statement came at the same time the International Monetary Fund and EU governments agreed to release funds under Greece's emergency financial bailout last week in Luxembourg.

Iran has denied any links to the alleged cell. Some Kuwaiti officials and some other Gulf Arab countries, mostly ruled by Sunnis, accuse Tehran of seeking to weaken them by infiltrating local Shi'ite communities and stirring up local politics. The so-called  Abdali cell  was uncovered when security forces raided a farmhouse in Abdali outside Kuwait City in 2015 and found a cache of guns and explosives. In January, a court found 23 guilty of various crimes, including intent to carry out  hostile acts  against Kuwait and possessing weapons. On Sunday, the country's Court of Cassation commuted the death sentence for one man to life in prison, a statement on state news agency KUNA said, without specifying defendants' names. It also lowered the life sentence for another man to 15 years in prison, and sentenced several others previously judged  not guilty  to 10 years. Relations between Sunnis - who make up to 85 percent of Kuwait's 1.4 million citizens - and the minority Shi'ite community have been mostly amicable, but rivalry between its neighbors Iran and Saudi Arabia have strained that harmony.

At one of the most important junctures for Europe and the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, May's government is reeling from a crisis of her own making - the loss of her parliamentary majority in a June 8 snap election she did not need to call. Such is the collapse of May's authority that her entire Brexit strategy is being picked apart in public by her ministers, her lawmakers and her allies on the eve of formal negotiations which begin in Brussels on Monday at 0900 GMT. Despite signals from both France and Germany last week that  Britain would still be welcome to stay if it changed its mind,  Brexit minister David Davis insisted on Sunday there would be no turning back.     As I head to Brussels to open official talks to leave the EU, there should be no doubt — we are leaving the European Union,  said Davis, who will launch the talks with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.  Now, the hard work begins. We must secure a deal that works for all parts of the United Kingdom, and enables us to become a truly global Britain.  Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy. But the other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. They also have a strong incentive to deny the UK a deal so attractive it might encourage others to follow the British example. With May still hammering out the details of a post-election deal to stay in power with the support of a small Northern Irish party, there are fears of a disorderly exit that would weaken the West, imperil Britain's $2.5 trillion economy and undermine London's position as the only financial center to rival New York. Compounding the pressures on the British leader, she has been widely accused of failing to show enough empathy with victims of a horrific tower block fire in London last week. One European diplomat in London said the political upheaval was such that it was difficult to know what to write back to his capital, pouring scorn on May's campaign slogan of 'strong and stable leadership'. Related CoverageBritish minister Leadsom says possible to strike Brexit deal in time frame What can you say of meaning about such chaos?  the diplomat asked.  I suppose it isn't quite a strong and stable Brexit yet.  What Kind of Brexit? Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: only 15 years ago, British leaders were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of a motley crew of skeptics on the fringes of both major parties. But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron prompted Britain to vote by 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 23 referendum last year. Leaving the EU - the biggest blow since World War Two to  European efforts at forging unity - is now the official consensus of both the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party. FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to travel to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen's permission to form a minority government, in London, June 9, 2017.Toby Melville/File PhotoAmid such upheaval, though, there is little agreement on what kind of Brexit May should try for - even assuming she can hold onto her job.  The United Kingdom's political tectonic plates are moving at the very moment when we are negotiating Brexit,  said Anand Menon, professor of politics at King's College London. Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU: leaving its single market, which enshrines free movement of people, goods, services and capital, and proposing limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. Opponents describe that as a  hard Brexit . They argue instead for a  soft  version, prioritizing some form of continued access to the single market in order to minimize economic damage. While European leaders try to gauge what to expect from Britain, May is so weakened that her own finance minister and the partners on whom she will rely for her majority, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, are giving her public guidance.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations,  finance minister Philip Hammond said. Slideshow (4 Images)Dog's Breakfast While Britain's economy has shown unexpected resilience since the Brexit vote, there are signs of weakness. Business leaders say the uncertainty means they are having to plan on the assumption that Britain leaves without a proper deal.  Everything is all over the place,  said a senior executive responsible for Brexit preparations at a FTSE 100 company.   It's a bit of a dog's breakfast at the moment because there is a lot of maneuvering and a lot of moving parts.   Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending. Opponents of Brexit fear that ditching a 60-year strategy of trying to hedge European integration with a special relationship with Washington or a brittle Commonwealth of former colonies would undermine what remains of Britain's global influence. The first issue at the Brussels talks will be the status of millions of EU citizens living in the United Kingdom and British residents of the other 27 countries, including their right to stay, to work, and to access medical care. The extent of Britain's exit bill needs to be decided, with the EU27 expected to seek tens of billions of euros they see as London's fair share of programs to which it has committed. The situation in Ireland - where the only land border between the EU and United Kingdom will lie - will also be discussed. May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship before Britain leaves, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of Brexit. The EU wants to deal with the first phase of divorce talks before moving on next year to discuss trade, though EU officials acknowledge that the agreements to be reached before Britain leaves can only be concluded as a whole package simultaneously. Three days after the talks begin, May is due to travel to Brussels for an EU summit - a chance for the other 27 leaders to take stock of their negotiating partner in the sharply altered climate brought about by the dramas of the past two weeks.

An Italian regulator has ordered it to cut its stake in one or other of the companies.  It seems to me Vivendi has said it intends to maintain its investment in Telecom Italia,  Cattaneo said. Asked if the group was interested in bidding for soccer rights for Italy's top-tier Serie A league, the CEO said he would wait to see what the new tender looked like.  But in the next few days we will announce important agreements for other sports,  he said.

She survived, but the lower half of her limb didn't. On leaving hospital, she found refuge with family in Yei, to the south, but then had to flee again as the war spread last year. Now, home is a camp outside the capital ringed by barbed wire and sandbagged positions manned by U.N. peacekeepers. The elderly lady has little hope that South Sudan's warring leaders, President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer, will heal the personal and tribal animosity that split South Sudan just two years after it became the world's youngest nation.  I don't think the leaders will resolve this any time soon,  she said, sitting on the dirt floor of a shelter that was once used to teach children grammar and maths, but is now occupied by new arrivals.  I don't even know what they are fighting over.  The camp outside Juba hosts 30,000 people, 50 percent more than it was designed for. The fugitives are part of the biggest movement of people in Africa since the 1994 Rwandan genocide - some two million within South Sudan and nearly the same again outside its borders. U.N. experts say the conflict, which also has roots in control of South Sudan's oil wealth, amounts to ethnic cleansing and risks escalating to genocide.  People told me stories of fear and violence,  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said after walking though the tent city, where the stench of latrines hangs in the air and children play football on pitches of baked red earth. The destitute camp-dwellers took advantage of Grandi's presence to list their daily hardships. Kun Chuol, an education coordinator, complained of congestion and a lack of rations. Angelina Nyagak, a women's representative, said those who left the camp to try to top up rations face the risk of attack and rape by armed men. In the last major bout of fighting, in July, 60 people in the camp were killed. Today, white armored personnel carriers are parked around the perimeter. Grandi pledged to speak on their behalf in meetings with South Sudan's leaders.  I can only speak to their sense of responsibility, hoping there is one,  he said.  The flight of people is a clear testimony that you are not taking enough responsibility for your own citizens. People wouldn't go away if they weren't afraid.  Peace Efforts After several failed peace efforts, South Sudan has launched its own national dialogue, while regional leaders have sought to revive internationally brokered talks. But few in the camp hold out much hope while Riek Machar, who is being held in South Africa under virtual house arrest, remains outside the negotiations.  It is about power. The problem came when Riek said he would stand in the election against Salva,  said John Wiyual, a Nuer whose home is just 5 km (3 miles) away but says he fears setting foot outside the camp.  They just need to bring those two people back together. There will be no peace in South Sudan if Riek is excluded.  Grandi said the failure of previous agreements, from those that ended decades of war with Khartoum and granted South Sudan independence to the more recent peace efforts, meant rebuilding trust would be tough.  There will have to be a bloody good agreement to convince people to go back,  Grandi said.  And it has to be sustainable. There is nothing worse than people who go back and have to flee again.

As I head to Brussels to open official talks to leave the EU, there should be no doubt — we are leaving the European Union, and delivering on that historic referendum result,  Davis said in a statement.

Clarke notified Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly on Friday of his decision, Craig Peterson, an adviser to Clarke, said in a statement, according to the Washington Post and other newspapers.  Sheriff Clarke is 100 percent committed to the success of President Trump and believes his skills could be better utilized to promote the president's agenda in a more aggressive role,  the newspapers quoted Peterson as saying. Neither the agency nor Clarke's office immediately responded to requests for comment. Clarke's decision comes a month after he told radio station WISN in Milwaukee that he would leave his post as sheriff in June to join the Department of Homeland Security.  At the time, a spokeswoman for the agency said no announcement on Clarke had been made. President Trump and Clarke met in Wisconsin on Tuesday and discussed other roles in which Clarke could help advance Trump's agenda, the Washington Post reported, citing Peterson. The Department of Homeland Security - created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon - includes agencies that handle customs, border protection and immigration, the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Secret Service. Clarke has come under fire for comments he has made about the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew out of protests over a number of police killings of unarmed black men in various parts of the United States. Clarke has labeled members of the movement  subhuman creeps  and called for its eradication.  Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July. Critics have faulted Clarke for his management of a Milwaukee County jail where a mentally ill man died in 2016 of dehydration. An inquest jury recommended that seven employees of the jail be criminally charged. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California called Clarke's appointment  a disgrace.  Reporting by Eric M.

The index traded flat and sideways the entire week with banking shares in focus after the government initiated talks for consolidation of PSU lenders.  Oil prices dropped after U.S. government data showed a smaller-than-expected weekly decline in domestic supplies and an increase in gasoline stockpiles and crude production. OPEC, meanwhile, reported ramped-up supplies from Libya and Nigeria. Global central bank policy action dominated the headlines during the week. The U.S. Fed raised rates and said it could start unwinding its stimulus relatively soon if the economy performs as expected. A hawkish Bank of England left rates unchanged.  In sector-specific action, the banking space was buzzing after the RBI said banks must start bankruptcy proceedings against 12 major defaulters.  Simultaneously, the government initiated talks for consolidation of state lenders and has picked big players including Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Canara Bank as possible acquirers.  Stressed assets now constitute 17 percent of all loans, according to an estimate by rating agency Moody’s.   The Maharashtra government announced a farm loan waiver for marginal farmers, which is expected to cost 300 billion rupees, raising fears that demand for waivers could become contagious.  According to a study by ratings agency CARE, Maharashtra is the only state with the fiscal capacity to pay for a farm loan waiver without breaching its fiscal responsibility commitments.  Pharma stocks were also in focus on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is preparing an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs, a move which could further create pricing pressure and hurt Indian companies.  Textile companies also remained in the news on reports that a new textile policy may be finalised in the next three months. Reliance Industries was also in the limelight as there was an expectation of a big announcement with BP, especially after the oil minister in a tweet requested the conglomerate to set up a fuel distribution network.  However, other than a tie-up on gas exploration, there was no specific announcement to worry OMCs.  Both retail and wholesale inflation have surprised on the lower side, leading to chatter about a possible rate cut by the RBI in August.  However, with the government expected to discuss increasing HRA allowances for central government employees as proposed by the 7th Pay Commission, the central bank could wait for the impact of any HRA increase on inflation before taking a call. In the coming week, a lack of domestic triggers mean investors will look for global cues for direction and we can expect stocks to remain flat.  With the rollout of India’s biggest tax reform since independence just two weeks away, I would advise investors to wait and watch as the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) could trigger an overdue correction in markets.  Ambareesh Baliga has about 25 years of experience in the stock market and has worked with Karvy and Kotak groups in the past.

Twenty years after Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, scores of mainland professionals are filling the elite financial ranks of Hong Kong, while a series of lay-offs at Western banks has led to an exodus of expatriates. The largest increase in mainland staff over the past decade has come in investment banks, with 80 percent seeing an increase of at least 20 percent, according to a 2015 Financial Services Development Council survey.   It has a much better environment than Beijing where I used to work,  said Hong Hao, a managing director at BOCOM International, who has lived in Hong Kong for five years.  The food is good, and the tax rate is also good.   Tax rates in Hong Kong are around 15-17 percent, while they can be as much as 45 percent in mainland China.  Chinese initial public offerings (IPO) dominate the Hong Kong market, the world's largest IPO market in 2016 when mainland offerings represented 80 percent of all new listings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Hong Kong's financial services industry accounts for 18 percent of the territory's economy, compared with just 10.4 percent in 1997 when the city returned to Chinese rule. Expat Customers Fall Evan Zhang, a 26-year-old from Guangdong province, is one of those new kids on the block in Hong Kong. For Zhang, one of the younger hires at CITIC Securities International, the increasing outward flow of Chinese capital in recent years is an opportunity.   With Chinese people more willing now to allocate assets overseas, and overseas investors willing to invest in China, I can play a go-between role to help them,  he said.  As top banks such as Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Bank of America trim their Asia headcount, businesses across Hong Kong have taken a direct hit. Bo Innovation, a Michelin-star restaurant, said its Western expat customers fell roughly 10 percent in the last 10 years, according to owner and executive chef Alvin Leung. Mainland clients increased by about the same percentage, he added. Western companies are also increasingly turning to more affordable locations such as Quarry Bay, at a time when Chinese companies are boosting their presence in the prime Central district, according to Tom Gaffney, a managing director at real estate services firm CBRE.  The value of a typical expat package for middle managers in Hong Kong, has fallen by two percent in U.S. dollar terms over the past five years, while the value of their benefits has fallen five percent over the same period, according to consultancy firm ECA International.  I have seen an enormous change in the expat landscape and packages offered,  said Christine Davis, a manager at international relocation firm The Santa Fe Group who was an expat in Hong Kong in 1999-2001 and again since 2011.          Everything was paid for by hosting companies in the past, she said, but now expat terms had been reduced  drastically .  Hong Kong dropped two places to 13th in the world in HSBC's 2016 Expat Explorer Survey, which measures various aspects of expat life.    Easier to Recruit  The new expat environment is making its easier to recruit talent. Several Chinese brokerages, asset management firms, and a Big Four Chinese bank told Reuters in recent months they intend to expand and hire more people in Hong Kong.  When I first joined the company 14 years ago, we could barely recruit the right people as we couldn't offer a good salary,  said Chen Shuang, chief executive of China Everbright Ltd, the Hong Kong investment arm of state-owned China Everbright Group.  But now, it's much easier to recruit top talent, even those from large Wall Street banks, which was unimaginable in the past.  Some senior Chinese bankers, such as managing directors and department heads, now earn more than their Western counterparts, which offer compensation of about $1 million a year, including base salary and cash bonus, according to executive recruiter Bernard Yeo of Bo Le Associates. On the flip side, junior Chinese bankers are typically paid 20 to 30 percent less than their foreign counterparts and enjoy a less generous package that excludes housing, school fees, and club memberships enjoyed by many Western expats, Yeo said.  The changing demographics of the financial industry is reflected in the local economy. Restaurants featuring provincial mainland Chinese cuisine, like Old Beijing restaurant and San Xilou, which offers spicy Sichuanese fare, are doing well, restaurant managers say. So are serviced apartment companies, English learning programs, and Audis, a popular car brand among Chinese.    In contrast,  Trattoria Doppio Zero, a popular Italian restaurant in the central business district, has seen over a 10-percent drop in its customers the last three years, said manager Jeffrey Ko.

Chinese initial public offerings (IPO) dominate the Hong Kong market, the world's largest IPO market in 2016 when mainland offerings represented 80 percent of all new listings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Hong Kong's financial services industry accounts for 18 percent of the territory's economy, compared with just 10.4 percent in 1997 when the city returned to Chinese rule. Expat Customers Fall Evan Zhang, a 26-year-old from Guangdong province, is one of those new kids on the block in Hong Kong. For Zhang, one of the younger hires at CITIC Securities International, the increasing outward flow of Chinese capital in recent years is an opportunity.  With Chinese people more willing now to allocate assets overseas, and overseas investors willing to invest in China, I can play a go-between role to help them,  he said. As top banks such as Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Bank of America trim their Asia headcount, businesses across Hong Kong have taken a direct hit. Bo Innovation, a Michelin-star restaurant, said its Western expat customers fell roughly 10 percent in the last 10 years, according to owner and executive chef Alvin Leung. Mainland clients increased by about the same percentage, he added. Western companies are also increasingly turning to more affordable locations such as Quarry Bay, at a time when Chinese companies are boosting their presence in the prime Central district, according to Tom Gaffney, a managing director at real estate services firm CBRE. The value of a typical expat package for middle managers in Hong Kong, has fallen by two percent in U.S. dollar terms over the past five years, while the value of their benefits has fallen five percent over the same period, according to consultancy firm ECA International.  I have seen an enormous change in the expat landscape and packages offered,  said Christine Davis, a manager at international relocation firm The Santa Fe Group who was an expat in Hong Kong in 1999-2001 and again since 2011. Everything was paid for by hosting companies in the past, she said, but now expat terms had been reduced  drastically . Hong Kong dropped two places to 13th in the world in HSBC's 2016 Expat Explorer Survey, which measures various aspects of expat life. Easier to Recruit The new expat environment is making its easier to recruit talent. Several Chinese brokerages, asset management firms, and a Big Four Chinese bank told Reuters in recent months they intend to expand and hire more people in Hong Kong.  When I first joined the company 14 years ago, we could barely recruit the right people as we couldn't offer a good salary,  said Chen Shuang, chief executive of China Everbright Ltd, the Hong Kong investment arm of state-owned China Everbright Group.  But now, it's much easier to recruit top talent, even those from large Wall Street banks, which was unimaginable in the past.  Some senior Chinese bankers, such as managing directors and department heads, now earn more than their Western counterparts, which offer compensation of about $1 million a year, including base salary and cash bonus, according to executive recruiter Bernard Yeo of Bo Le Associates. On the flip side, junior Chinese bankers are typically paid 20 to 30 percent less than their foreign counterparts and enjoy a less generous package that excludes housing, school fees, and club memberships enjoyed by many Western expats, Yeo said. The changing demographics of the financial industry is reflected in the local economy. Restaurants featuring provincial mainland Chinese cuisine, like Old Beijing restaurant and San Xilou, which offers spicy Sichuanese fare, are doing well, restaurant managers say. So are serviced apartment companies, English learning programs, and Audis, a popular car brand among Chinese. In contrast,  Trattoria Doppio Zero, a popular Italian restaurant in the central business district, has seen over a 10-percent drop in its customers the last three years, said manager Jeffrey Ko.

Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of turning a blind eye to Afghan Taliban commanders based within its borders and of supporting the militant group, something Islamabad denies.  Islamabad has claimed that Kabul is not doing enough to tackle Pakistani Taliban militants who have been driven out of Pakistan, but who still carry out attacks across the border.

In an agonising half hour for the Japanese manufacturer, whose hopes were high after securing pole position with a record fastest lap at the Sarthe circuit, two of the team's three cars retired in the night. Only the number eight Toyota remained on track, in 15th place and 28 laps behind the leading Porsche of former winners Neel Jani of Switzerland, Britain's Nick Tandy and Germany's Andre Lotterer.  It is so disappointing. The car was running very well and we were just taking things steady, building a gap at the front. Then after the safety car, I just had no power,  said pole-sitter Kamui Kobayashi. The former Formula One driver was halted by a clutch problem in the leading number seven car around the 10 hours mark. Until then, the car had barely missed a beat as five times runners-up Toyota set about trying to end years of heartache and become only the second Japanese manufacturer to win the world's greatest endurance race. The team missed out last year when their leading car broke down on the final lap only minutes from the chequered flag. Kobayashi got going again momentarily before the car stopped again and he had no option but to park up and walk away.  I tried to come back to the pits but it wasn’t possible. I feel so sad for everyone in the team who has worked so hard for this race and produced such a quick car,  he said. In a second big blow, the number nine car driven by Frenchman Nicolas Lapierre, Japan's Yuji Kunimoto and Argentina's Jose Maria Lopez was involved in a collision 15 minutes later. The impact at the approach to the first corner at around 1.30 a.m. caused too much damage to continue. The number eight car of Switzerland's Sebastien Buemi, Britain's Anthony Davidson and Japan's Kazuki Nakajima had already lost more than an hour in the pits as mechanics replaced the front motor and battery. With Toyota out of the picture, the stage was set for Porsche to win by a massive margin. Two LMP2 cars were in the other podium spots, with the Jackie Chan DC Racing Oreca driven by France's Thomas Laurent, Britain's Oliver Jarvis and Dutch-born Chinese racer Ho-Pin Tung in second place but 12 laps behind. Vaillante Rebellion's number 13 car, driven by Brazilian Nelson Piquet Junior, Denmark's David Hansson and Switzerland's Mathias Beche was third. The second Porsche of New Zealanders Earl Bamber and Brendon Hartley, along with Germany's Timo Bernhard, was out of contention 18 laps behind after suffering front axle problems.

A rain delay in the second game only made the work last a little longer and the reward was first place in the American League Central. Chisenhall homered twice and drove in four runs, and Cleveland beat the Minnesota Twins 6-2 in the nightcap to sweep the doubleheader and surpass Minnesota for the top spot in the division. The Indians won the first three contests of the four-game weekend series and lead the Twins by one game in the Central, the first time Minnesota hasn't owned at least a share of the division lead since May 10. Cleveland is 7-2 against Minnesota this year. Related CoverageCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatch We knew what we needed to do when we came in here,  Chisenhall said.  They were in first place and we had to beat them. They're the team to beat right now. So I think we've done OK, so far, just continue that tomorrow.  Jose Ramirez had two hits in the nightcap after homering from both sides of the plate in the Indians' 9-3 victory in the first game. Ramirez is 8-for-14 with two home runs, four doubles, four RBIs and four runs scored in the series. He has multiple hits in each of his last five games. Austin Jackson and Francisco Lindor also homered in the second game as Cleveland pounded six homers in the doubleheader.  You got two games, rain delay and everybody did something,  Indians manager Terry Francona said.  It was fun. It's a long day, but I thought our guys carried the enthusiasm throughout, and they did a really good job. When we went back after the rain, Lonnie with a gorgeous swing. But we played with enthusiasm.  Nick Goody (1-0) earned his first major league win in his 58th career appearance. Goody pitched 1 2/3 innings and allowed one run on a homer by Brian Dozier after relieving starter Mike Clevinger.  Very frustrating,  Dozier said of the day.  You have a lot of momentum coming in here, a lot of excitement for the weekend. We've still got a game tomorrow, but I don't know. It didn't bode so well for us today, on all accounts. Pitching, defense, swinging the bats.  Clevinger gave up one run on two hits, a walk and four strikeouts in four innings in his return to the rotation. Jackson and Chisenhall hit homers in the fourth inning against Minnesota starter Adalberto Mejia before rain came in the fifth inning and delayed the game for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Neither starter made it back after the delay. Mejia (1-3) pitched 4 2/3 innings, yielding two runs, five hits and three walks. Tyler Duffey pitched for the Twins after the delay and walked Carlos Santana to lead off the sixth. Jackson singled and Chisenhall hit a three-run homer to provide the big cushion and turn the game over to Cleveland's bullpen.  When we made mistakes today, they hit them over the fence,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  They made mistakes, and we hit them to the track for the most part. It's a little frustrating. We haven't performed as well as I would've hoped over these first three games, but we have another chance tomorrow.  NOTES: To make room for starter Ryan Merritt, Cleveland optioned LHP Kyle Crockett to Triple-A Columbus. Merritt was optioned back to Columbus after pitching the first game as the team recalled 3B Giovanny Urshela. ... RHP Mike Clevinger was recalled to start the second game as the Indians' 26th man for the doubleheader. Clevinger will have to be returned to Columbus after the game but is expected to make a start in Baltimore next week. ... Minnesota optioned RHP Ryan Pressly to Triple-A Rochester before the doubleheader and called up Saturday's Game 1 starter LHP Adam Wilk. RHP Alex Wimmers was added as the 26th man for the doubleheader. ... Cleveland RHP Danny Salazar, on the 10-day disabled list because of right shoulder soreness, will throw a bullpen session Monday. ...

Center fielder Maybin continued to thrive in the leadoff spot Saturday night, hitting the first pitch he saw for a home run to center to start the Angels on their way to a 9-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals. He also had a stolen base, his league-leading 21st of the season. The 6-foot-9 Meyer, meanwhile, had his sixth straight fine effort on the mound, holding the red-hot Royals to two hits and a walk in six shutout innings. In a season where injuries shelled the Angels' rotation, he's been a bright spot for the present and future. Maybin's home run was his fourth, equaling his output last season in Detroit. He also extended his streak of reaching base in a game to 22. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at AngelsKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchIn the 20 games Maybin has hit in the No. 1 spot, he is hitting .387 with 24 runs scored, 13 extra-base hits and 12 steals. He also doubled and stole third in the seventh, starting a four-run rally that put the game away. He's only been thrown out stealing once in 2017.  Everyone finds a nut every once in a while,  Maybin chuckled about the home run. It's the third leadoff home run in his career.  Sometimes a pitcher will try to throw a strike with his first pitch, so I went up there looking for something over the plate. I always think it's a boost to give your starting pitcher room to breath.  Hitting leadoff is very comfortable for me. I feel good at the top, trying to provide energy to start the game off. If I get on, the guys after me might get good pitches to hit. I'll always be looking to run when I can.  Meyer (3-3) silenced a Royals team that had 10 or more hits in their last four games, hitting .350 in that span with 25 runs. Meyer, who was obtained last season in a trade with Minnesota, has thrown 33 innings in his last six starts and allowed seven earned runs -- good for a 1.91 ERA -- and 21 hits while striking out 41. His nine strikeouts Saturday equaled his season and career high.  I felt good with everything today,  Meyer said.  It was another step in the right direction. The next step is pitching in the seventh (inning). I want to be consistent and the kind of pitcher a coaching staff can trust.   It may not show from game to game, but the leap he's made from last winter in his mechanics and finding a rhythm is light years ahead of here he was,  Scioscia said. Meyer worked out of a jam in the Royals sixth that he didn't create. Third baseman Yunel Escobar bobbled a grounder and second baseman Danny Espinosa dropped a throw on a double-play ball by Whit Merrifield to put two on with no outs. But Meyer induced Jorge Bonifacio to hit into a double play, worked around Lorenzo Cain with a five-pitch walk and struck out Eric Hosmer to end the rally. Royals manager Ned Yost praised Meyer's work, extolling his ability to throw his curve for strikes. But he also said the shadows early were a factor in a game that started at 5:15 p.m.  The shadows were difficult, for both sides,  he said.

Angels RHP Cam Bedrosian was activated from the disabled list Saturday and pitched a 1-2-3 eighth inning. The 25-year-old has been on the DL since suffering a groin injury in his third appearance of the season. ... Angels RHP Matt Shoemaker has been placed on the 10-day DL because of tightness in his right forearm. He suffered the injury in his last start Wednesday against the Yankees. It is not considered a long-term injury but he has yet to resume throwing, leading the club to put him on the DL since he will miss at least one turn in the rotation. ... The Angels recalled RHP Parker Bridwell from Salt Lake City and optioned Daniel Wright. ... The Angels and Royals wore uniforms with light blue hats, socks and uniform trim as part of a Father's Day and prostate cancer awareness weekend promotion.

The respected business magazine is among the first to reveal the size of loans made by mid-sized bank Minsheng to Anbang. Minsheng spokesman Li Liming told Reuters the account of the shareholders' meeting was correct. Anbang, one of China's most aggressive buyers of overseas assets, said last week that Chairman Wu Xiaohui was temporarily unable to fulfil his duties due to personal reasons. People familiar with the matter said Wu had been detained by authorities earlier in June. Anbang has said Wu's duties would be managed by other senior executives, and that its business was operating normally. No other details have been provided by the insurer. Anbang Group is one of Minsheng Banking's largest private shareholders.  It is precisely because Anbang is a major shareholder that our controls are stricter and we strictly disclose related party transactions,  Hong is reported to have said. Hong also said Minsheng will continue to sell Anbang's insurance products, according to the Caixin report. Employees at several Chinese banks told Reuters last week that they had stopped selling some Anbang products, in some cases several months ago. Banks are the main distribution channel for Anbang's insurance products.

Hinch made clear his satisfaction with how Paulino emotionally approached his fifth career start. Paulino, a recent fixture in an injury-ravaged rotation, produced the best start of his burgeoning career and was backed by an aggressive offense in the Houston Astros' 7-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Minute Maid Park. Paulino (1-0) posted his first career win by working a career-long six innings, allowing three hits and one run with four strikeouts. The lone blemish came in the fifth inning when Boston designated hitter and Houston native Chris Young hit a leadoff home run to left field, his 11th career homer at Minute Maid Park.  I feel really blessed,  said Paulino, who made one start last season and joined the rotation this season on May 31.  I have to thank my teammates because they helped me out to get this win and I'm really happy about it.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at AstrosBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatchPaulino responded to the Young dinger by retiring the following three batters in order before working around a leadoff single by Mookie Betts in the sixth with an inning-ending double play off the bat of Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts. While Paulino retired the side in order just twice, in the second and third, he allowed only one baserunner to reach scoring position, and that came via Young and his home run trot. Not only was he efficient, he was calm and collected.  That was a great performance,  Hinch said.  And I loved his demeanor; he was calm the whole day. He was focused, he was getting them to mishit some balls. He stayed very calm in his approach. All in all, I think his ability to throw both breaking balls for strikes, mix in a fastball here and there (was critical), but just (his ability to) control his emotions and excitement and his demeanor on the mound was the most impressive it's been since he's been up here.  Said Red Sox manager John Farrell of Paulino:  The scouting report was that you're never really in a fastball count because of the ability to command the secondary pitches, and that was the case here tonight.  George Springer, Jose Altuve and Carlos Beltran had multi-hit games for the Astros (46-23), with Springer and Altuve each finishing 2-for-4. Altuve scored twice and added two RBIs, and Beltran homered, doubled and had three RBIs. Boston (38-30) was undone by another poor start from right-hander Rick Porcello (3-9). The Astros were quick to make Porcello uncomfortable with the first four batters reaching base in the first inning. Springer and Altuve reached via doubles, with Springer scoring on the Altuve extra-base hit to give Houston the lead. After a Carlos Correa walk loaded the bases, Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran delivered quality, veteran at-bats, each driving a Porcello offering to deep center field for run-scoring sacrifice flies. Houston took a less manufactured approach to scoring three more runs in the third, with Altuve and Beltran homering to stretch the lead to 6-0. Altuve cranked his 10th home run 428 feet to left-center field while Beltran hit his ninth to right. Porcello stabilized and worked six innings, but the early damage was severe. He allowed seven runs and 10 hits, six for extra bases, and one walk. It marked the fifth time this season that Porcello has surrendered double-digit hits in a start.  It's inconsistent,  Porcello said of his execution.  That's the bottom line, inconsistent.  NOTES: Astros RHP Lance McCullers will accompany the club on its upcoming seven-game trip through Oakland and Seattle with the possibility that he could start the series finale against the Athletics on Thursday. McCullers, on the 10-day disabled list since June 9 with lower back discomfort, must throw a bullpen without issue before a decision is rendered regarding reinstatement. ... Red Sox 3B Pablo Sandoval sat for a second consecutive game, with manager John Ferrell acknowledging that Sandoval is enduring an adjustment period to the knee brace he has worn since being reinstated from the disabled list on May 30. Sandoval missed 31 games with a right knee sprain. ...

The 2013 National League MVP continued his recent surge Saturday, when his 12th home run powered the Pirates to a 4-3 win over the Chicago Cubs at PNC Park. McCutchen belted a solo shot to left field off Justin Grimm that extended his hitting streak to eight games and pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 4-2 in the bottom of the sixth. His 12 home runs are tied for the team lead with Josh Bell.  It was hittable,  McCutchen said.  I stayed on and was able to hit it out. (I was) just ready to hit. Good things happen.  McCutchen's homer proved to be the game-winner, as Addison Russell led off the seventh with a homer to pull the Cubs within 4-3. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at PiratesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchPittsburgh (31-37) bounced back from allowing six runs in the ninth inning of a 9-5 loss to Chicago (33-34) on Friday. Pirates right-hander Ivan Nova (7-4) struck out Jon Jay to finish his outing and strand Jason Heyward at third base. He allowed three earned runs and six hits in seven innings. Left-hander Felipe Rivero got the final five outs for his third save of the season. He has a 0.72 ERA in 36 appearances this season.  The last two years, besides this year, I've been worried so much about the hitters,  Rivero said.  This year, I'm not worried about it because this is my third year and I think I know them pretty well and I know who they are.  After the Pirates surrendered a 2-0 lead, Adam Frazier singled to right to score Jordy Mercer from third and put them ahead 3-2 in the bottom of the fifth. Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta (6-5) was pulled after throwing two wild pitches and hitting David Freese to load the bases in the fifth. He allowed three runs (two earned) and four hits with seven strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings. Arrieta pitched with a laceration on his right thumb, but said the cut did not give him any problems Saturday. Instead, Cubs manager Joe Maddon said Arrieta sweated profusely, which made it difficult to grip the ball.  It was more wetness than the cut or anything with his finger,  Maddon said.  He didn't say anything to me about his finger. It was more about he could not grip the ball. He was so darn wet. Dripping, I mean absolutely dripping.  Gregory Polanco built the Pirates' 2-0 lead with his first home run since May 28 in the bottom of the first inning. After Francisco Cervelli advanced Frazier to second base on a fielder's choice, Polanco roped a 397-foot home run on a 0-1 pitch over the right-field wall. Entering Saturday, Polanco was 3-for-27 in his previous seven games. He followed his homer with another sharp shot to right field, with this one bouncing off the wall in the third inning.  Some real good at bats from Gregory,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  Sweet swing on the homer, the double. To get an intentional walk (in the fifth inning), he hasn't been in that position. Just put him on and pass on him. He's continued to work hard. (He) did some quality work out there today as Bell did, as Frazier did. It paid off for all of them.  It seemed like Polanco's home run could provide all the insurance Nova needed until Arrieta homered to left field to tie it 2-2 in the fifth. The home run was Arrieta's first of the season and fifth of his career.  It still got in on me a little bit, but I was able to find a little bit of barrel and put it out,  Arrieta said.  We were close in the end. Really, when you have a guy like Nova go seven and you have Rivero come in with that type of arm for a couple innings, it makes it tough. We're just hoping he makes a mistake. NOTES: Pirates 2B Josh Harrison sat after going 1-for-5 against the Cubs on Friday. Adam Frazier took over at second base. ...

Beyonce, 35, and rapper and music producer Jay Z, already have a five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. E! News, citing multiple unidentified sources, reported the birth and that Jay Z and Blue Ivy were seen at a Los Angeles area hospital on Thursday. Us Weekly, also citing multiple unidentified sources, reported that the couple welcomed twins earlier this week.  Bey and Jay are thrilled and have started sharing the news with their family and closest friends,  one unidentified source told PEOPLE. Reuters could not verify the reports. A representative for Beyonce did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The celebrity news websites did not provide additional details, such as the date and time the twins were born or the sex of the infants. The  Lemonade  singer, one of the most powerful women in the music business, announced the pregnancy on her Instagram account in February along with an image of her posed in lingerie and caressing a noticeable baby bump. The announcement got more than 8 million  likes  in the first 24 hours to become the  most-liked  Instagram ever. The R&B; singer performed live at the Grammy awards in Los Angeles two weeks later, proudly displaying her swelling belly in a motherhood-themed show. She has since posted numerous pictures of her bare baby bump on her social media accounts. The birth of Blue Ivy caused a paparazzi storm in 2012, with New York's Lenox Hill hospital shutting down part of its maternity wing to accommodate music's royal couple. News of the pregnancy came less than a year after the release of Beyonce's 2016 album  Lemonade,  in which she appeared to address long-standing rumors of trouble in her eight-year marriage. The lyrics of several songs spoke about being cheated on, and regretting being married. But Beyonce made clear in the final tracks of the album and in music videos featuring Jay-Z that she had decided to stay in the relationship. The couple have never addressed the rumors publicly.
