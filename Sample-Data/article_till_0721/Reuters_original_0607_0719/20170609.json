On Thursday night, they were the ones on the other end of another Volquez gem. The right-hander shut down his former team and combined with the Miami Marlins bullpen to four-hit the Pirates in a 7-1 victory. Pitching just five days after his first career no-hitter, Volquez allowed the second batter of the game to reach on a single but quickly settled in. He struck out eight Pirates while cruising through seven scoreless innings to earn his third win of the season.  I know what he's doing when he's on. You just hope to catch him when he's not too on,  said Pirates center fielder Andrew McCutchen, who went 0-for-3 against Volquez.  When he has command of his fastball and he can get ahead with his fastball, it sets him up for his off-speed, his changeup and his curveball. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at PiratesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatch He was locating his heater. He was able to locate his off-speed as well. If he's able to do that, (it's) tough to get on base and tough to get a hit.  Volquez (3-7) has won in three consecutive appearances after losing six in a row and seven of his first nine starts. The Marlins are 8-3 since Volquez flipped the switch on his season.  We felt we could get him right again, and now he's pitching the way we thought he would,  said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who added that he thinks Volquez has actually pitched better since tweaking his ankle in the first inning of his no-hitter.  He has to stay calm on that ankle, and it keeps him from getting out of his delivery.  Pirates starter Gerrit Cole, meanwhile, had his fourth straight subpar outing. He has had trouble with home runs all season, having given up the second most in the National League with 15. On Thursday, he was able to keep the Marlins in the ballpark, but they used 10 hits -- five of them doubles -- to jump out to an early lead. In all, Cole (3-6) allowed seven runs on 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings. He failed to pitch beyond the fifth inning for a fourth consecutive start. Miami center fielder Christian Yelich went 3-for-5 and doubled twice off Cole. In the first, his two-bagger scored Dee Gordon, who had led off the game with a single. Derek Dietrich (3-for-4) then doubled in Yelich. Dietrich got things started in the fourth with a double to right, and then Tyler Moore sent one of his own off the wall in center field to score Dietrich. In the fifth inning, Dietrich earned his third RBI with a single that scored Marcel Ozuna. Moore drove in his second run with a single that brought home J.T. Realmuto. JT Riddle got into the act with an RBI single that scored Dietrich and ended Cole's night.  That fifth inning, there were a lot of base hits that were not necessarily scorched, at least compared to earlier in the game, but I failed to get them on the ground,  Cole said.  I'm looking for those balls to be hit on the ground to the shortstop instead of lofted 6 feet over the infield.  Miami's Dustin McGowan threw a scoreless eighth inning. Brian Ellington gave up the lone Pirates run in the ninth when Phil Gosselin singled and scored on Josh Bell's groundout. NOTES: Miami RHP Tom Koehler threw four innings in a rehab start with Class A Jupiter. Koehler allowed three runs on five hits in four innings while walking two and striking out three. All three runs came on home runs. ... Marlins LHP Justin Nicolino will make a rehab appearance on June 13 as he returns from a contusion on his left index finger. ... Pirates RHP Ivan Nova said his left knee feels fine and he should be able to make his next scheduled start. Nova was removed from his start June 6 in Baltimore with left knee inflammation. ... Before the game, the Pirates recalled RHP Dovydas Neverauskas and optioned RHP Johnny Barbato to Triple-A Indianapolis. Neverauskas pitched a scoreless ninth inning, working around two hits.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-marlins-pirates-writethru-idUSMTZED699E2URL"},

Dickey appears to be trending in the right direction. The veteran pitched his best game of the season, baffling the Philadelphia Phillies for seven innings to break a personal six-game winless streak, helping the Atlanta Braves to a 3-1 victory Thursday.  For whatever reason in my career, I've started slowly, and hopefully this is the beginning of the next four months of it being nice and tight,  Dickey said. The knuckleball specialist allowed one run and three hits, and he retired 15 consecutive batters from the second through sixth innings. Dickey (4-4) struck out a season-high eight batters in his first start with catcher Tyler Flowers behind the plate. He did not walk a batter for the first time in 12 starts this season and won for the first time since May 2 after going 0-2 with four no-decisions.  I've been real close in a number of outings,  Dickey said.  I feel like my performances have been a little bit better than the statistics were showing. I always knew that. I told Snit (Atlanta manager Brian Snitker) at the end of the night that this is more of what I feel like you should expect out of me.  Snitker said,  I talked to him after the seventh and he was happy. I think going forward he can build on this.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BravesPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchDickey became the third consecutive Atlanta starter to work seven innings. Jim Johnson worked a scoreless ninth inning and earned his 12th save. The win gave Atlanta a split of the four-game series. Philadelphia leads the season series 5-2. Phillies rookie Ben Lively (1-1), making his second major league start, worked around nine hits and two walks over seven innings to allow only three runs. He struck out three.  You've got to be happy with Lively's performance,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  He's a real battler. Threw a lot of strikes, walked a couple guys, not a lot of strikeouts, but he battles, comes right at you.  Lively has pitched seven innings in his first two starts, which gives the pitching-poor Phillies a good building block.  Stay strong,  Lively said.  How I pitched got me here. ... Keep throwing strikes and keep being that bulldog.  Atlanta's 11-hit attack was led by Brandon Phillips, Matt Kemp, Matt Adams and Flowers with two hits apiece. The Braves scored twice in the first inning. Ender Inciarte walked and went to third on Phillips' double. Inciarte scored when Nick Markakis grounded to second base, and Phillips scored on Kemp's double. Lively allowed the Braves to get runners in scoring position in the second and third innings but did not give up a run.  He didn't have the velocity (in the first inning),  Mackanin said.  I was surprised. And all of a sudden, after the second or third inning, he started throwing harder. He battles you. That's two in a row, seven innings. That's what we needed.  The Braves went ahead 3-0 by scoring a run in the sixth inning. Adams singled and scored when Flowers doubled over the head of Philadelphia center fielder Odubel Herrera. Philadelphia got a run in the seventh. Herrera doubled to left -- his 12th straight extra-base hit and league-leading 22nd double -- and scored when Maikel Franco fisted a single to the opposite field in right. Herrera was able to just beat the throw home from Markakis with a slide. The Phillies got runners on the corners in the eighth with two outs against Atlanta reliever Arodys Vizcaino, but lefty Ian Krol retired Herrera to end the threat. Philadelphia had only four hits and left four runners on base.  We got up early and then (Dickey) shut them down,  Atlanta left fielder Matt Kemp said.  You saw a lot of ugly swings. That meant his ball was moving.  NOTES: Phillies CF Odubel Herrera has doubled in each of the past six games, tying the franchise record and making him the third player since 1913 to do it. ...

The Nationals fielded a lineup that did not include first baseman Ryan Zimmerman (.362), second baseman Daniel Murphy (.336) and third baseman Anthony Rendon (.291) as they got some rest. But the Nationals reserves had solid nights and starting pitcher Joe Ross had a great night, striking out a career-high 12 batters in a 6-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles.  They want to play,  Nationals shortstop Trea Turner said of reserves Stephen Drew, Wilmer Difo and Brian Goodwin who got rare starts.  When they get in the lineup and the opportunity to play they play very well and play very hard. I thought we had some great at-bats.  Turner had three hits and a career-high three steals as Washington swiped five bases. Drew, who had two hits and drove in two, was the only position player on either team who didn't strike out. The Orioles fanned 15 times, and 26 of the 51 outs came via a punch-out.  We didn't do much with the bats obviously,  said Orioles manager Buck Showalter. The Orioles also played without All-Star third baseman Manny Machado, who hurt his left wrist in a play at third on Wednesday in Baltimore against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Related CoverageBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch I think we will have a better idea tomorrow,  Showalter said of Machado's condition.  We were challenged the last two nights.  Ross was coming off an ugly start Saturday as he gave up six earned runs in three innings at Oakland. But Baker still saw some encouraging signs from Ross, who began the year at Triple-A Syracuse.  The slider is one of his main pitches,  Baker said of Ross, who reached double digits in strikeouts for the second time in his career. Washington scored four runs in the first inning.  It is big for the pitcher,  said Turner, who led off the first with a walk and later scored. Bryce Harper added three hits, an RBI, a run scored and a stolen base for Washington. The nearby foes split the four-game season series after the Orioles had won the season series the previous five seasons. The first-place Nationals (38-21) are 17-9 at home while the third-place Orioles (31-27) fell to 10-17 on the road. Ross (3-2), who entered the game with a 7.34 ERA and lowered it to 6.16, allowed four hits and one run in 7 1/3 innings. His bid for a shutout was spoiled with an RBI single by Joey Rickard in the seventh that trimmed the margin to 6-1. The losing pitcher was Baltimore starter Alec Asher (2-4), who had defeated the Boston Red Sox in his previous outing. The game was a makeup of a May 11 rainout in Washington. Mark Trumbo had two hits for the Orioles. Asher (2-4) labored through a 41-pitch first inning as the Nationals put four runs on the board before many fans could find their seats. Harper drove in a run with an infield single, Drew had an RBI single, and Michael A. Taylor had a rare hit to right field as he laced a two-run double near the line to make it 4-0. Turner singled in the second, went to second on a walk, stole third and scored on a sacrifice fly by Adam Lind to make it 5-0. Ross, meanwhile, was as effective as Asher was laboring. The Washington right-hander struck out the side in the second and fifth. Asher gave up five runs, seven hits and four walks with six strikeouts in four innings. He threw a whopping 100 pitches -- only 59 for strikes -- and was replaced by Ubaldo Jimenez in the fifth. Drew, the first batter to face Jimenez, hit a solo homer to make it 6-0. Chris Davis, normally a first baseman, played third for the Orioles while Trumbo played first.  I was proud of Chris tonight,  Showalter said.

We cordially ask you to help us open a new diplomatic horizon with new leadership under nominee Kang Kyung-wha, with her experience from the foreign ministry and the United Nations,  Blue House spokesman Park Soo-hyun told a media briefing.  We ask that you approve of her as quickly as possible.  Kang, who has enjoyed a long career at the United Nations and was most recently senior adviser on policy to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, does not need official parliamentary approval to become foreign minister. The president can appoint Kang as foreign minister, but the standard procedure is for lawmakers to issue a report on possible cabinet members after a nomination hearing. If Moon appoints Kang in the face of any opposition from other political parties it could hurt his chances of securing their support on major policy issues in parliament, where his party does not have a majority. The minor opposition People's Party, which has the swing vote in parliament, disapproves of Kang, saying her working abilities are not enough to cover her personal flaws. Lawmakers grilled Kang for 14 hours during her nomination hearing on Wednesday, criticizing her over a number of offences, including paying long-overdue taxes just after she received her ministerial nomination, and accused her of attempting to evade them altogether. Kang's decision to falsely register her place of residence for her child more than a decade ago was also strongly criticized as it is a criminal offence in South Korea and offenders, if found guilty, could face up to three years in prison. Kang acknowledged some of the accusations like false residence papers and tardy tax payments, saying her actions were deeply regrettable.

The president has struggled to appoint a squeaky-clean cabinet as his efforts to find candidates free of ethics issues have proved challenging, leading to a delay in government and policy formation. Time is of the essence for Moon, who is currently facing a national security power vacuum as he is currently working with holdovers from the previous Park Geun-hye administration. He has yet to appoint ministers for unification, foreign affairs and national defense.

Lee Kwansup, chief executive of state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co Ltd (KHNP), said cutting back on nuclear, which accounts for about 30 percent of South Korea's electricity, could also affect the sale of nuclear reactor overseas.  It's a concern whether South Korea can realize the country's energy mix goal as pledged, and we should plan well on power facilities over the course of actualizing the government's plan to scale back nuclear power,  Lee said at a forum in Seoul.  The government is currently weighing how feasible pledges are and we will surely follow the government's policy when it's decided,  Lee added. South Korea's new President Moon Jae-in has pledged to reduce the country's reliance on coal and nuclear power in a bid to mitigate air pollution and address concerns over safety of nuclear power. He aims to quadruple the share of renewable power generation to 20 percent by 2030, and has pledged to halt the construction of eight new nuclear plants, including two that are partly built. KHNP, which is owned by state-run utility Korea Electric Power Co Ltd (KEPCO), operates 25 nuclear reactors in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.  Scrapping a plan to build new reactors and bans on extending the life of older reactors would cut the number of reactors to 16, with total installed capacity falling to nearly 18 gigawatts from 23 gigwatts at present, Lee said.       South Korea, the world's fifth-biggest user of nuclear power, is also keen to export its nuclear reactor, known as the APR 1400.  I think we should take a realistic approach because it could have a negative impact on exporting nuclear reactors to the United Arab Emirates,  Lee added. In 2009, a KEPCO-led consortium won a deal to build four nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates, with work on the first reactor completed. KHNP is also one of the six groups looking to build nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic.

In an internal memo announcing Zames' departure, Dimon thanked him for his 13 years of service but did not say why he was going. A person familiar with the matter said Zames, who did not return a call seeking comment, wanted to run a company on his own and saw JPMorgan's upper management ranks as too crowded. The exit stirs up, once again, one of Wall Street's favorite parlor games - trying to work out who will succeed Dimon, 61, at the helm of the largest U.S. bank. At 46, Zames was the youngest of the six contenders and had the advantage of knowing all segments of the bank, after overseeing areas including cyber security, technology and real estate. Zames also played a central role in keeping the bank stable amid financial turmoil. He helped stabilize Bear Stearns, after JPMorgan acquired the investment bank during the 2007-2009 crisis, and transformed JPMorgan's chief investment office and treasury arm after the so-called  London Whale  scandal in 2012. More recently, he was focused on critical technology and cyber functions.   While I am sad to see him leave, I respect his decision and all he has done for JPMorgan Chase,  said Dimon. In the memo, Dimon detailed a new organizational structure in which the five other potential successors - Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, Corporate and Investment Bank CEO Daniel Pinto, Consumer and Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith, Asset Management CEO Mary Erdoes and Commercial Bank CEO Doug Petno - divvy up Zames' responsibilities. With Dimon showing no inclination to relinquish his role, a raft of potential successors has left the bank in recent years. Many have gone on to lead other institutions, including Barclays PLC (BARC.L) CEO Jes Staley, Standard Chartered PLC (STAN.L) CEO Bill Winters and former Visa Inc (V.N) CEO Charles Scharf. Michael Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, which owns about 6 million JPMorgan shares, said the bank still has lots of highly capable leaders.  They've built up such a high quality bench that a lot of these senior executives are going to be attractive to other companies,  he said. Zames will receive discretionary payments of $4.625 million on Feb. 1, 2018 and $4.5 million a year later. He has agreed not to compete with JPMorgan until Feb. 1, 2018, not to solicit clients for a year after that date and not to hire employees of the bank before Feb. 1, 2020.  Jamie has been a true mentor to me, and it has been a privilege to be a member of his team. I'm confident I will continue to benefit from his guidance and wisdom in the future,  Zames said in the memo.

ETFs were initially seen as devices used to track stock indexes, but BlackRock has aggressively marketed fixed-income ETFs to institutions that normally use bonds. That approach has paid off. U.S.-based bond ETFs attracted record cash last quarter, according to researcher Morningstar Inc, and iShares took in $4 in $10 of that money.

Following a disappointing effort in Monaco where their Italian arch-rivals swept to a one-two finish, Mercedes have returned to a happy hunting ground for Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. Triple champion Hamilton has triumphed five times on the island track, including the last two years, while team mate  Bottas was on the podium at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in 2015 and 2016 with Williams.  Sure we need to make the car better, quicker, faster --  obviously there is still a long way to go and no massive panic,  said Bottas, who replaced retired champion Nico Rosberg at the team in January.  Every bad race we have we are losing points to Ferrari so for sure we need to pick up some pace, make the car better, quicker, improve mechanically...anything is going to help. Hopefully we will be winning sooner rather than later.  From the first year I came here I felt comfortable with the track. I can't say it is my favorite but in general it has been good for me,  added the Finn. If Mercedes cannot find their mojo again soon, they can expect to see Ferrari pull away at the top of both the drivers' and constructors' standings. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel has won three of the six races so far, with Hamilton 25 points behind after two victories. Bottas won in Russia.  We’ve obviously seen that Ferrari are quickest at the moment, so they’re the favorites, but we’ve worked very hard to rectify the issues we had in the last race,  said Hamilton, who has also started from pole in Canada five times.  We’ve got some unique bits on the car I think which will work well this weekend.  Bottas said Montreal required a more aggressive approach than some other tracks.  You need to be better with the technical sections, how you take the curbs, how you take the line,  he said.  There are a couple of places where you come close up against the wall and you need to be aggressive on those.

The Outlook is Stable due to WLMI's solid financial profile and the unchanged credit profile of its ultimate parent, Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC; AA-/Stable). KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Fitch's assessment of WLMI's strategic importance to the group, and includes a one- notch uplift from its standalone rating. WBC has, when required, provided capital to WLMI, and we believe the bank would do so in the future to support growth or offset the adverse impact on capitalisation from a severe deterioration in the operating environment. On a standalone basis WLMI has an adequate capital position and conservative investment approach. The company's operating and underwriting performance has historically been strong and, despite higher financial leverage compared with Fitch's median criteria guidelines, interest coverage is solid. The introduction of financial leverage into WLMI increased its reliance on WBC for financial flexibility. Fitch believes the group can provide support if required. WBC generated net income of AUD7.5 billion in the year to 30 September 2016 (FY16) and had net assets of AUD58 billion at FYE16. The group's reduced risk appetite for lenders mortgage insurance (LMI) is unchanged from FY14. WLMI continues to use reinsurance to significantly limit its net exposure. However, the strategic alliance with insurer Arch Capital Group, Ltd. has increased WLMI's oversight over all residential mortgages originated in WBC that require LMI and improved the alignment of banking and LMI product systems. WLMI has insured mortgages with loan-to-value ratios (LVR) of more than 90% since May 2015, but cedes 100% of the exposure through reinsurance under transitionary arrangements. WLMI also ceded a large proportion of risks from mortgages with 90% and below LVR ratio through quota-share reinsurance arrangements. The transitionary arrangements have resulted in a higher regulatory capital requirement due to limitations on the amount of reinsurance allowed in the regulatory risk based calculation. To continue to meet WLMI's target capital ratios, WBC partially offset the higher capital requirement with a AUD30 million injection of equity in FY16. WLMI's coverage of its regulatory-prescribed capital decreased to an adequate 1.3x at FYE16 (FYE15: 1.5x). Financial leverage decreased to 28% at FYE16 (FYE15: 37%) due to a larger capital base. WLMI's debt consists of AUD80 million in Tier 2-compliant subordinated notes issued to WBC. This is higher than the agency's median criteria guidelines for 'AA' rated insurers and increases the company's reliance on WBC. However, strong profitability resulted in an interest coverage ratio of 14x in FY16, which is consistent with Fitch's median criteria guidelines for the rating. In Fitch's opinion, WLMI has sufficient capital to withstand a range of severe downturn scenarios, although in a more severe scenario WLMI would be likely to require recapitalisation to continue operating within prudential guidelines. In such a scenario, the agency believes WBC would be willing and capable of providing support. WLMI has a low-risk investment portfolio that consists of cash and highly rated fixed-income securities, which are restricted to those from domestic 'AA-'-rated financial institutions. The company is not exposed to risky assets, such as equities or below-investment-grade securities. WLMI's narrow product focus as a mono-line insurer renders it susceptible to a systemic downturn in Australia's housing market. However, it has geographic diversity in its Australian exposure, helping mitigate the potential adverse effect of a regional downturn. Default rates have differed among Australian states and regions due to variations in economic stresses. The company's portfolio is weighted towards fully documented, prime borrowers. Non-standard loans accounted for 17% of risks in force at FYE16 (FYE15: 21%) and were less than 1% of risks underwritten during the year. These consist mainly of self-employed borrowers with original LTV ratios of less than 80%. RATING SENSITIVITIES There is little prospect of WLMI's rating being upgraded, as this would require an uplift from the group rating, which was affirmed in March 2017. Fitch considers WLMI's standalone rating to be below that of WBC. A downgrade of WBC's rating could lead to a downgrade of WLMI due to its reliance on WBC. A downgrade could also result if a severely deteriorating economic environment leads to a weakening of WLMI's capital position and capital support was not forthcoming from WBC. In such a scenario, WLMI may find itself unable to meet high minimum regulatory capital requirements.

May's Conservatives will fail to win a majority, according to an exit poll, meaning the like-minded DUP, set to gain two seats to win 10 of Northern Ireland's total of 18, could potentially play a key role in a future government. The influence which Britain's smallest province may have after the election was reinforced by the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party's pledge to maintain its policy of not taking its seats, a position that will cut the numbers needed to win a majority. Sinn Fein was on course to win as many as 7 of the remaining seats, up from 4 in 2015. That would mean the winning party would need 323 seats for a majority, rather than 326. The exit poll suggested May's Conservatives would win 314 seats.  This is perfect territory for the DUP obviously because if the Conservatives are just short of an overall majority, it puts us in a very, very strong negotiating position and it is one we would take up with relish,  DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC television.  We will be serious players if there is a hung parliament. We will talk to whoever is the largest party, it looks like the Conservatives. We have a lot in common, we want to see Brexit work, we want to see the Union strengthened. I think there is a lot of common ground.  Donaldson suggested that the DUP could support a Conservative government on a vote by vote basis. The party's leader, Arlene Foster, said they would have to have very serious discussions if the exit poll was borne out.  Political leaders in Northern Ireland had cast the election as a referendum on whether voters want to be part of the United Kingdom or neighboring Ireland after Brexit and a nationalist surge at regional elections in March raised the stakes in the long and divisive dispute over the province's status.  The outcome allowed for interpretations either way and with Sinn Fein and the DUP deadlocked in talks to restore the province's devolved assembly, others suggested the latest election would only serve to complicate those negotiations.  It's very difficult to see how two parties emboldened by the results this evening will be any more conciliatory when it comes to re-establishing the devolved institutions,  Naomi Long, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance Party, who like all smaller parties failed to win a seat, told the BBC.

The move follows out-of-cycle rate hikes announced by Australia's major banks in March even as the country's central bank has held rates at a record low 1.50 percent after last easing in 2016. The change will bring ANZ's interest-only home loan rates to as high as 6.26 percent. At the same time, the bank said it will lower variable interest rates by 5 basis points on principal and interest home loans to 5.20 for owner-occupiers and 5.80 percent for investors. All changes are effective June 16.  We need to manage our regulatory obligations and we are now required to hold additional capital against our home loans,  ANZ Group Executive Australia Fred Ohlsson said. Australia's 'Big Four' banks including ANZ are heavily reliant on mortgages for earnings growth. However, regulators have intensified pressure in recent months to slow down lending, in particular interest-only loans which are massively favoured by speculative investors. Regulators are worried excessive debt in the property market will hurt spending elsewhere in the economy as the nation's household debt-to-income ratio has climbed to an all-time peak of 189 percent. Late in March, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) asked banks to limit new interest-only lending to 30 percent of total new residential mortgage lending, from 40 percent now. It also demanded that banks limit investor credit to  comfortably remain below  a previously-set cap of 10 percent annual growth. The measures seem to have worked. Home prices in Sydney and Melbourne - two of the hottest markets - have eased since April although they are still up 11 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively, from a year ago. Separately, data on Friday showed housing finance fell 1.9 percent in April for a third straight month of falls.

In a statement on Universal's website issued under the name of the company's president, Universal said it had found the possibility of  fraudulent acts  related to a 2015 loan of HK$135 million ($17.31 million) to an unnamed third party.  The statement says that all but HK$5 million of the loan was subsequently transferred to Okada Holdings Limited, a company controlled by Okada and his son, and that the purpose of the loan was  to achieve personal benefit for Chairman Okada.  Okada Holdings holds a majority stake in Universal, whose shares fell 6.1 percent to 3,250 yen Friday morning in Tokyo. Related CoverageUniversal Entertainment shares tank, chairman accused of improper loanThe statement says the transfer was carried out by Okada and another director, Yoshinao Negishi. A week earlier, the company said both men would not be reappointed to the board at its annual shareholder meeting this month.      Okada could not be reached for comment. David Krakoff, a lawyer who is representing Okada and Universal Entertainment in an unrelated U.S. civil legal proceeding, did not respond to an email or phone call requesting comment.     Negishi did not respond to messages to a social media account seeking comment.      No one at Universal could be reached. The statement was released in the evening Tokyo time after normal working hours.    The company's president, Jun Fujimoto, could not be reached for comment.     Universal Entertainment said it has established an investigative panel composed of three external lawyers to further probe the transfer of funds, with an interim report expected to be completed around the end of June.     Okada, who founded the predecessor of Universal in 1969 and ranks among Japan's wealthiest people, has focused much of his time recently on a $2.4 billion casino resort that opened earlier this year in the Philippines.

In a statement on Universal's website issued under the name of the company's president, Universal said it had found the possibility of  fraudulent acts  related to a 2015 loan of HK$135 million ($17.31 million) to an unnamed third party.  The statement says that all but HK$5 million of the loan was subsequently transferred to Okada Holdings Limited, a company controlled by Okada and his son, and that the purpose of the loan was  to achieve personal benefit for Chairman Okada.  Okada Holdings holds a majority stake in Universal, whose shares fell 6.1 percent to 3,250 yen Friday morning in Tokyo. Related CoverageUniversal Entertainment shares tank, chairman accused of improper loanThe statement says the transfer was carried out by Okada and another director, Yoshinao Negishi. A week earlier, the company said both men would not be reappointed to the board at its annual shareholder meeting this month.      Okada could not be reached for comment. David Krakoff, a lawyer who is representing Okada and Universal Entertainment in an unrelated U.S. civil legal proceeding, did not respond to an email or phone call requesting comment.     Negishi did not respond to messages to a social media account seeking comment.      No one at Universal could be reached. The statement was released in the evening Tokyo time after normal working hours.    The company's president, Jun Fujimoto, could not be reached for comment.     Universal Entertainment said it has established an investigative panel composed of three external lawyers to further probe the transfer of funds, with an interim report expected to be completed around the end of June.     Okada, who founded the predecessor of Universal in 1969 and ranks among Japan's wealthiest people, has focused much of his time recently on a $2.4 billion casino resort that opened earlier this year in the Philippines. Okada has billed the ambitious project as a way to tap into the growth of Asian gaming and to diversify Universal's revenues beyond its mainstay business of selling machines for pachinko, a mix of slot and pinball that is the dominant form of gambling in Japan.

(Reuters) - A U.S. intelligence contractor accused of illegally leaking a classified report on Russian interference in U.S. elections to a media outlet pleaded not guilty on Thursday to an espionage offense, and a federal judge denied her request for bail. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, is accused of passing the top secret National Security Agency report to The Intercept last month while working with Pluribus International Corp, which provides analytical services for U.S. defense and intelligence. Winner was charged in a federal grand jury indictment on Wednesday with a single count of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, a felony offense under the Espionage and Censorship Act that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A federal judge ordered that Winner remain held without bond after prosecutors argued during Thursday's three-hour hearing that she posed a flight risk and public danger, citing what they called  disturbing  comments found in her notebook. In one notation she wrote:  I want to burn the White House down,  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Solari told the judge. The prosecutor said investigators also found the names of three Islamic extremists known to federal authorities listed in Winner's notebook. According to a probable-cause affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Winner admitted to intentionally printing a copy of the intelligence report in her office and mailing it to the news outlet.     The NSA document in question provided technical details on what it said were Russian attempts to hack election officials in the United States and a voting-machine firm before the presidential election in November, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the case have confirmed to Reuters.

Lincoln County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERSThe FBI said unauthorized disclosure of the secret document  could reasonably result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security,  though the government has not alleged that Winner sought to share the report with foreign agents. She is the first person charged with leaking classified information to the media since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who has called for investigations into leaks to the media. Slideshow (4 Images)A White House spokeswoman said at a press briefing ahead of Winner's detention hearing that Trump believes anyone found guilty of unlawfully disclosing government secrets should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Winner, shackled at the feet and wearing an orange jumpsuit in court, said little during Thursday's proceeding, except to reply,  Not guilty, your honor,  when asked for her plea, and to answer  yes  and  no  to procedural questions put to her by the judge. Winner's parents testified in support of her request to be released from jail on bond, describing their daughter as a church-going patriot who volunteered for the military and was never previously in trouble.  Your honor, my daughter is a good girl. She will do whatever you tell her to do if you grant her bond,  her stepfather, Gary Winner, told the judge. Solari countered that Winner's political agenda mattered more to her than her oath to protect secrets entrusted to her, adding that she might be tempted to flee if further charges were brought in the continuing investigation.

The Nikkei share average, built on early gains to stand 0.8 percent higher at 20,065.89 points by midmorning. For the week, the index is poised to post a 0.5 percent drop. Trading was volatile after a UK election exit poll pointed to a hung parliament, a shock result that would plunge British politics into turmoil and could delay Brexit talks.  If that's the case, there will be big uncertainty over Brexit talks thus the market will likely become risk averse,  said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. With the count still underway, the BBC said that Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party was forecast to remain the largest party in parliament, predicting that the Conservatives would lose fewer seats than the exit poll had suggested, but would still come up short of a majority. The chance that the Conservatives could scrape majority, however, was enough to spark short-covering by short term investors such as hedge funds and commodity trading advisors, traders said. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp jumped more than 7 percent to hit a 17-year high after a subsidiary of the company had agreed to buy robotics firm Boston Dynamics from Alphabet Inc. SoftBank contributed a hefty 74 positive points to the Nikkei benchmark index, which was why the index was outperforming the broader Topix, which was only up 0.3 percent. Traders said that overnight gains in Nvidia Corp and Alibaba also contributed to gains in SoftBank, which has a stake in them. Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 0.7 percent, Nissan Motor Co falling 0.1 percent and Panasonic Corp declining 1.1 percent. Fujifilm Holdings stumbled more than 4 percent after the Nikkei reported that the company's accounting irregularities spread to its Australian unit. Also underperforming the market was slot machine maker Universal Entertainment Corp, which plunged as much as 13 percent after the company said it was investigating what it suspects was an improper transfer of funds by its chairman to a company he controls.

Not only that but sixth seed Thiem has not dropped a set en route to Friday's semi-final and on Wednesday trounced defending champion Novak Djokovic 7-6 6-3 6-0. So, while many are already writing Nadal's name on the trophy for an unprecedented 10th time, the fourth seed will have some doubts in the back of his mind as he takes on a man aiming to avoid a second successive semis-final exit. Nadal dropped 22 games in reaching the semi-finals -- the lowest total in the professional era -- but is unlikely to beat Bjorn Borg's record of dropping a mere 27 on his way to the 1978 final at Roland Garros. Whether or not 23-year-old Thiem can win enough games to seriously worry Nadal will boil down to how much belief the Austrian can take on to the Philippe Chatrier court that Nadal has more or less owned since 2005. Related CoveragePlayer profiles: Rafa Nadal vs Dominic Thiem2017 record: Rafa Nadal vs Dominic ThiemWhat will help is the win he enjoyed over Nadal in Rome after losing to the 31-year-old in Barcelona and Madrid.  It's great for me to be in the semi-finals again,  Thiem said.  On Friday I'm playing the toughest opponent ever here in Roland Garros. The toughest match what you can imagine.  But there are no secrets.  Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 7, 2017   Spain's Rafael Nadal in action during his quarter final match against Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta   Reuters / Benoit TessierWhile Nadal, trying to become the second man in the professional era to make 10 appearances in the final at one grand slam after Roger Federer (Wimbledon), will be favorite to beat Thiem, the other semi-final looks too close to call. It is a repeat of last year's semi-final when Andy Murray produced arguably his greatest match on clay to defeat reigning champion Stan Wawrinka. World number one Murray is the only one of the surviving quartet to have been seriously tested so far here, having dropped three sets. But after arriving in Paris at a low ebb after a poor run on clay, the arrival of coach Ivan Lendl to watch over his shoulder has flicked a switch and he looks menacing again. Murray, bidding to reach a 12th grand slam final, feels he has hit form at just the right time.  I feel like I'm sort of in autopilot a little bit, like I know what I should be doing,  Murray said after dispatching Japan's Kei Nishikori in the quarter-finals in four sets. Wawrinka, champion in 2015, comes alive at the slams, especially in the latter stages and he has been in brutal form, steaming past the likes of Fabio Fognini, Gael Monfils and Marin Cilic with nonchalant ease. He trails Murray 10-7 overall but has a full tank of gas.  There have been other tournaments where making it to the semi-finals was much more difficult with longer matches,  he said.  The fact is things have gone quite well. I feel physically and mentally ready. I feel fresh.

Cink ran up nine birdies and three bogeys in a rollercoaster round at TPC Southwind to join Matt Every, Scott Brown and Colombian Sebastian Munoz at the top, with South African Charl Schwartzel and Australian Matt Jones one shot off the lead. Rickie Fowler struggled to get his game on track after posting a double bogey at his fourth hole and a triple at his sixth and ended the day on four-over-par (74), leaving him with a lot of work to do to make the cut in the final tune-up for next week’s U.S. Open. The 44-year-old Cink said he was  a little tired  after coming through a sectional qualifier for the second major of the year.  Takes a little bit longer at 44 to get over those kind of days,  the 2009 British Open champion told reporters. “I did a pretty good job of managing myself out there, not getting too bent out of shape about anything good or bad that happened. And it was a solid day. Every part of the game was pretty solid.” Jun 8, 2017; Memphis, TN, USA; Rickie Fowler hits his tee shot on the 11th hole during the first round of the FedEx St. Jude Classic golf tournament at TPC Southwind.

(Reuters) - A U.S. intelligence contractor accused of illegally leaking a classified report on Russian interference in U.S. elections to a media outlet pleaded not guilty on Thursday to an espionage offense, and a federal judge denied her request for bail. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, is accused of passing the top secret National Security Agency report to The Intercept last month while working with Pluribus International Corp, which provides analytical services for U.S. defense and intelligence. Winner was charged in a federal grand jury indictment on Wednesday with a single count of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, a felony offense under the Espionage and Censorship Act that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A federal judge ordered that Winner remain held without bond after prosecutors argued during Thursday's three-hour hearing that she posed a flight risk and public danger, citing what they called  disturbing  comments found in her notebook. In one notation she wrote:  I want to burn the White House down,  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Solari told the judge. The prosecutor said investigators also found the names of three Islamic extremists known to federal authorities listed in Winner's notebook. According to a probable-cause affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Winner admitted to intentionally printing a copy of the intelligence report in her office and mailing it to the news outlet.     The NSA document in question provided technical details on what it said were Russian attempts to hack election officials in the United States and a voting-machine firm before the presidential election in November, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the case have confirmed to Reuters.

Lincoln County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERSThe FBI said unauthorized disclosure of the secret document  could reasonably result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security,  though the government has not alleged that Winner sought to share the report with foreign agents. She is the first person charged with leaking classified information to the media since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who has called for investigations into leaks to the media. Slideshow (4 Images)A White House spokeswoman said at a press briefing ahead of Winner's detention hearing that Trump believes anyone found guilty of unlawfully disclosing government secrets should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Winner, shackled at the feet and wearing an orange jumpsuit in court, said little during Thursday's proceeding, except to reply,  Not guilty, your honor,  when asked for her plea, and to answer  yes  and  no  to procedural questions put to her by the judge. Winner's parents testified in support of her request to be released from jail on bond, describing their daughter as a church-going patriot who volunteered for the military and was never previously in trouble.  Your honor, my daughter is a good girl. She will do whatever you tell her to do if you grant her bond,  her stepfather, Gary Winner, told the judge. Solari countered that Winner's political agenda mattered more to her than her oath to protect secrets entrusted to her, adding that she might be tempted to flee if further charges were brought in the continuing investigation.

Gianforte will appear in court in Bozeman on Monday and is scheduled to be sentenced the same day, after he enters his plea, Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert said by phone. The altercation has been portrayed as an illustration of the new toxicity of American politics. Critics of President Donald Trump say his strident criticism of the media has encouraged violence against journalists, while his supporters say many reporters are overly aggressive and disrespectful.   Under Montana law, a conviction for misdemeanor assault carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. Lambert declined to say if his office would recommend jail time. An attorney for Gianforte declined comment. Gianforte, a technology executive, pledged in a letter on Wednesday to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists and apologized to reporter Ben Jacobs, who accused Gianforte of assaulting him on May 24. Gianforte won Montana's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election the next day. Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of The Guardian newspaper, said Gianforte  body-slammed  him, breaking his eyeglasses, when the reporter posed a question about healthcare during a campaign event in Bozeman.  FILE PHOTO - U.S. House of Representative elect Greg Gianforte delivers his victory speech during a special congressional election in Bozeman, Montana, U.S. on May 25, 2017.Colter Peterson/File PhotoGianforte was heard shouting:  Get the hell out of here  and  I'm sick and tired of you guys  in an audio recording of the incident played repeatedly on cable news television. Gianforte's campaign initially suggested Jacobs instigated the incident by barging into the candidate's office and shoving a recording device in his face as he was preparing for a TV interview. But in a letter of apology to Jacobs issued on Wednesday, Gianforte said his  physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful.  In return for Gianforte's apology and his charitable donation, Jacobs agreed not to bring civil action against the congressman-elect. Jacobs, at Gianforte's request, also sent an email to Lambert, saying he would not object to Gianforte pleading no contest to misdemeanor assault, according to a release of liability document signed by Jacobs. Lambert said his office could still insist that Gianforte plead guilty instead of pleading no contest. In either event, the plea would trigger Gianforte's sentencing. Lambert previously said additional, more serious criminal charges could be brought in the case. But he said on Thursday that after reviewing the evidence and discussing the matter with Jacobs, the prosecutor decided the misdemeanor charge was appropriate. Gianforte defeated Democrat Rob Quist to fill the House seat vacated when Trump appointed Ryan Zinke as interior secretary. He is expected to be sworn in later this month.

In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he wanted to get his account of his conversations with Trump into the public sphere in the hope it would prompt the appointment of a special counsel, as later occurred, to oversee the investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The conversations included one in which Comey said he believed Trump had pressured him in February to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey said he had asked  a close friend  who was a Columbia Law School professor to get his story out after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on May 9. Daniel Richman, a professor of criminal law at Columbia, confirmed to Reuters he was the person referred to in Comey's testimony. Richman, who is listed as an adviser to Comey in his official biography on the school's website, did not respond to further requests for comments. During his time in office, Trump has raged against the press and its use of anonymous sources.  Following Comey's testimony, Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz sharply criticized Comey for leaking what he called  privileged communications  between the president and the then-FBI director. He tried to link Comey with others in the government who he said had selectively and illegally leaked classified information to undermine the administration and suggested that Comey might have broken the law. It would be up to the appropriate authorities to determine whether the leak should be investigated, Kasowitz said. Comey could not be reached for immediate comment.  Some legal experts said Comey's actions did not run afoul of the law. Faiza Patel, co-director of public policy group Brennan Center for Justice, noted that Comey testified that he was careful to avoid putting classified information in memos memorializing his conversations with Trump. Other experts said Kasowitz's claim that Comey leaked  privileged  information was off the mark, citing the fact that Trump previously had disclosed details about his interactions with Comey. To leak his memo, Comey chose someone who has publicly defended him in the past, including his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. A 1984 graduate of Yale Law School, Richman clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. He served as chief appellate attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan from 1987 to 1992, when Comey was also a prosecutor in that office. Richman went on to join the faculty of Fordham University School of Law and moved to Columbia in 2007. He has also served as a consultant to the U.S. Justice and Treasury departments on criminal matters and on advisory committees to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York state Governor Eliot Spitzer. After Comey's testimony, a surge of Web searches for Richman appeared to overwhelm the Columbia Law School's website.  Columbia Law's site is down at the moment. We are working on a solution. Stay tuned,  the school said in a posting on Twitter.

In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9.  During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations,  to sort that out.   I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning,  Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI probe of Flynn. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on.  We're under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever,  he said. Comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the president's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trump's presidency, especially as the FBI probe has ensnared not only Flynn but Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. Comey's testimony drew renewed attention to Sessions and his relationship with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak.  After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Related CoverageTrump still standing, but damaged by Comey's testimonyInstant View: Comey accuses Trump administration of defaming himTrump lawyer criticizes Comey's leak to news mediaAsked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added:  Again, I take the president's words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.  Comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. 'Lies, Plain and Simple' Comey said Trump's administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.  Those were lies, plain and simple,  Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trump's administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election.  The Russian investigation is going to go on and it's not going to stop and the president should have known that,  committee member Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told MSNBC. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey's testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last year's election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. Former Federal Bureau of Investigations Director James Comey departs after testifying before a closed session of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 8, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinNBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in mid-June.   Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist. Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman confirmed to Reuters he was the friend to whom Comey was referring. Kasowitz said that  we will leave it to the appropriate authorities  to determine whether Comey's leak  should be investigated.  Legal experts questioned Kasowitz's contention that Trump's private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications. 'Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes'     Comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with Trump, but that if so, they should be released. Slideshow (9 Images) Lordy, I hope there are tapes,  Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because  I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.  From Capitol Hill to San Francisco's Castro district, Comey's appearance attracted television  watch parties  beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the  Super Bowl of Washington.  U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comey's testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trump's presidency.  Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, whom the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Kislyak. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the president's request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trump's position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation.      Yes,  Comey replied.     Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said.  He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way,  she said.  Regarding Sessions, Comey said he did not discuss Trump's pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with the attorney general because the FBI leadership team believed Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russia probe.  We were also aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,  Comey said, without giving more details. The Justice Department later issued a statement saying that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe only because he had been part of Trump's campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding:  I'll just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.

But former FBI Director James Comey's remarks to a packed hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee left the Republican president far from unscathed. Comey recounted in vivid detail conversations with Trump that he viewed as an effort to undermine an investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. He also said Trump's comments after firing him on May 9 that the FBI was in disarray and that its members had lost confidence in Comey  were lies, plain and simple.  Still, Comey handed Trump and his supporters some fresh ammunition when he confirmed he had told the president the investigation was not focused on him personally. Even Senator Marco Rubio, who was among a number of Republicans who battled Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, seemed to be advocating for him at times during the hearing. Rubio asked Comey why he did not directly tell Trump that he thought the president was making inappropriate requests of him. Comey replied that he did not know. “I was a bit stunned, and didn’t have the presence of mind,” he said. A Republican close to Trump said the president felt very good about Comey's testimony, particularly since it bore out his earlier statement that the former FBI director had told him he was not under investigation. But the cloud from the Russia probe still hangs heavily over Trump's White House.  Comey's firing set the stage for the appointment of a special counsel, Robert Mueller, who has taken over the investigation. Congressional probes, including one by the Senate intelligence panel, are ongoing. Russia has denied interference in last year's presidential campaign. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. But Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who sits on the intelligence committee, said the matter was nowhere near over.  It’s a big investigation, and these are facts. ... You have to dig for, and do a lot of analysis.  Several Democrats said Trump's conversations with Comey seemed to build a case of obstruction of justice. “The lawyers are going to dig into obstruction of justice,” Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the intelligence panel, said after the hearing.  I believe the evidence just keeps piling up that there has been a very real presidential abuse of power.” But Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said Trump's interactions with Comey may have reflected his lack of political experience rather than an effort  to pressure the FBI director. Ryan said Trump may not have been  steeped  enough in the FBI's independence from the White House.  He's new in government, and so therefore I think he's learning as he goes,  he told reporters.  I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse. It's just my observation.  A Long Summer Trump could face even more problems over the coming months if the stream of details leaking out about the Russia investigation continues to grab the spotlight at a time when the White House wants to focus on priorities such as rolling back the Obamacare healthcare law and overhauling the tax code.  It distracts the administration and gives Republicans in the House and the Senate, many of whom have not been Trump supporters from the beginning, a reason to keep their distance and not get behind him,  said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducts political polling.  It’s going to be a long summer,” Smith said. Trump's core supporters are hunkering down for a fight. Great America Alliance, one pro-Trump group, spent $400,000 this week running ads attacking Comey, said Eric Beach, who runs the group. The ad lambasted Comey as “just another D.C. insider  and included images of militant attacks abroad to suggest Comey had not been focused enough on protecting Americans. But the investigation has contributed to a steady erosion of Trump's political capital. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken from June 1 to 5, even before the Comey testimony - 38 percent of Americans said they approved of Trump, versus 58 percent who disapproved.   I think the situation is getting much more serious for Mr. Trump,” said Jon Bond, a political science professor at Texas A&M; University. “The Mueller investigation is going on. I suspect that information that came out in today’s hearings is going to feed into that investigation. It looks like to me that the president is in increasing jeopardy.” Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell, Richard Cowan, Steve Holland, Ginger Gibson, Patricia Zengerle and Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-fallout-idUSKBN190066"},

Gianforte will appear in court in Bozeman on Monday and is scheduled to be sentenced the same day, after he enters his plea, Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert said by phone. The altercation has been portrayed as an illustration of the new toxicity of American politics. Critics of President Donald Trump say his strident criticism of the media has encouraged violence against journalists, while his supporters say many reporters are overly aggressive and disrespectful.   Under Montana law, a conviction for misdemeanor assault carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. Lambert declined to say if his office would recommend jail time. An attorney for Gianforte declined comment. Gianforte, a technology executive, pledged in a letter on Wednesday to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists and apologized to reporter Ben Jacobs, who accused Gianforte of assaulting him on May 24. Gianforte won Montana's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election the next day. Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of The Guardian newspaper, said Gianforte  body-slammed  him, breaking his eyeglasses, when the reporter posed a question about healthcare during a campaign event in Bozeman.  FILE PHOTO - U.S. House of Representative elect Greg Gianforte delivers his victory speech during a special congressional election in Bozeman, Montana, U.S. on May 25, 2017.Colter Peterson/File PhotoGianforte was heard shouting:  Get the hell out of here  and  I'm sick and tired of you guys  in an audio recording of the incident played repeatedly on cable news television. Gianforte's campaign initially suggested Jacobs instigated the incident by barging into the candidate's office and shoving a recording device in his face as he was preparing for a TV interview. But in a letter of apology to Jacobs issued on Wednesday, Gianforte said his  physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful.  In return for Gianforte's apology and his charitable donation, Jacobs agreed not to bring civil action against the congressman-elect. Jacobs, at Gianforte's request, also sent an email to Lambert, saying he would not object to Gianforte pleading no contest to misdemeanor assault, according to a release of liability document signed by Jacobs. Lambert said his office could still insist that Gianforte plead guilty instead of pleading no contest. In either event, the plea would trigger Gianforte's sentencing. Lambert previously said additional, more serious criminal charges could be brought in the case. But he said on Thursday that after reviewing the evidence and discussing the matter with Jacobs, the prosecutor decided the misdemeanor charge was appropriate. Gianforte defeated Democrat Rob Quist to fill the House seat vacated when Trump appointed Ryan Zinke as interior secretary. He is expected to be sworn in later this month.

Reality Leigh Winner, 25, is accused of passing a top secret National Security Agency report to The Intercept while working as a contractor with Pluribus International Corp. Winner was charged in a federal grand jury indictment on Wednesday with a single count of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, a federal felony offense that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A federal judge ordered that Winner remain held without bond after prosecutors argued during Thursday's three-hour hearing that she posed a flight risk and danger to the public, citing what they called  disturbing  comments in a notebook of hers. In one notation she wrote:  I want to burn the White House down,  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Solari told the judge. The prosecutor said investigators also found the names of three Islamic extremists known to federal authorities listed in Winner's notebook. According to a probable-cause affidavit filed in court by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Winner admitted to intentionally printing a copy of the intelligence report in her office and mailing it to the news outlet. The NSA document in question provided technical details on what it said were Russian attempts to hack election officials in the United States and a voting-machine firm before the U.S. presidential election in November, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the case have confirmed to Reuters. The FBI affidavit said unauthorized disclosure of the document  could reasonably result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security, and is marked as such.  Winner, shackled at the feet and wearing an orange jumpsuit in court, said little during Thursday's proceeding, except to reply,  not guilty, your honor,  when asked for her plea, and to answer  yes  and  no  to procedural questions put to her by the judge. She became the first person charged with leaking classified information to the media under the administration of President Donald Trump. Trump, who has repeatedly vowed to crack down on leakers, believes anyone found guilty of unlawfully disclosing government secrets should be punished to the fullest extent of the law, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said at a press briefing ahead of Winner's detention hearing. First Amendment advocates have said they are concerned the Trump administration may use Winner's case to chill what they view as legitimate government whistleblowing. They were also critical of the Obama administration's approach to leaks, including its pursuit of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The case against Winner was announced less than an hour after The Intercept published the secret NSA document. Reporting Rich McKay in Augusta.

Trump,James Comey,Koji Fukaya,Theresa May,Yukio Ishizuki,GLOBAL,FOREX/ (UPDATE 1),Americas,Japan,New Zealand,Currencies / Foreign Exchange Markets,Corporate Events,Asia / Pacific,Australia,Euro Zone as a Whole,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"* British exit polls point to hung parliament in blow for May * Pound down 1.5 pct after dropping as much as 2 pct vs dollar * Movements in dollar, euro and yen limited, Comey taken in stride * Broader market focus shifts to next week's Fed meeting (Adds details and quotes, updates prices) By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, June 9 (Reuters) - The pound fell sharply on Friday after British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party appeared set to fall short of an expected majority in a general election. Sterling was down 1.5 percent at $1.2764 after sliding to as low as $1.2705, down about 2 percent and the weakest since April 18. An exit poll predicted the Conservatives would win 314 seats in the 650-member parliament and the opposition Labour Party 266, meaning no clear winner and a  hung parliament . As of 0125 GMT the BBC reported that May's party was not expecting an overall majority. If the exit poll proves correct, the shock result would plunge domestic politics into turmoil and could alter the nature of Brexit talks. For a graphic on the poll and results as they come in, see tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48 Movements in other major currencies such as the dollar, euro and yen were limited, also having taken in stride testimony by former FBI director James Comey, which was initially expected to be the other big event of the week.  Britain's exit from the European Union will continue regardless of the political turmoil likely to be created by the election results. Other currencies, like dollar/yen, are not reacting much as it is a more domestic affair this time, unlike last year's Brexit vote,  said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.  Focus for the broader currency market will now shift towards the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.  The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 110.110 yen.  There were many participants who wanted to take advantage of the volatility resulting from a key event like the British elections, which explains the pound's initial steep drop,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The swings in the pound have not spilled over into other currencies as the market was well hedged and prepared for a variety of election scenarios.  The euro extended overnight losses and was 0.2 percent lower at $1.1190. The common currency was capped after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme. Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine its investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. While this was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years and was approached by investors with caution, it did not offer fresh insight for the financial markets. The Nasdaq managed to close at a record high on Thursday. Trump's critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offence potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. Buoyed by the pound's fall, the dollar index against a basket of major currencies was up 0.4 percent at 97.319.

some key developments so far:          VALE OF CLWYD     LABOUR GAIN     The first Labour gain of the night. Some polls had showed the Conservatives doing well in Wales, where most people voted to leave the European Union. But Labour overturned a thin 237 vote margin, increasing its vote by around 12 percentage points          NUNEATON     CONSERVATIVE HOLD     Considered a national bellwether seat, holding Nuneaton gave May's Conservatives a boost. They increased their majority here in 2015, despite it being a Labour target, and it provided one of the first indications the Conservatives were on course for victory. However, Labour also increased their share of the vote in the seat, as support for the anti-European Union party UKIP collapsed.          DARLINGTON     LABOUR HOLD     This was a key Conservative target seat, which voted in favor of leaving the EU. But Labour held the seat, with both parties increasing their share of the vote by about 8 percentage points.      SWINDON SOUTH     CONSERVATIVE HOLD     Swindon South was held by the Conservatives despite being among the more marginal seats.          BATTERSEA     LABOUR GAIN     British junior finance minister Jane Ellison was defending a 15 percentage point lead in Battersea in London, but the strongly pro-Remain seat voted Labour. The opposition party increased its share of the vote by 9.1 percentage points, while Conservative share of the vote dropped by nearly 11 points.              EALING CENTRAL & ACTON     LABOUR HOLD     Labour's Rupa Huq had just a 274 seat majority in 2015, but gained a massive 16.5 percentage point increase to record nearly 60 percent of the vote it the strongly pro-remain seat.          ANGUS     CONSERVATIVE GAIN     Britain's Conservative Party has taken the Angus seat from the Scottish National Party by overturning a 11,230 majority to win by 2,644 votes, delivering a blow to Nicola Sturgeon's party, which had a near clean sweep in Scotland two years ago.          MORAY     CONSERVATIVE GAIN     The Conservatives also took Moray from the SNP, unseating the party's leader in Westminster Angus Robertson. While Moray voted to remain in the European Union, it did so by the tightest margin in Scotland, and was strongly against independence in 2014's Scottish referendum.          BURY NORTH     LABOUR GAIN     This had been a Conservative-held marginal seat, with a majority of just 378 voters. It has been a bellwether seat so the fact the Conservatives lost it, despite facing no UKIP candidate, supports the view that they could lose their majority.          Still to come:           NORTHAMPTON NORTH, RESULT EXPECTED 0100 GMT     This seat has elected a lawmaker from the winning party at every British national election since it was created in 1974. It is held by the Conservatives with a majority of 3,245.     UKIP, which won more than 6,000 votes here in 2015, are not fielding a candidate so it should be a comfortable win for the Conservatives if they are to increase their national majority.                   HASTINGS AND RYE, RESULT EXPECTED 0200 GMT     ITV REPORT THAT THERE IS A RECOUNT AS TOO CLOSE TO CALL     This is the seat of interior minister Amber Rudd, who has played a prominent role in the election campaign and is tipped as a possible successor to Chancellor Philip Hammond. She has held it since 2010, and won a majority of 4,796 in 2015.     The Green Party, which won just under 2,000 votes there in 2015, has agreed not to field a candidate in a bid to help Labour try and unseat Rudd. Pollster YouGov's election model has predicted they could succeed in doing so.          BRIGHTON KEMPTOWN, RESULT EXPECTED 0400 GMT     This marginal seat is held by the Conservative minister responsible for financial services, Simon Kirby, with a majority of just 690. It voted strongly in favor of remaining in the EU.     It has been a bellwether at national elections since 1979 and the Green Party, who won more than 3,000 votes here in 2015, are not standing. Labour need to win seats like this if they are to have any chance of being the largest party nationally.          HALIFAX, RESULT EXPECTED 0430 GMT     This is one of Labour's most marginal seats, with a majority of just 428. It voted in favor of Brexit. May's Conservatives launched their election policy document here and need to win seats like this if she is to hang on to her majority.

The helmets point to both present and future -- Alonso the team's big name driver who may not stay beyond this season, and Lando Norris, the British 17-year-old being groomed for great things.  Certainly Lando is a world champion of the future with us,  said Brown, who arrived last November after previous boss Ron Dennis was ousted.  He's still young and you can ruin a driver by putting him in too early. But do I anticipate Lando being in a McLaren, winning races and the championship? That's the plan,  the American told Reuters before flying to Canada for this weekend's grand prix. On the team's current form, that is very much a long-term plan as Norris seeks to win the European Formula Three championship. Honda-powered McLaren are the only team not to have scored a point so far this season and the former champions have not won a grand prix since 2012. The immediate challenge is keeping Alonso and that will depend on the increasingly unlikely chance of engine partners Honda getting their act together. Without a winning engine, the Spaniard looks set to leave.  I think he loves the McLaren environment, I think there’s no team he’d rather race for more than McLaren. But he wants to race at the front of the field. And I get it,  said Brown.  There’s zero tension between Fernando Alonso and McLaren, the relationship has never been healthier. We’re frustrated together.  We’ve been clear that we want him to stay and he’s been clear he wants to stay, but we need a better race car so that’s where our attention is on.  Motorsport Network The cabinet, in a spacious glass-walled office with views looking out across the factory's lake, also contains miniature cars, including from rivals Mercedes, Ferrari and Williams. The collection says a lot about the American marketing and sponsorship expert's wide-ranging interests and connections across the paddock. The 45-year-old retired racer, who has another collection of real Formula One cars including a Michael Schumacher Benetton B191 and Ayrton Senna Lotus 98T from the 1980s, is a wearer of many hats if not helmets. Part of the management team tasked with leading the former champions back to the top, he is also chairman of the fast-growing Miami-based Motorsport Network. The multi-lingual media platform includes the Motorsport.com and autosport.com websites, as well as F1 Racing magazine, Motorsport.TV and photographic archives going back to the championship's early years. It also has a stake in Formula E, the electric series in which McLaren Applied Technologies will be battery supplier from next year, and is building close ties to Formula One's new owners Liberty Media. Some might see the many overlaps as posing a conflict of interest for Brown, who holds an executive role at publications that write about his team. He sees it differently.  I work and help the company on the business side, not the editorial side. If you look at Autosport, we’ve had good headlines and bad headlines. I’m not contributing to things editorially,  he said.  Is it a conflict that (Red Bull owner) Dietrich (Mateschitz) owns the Austrian GP? The sport loves finding conflicts or creating conflicts. Sometimes they are really there, sometimes they aren’t.  The former head of CSM Sport & Entertainment introduced sponsors around the paddock in his former existence and is known as a dealmaker. That is one reason why McLaren, who have lost some key backers, brought him in.   I’ve known (Red Bull team boss) Christian Horner for 20 years. (Mercedes motorsport head) Toto (Wolff) and I have done deals. I’ve done deals with Ferrari. (Williams chief executive) Mike O’Driscoll used to sit on my advisory board,  he said.  I’ve got great relationships up and down pitlane ... when I joined here I thought I don’t want to lose those relationships and I haven’t.

Trump,Kate McBride,Scott Puritz,USA,MILLER/RETIREMENTADVICE,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Friday is the day, folks. Starting on June 9, all financial advisers providing guidance on retirement accounts must adhere to the new U.S. Department of Labor rule requiring that they act in your best interest rather than their own. The controversial rule survived a bruising seven-year battle against entrenched interests in the financial services industry, which were seeking to protect excess fees that cost retirement savers $17 billion a year - a full percentage point in annual returns, according to U.S. government estimates during the Obama administration. Most recently, the rule survived a 60-day delay by the new administration under President Donald Trump, which has considered repealing or revising it. The Trump administration may yet try to weaken or undo parts of the so-called fiduciary standard, and several important parts of the rule are due for completion in January. These include details on adviser exemptions and disclosures that must be made to consumers. For now, the rule has teeth. It permits consumers to sue advisers if they do not think they have met their fiduciary obligations. What will the rule mean for retirement savers, and how can you take advantage of its protections? The following are some key issues to consider: What Has Changed? The fiduciary rule imposes requirements on advisers who were previously not required to act in clients' best interest. If you are surprised to learn that all advisers were not already required to do this, you are not alone. A survey released in April by Financial Engines, which advises workplace savers, found that 53 percent of Americans mistakenly thought that all financial advisers already adhered to a best interest standard. Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) are already fiduciaries; now broker-dealers and insurance company representatives will have to act in your best interest whenever tax-advantaged retirement accounts are involved. Previously, they were governed by a far weaker  suitability  standard that allowed them to sell higher-cost products that might otherwise fit your investment goals. Do a Check-Up If you already work with an adviser, expect to receive a contract spelling out that the relationship is now governed by the new rule and specifying that advice will be in your best interest, costs will be no more than reasonable and that no misleading statements are permitted. The rule is limited to tax-advantaged retirement accounts - such as IRAs and 401(k) accounts - including rollovers from workplace plans to IRAs. But do not stop there. Insist that any adviser you work with accepts fiduciary responsibility. An easy way to separate wheat from chaff is by asking an adviser to sign the Committee's fiduciary oath, a legally enforceable contract that commits advisers to put your interests first. (To download the fiduciary oath, click: here) Scott Puritz, managing director of Rebalance IRA, a low-fee fiduciary advisory firm that manages retirement investments, recommends requiring any prospective adviser to provide a detailed accounting of all expenses applied to your retirement accounts, including adviser, fund, marketing and distribution and transaction costs. Also request a detailed accounting of any one-time expenses, such as front-end loads on mutual funds plus exit or surrender penalties. You also want full disclosure of any conflicts of interest that an adviser may have that could impact her advice to you. Be Informed Finally, ask for a copy of the firm's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form ADV Part 2, which requires brokers to disclose the types of services provided, fee schedules, disciplinary information and any conflicts of interest. It is also important to conduct a thorough background check on anyone you intend to hire, advises Kate McBride, former chair of The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, a group of industry practitioners and experts. Do a search of FINRA's Brokercheck database (brokercheck.finra.org/), and a Google search for news on the adviser’s firm.  Be on the lookout for firms that have paid big fines in the past five years for wrongdoing or over-charging,  McBride says.  If there are more than a handful of cases, think carefully about whether you want to use that firm.  The Pittsburgh-based Centre for Fiduciary Excellence maintains a database of roughly 200 vetted fiduciary advisory firms around the United States that have subjected themselves to extensive audits of their investment practices and client files. (To access the free database, click here: here)  People will spend more time looking for a contractor to fix their sinks than they do hiring an adviser,  McBride adds.  You have to do your homework.

World number two Ariya Jutanugarn, of Thailand, made a smooth start with a 67, while Germany's defending champion Caroline Masson carded 70. Co-leader Pettersen was delighted with her score, especially after a less-than-ideal preparation. “I lost my yardage book before getting here,” she told reporters. “I had to get all my new notes, which is kind of a big deal because I have a lot of good notes from the past.

That would clearly be a temporary win for Temer, but analysts say it would still leave him weakened and by no means bring an end to the political crisis roiling Brazil.  A guilty ruling would annul the 2014 election victory of former President Dilma Rousseff and her then running mate Temer and unseat Temer, though he could appeal and likely remain in office until a final decision, which would take months. That would deepen uncertainty over his austerity agenda aimed at plugging a gaping budget deficit and pulling Brazil out of its worst ever recession. So far, only one judge has ruled in the trial. Herman Benjamin voted to annul the 2014 Rousseff-Temer ticket for accepting bribes and illegal donations. But four of the seven justices are expected to vote the other way on Friday morning, including the head of the court, Gilmar Mendes, who said any ruling had to consider the stability of the country and Temer should not be compelled to step down for a minor reason. Exclusion of the plea-bargain testimony from Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] executives strengthened Temer's line of argument that his campaign received no illegal funds. The executives told prosecutors they funneled millions of dollars into the 2014 Rousseff-Temer campaign in return for government contracts and other kickbacks. The Temer and Rousseff defense teams requested the Odebrecht testimony be scrapped, holding that it went beyond the scope of the original complaint filed to the court by the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) after it lost the 2014 election.  Temer has the votes to stay in office,  said Welber Barral, a Brasilia insider and political consultant who is following the case closely, as is much of the country and its investors. Barral said the court, known as the TSE, would most probably vote 4-3 to throw out the case. Any of the judges, however, could ask for more time to study the case, which could delay a final ruling for weeks. President of the Superior Electoral Court Gilmar Mendes gestures during a session where Brazil's electoral court will take up 2014 case that could unseat President Michel Temer, in Brasilia, Brazil June 8, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoBrazil's currency BRBY strengthened as investors sensed the court would likely favor Temer, raising the survival chances of his measures to close the budget deficit. Interest rate futures, a gauge of concern over Brazil's future, fell off morning highs on the decision to exclude Odebrecht testimony. If Temer Survives Tse, Unlikely to Fall Temer opponents had been counting on a TSE ruling to force him from office. The country is stuck in a political crisis triggered by Brazil's biggest ever graft scandal and last year's impeachment of Rousseff, whose supporters called it a soft coup arranged by Temer and allies to thwart the scandal probe. Slideshow (5 Images)Temer himself is under investigation for allegedly receiving millions in bribes and obstruction of justice, and Brazil's top federal prosecutor is widely expected to formally charge him soon. Temer, whose government's approval ratings are in the single digits, canceled meetings to follow the court session on television in his presidential office, an aide said.  The president is confident his defense with prevail,  spokesman Marcio de Freitas told Reuters. If Temer is forced from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over, and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018.   Temer has refused to resign despite separate bribery allegations made in plea-bargain testimony by executives of the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA). Even if Temer survives the electoral court case and is charged by prosecutors for corruption, he is unlikely to fall.  For the top court to put him on trial, the charges would have to be authorized by two thirds of the lower chamber of Congress, where his allies are still a majority. The PSDB party, Temer's main coalition ally, delayed until Monday a meeting on whether to pull its three ministers from his cabinet, which would erode his support in Congress, but not to the point that charges against him would pass the chamber.

He also met municipal and medical officials as well as civil society activists from the nearby city of Ubari, the NOC said. Sharara was producing nearly a third of Libya's national output of 835,000 bpd earlier this week.  The southwestern field reopened in December after a two-year pipeline blockade was lifted, but there have been temporary shutdowns several times since then because of local protests. The field is operated by the NOC in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Statoil.  Libya is trying to boost production to 1.25 million bpd before the end of the year. The OPEC member produced more than 1.6 million bpd before Libya's 2011 revolution, but since then output has been crippled by protests, political divisions and armed conflict.

Brent crude futures were trading at $47.67 per barrel at 0039 GMT, down 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. That puts Brent 12 percent below its opening level on May 25, when an OPEC-led policy to cut oil output was extended to cover the first quarter of 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.44 per barrel, down 20 cents, or 0.44 percent, from their previous close. They are down over 11 percent from May 25.  (With very few) bullish catalysts around at the moment, the path of less resistance remains lower,  ANZ bank said. Traders said the price slump was a result of ongoing oversupply despite the pledge led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of production until the first quarter of 2018. In the United States, official Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed a surprise build in commercial crude oil stocks to 513.2 million barrels this week C-STK-T-EIA. The bloated inventories are in part a result of a relentless rise in U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has risen by 10 percent since mid-2016 to over 9.3 million bpd and estimated by the EIA to hit a record 10 million bpd next year, challenging output of top exporter Saudi Arabia. But markets elsewhere are also oversupplied, with evidence emerging that traders are putting excess crude into floating storage, a key indicator for a glut. The Brent forward price curve now shows a clear contango shape, in which prices for January next year are $1.5 per barrel above those for immediate delivery, making it profitable to put crude into tankers and wait for a later sale. Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows at least 25 supertankers are currently sitting in the Strait of Malacca and the Singapore Strait, holding unsold fuel. That's only slightly less than in early May and about the same amount from April, indicating that even in Asia with its strong demand growth, traders are struggling to clear out bloated inventories. And more production is coming. Libya's 270,000 bpd Sharara oil field has reopened after a workers' protest and should return to normal production within three days, the National Oil Corporation said in a statement early on Friday.

Speaking in Paris, Meirelles said the decree, which raises fines for banks to as much as 2 billion reais ($610 million) from 250,000 reais, had been under study for some time. The decree announced this week also would allow the central bank to strike plea-bargain agreements with financial firms that admit breaching the law in exchange for softer fines or more lenient prison terms for their executives. Two presidential aides, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said the government sped up preparation of the decree because of the risk of new disclosures snaring Brazilian banks in a vast corruption scandal. An index of financial-sector companies on the Sao Paulo stock exchange fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday. The central bank is Brazil's banking and financial industry regulator. A securities industry watchdog known as the CVM oversees the functioning of capital markets. Congress has six months to vote on turning President Michel Temer's decree into permanent law.  This certainly gives more power to the central bank and the CVM to implement their measures,  Meirelles said in comments released by the Finance Ministry, without elaborating on the size and scope of the new framework. The minister's remarks reflected how senior officials see a series of corruption investigations into cozy ties between politicians and business leaders are evolving so quickly that they require rapid action to fine-tune legislation. The central bank said in a statement on Thursday that the value of fines in eventual leniency agreements would depend on the gravity of the infractions committed, as well as the size and the financial capacity of a financial institution to bear with such a penalty. The decree is not retroactive, it said. The decree came as Congress launched an investigation into the stock and currency trades of Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA as news broke of a plea-bargain testimony from its controlling shareholders. Meatpacking is the latest sector of the economy to be hit by a three-year corruption investigation in Brazil, which contributed to the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff last year and now threatens Temer, her successor. $1 = 3.28 reais Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Writing by Alonso Soto; Editing by Frances Kerry and Bill Trott","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-corruption-banks-idUSL1N1J52J2"},

Security Council to authorize a West African force to combat terrorism and trafficking in the Sahel region because it does not believe it is warranted and does not want the world body to help fund it, diplomats said on Thursday. France circulated a draft Security Council resolution on Tuesday to the 15-member body that would approve the force using  all necessary means  and ask U.N. chief Antonio Guterres to report on options for U.N. support to the operation. Closed-door negotiations began on Wednesday, and diplomats said the United States would prefer the council give its blessing in a statement instead of a resolution and encourage bilateral support for the West African force.  The European Union has already committed $56 million to the Sahel force. The United States supports the force  in principle as a potentially important example of African efforts to fight extremism on the continent,  a U.S. official said, but noted that a U.N. resolution was not the only way to provide political support.  The official said U.N. authorization was not needed because the force already had the approval of the countries where it would deploy, likening it to a joint task force in the Lake Chad Basin fighting Boko Haram, which has council political support but no official authorization.  Further, we find the mandate of the force way too broad, lacking precision; and would set a dangerous precedent by providing authorization for lethal force for a broad spectrum of activities including operations to 'eradicate' undefined criminal networks,  the official said.   The vast, arid Sahel region has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups - some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State - that European nations, particularly France, fear could threaten Europe if left unchecked.  The African Union and the secretary-general have asked the council to authorize this Sahel force,  France's U.N. ambassador, Francois Delattre, told reporters on Thursday.  It is important that the whole Security Council gets united behind this draft.  The United States is currently trying to cut the cost of U.N. peacekeeping and is reviewing each of the 16 missions as they come up for Security Council renewal. Washington is the largest contributor, paying 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget. Last year, the Sahel nations - Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania - proposed establishing special units, each of around 100 well-trained soldiers, which would be deployed in areas where jihadist groups are known to operate. They would complement the efforts of regular armed forces, a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali and France's Operation Barkhane, which has around 4,000 troops deployed across the five Sahel countries. France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali a year earlier. However, militants continue to attack in Mali and its neighbors.

In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9. During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations,  to sort that out.   I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning,  Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI probe of Flynn. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on.  We're under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever,  he said. Comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the president's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trump's presidency, especially as the FBI probe has ensnared not only Flynn but Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. Comey's testimony drew renewed attention to Sessions and his relationship with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Asked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added:  Again, I take the president's words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.  Comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. 'Lies, Plain and Simple' Comey said Trump's administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.  Those were lies, plain and simple,  Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trump's administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election.  The Russian investigation is going to go on and it's not going to stop and the president should have known that,  committee member Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told MSNBC. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey's testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last year's election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. NBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in mid-June. Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist. Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman confirmed to Reuters he was the friend to whom Comey was referring. Kasowitz said that  we will leave it to the appropriate authorities  to determine whether Comey's leak  should be investigated.  Legal experts questioned Kasowitz's contention that Trump's private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications. 'Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes' Comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with Trump, but that if so, they should be released.  Lordy, I hope there are tapes,  Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because  I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.  From Capitol Hill to San Francisco's Castro district, Comey's appearance attracted television  watch parties  beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the  Super Bowl of Washington.  U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comey's testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, whom the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Kislyak. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the president's request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trump's position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation.  Yes,  Comey replied. Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said.  He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way,  she said. Regarding Sessions, Comey said he did not discuss Trump's pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with the attorney general because the FBI leadership team believed Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russia probe.  We were also aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,  Comey said, without giving more details. The Justice Department later issued a statement saying that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe only because he had been part of Trump's campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding:  I'll just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.

I asked if it was a typo,  Iannetta said.  Then I asked if we were trying, joking around.  No joke. Iannetta homered, doubled twice and drove in a career-high seven runs when the D-backs completed a three-game sweep with a 15-4 victory over the Padres at Chase Field. Iannetta, hitting second for the first time this season, hit a two-run homer off Clayton Richard for a 4-3 lead in the fifth inning before hitting a bases-loaded double in a six-run sixth and a two-run double in a four-run eighth.  It was exciting,  Iannetta said.  It was fun. These are the days you play baseball for, the chance to contribute and you have fun while doing it. I feel like a kid again.  Daniel Descalso had two hits, including a homer, and drove in two runs as the Diamondbacks (37-25) improved to a major league-best 24-8 at home, the best home start in franchise history. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at DiamondbacksSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchPaul Goldschmidt, Chris Owings and Nick Ahmed had two hits apiece for the Diamondbacks, who outscored the Padres 32-9 in the series. Their 15 runs were a season high, and they scored their first 10 with two outs and no one on in an inning.  Pretty offensive day,  said Arizona manager Tony Lovullo, who added that he had been toying with the idea of putting Iannetta second for a few day.  The game turned around in a hurry. I was really proud of what we did against a pitcher that has typically thrown very well against us. Our guys had a really good approach. Obviously the day was highlighted by Chris Iannetta.  The D-backs have used four No. 2 hitters in front of Goldschmidt in an attempt to maximize production against left-handed starters this season.  To hit in front of one of the best hitters in the game, you know you are going to see some pitches to hit,  said Iannetta, whose previous career RBI high was six.  It's a boost of confidence to know all you have to do is pick one out. They don't want to face him. They would rather face me.  Wil Myers, Hunter Renfroe and Jose Pirela had two hits apiece for San Diego (23-38), which has lost five in a row after a five-game winning streak. Arizona left-hander Patrick Corbin (5-6) gave up eight hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings, his second victory over the Padres in three starts this season. He struck out eight and walked three. Richard gave up six hits and four runs in five innings for the Padres, who led 2-0 and 3-2 before Iannetta took over. Richard (4-7) has made four starts against Arizona this season, winning the two at home and losing the two at Chase Field. He gave up two runs in 15 2/3 innings at Petco Park and 10 runs in 8 2/3 innings at Chase Field.  Through the game, we just didn't finish innings,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  It's just not good baseball, I don't think there's really another way to describe it. You give some credit to their guys. Those guys compete to the last out of every single inning. They make you earn your outs. They don't get outside the strike zone, they don't chase a lot. They don't give you easy outs.  San Diego took a 2-0 lead on two walks and three singles in the first inning, with Austin Hedges' two-run, bases-loading single making it 2-0. The Diamondbacks tied it in the bottom of the first after Goldschmidt singled with two outs. Owings doubled in one run and Descalso singled in the second. Myers singled and scored on Renfroe's double to open the third for a 3-2 Padres lead. Gregor Blanco had a bunt single down the third base line with two outs in the fifth before Iannetta homered off Richard to make it 4-3. With two outs in the sixth inning, Brandon Drury was hit by a pitch, Jake Lamb walked and Ahmed hit an infield single to load the bases before David Peralta's pinch-single made it 6-3. Iannetta followed with his double to the fence in right-center field for a 9-3 lead.

Authorities are running DNA tests from the bones in an attempt to identify the remains that were discovered on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Baja California Sur state prosecutors office said in a statement. A forensic team was still looking for more remains on Thursday. The murder rate has surged in Baja California Sur in the past three years due to a spike in violence in the municipality of Los Cabos, which includes the towns of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. The number of murders in the first four months of the year increased more than five times from the same period last year to 144, according to government data. Mass graves, some with hundreds of bodies, have been discovered around Mexico in the states that have been hardest hit by drug violence, such as Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Morelos and Guerrero.  Some 30,000 people have disappeared in Mexico since drug violence increased sharply around 2007. More than 150,000 have been killed since then, when former president Felipe Calderon sent the army out to battle drug gangs.

In a letter to five House Democrats, Germany's largest bank said it was barred from sharing information about Trump's finances due to U.S. privacy laws.    We hope that you will understand Deutsche Bank's need to respect the boundaries that Congress and the courts have set in an effort to protect confidential information,  lawyers for the bank from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld wrote in the letter. Deutsche's correspondence follows a May 23 request from Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, and four peers, requesting information about the Republican president. Waters' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In May, the lawmakers asked Deutsche Bank to share what it might know about Trump's real-estate business and whether the president had financial backing from Russia. The lawmakers initially gave Deutsche Bank until June 2 to respond, but the German lender requested more time. Public records show that Deutsche Bank loaned Trump millions of dollars for real-estate ventures.  The Democrats do not have the power to compel Deutsche Bank to comply. The Financial Services Committee has subpoena power, but Republican committee members, who make up the majority of the panel, would have to cooperate.     No Republicans signed the letter. The bank responded on a day when Washington was consumed with testimony by James Comey, former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who appeared before a Senate panel on Thursday and accused Trump of firing him to undermine an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia. [L1N1J50C1] Moscow has denied the allegations of election meddling. Trump has denied any collusion. The congressional Democrats also sought information about a Russian  mirror trading  scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines over the scheme, which could have been used to launder money out of Russia. The trades involved, for example, buying Russian stocks in roubles for a client and selling the identical value of a security for U.S. dollars for a related customer. Deutsche Bank provided the Democrats copies of settlements regarding the trades.

Going private, which would involve raising debt, would be a risky but potentially profitable bet by Nordstrom's founding family and largest shareholder bloc that the company can reshape itself and emerge from the retail meltdown stronger.  Shares of the Seattle-based clothing and accessories retailer ended 10.3 percent higher after having surged as much as 18 percent in their biggest intraday percentage gain since February 2009. The company has a market value of about $7.4 billion. U.S. malls have been struggling with slowing customer traffic and mall anchors like Nordstrom and Macy's Inc (M.N) are trying to revive sales.  Nordstrom in May reported first-quarter same-store sales that fell short of estimates, triggering a drop in its shares. Once it goes private, Nordstrom may be able to restructure its business, which is more difficult as a public company, said Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of Vivaldi, a consulting firm that works with retail brands.  It's the right move,  he said. At a share price of $46, the retailer would need to raise $5.45 billion to $8.19 billion of additional debt to fund the takeout, said Chuck Grom, analyst with Gordon Haskett. Such a move would come amid a wave of store closures and bankruptcies in the retail industry.  High-end department store chain Neiman Marcus, which went private in 2005, said in March it is exploring options as it seeks relief from its swelling debt pile. Analysts and consultants were divided on how successful Nordstrom could be in going private.  Related CoverageNordstrom might struggle for private backing as mall stores lose valueUBS Group AG analysts said in a report that they were cautious about Nordstrom's ability to secure financing given problems in the retail sector. They also flagged a bid by the founder of electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) to take the company private that failed in 2013 when he was unable to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion in debt. Other analysts said that going private may be slightly easier for Nordstrom.  Nordstrom is not highly levered, they have quite a bit in their way of real estate assets so is it probably easier for them to actually get this transaction done,  said Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE.  Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle, Nordstrom went public in 1971. The retailer, known for its high-end department stores and customer service, sells designer items including Jimmy Choo stilettos and Burberry trench coats.  Nordstrom operates 354 stores in 40 states which includes its Nordstrom branded full-line stores and off-price discount chain Nordstrom Rack. The company also operates stores in Canada and Puerto Rico.  FILE PHOTO: The Nordstrom store is pictured in Broomfield, Colorado, February 23, 2017.Rick Wilking/File PhotoShares of other U.S. department store chains rose after Nordstrom's announcement.  Dillard's Inc (DDS.N) gained as much as 6.3 percent, Macy's rose 3.3 percent and Kohls Corp (KSS.N) climbed 1.3 percent early on Thursday. The stocks pared gains in afternoon trade, with Macy's and Kohl's ending the day in negative territory.  Taking It Private In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the department store operator said the group formed to consider going private had not made a formal proposal.  The group comprises Chairman Emeritus Bruce Nordstrom, his sister Anne Gittinger, President James Nordstrom and co-Presidents Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom. The group, which owns 31.2 percent of the company, said it was not interested in selling its stake to third parties or voting for an alternative deal. With the Nordstrom family's share ownership, the odds of a deal getting done are higher, said Grom with Gordon Haskett. The ownership would appear to satisfy the requirements of a leveraged buyout transaction, he said. The largest shareholders in the company from the group include Bruce Nordstrom with 16.9 percent of outstanding shares, followed by Gittinger with 9.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Peter and Blake Nordstrom own about 1.7 percent each.   Because of the changing dynamics in the retail environment, the group is evaluating whether the long-term interests of the issuer (Nordstrom) are better served as a privately held company,  the members of the Nordstrom family said in a filing. The company's board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore the possibility of any transaction that could be made by the group.  The committee said it had entered into an agreement with the Nordstrom family members over some standstill provisions that would prevent them from taking certain actions until Jan. 31, 2019.  The special committee has hired Centerview Partners as its financial adviser and Sidley Austin as legal counsel.  The Nordstrom family is working with investment bank Moelis & Co (MC.N) as its financial adviser and Hogan Lovells as legal counsel.

Just a few weeks after his election in November, Trump announced he had struck a deal to stop about 1,000 jobs at U.S. manufacturer Carrier from being moved to its Mexican operations in the industrial state of Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas. Soon afterward, carmaker Ford canceled a planned $1.6 billion plant in central Mexico, causing widespread alarm that Trump's interventions and threats to tear up the NAFTA trade agreement would lead to a collapse in investment in Mexico. But Fernando Turner, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon, said U.S. companies still were committed to the state and that there had been no slowdown in investment by them because they understand the benefits of Mexico better than Trump does.  American companies will educate him,  he told Reuters. Turner said U.S. firms were no longer talking about their investments to avoid incurring Trump's wrath.  Until Trump changes his rhetoric ... there won't be a single global company from anywhere that wants to announce investment in Mexico. (But) they're going to do it,  he said. Nuevo Leon is home to some of the biggest companies in Mexico, including cement maker Cemex (CMXCPO.MX) and conglomerate Alfa (ALFAA.MX). It received a tenth of the foreign direct investment (FDI) to Mexico in 2016 - more than any other region, barring Mexico City. Provisional government first quarter data showed FDI to Nuevo Leon fell to $585 million from a preliminary figure of $779 million in the same period last year. Nationally, however, the figure rose 0.6 percent to $7.9 billion in the quarter. Trump's rhetoric has caused anger in Mexico, and Nuevo Leon last month unveiled an economic plan aiming to modernize the economy and reverse a brain drain to the United States.

Samantha Geimer was 13 years old when Polanski assaulted her in Los Angeles in 1977. In recent years, she has said repeatedly  that she has forgiven Polanski, now 83, but Friday's appearance would make the first time Geimer has appeared publicly at a court hearing in the case.  Samantha Geimer is tired of this. She has been asking the court to terminate this case for years. She wants to get it over with,  the director's attorney, Harland Braun, told Reuters on Thursday. He said Geimer would help make the case that Polanski had served his time and should not be  punished further. Debra Tate, the sister of Polanski's murdered actress wife Sharon Tate, will also attend Friday's court hearing, Braun said. Polanski's case has been a cause celebre for 40 years. Following a 1977 guilty plea to rape and spending 42 days in jail, he fled the United States, fearing a plea bargain with prosecutors would be overruled and that he would get a lengthy prison term.  The most recent attempt to resolve matters ended in April when a Los Angeles judge ruled that the French-Polish director could not cut a deal from abroad to return to the United States without serving more jail time.  Debra Tate is coming to support Roman. She hopes he will eventually get this case resolved,  Braun added. Polanski's heavily pregnant wife Sharon Tate was murdered in 1969 at age 26 by followers of Charles Manson.    Braun said the aim of Friday's hearing at Los Angeles Superior Court was to unseal testimony about the 1977 plea deal and use it as evidence to get European authorities to rescind the international arrest warrant against Polanski.  We want to have the transcripts so we can show the people at Interpol that he has already done his time,  Braun said. Polanski, whose films include  Rosemary's Baby,  and  Chinatown,  was arrested on U.S. warrants in both Poland and Switzerland during the past decade, but both countries ultimately declined to extradite him. It was not clear whether Geimer or Tate would be permitted  to address Friday's court hearing. If they are not, they will make their case to media outside, Braun said. The Los Angeles District Attorney's office, which has fought to have Polanski face justice in the United States, said it would ask the court to deny Braun's request and any others  in the absence of new facts or a change of circumstance.  Geimer, who now lives in Hawaii, helped promote a 2008 documentary about claims of judicial misconduct in the case. She said at the time that she does not believe Polanski is a danger to society who needs to be locked up.

The so-called  persuader rule  was one of a handful of major labor rules adopted during former President Barack Obama's tenure. It was championed by unions, but was heavily attacked by corporate trade groups. The rule never took effect. Last year, a federal judge in Texas blocked its implementation after business groups including the National Federation of Independent Business sued because they said the rule was a violation of federal labor law. The Labor Department had been appealing that decision in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but after President Donald Trump was elected, the department began asking for multiple extensions to file briefs. On Thursday, the Labor Department announced it was publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind the rule. It will be accepting public comments starting June 12.

That would clearly be a temporary win for Temer, but analysts say it would still leave him weakened and by no means bring an end to the political crisis roiling Brazil.  A guilty ruling would annul the 2014 election victory of former President Dilma Rousseff and her then running mate Temer and unseat Temer, though he could appeal and likely remain in office until a final decision, which would take months. That would deepen uncertainty over his austerity agenda aimed at plugging a gaping budget deficit and pulling Brazil out of its worst ever recession. So far, only one judge has ruled in the trial. Herman Benjamin voted to annul the 2014 Rousseff-Temer ticket for accepting bribes and illegal donations. But four of the seven justices are expected to vote the other way on Friday morning, including the head of the court, Gilmar Mendes, who said any ruling had to consider the stability of the country and Temer should not be compelled to step down for a minor reason. Exclusion of the plea-bargain testimony from Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] executives strengthened Temer's line of argument that his campaign received no illegal funds. The executives told prosecutors they funneled millions of dollars into the 2014 Rousseff-Temer campaign in return for government contracts and other kickbacks. The Temer and Rousseff defense teams requested the Odebrecht testimony be scrapped, holding that it went beyond the scope of the original complaint filed to the court by the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) after it lost the 2014 election.  Temer has the votes to stay in office,  said Welber Barral, a Brasilia insider and political consultant who is following the case closely, as is much of the country and its investors. Barral said the court, known as the TSE, would most probably vote 4-3 to throw out the case. Any of the judges, however, could ask for more time to study the case, which could delay a final ruling for weeks.

Interest rate futures, a gauge of concern over Brazil's future, fell off morning highs on the decision to exclude Odebrecht testimony. If Temer Survives Tse, Unlikely to Fall Temer opponents had been counting on a TSE ruling to force him from office. The country is stuck in a political crisis triggered by Brazil's biggest ever graft scandal and last year's impeachment of Rousseff, whose supporters called it a soft coup arranged by Temer and allies to thwart the scandal probe. Slideshow (5 Images)Temer himself is under investigation for allegedly receiving millions in bribes and obstruction of justice, and Brazil's top federal prosecutor is widely expected to formally charge him soon. Temer, whose government's approval ratings are in the single digits, canceled meetings to follow the court session on television in his presidential office, an aide said.  The president is confident his defense with prevail,  spokesman Marcio de Freitas told Reuters. If Temer is forced from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over, and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018.   Temer has refused to resign despite separate bribery allegations made in plea-bargain testimony by executives of the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA). Even if Temer survives the electoral court case and is charged by prosecutors for corruption, he is unlikely to fall.  For the top court to put him on trial, the charges would have to be authorized by two thirds of the lower chamber of Congress, where his allies are still a majority. The PSDB party, Temer's main coalition ally, delayed until Monday a meeting on whether to pull its three ministers from his cabinet, which would erode his support in Congress, but not to the point that charges against him would pass the chamber.

Following are comments from financial market analysts and political commentators. Dean Turner, Economist at Ubs Wealth Management  Should the poll prove accurate, it is likely that the pound will give up the bulk of its post-election announcement gains. After this, retreating back to the low 1.20 levels versus the U.S. dollar is a very real possibility. Nevertheless, sterling has steadied following the initial sell-off and there are few signs that anxiety has spread into other markets just yet.  Samuel Tombs, Chief Uk Economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics  This exit poll is a thunderbolt that leaves only two outcomes realistically in play: a slender Tory majority or a hung parliament. The exit poll’s biggest error in the last two decades was in 2015 when it under-predicted the Conservatives’ seats by 14. We see the risks to the seat projection as evenly balanced, given that its estimate was slightly too high in the four previous elections.     Lee Hardman, Currency Analyst at Mufg  The market will be praying that this exit poll has got it wrong. Currency volatility is the best proxy for market fears.  If the Conservative ship is sinking then the market will be looking for a life boat.  UK DEFENCE MINSTER MICHAEL FALLON, ONE OF MAY'S MINISTERS      Let's see some actual results to see if this is borne out - this is a projection, I think you made that clear, it is not a result. These exit polls have been wrong in the past, in 2015 they underestimated our vote. I think in a couple of elections before that they overestimated our vote. So we do need to see some actual results before we interpret this one way or the other.      ALAN CLARKE, HEAD EUROPEAN FIXED-INCOME STRATEGY, SCOTIABANK  There has got to be a good chance that (May) stands down as prime minister in this environment. The betting websites have Boris Johnson as 2:1 to be the next prime minister after Theresa May.  George Osborne, Former Uk Finance Minister  It is early days. It's a poll. If the poll is anything like accurate this is completely catastrophic for the Conservatives and for Theresa May. It's difficult to see, if these numbers were right, how they would put together the coalition to remain in office. But equally it's quite difficult looking at those numbers to see how Labour could put together a coalition so it's on a real knife edge.  Paul Hollingsworth, Economist, Capital Economics   The economy looks set to face a period of uncertainty about the outlook for policy, Brexit and the possibility of another election. Admittedly, the exit poll could yet be proved wrong.   KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK  It wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility to see pound/dollar drop below $1.26 or even $1.25. All of the sterling crosses are down. All of that is significant.  Jordan Rochester, Fx Strategist, Nomura    This is the hung parliament territory, it's also what we had for the last election pretty much, but then the real numbers on the night came up with a majority, so it's not over yet, folks. But we possibly have the Labour + Scottish National Party + Liberal Democrat coalition possibility in play here. But it’s still hard to form a coalition with Labour + others here, given their total only reaches the same number more or less than that of the Conservatives.   Craig Erlam, Analyst With Brokerage Oanda in London  A hung parliament is the worst outcome from a markets perspective as it creates another layer of uncertainty ahead of the Brexit negotiations and chips away at what is already a short timeline to secure a deal for Britain.

Giants closer Mark Melancon (1-1) blew a two-run lead in the ninth, giving up a solo home run to Eric Sogard and an RBI single to Travis Shaw. But the Giants got three straight singles to open the 10th against Jacob Barnes (1-1), with Hunter Pence's pinch-hit single driving in the go-ahead run. Another run scored on a Denard Span double, and a third scored on an Eduardo Nunez single, his second hit of the day. Joe Panik, who hit his third homer of the year back in the third inning, added one more run when Eric Thames dropped his fly ball in left, which was scored as a sacrifice fly.  We've had some tough times and you know, we give up a two-run lead there in the ninth and find a way to win the ballgame,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  That really can get a club down but it shows a lot of battle on the character and how resilient they are to put a four-spot up, especially on a road trip that hasn't been great for us. They kept fighting. That's all you can do. They're doing that. You keep doing that and we'll get this turned around.  Related CoveragePreview: Giants at BrewersSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchThe Giants' late rally might not have been possible without a fortunate break during Milwaukee's ninth-inning comeback. After Sogard's homer, Thames drew a walk to put the tying run on first and he appeared to score when Jesus Aguilar followed with a double to the corner in left. But the ball got lodged under the padding along the outfield wall, and thus, left Aguilar with a ground rule double. He was held at second and Thames at third, bringing Craig Counsell out to challenge the call which was confirmed after a review of 1:38.  I asked (home plate umpire Ed Hickox) to confer with each other that it was lodged,  Counsell said.  They agreed, so after that, there's no harm in me challenging whether it's lodged or not. New York said it was lodged, also.  Hickox said that even though Orlando Calixte played the ball, it was still dead.  Any umpire who sees a ball gets lodged can kill it,  Hickox told a pool reporter.  If a fielder throws his hands up and we don't see it, we will continue to go out there until we can see it lodged or see it not lodged. So the fact of him throwing his hands up is not really the issue. It's 'Did the umpire see it lodged or not?'  Shaw sent the tying run home with a base hit, but Aguilar could only get to third. After Domingo Santana struck out, catcher Jett Bandy came within inches of winning it; but his line drive was snared by Nunez, the third baseman, and Melancon got pinch-hitter Hernan Perez on a grounder to end the threat.  We needed a break at that point,  Bochy said.  It's not really a break; it's just good defense and it shows you how athletic Nunez is. I think once he got out of it, he said it was a sense of relief and the guys were pretty fired up.  The late collapse and eventual comeback wiped out Johnny Cueto's attempt to extend his eight-game winning streak against the Brewers. Cueto allowed three runs -- two earned -- on six hits and four walks while striking out four over five innings of work. Brewers starter Paolo Espino, making his second big league start, lasted four innings and allowed three runs on five hits and two walks, striking out a pair, but he gave up solo home runs to Panik and Austin Slater. NOTES: RHP Paolo Espino was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs and started Thursday against San Francisco in place of RHP Matt Garza (chest), who went on the 10-day disabled list a day earlier. ... To make room for Espino on the roster, Milwaukee optioned OF Brett Phillips back to Colorado Springs. Phillips appeared in two games and went 1-for-3 with a pair of strikeouts in his first major league action. ... San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy gave C Buster Posey the day off and RF Hunter Pence wasn't in the starting lineup before being utilized as a pinch hitter. Both will be back in the lineup Friday against Minnesota, Bochy said. ...

Alabama had planned to put Robert Melson, 46, to death by lethal injection on Thursday evening at its death chamber in Atmore. If the execution goes ahead, it will be the 13th this year in the United States and the second in Alabama in 2017.  Upon consideration of the application of counsel for the applicant, it is ordered that execution of the sentence of death is hereby stayed pending further order of the undersigned or of the court,  stated a document signed by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and released on Thursday evening. Lawyers for Melson have tried to halt his execution, arguing that a drug in the state's lethal injection mixture has been linked to troubled executions in Alabama, Arizona and Oklahoma, where inmates could be seen twisting on death chamber gurneys. They said the drug, the sedative midazolam, does not render a person sufficiently unconscious for surgery and its use violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Last week, a federal appeals court in Atlanta issued a stay of execution for Melson because of the drug issue. Alabama appealed, and the Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted Melson's stay, allowing the execution to proceed. Justice Thomas' latest order temporarily blocking the execution came after Melson's attorneys submitted new arguments related to the drug issue. Melson was convicted of murdering James Nathaniel Baker, 17, Darryl Collier, 23 and Tamika Collins, 18, during a robbery at a fried chicken fast-food restaurant in Gadsden, about 115 miles northwest of Montgomery. As the restaurant was closing around midnight, Melson and another robber forced four employees to remove cash from the restaurant safe and then ordered them into a freezer, court summary documents said. Melson fatally shot three of the workers while the fourth, Bryant Archer, was shot multiple times but survived, the documents said. Archer identified one of the robbers as Cuhuatemoc Peraita, a former employee at the restaurant, but did not know the shooter, they said. Police later linked Melson to Peraita, who was 17 at the time of the killings and too young to be executed under U.S. law. Peraita was sentenced to life without parole. While in prison, he killed another inmate and currently is on death row, according to court records.

Just a few weeks after his election in November, Trump announced he had struck a deal to stop about 1,000 jobs at U.S. manufacturer Carrier from being moved to its Mexican operations in the industrial state of Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas. Soon afterward, carmaker Ford canceled a planned $1.6 billion plant in central Mexico, causing widespread alarm that Trump's interventions and threats to tear up the NAFTA trade agreement would lead to a collapse in investment in Mexico. But Fernando Turner, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon, said U.S. companies still were committed to the state and that there had been no slowdown in investment by them because they understand the benefits of Mexico better than Trump does.  American companies will educate him,  he told Reuters. Turner said U.S. firms were no longer talking about their investments to avoid incurring Trump's wrath.  Until Trump changes his rhetoric ... there won't be a single global company from anywhere that wants to announce investment in Mexico. (But) they're going to do it,  he said. Nuevo Leon is home to some of the biggest companies in Mexico, including cement maker Cemex (CMXCPO.MX) and conglomerate Alfa (ALFAA.MX). It received a tenth of the foreign direct investment (FDI) to Mexico in 2016 - more than any other region, barring Mexico City. Provisional government first quarter data showed FDI to Nuevo Leon fell to $585 million from a preliminary figure of $779 million in the same period last year. Nationally, however, the figure rose 0.6 percent to $7.9 billion in the quarter. Trump's rhetoric has caused anger in Mexico, and Nuevo Leon last month unveiled an economic plan aiming to modernize the economy and reverse a brain drain to the United States.

McCain said last week Putin was a bigger threat to global security than Islamic State, and warned the Senate would push for tougher sanctions against Moscow for its alleged interference in the U.S. election last year. Slideshow (2 Images)In an interview with U.S. film director Oliver Stone, excerpts of which were released on Thursday ahead of its broadcast by U.S. TV network Showtime from June 12, Putin praised the senator's  patriotism .  I like Senator McCain to a certain extent. And I'm not joking. I like him because of his patriotism, and I can relate to his consistency in fighting for the interests of his own country,  Putin told Stone in the interview, recorded in February. But he added:  People with such convictions like the Senator you mentioned, they still live in the Old World. And they’re reluctant to look into the future, they are unwilling to recognize how fast the world is changing.  He urged the United States to work with Russia on global problems.  Right now there are common threats we are both facing, like international terrorism. We've got to fight poverty across the world,  Putin said.  After all, we've piled up so many nuclear weapons that it has become a threat to the whole world as well. And it would be good for us to give it some thought. There are many issues to address.

The launches, the latest in a fast-paced series of missile tests by North Korea defying world pressure to rein in its weapons program, come less than a week after the United Nations Security Council passed fresh sanctions on the reclusive state. (Graphic - Nuclear North Korea tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF ) South Korea on Wednesday said it will hold off on installing remaining components of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that has angered North Korea's main ally, China, amid early signs of easing tensions between the two countries. U.S. President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed the Korean situation, including THAAD, at the White House on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing. North Korea missile launches showed that THAAD was  important to, not only to protect U.S. forces, to protect our alliance and to ... help to further strengthen the region,  Nauert said.  We are aware, certainly, of the situation and the suspension of additional launchers,  she said.  We would continue to say that THAAD was an alliance decision at the time, and we continue to work closely with (South Korea) throughout their process.  Nauert called the latest North Korean missile launches  provocative.   The missiles were launched Thursday morning from the North Korean coastal city of Wonsan and flew about 200 km (124 miles), South Korea's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the mainland United States.     Compared to the different types of ballistic missiles Pyongyang has recently tested, the missiles launched on Thursday are considered to be more defensive in nature, designed to defend against threats such as enemy warships. North Korea unveiled a number of new weapons at a massive military parade on April 15 to mark the birth anniversary of the state's founding leader and has since tested some of them.      What appeared to be a new type of land-to-ship missile equipped with four launching canisters was unveiled at the parade,  said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.  I think this might be what was used today.  Thaad Defense Delayed Thursday's launch is the fourth missile test by North Korea since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10 pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang. He says  sanctions and pressure alone have failed to resolve the growing North Korean threat. A South Korean soldier walks past a TV broadcast of a news report on North Korea firing what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast, at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, June 8, 2017.Kim Hong-JiNorth Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016 in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. Moon had also promised to review the deployment of the THAAD system in South Korea, a decision that was made by the government of his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye. On Wednesday, Moon's office said installation of four additional launchers would be halted until an assessment of the system's impact on the environment was completed. Two launchers of the full six-launcher THAAD battery, as well as the system's far-reaching radar that China worries could upset the regional security balance, have already been installed at a deployment site in the southeastern city of Seongju. The elements will stay in place, South Korea said. The introduction of the THAAD system has sparked protests in South Korea and a backlash in China against South Korean business interests. FILE PHOTO: A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014.Denis Balibouse/File PhotoThe Global Times, published by China's official People's Daily, said in an editorial that no matter the outcome of the environmental study, South Korea's announcement could reduce friction.  Obviously, the pressure China puts on South Korea has taken effect. Seoul's will has been shaken,  the paper said.  However, attitude is not everything. Without solving the problem of THAAD, the pain it has brought to bilateral relations will not disappear, and South Korea must swallow some of the bitter results.  China should work with Russia on counter-measures to THAAD, the Global Times added. Asked about the latest missile test, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called for all parties to exercise restraint.  The UN Security Council resolution has clear rules on (North Korea's) use of ballistic missiles technologies,  she said.  All sides should work together to de-escalate tensions and take active steps to stabilize the region.    Trump has been pressing China to rein in North Korea, warning that all options, including a pre-emptive military strike, are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development. Seoul, Tokyo and Washington were analyzing the launches for further information, officials said. Japan's navy and air force conducted military drills with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan last week, following similar joint U.S.-South Korea exercises.          North Korea likely wanted to show off its ability to precisely target a large warship, in relation to the joint military drills involving U.S. aircraft carriers,  Roh Jae-cheon, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman, told a media briefing.  By testing different types of missiles, North Korea also appears to be aiming to secure the upper hand in relations with South Korea and the United States.

It was the posture of a longtime law-enforcement official and former FBI director, someone used to keeping matters close to the vest.  But even the steady, crisp rhythm of his answers could not hide what lay beneath the surface: Comey's dismissal by President Donald Trump last month wounded and angered him.  Beyond testifying to conversations he said he had with Trump concerning the federal probe into ties between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials, Comey time and again told the Senate committee before him and viewers across the country he not only has a harsh opinion of the president’s purported conduct, but also of his character.  Just minutes into his testimony, Comey said the president and his aides had chosen to defame him by spreading lies about his job performance, attempting to shred a reputation carefully built during 20 years of government service.  Those were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them and that the American people were told them,  he said.  Later, Comey testified he began documenting his conversations with the president because of what he called “the nature of the person.” “I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting,” Comey said.  Trump, uncharacteristically, stayed silent during Comey’s testimony, despite earlier suggestions from White House aides that he might take to Twitter to respond. He never did, ceding the stage, for the moment, to his nemesis.  He left rebuttals to his son, Donald Trump, Jr., who defended Trump on Twitter, and to his outside lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, who denied the president had ever pressured Comey to drop the FBI’s probe into Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. 'Lordy'     In response to questions from senators, Comey repeatedly cast Trump as a boss or “patron” trying to secure his loyalty, something that Comey said made him “uneasy.   At one point, Comey was asked why his version of events should be believed over the president’s.  “I've tried to be open, fair, transparent and accurate,” he said, encouraging senators to examine the two men's “consistency track record, demeanor, record over time, that sort of thing.” Referring to a Trump comment on social media about the possible existence of tapes that could provide proof of their conversations, Comey said he was so rankled he decided to hand memos of his interactions with the president to a close friend to leak to the media.  “I’ve seen the tweet about the tapes,” Comey said. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes.”  At the White house, in keeping with Trump’s silence, his aides played down the day’s events. “It’s a regular Thursday at the White House,” Sarah Sanders, the deputy press secretary, told reporters,  as televisions in the West Wing blasted Comey’s testimony.  Trump watched at least part of the hearing with his outside legal team, in a dining room at the White House, but Sanders said she did not know if he had seen much of it. Sanders took umbrage when asked if, as Comey had suggested, the president had lied.  “I can definitively say the president is not a liar. I think it’s frankly insulting that question would be asked,” she said. After Comey’s testimony, Trump delivered a brief speech to a friendly audience at a conference of religious leaders in Washington where he did not mention the controversy. Throughout the hotel ballroom where the event was staged, attendees expressed support for the Republican Trump and distaste for Democrats and the news media. “I feel he’s doing a wonderful job for our country,” said Donna Hubers of Baltimore, who was checking her phone for Comey updates.  Dinner Date There were some lighter, and literary, moments in Comey's testimony.  He recalled at one point that he had to give up a dinner date with his wife because Trump asked to meet him at the White House. That was one of the meetings that Trump allegedly used to pressure Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn.  In retrospect, I love spending time with my wife, and I wish I would have been there that night,  he said on Thursday, drawing laughs from the senators. Comey also reached into English history to boost his portrayal of Trump. He was asked by Senator Angus King, an independent, whether he took the president’s references to the Flynn probe in the Oval Office as a directive to drop the matter.  Comey replied with a quotation attributed to King Henry II of England, who was at odds with Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury.  “Yes. It rings in my ear as, well, ‘Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?'” “I was just going to quote that,” Senator King said. “And the next day, he (Becket) was killed.

Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. Comey said Trump pressured him to drop an investigation of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and told Comey that he needed his loyalty even though FBI directors are supposed to work independently from the White House. Trump did not directly comment on the allegations, but his personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, tried to discredit Comey's testimony.  The president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone,  Kasowitz said in a brief appearance before television cameras.  The president also never told Mr. Comey, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' He never said it in form and he never said it in substance.  Kasowitz said Comey's testimony made it clear that Trump was not being investigated for collusion with Russian officials and that the president felt  completely vindicated.

The Canadian department store operator, which also posted a steeper-than-expected drop in quarterly retail sales, said the move would help the company save more than C$350 million ($259 million) annually. Hudson's Bay, also known as HBC, and other large retailers are struggling to reinvent themselves amid an industrywide upheaval, blamed in part on changing shopping trends that have seen shoppers migrate online.

HBC said the cuts, about 3 percent of the company's more than 66,000 employees, were decided after a six-month review of ways to slash costs and streamline its operations. Storch declined to give details on where the cuts would happen.

In a statement on Universal's website issued under the name of the company's president, Universal said it had found the possibility of  fraudulent acts  related to a 2015 loan of HK$135 million ($17.31 million) to an unnamed third party. The statement says that all but HK$5 million of the loan was subsequently transferred to Okada Holdings Limited, a company controlled by Okada and his son, and that the purpose of the loan was  to achieve personal benefit for Chairman Okada.  The statement says the transfer was carried out by Okada and another director, Yoshinao Negishi. A week earlier, the company said both men would not be reappointed to the board at its annual shareholder meeting this month. Okada could not be reached for comment. David Krakoff, a lawyer who is representing Okada and Universal Entertainment in an unrelated U.S. civil legal proceeding, did not respond to an email or phone call requesting comment. Negishi did not respond to messages to a social media account seeking comment. No one at Universal could be reached. The statement was released in the evening Tokyo time after normal working hours. The company's president, Jun Fujimoto, could not be reached for comment. Universal Entertainment said it has established an investigative panel composed of three external lawyers to further probe the transfer of funds, with an interim report expected to be completed around the end of June. Okada, who founded the predecessor of Universal in 1969 and ranks among Japan's wealthiest people, has focused much of his time recently on a $2.4 billion casino resort that opened earlier this year in the Philippines. Okada has billed the ambitious project as a way to tap into the growth of Asian gaming and to diversify Universal's revenues beyond its mainstay business of selling machines for pachinko, a mix of slot and pinball that is the dominant form of gambling in Japan. It is the not the first boardroom drama involving Okada, who was ousted as a director of U.S. casino operator Wynn Resorts in 2012 based on allegations by Wynn’s board that he had wined and dined Philippine gaming officials in possible violation of U.S. anti-bribery laws. Okada has denied these allegations and is fighting Wynn in a civil lawsuit in Nevada alleging his ouster was wrongful. Separate from the boardroom battles, Okada and his companies remain under investigation by the FBI over a $40 million payment to a Manila-based consultant in 2010. The FBI's probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

The move could mean substantial delays in a full deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, as the environmental review may take well over a year, according to a senior official at the presidential Blue House. During his successful election campaign, President Moon Jae-in had pledged to review the previous South Korean government's decision to deploy THAAD, saying that the deployment was rushed without assessing its environmental impact or seeking parliamentary approval. On Wednesday, Moon's office said installation of four additional launchers would be halted until an assessment of the system's impact on the environment was completed. China, along with Russia, has repeatedly expressed opposition to the THAAD deployment, saying it will do nothing to help ease tensions with North Korea. Beijing also fears THAAD's powerful radar system can look deep into China, threatening its own security. Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated that China's opposition to the deployment of THAAD was clear and consistent.  We have said many times before that the United States deployment of THAAD not only is not beneficial for the resolution of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, it is also not good for regional stability,  she said.   On this issue, China and Russia are agreed and have common interests. Of course China and Russia will continue to closely communicate on this issue, we will oppose the United States deploying THAAD in South Korea.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that elements of U.S. anti-missile systems in Alaska and South Korea were a challenge to Russia and that Moscow had no choice but to build up its own forces in response. Putin said the Kurile Islands, a chain of islands in the Far East where Russia and Japan have rival territorial claims, were  quite a convenient place  to deploy Russian military hardware to respond to such threats. The introduction of the THAAD system has sparked protests in South Korea and a backlash in China against South Korean business interests. The Global Times, published by China's official People's Daily, however said that no matter the outcome of the environmental study, South Korea's announcement could reduce tensions.  Moon is more rational on THAAD than former President Park Geun-hye, which can benefit future China-South Korea relations,  the newspaper said in an editorial.  No matter the outcome, that the Blue House announced a suspension in the deployment of THAAD can help reduce friction with China.  But it added:  However, attitude is not everything. Without solving the problem of THAAD, the pain it has brought to bilateral relations will not disappear, and South Korea must swallow some of the bitter results.  China should work with Russia on counter-measures to THAAD, the Global Times added.

If the exit poll proves correct, the shock result would plunge domestic politics into turmoil and could delay Brexit talks. Sterling was down 1.4 percent at $1.2780 after sliding to as low as $1.2705, down about 2 percent and the weakest since April 18. The exit poll predicted the Conservatives would win 314 seats in the 650-member parliament and the opposition Labour Party 266, meaning no clear winner and a  hung parliament . But few seats had been declared by 0728 GMT, and the BBC reported that 76 seats appeared too close to call. For a graphic on the poll and results as they come in, see tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48 Movements in other major currencies like the dollar, euro and yen were limited, also having taken in stride a testimony by former FBI director James Comey, which was initially expected to be the other big event of the week.  There were many participants who wanted to take advantage of the volatility resulting from a key event like the British elections, which explains the pound's initial steep drop,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The swings in the pound have not spilled over into other currencies as the market was well hedged and prepared for a variety of election scenarios.  The dollar was flat at 110.010 against the safe-haven yen . The euro extended overnight losses and was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1199. The common currency was capped after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme. Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine its investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. While this was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years and was approached by investors with caution, it did not offer fresh insight for the financial markets. The Nasdaq managed to close at a record high on Thursday. Buoyed by the pound's fall, the dollar index against a basket of major currencies was up 0.3 percent at 97.236.

Three years later, production has yet to begin. But servicing the debt is cutting into overall profits at his Lustre Engineering, which also offers electrical services, and the 59-year-old may have to sell off assets to repay the bank. Patharkar says India's bureaucrats are to blame for denying contracts to small businesses like his, and has taken one state-run power company to court to challenge its tendering process.  Government has put in place a very good public procurement policy, but officials on the ground are not implementing it,  he said. Bureaucracy is only one of the more visible parts of a problem that is vastly more systemic since Asia's third-largest economy started to falter, burdened by $150 billion in bad loans, excess and idle capacity and stalled private investment.  Private capital investments contracted 2.1 percent in the first three months of this year despite a surge in government spending, dragging economic growth to 6.1 percent, its lowest in more than two years. Signs for the current quarter are also not encouraging. According to CMIE, a think tank, new investment proposals in April and May were down by more than half from the same period in both of the last two years. The culprit is a so-called twin balance-sheet phenomenon: reduced new investment by stressed private companies, which account for three-quarters of India's total capital spending, and one of the highest bad-loan ratios among emerging economies. The bad loans have forced banks to curb overall lending growth and cut their credit exposure to industry, while the share of capital investments in India's GDP has dropped to below 30 percent from more than 38 percent a decade ago.  The motivation to invest into new capacities is falling,  said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive officer at CMIE. Foreign portfolio investors remain bullish about India,  pumping $19 billion into Indian stock and bond markets since January, lured by the country's relatively strong fundamentals. But the World Bank warned last week that prospects for developing economies like India were being undermined by weak investment. If the trend continues, it may thwart India's hopes of   replicating the growth that dramatically boosted employment, reduced poverty and increased per capita income in China. FILE PHOTO: Porters move goods in the Chandni Chowk area of Old Delhi, India February 1, 2017.Cathal McNaughton/File PhotoStress Widening, Deepening The downbeat mood is a far cry from the bullish sentiment among businesses three years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was running for India's top job.  His reputation, built while running the western state of Gujarat, of speeding up implementation of infrastructure projects and promoting manufacturing raised hopes of a similar push at the national level. To be sure, his administration has spent billions of dollars on rail, road, port and power projects and pushed through a slew of steps to cut bureaucratic red tape and attract investments, the benefits of which, many believe, are still to come. But it has been slower to act on calls to write off loans and privatize state-run banks, which experts say are needed to revive corporate and bank balance sheets but will not sit well with bank labor unions or the taxpayers that will have to foot the bill.     Stressed corporate balance sheets have taken a heavy toll on state-run banks. At least 13 of banks accounting for approximately 40 percent of total loans are severely stressed, with over 20 percent of their outstanding loans classified as restructured or bad loans. A study by Credit Suisse shows that around 40 percent of India's corporate debt is owed by companies with interest coverage ratio of less than 1, meaning they do not earn enough to pay the interest obligations on their loans. The stress on the corporate sector is not only deepening, it is also widening. In the telecoms sector, interest coverage ratios slid after the entry of Reliance Jio increased competition, prompting a major round of price-cutting. Since the second half of 2016, much of the rise in bank bad loans has come from small businesses hobbled by poor sales and profitability. But it isn't just small businesses like Lustre Engineering who have had to resort to asset sales. Saddled with $3.1 billion in debt, GMR Group, an infrastructure conglomerate, plans to sell its road, power and airport assets. It has also put all investment in energy and highway projects on hold for the next 12-18 months. A revival in consumer spending and goods exports should boost consumer demand and lift capacity utilization at Indian factories that is running below average, economists say. But that may not be enough for a big investment revival. R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer at industrial group Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS), expects Modi's infrastructure drive to start showing results by mid-2018. But he says more needs to be done to ensure swift execution of projects.  People are still required to go to multiple agencies for clearances,  Shankar Raman told Reuters.  Ease of doing business is still a work in progress.

The OPEC member is struggling to service its heavy debt burden as its state-led socialist economy unravels under low oil prices, with bond yields among the highest of any emerging market country because of investor concerns of default. President Nicolas Maduro insists his government will meet all debt obligations and dismisses talk of default as conspiracy by political adversaries. The sources, who asked not to be identified, did not know which loans were associated with the interest payments in question. It was not immediately evident whether failure to make the payment within the grace period would immediately leave Venezuela in default. A CAF source who asked not to be identified said Venezuela has missed interest payment deadlines in the past but always ended up paying. Caracas-based CAF, which is owned by 19 countries primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean and 13 private banks in the region, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles media inquiries for the Finance Ministry, did not respond to an email request for comment. Venezuela received $1.9 billion in disbursements from CAF between 2012 and 2016, according to its 2016 annual report. CAF in 2016 approved $541 million in operations for Venezuela including $400 million for urban development, $40 million for potable water systems, and a renewal of a $101 million credit line to state development bank Bandes, the annual report said. Opposition leaders have for months pushed major banks not to provide new financing to Maduro's government. Julio Borges, leader of the opposition-controlled Congress, last week excoriated Goldman Sachs and Japanese investment bank Nomura for buying a combined total of $2.9 billion in bonds issued by state oil company PDVSA.

(Reuters) - A Maryland man convicted of murder in a case featured on the 2014  Serial  podcast was adequately represented by his original lawyer, a prosecutor argued on Thursday in an appeal of a judge's decision to throw out the conviction. Adnan Syed, 37, who is serving a life sentence for strangling his former girlfriend in 1999, was granted a new trial in June 2016. Maryland's attorney general appealed the decision. Prosecutor Thiruvendran Vignarajah on Thursday told the three-judge panel of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals that the judge erred in ordering a new trial since Syed's lawyer had  meticulously and vigorously investigated  his case. Baltimore Circuit Judge Martin Welch had ruled that Syed's original lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, should have cross-examined a witness about the reliability of cellphone tower evidence.  Gutierrez, who died in 2004, agreed to be disbarred by the state's highest court in 2001 rather than face complaints filed with the state's Attorney Grievance Commission. She said at the time that she could no longer practice because of ill health.   Syed’s current attorney, Justin Brown, told the panel that prosecutors in his trial had removed a key disclaimer attached to phone records that helped to convict Syed. “You’ve got this document that says those incoming phone calls are not reliable,  Brown said.  That was the crux of the state’s case.”  Vignarajah said defense attorneys should have raised the argument in an earlier appeal. Brown told judges that Gutierrez also failed to contact a potential alibi witness, an argument that Welch dismissed last year. The potential witness, Asia McClain Chapman, testified in  2016 that she and Syed were together at the time when prosecutors said the murder occurred. She said no one contacted her to provide an alibi at Syed's trial. More than 60 people packed the courtroom for Thursday's hearing. Syed remains in prison and was not present. The  Serial  podcast on Syed's case, released by public radio station WBEZ in Chicago, has been downloaded millions of times. It raised questions about testimony from an acquaintance of Syed, who had claimed Syed told him he planned to kill Lee and needed his help after the murder, and about phone calls that linked Syed to the crime. Rabia Chaudry, an activist and friend of Syed, said the publicity from the podcast helped raise about $700,000 for legal fees. The court will issue a written opinion on the case. The ruling could go to the Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court.

The Nasdaq Composite posted a record closing high boosted by gains in Nvidia and Yahoo. S&P; 500 futures opened slightly lower for the overnight session after exit polls showed there was a likelihood for a hung British Parliament. Traders had been on tenterhooks ahead of Comey's testimony to a Senate committee, his first since being fired by Trump on May 9. His prepared remarks had been made public Wednesday. The market's concern on the issue is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for their agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs. The Trump 'reflation trade' that favored banks and sectors linked to infrastructure spending, among others, was back Thursday, with the S&P; 500 financial sector .SPSY up 1.1 percent. The S&P; 1500 construction and engineering index .SPCOMCSE rose 1.4 percent and a gauge of construction materials' stocks .SPCOMCEMT added 1.5 percent.   If there was something (damning) that's going to come out, as leaky as things seem to be, we would have heard something more than what we've been hearing so far,  said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. Also supporting infrastructure stocks, specifically steel companies, was an announcement from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that a national security review of the U.S. steel industry will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers. The S&P; 1500 steel sector index .SPCOMSTEEL jumped 4.1 percent, the most since April 20. In his statement, Comey said the president lied in describing their encounters and that he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, but was confident that no votes had been altered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 8.84 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,182.53, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 0.65 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,433.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 24.38 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,321.76. Other analysts were not so rosy about the effect of Comey's testimony on the Trump agenda.  It leaves us where we were before. It becomes that much more difficult for the Trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package,  said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermid Anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected. You are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018, possibly in 2019.  Utilities stocks fell the most on the S&P; 500 as Treasury yields rose, tracking German Bund yields, after the European Central Bank upgraded its growth forecast for the euro zone even as it suggested its stimulus plan will remain in place as inflation remains subdued. The S&P; utilities sector .SPLRCU was down 0.88 percent, the most since mid March. Futures opened slightly lower after an exit poll unexpectedly showed Prime Minister Theresa May falling short of an overall parliamentary majority in Britain's election. Pressure on U.S. stocks from the British vote was expected to be  fleeting,  according to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  A hung parliament isn’t a worst case scenario. In fact, it could be positive over the long-term as it means Brexit would have to take a softer-form. This seems to be a uniquely British problem.  S&P; 500 e-minis ESc1 were down 3.5 points, or 0.14 percent, with 14,354 contracts changing hands. Stock Movers Among specific stocks, Nordstrom (JWN.N) jumped 10.3 percent to $44.63 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private. Alibaba shares (BABA.N) were up 13.3 percent to $142.34 after the company said it expects revenue growth of 45 to 49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. Yahoo YHOO.O, which has a 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba, gained 10.2 percent to $55.71. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 7.3 percent to $159.94 after Citigroup reiterated its bullish view on the stock and said longer term it could hit $300.

In a letter to five House Democrats, Germany's largest bank said U.S. federal privacy and confidentiality laws prevented it from sharing information on its reported banking relationship with the President and his family.  We hope that you will understand Deutsche Bank's need to respect the boundaries that Congress and the courts have set in an effort to protect confidential information,  lawyers for the bank from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld wrote in the letter. Deutsche's correspondence follows a May 23 request from Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, and four peers, requesting information about the Republican president. The original letter sought details that might show whether Trump's loans for his real-estate business were backed by the Russian government, including documents tied to any internal reviews of Trump's accounts at the bank. The lawmakers initially gave Deutsche Bank until June 2 to respond, but the German lender requested more time. The Democrats on their own cannot compel Deutsche Bank to hand over the information. The House committee has subpoena power, but Republican committee members, who make up the majority of the panel, would have to cooperate. No Republicans signed the letter. Public records show Deutsche Bank loaned Trump millions of dollars for real-estate ventures. The letter was sent on a day Washington was consumed with testimony by former FBI director James Comey, who appeared before a Senate panel on Thursday and accused Trump of firing him to undermine an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia. Moscow has denied the allegations of election meddling, and Trump has denied any collusion. The congressional Democrats also sought information about a Russian  mirror trading  scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines over the scheme, which could have been used to launder money out of Russia. The trades involved, for example, buying Russian stocks in roubles for a client and selling the identical value of a security for U.S. dollars for a related customer. Deutsche Bank provided the Democrats copies of settlements regarding the trades.

Traders had been on tenterhooks ahead of Comey's testimony to a Senate committee, his first since being fired by Trump on May 9. His prepared remarks had been made public Wednesday. The market's concern on the issue is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for their agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs. The Trump 'reflation trade' that favored banks and sectors linked to infrastructure spending, among others, was back Thursday, with the S&P; 500 financial sector .SPSY up 1.1 percent. The S&P; 1500 construction and engineering index .SPCOMCSE rose 1.4 percent and a gauge of construction materials' stocks .SPCOMCEMT added 1.5 percent.   If there was something (damning) that's going to come out, as leaky as things seem to be, we would have heard something more than what we've been hearing so far,  said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. Also supporting infrastructure stocks, specifically steel companies, was an announcement from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that a national security review of the U.S. steel industry will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers. The S&P; 1500 steel sector index .SPCOMSTEEL jumped 4.1 percent, the most since April 20. In his statement, Comey said the president lied in describing their encounters and that he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, but was confident that no votes had been altered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 8.84 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,182.53, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 0.65 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,433.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 24.38 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,321.76. Other analysts were not so rosy about the effect of Comey's testimony on the Trump agenda.  It leaves us where we were before. It becomes that much more difficult for the Trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package,  said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermid Anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected. You are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018, possibly in 2019.  Utilities stocks fell the most on the S&P; 500 as Treasury yields rose, tracking German Bund yields, after the European Central Bank upgraded its growth forecast for the euro zone even as it suggested its stimulus plan will remain in place as inflation remains subdued. The S&P; utilities sector .SPLRCU was down 0.88 percent, the most since mid March. Futures opened slightly lower after an exit poll unexpectedly showed Prime Minister Theresa May falling short of an overall parliamentary majority in Britain's election. Pressure on U.S. stocks from the British vote was expected to be  fleeting,  according to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  A hung parliament isn’t a worst case scenario. In fact, it could be positive over the long-term as it means Brexit would have to take a softer-form. This seems to be a uniquely British problem.  S&P; 500 e-minis ESc1 were down 3.5 points, or 0.14 percent, with 14,354 contracts changing hands. Stock Movers Among specific stocks, Nordstrom (JWN.N) jumped 10.3 percent to $44.63 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private. Alibaba shares (BABA.N) were up 13.3 percent to $142.34 after the company said it expects revenue growth of 45 to 49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. Yahoo YHOO.O, which has a 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba, gained 10.2 percent to $55.71. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 7.3 percent to $159.94 after Citigroup reiterated its bullish view on the stock and said longer term it could hit $300. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 7.10 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.62 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) - A Maryland man convicted of murder in a case featured on the 2014  Serial  podcast was adequately represented by his original lawyer, a prosecutor argued on Thursday in an appeal of a judge's decision to throw out the conviction. Adnan Syed, 37, who is serving a life sentence for strangling his former girlfriend in 1999, was granted a new trial in June 2016. Maryland's attorney general appealed the decision. Prosecutor Thiruvendran Vignarajah on Thursday told the three-judge panel of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals that the judge erred in ordering a new trial since Syed's lawyer had  meticulously and vigorously investigated  his case. Baltimore Circuit Judge Martin Welch had ruled that Syed's original lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, should have cross-examined a witness about the reliability of cellphone tower evidence.  Gutierrez, who died in 2004, agreed to be disbarred by the state's highest court in 2001 rather than face complaints filed with the state's Attorney Grievance Commission. She said at the time that she could no longer practice because of ill health.   Syed’s current attorney, Justin Brown, told the panel that prosecutors in his trial had removed a key disclaimer attached to phone records that helped to convict Syed. “You’ve got this document that says those incoming phone calls are not reliable,  Brown said.  That was the crux of the state’s case.”  Vignarajah said defense attorneys should have raised the argument in an earlier appeal. Brown told judges that Gutierrez also failed to contact a potential alibi witness, an argument that Welch dismissed last year. The potential witness, Asia McClain Chapman, testified in  2016 that she and Syed were together at the time when prosecutors said the murder occurred. She said no one contacted her to provide an alibi at Syed's trial. More than 60 people packed the courtroom for Thursday's hearing. Syed remains in prison and was not present. The  Serial  podcast on Syed's case, released by public radio station WBEZ in Chicago, has been downloaded millions of times. It raised questions about testimony from an acquaintance of Syed, who had claimed Syed told him he planned to kill Lee and needed his help after the murder, and about phone calls that linked Syed to the crime. Rabia Chaudry, an activist and friend of Syed, said the publicity from the podcast helped raise about $700,000 for legal fees. The court will issue a written opinion on the case. The ruling could go to the Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court.

The 36-year-old fisherman was among hundreds banned from fishing a stretch of water near the entry point for a pipeline that pumps oil 770 km (480 miles) across Myanmar to southwest China and forms a crucial part of Beijing's  Belt and Road  project to deepen its economic links with Asia and beyond.  How can we make a living if we're not allowed to catch fish?  said Nyein Aye, who bought a bigger boat just four months ago but now says his income has dropped by two-thirds due to a decreased catch resulting from restrictions on when and where he can fish. Last month he joined more than 100 people in a protest demanding compensation from pipeline operator Petrochina . The pipeline is part of the nearly $10 billion Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone, a scheme at the heart of fast-warming Myanmar-China relations and whose success is crucial for the Southeast Asian nation's leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Embattled Suu Kyi needs a big economic win to stem criticism that her first year in office has seen little progress on reform. China's support is also key to stabilising their shared border, where a spike in fighting with ethnic armed groups threatens the peace process Suu Kyi says is her top priority. China's state-run CITIC Group, the main developer of the Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone, says it will create 100,000 jobs in the northwestern state of Rakhine, one of Myanmar's poorest regions. But many local people say the project is being rushed through without consultation or regard for their way of life. Suspicion of China runs deep in Myanmar, and public hostility due to environmental and other concerns has delayed or derailed Chinese mega-projects in the country in the past. China says the Kyauk Pyu development is based on  win-win  co-operation between the two countries.  Avoiding Panic  Since Beijing signalled it may abandon the huge Myitsone Dam hydroelectric project in Myanmar earlier this year, it has pushed for concessions on other strategic undertakings - including the Bay of Bengal port at Kyauk Pyu, which gives it an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East. Internal planning documents reviewed by Reuters and more than two dozen interviews with officials show work on contracts and land acquisition has already begun before the completion of studies on the impact on local people and the environment, which legal experts said could breach development laws. The Kyauk Pyu Special Economic Zone will cover more than 4,200 acres (17 sq km). It includes the $7.3 billion deep sea port and a $2.3 billion industrial park, with plans to attract industries such as textiles and oil refining. A Reuters' tally based on internal planning documents and census data suggests 20,000 villagers, most of whom now depend on agriculture and fishing, are at risk of being relocated to make way for the project.  There will be a huge project in the zone and many buildings will be built, so people who live in the area will be relocated,  said Than Htut Oo, administrator of Kyauk Pyu, who also sits on the management committee of the economic zone. He said the government has not publicly announced the plan, because it didn't want to  create panic  while it was still negotiating with the Chinese developer. Ambitious Deadline In April, Myanmar's President Htin Kyaw signed two agreements on the pipeline and the Kyauk Pyu port with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, as Beijing pushed to revive a project that had stalled since its inception in 2009. The agreements call for environmental and social assessments to be carried out as soon as possible. While the studies are expected to take up to 15 months and have not yet started, CITIC has asked Myanmar to finalise contract terms by the end of this year so that the construction can start in 2018, said Soe Win, who leads the Myanmar management committee of the zone. Such a schedule has alarmed experts who fear the project is being rushed.  The environmental and social preparations for a project of these dimensions take years to complete and not months,  said Vicky Bowman, head of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business and a former British ambassador to the country. CITIC said in an email to Reuters it would engage  a world-renowned consulting firm  to carry out assessments. Although large-scale land demarcation for the project has not yet started, 26 families have been displaced from farmland due to acquisitions that took place in 2014 for the construction of two dams, according to land documents and the land owners. Experts say this violates Myanmar's environmental laws.  Carrying out land acquisition before completing environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans is incompatible with national law,  said Sean Bain, Myanmar-based legal consultant for human rights watchdog International Commission of Jurists. Job Opportunities? CITIC says it will build a vocational school to provide training for skills needed by companies in the economic zone. It has given $1.5 million to local villages to develop businesses. Reuters spoke to several villagers who had borrowed small sums from the village funds set up with this money.  The CITIC money was very useful for us because most people in the village need money,  said fisherman Thar Sai Aung, who borrowed $66 to buy new nets. Chinese investors say they also plan to spend $1 million during the first five years of the development, and $500,000 per year thereafter to improve local living standards. But villagers in Kyauk Pyu say they fear the project would not contribute to the development of the area because the operating companies employ mostly Chinese workers. From more than 3,000 people living on the Maday island, the entry point for the oil pipeline, only 47 have landed a job with the Petrochina, while the number of Chinese workers stood at more than double that number, data from labour authorities showed. Petrochina did not respond to requests for comment. In a recent report it said Myanmar citizens made up 72 percent of its workforce in the country overall and it would continue to hire locally.  I don't think there's hope for me to get a job at the zone,  said fisherman Nyein Aye. He had been turned down 12 times for job applications with the pipeline operator.  Chinese companies said they would develop our village and improve our livelihoods, but it turned out we are suffering every day.

Three years later, production has yet to begin. But servicing the debt is cutting into overall profits at his Lustre Engineering, which also offers electrical services, and the 59-year-old may have to sell off assets to repay the bank. Patharkar says India's bureaucrats are to blame for denying contracts to small businesses like his, and has taken one state-run power company to court to challenge its tendering process.  Government has put in place a very good public procurement policy, but officials on the ground are not implementing it,  he said. Bureaucracy is only one of the more visible parts of a problem that is vastly more systemic since Asia's third-largest economy started to falter, burdened by $150 billion in bad loans, excess and idle capacity and stalled private investment.  Private capital investments contracted 2.1 percent in the first three months of this year despite a surge in government spending, dragging economic growth to 6.1 percent, its lowest in more than two years. Signs for the current quarter are also not encouraging. According to CMIE, a think tank, new investment proposals in April and May were down by more than half from the same period in both of the last two years. The culprit is a so-called twin balance-sheet phenomenon: reduced new investment by stressed private companies, which account for three-quarters of India's total capital spending, and one of the highest bad-loan ratios among emerging economies. The bad loans have forced banks to curb overall lending growth and cut their credit exposure to industry, while the share of capital investments in India's GDP has dropped to below 30 percent from more than 38 percent a decade ago.  The motivation to invest into new capacities is falling,  said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive officer at CMIE. Foreign portfolio investors remain bullish about India,  pumping $19 billion into Indian stock and bond markets since January, lured by the country's relatively strong fundamentals. But the World Bank warned last week that prospects for developing economies like India were being undermined by weak investment. If the trend continues, it may thwart India's hopes of   replicating the growth that dramatically boosted employment, reduced poverty and increased per capita income in China. FILE PHOTO: Porters move goods in the Chandni Chowk area of Old Delhi, India February 1, 2017.Cathal McNaughton/File PhotoStress Widening, Deepening The downbeat mood is a far cry from the bullish sentiment among businesses three years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was running for India's top job.  His reputation, built while running the western state of Gujarat, of speeding up implementation of infrastructure projects and promoting manufacturing raised hopes of a similar push at the national level. To be sure, his administration has spent billions of dollars on rail, road, port and power projects and pushed through a slew of steps to cut bureaucratic red tape and attract investments, the benefits of which, many believe, are still to come. But it has been slower to act on calls to write off loans and privatize state-run banks, which experts say are needed to revive corporate and bank balance sheets but will not sit well with bank labor unions or the taxpayers that will have to foot the bill.     Stressed corporate balance sheets have taken a heavy toll on state-run banks. At least 13 of banks accounting for approximately 40 percent of total loans are severely stressed, with over 20 percent of their outstanding loans classified as restructured or bad loans. A study by Credit Suisse shows that around 40 percent of India's corporate debt is owed by companies with interest coverage ratio of less than 1, meaning they do not earn enough to pay the interest obligations on their loans. The stress on the corporate sector is not only deepening, it is also widening. In the telecoms sector, interest coverage ratios slid after the entry of Reliance Jio increased competition, prompting a major round of price-cutting. Since the second half of 2016, much of the rise in bank bad loans has come from small businesses hobbled by poor sales and profitability. But it isn't just small businesses like Lustre Engineering who have had to resort to asset sales. Saddled with $3.1 billion in debt, GMR Group, an infrastructure conglomerate, plans to sell its road, power and airport assets. It has also put all investment in energy and highway projects on hold for the next 12-18 months. A revival in consumer spending and goods exports should boost consumer demand and lift capacity utilization at Indian factories that is running below average, economists say. But that may not be enough for a big investment revival. R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer at industrial group Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS), expects Modi's infrastructure drive to start showing results by mid-2018. But he says more needs to be done to ensure swift execution of projects.  People are still required to go to multiple agencies for clearances,  Shankar Raman told Reuters.  Ease of doing business is still a work in progress.

House passage of the CHOICE Act is the farthest Republicans have gotten so far in undoing regulations they say hurt small banks and make the government responsible for bailing out big financial institutions should they fail. Republican President Donald Trump is pushing for deregulation across the federal government. Next week the Treasury Department is expected to release the first in a series of reports on lightening financial rules and re-interpreting Dodd-Frank provisions.  Lawmakers in the near future could also approve smaller bits of legislation to undo specific measures in Dodd-Frank, one of the biggest achievements of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Earlier on Thursday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, a Republican, said he would hold several hearings in coming months with the goal of  ultimately passing a meaningful and bipartisan reform package.  On a day when the national spotlight was on the Senate testimony of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the fight over repealing Dodd-Frank consumed the House. The bill was approved along party lines by a vote of 233-to-186 after four hours of often-loud debate. The most powerful Democrat in the chamber, California's Nancy Pelosi, described the legislation as  dastardly.  The argument even spilled over to a House committee hearing on the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. There, Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro demanded that acting CFTC chair J. Christopher Giancarlo, a Republican, provide three examples in writing to prove his statement that overregulation was hurting the economy. Authored by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican, the CHOICE Act allows banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or holding onto more capital. While the act was meant to address bankers' concerns, many in the banking sector do not support it because they consider the required capital level too high. Also, the American Bankers Association expressed disappointment that the bill had retained Dodd-Frank limits on debit card fees. The act restructures the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created to guard against fraud in lending. It eliminates the Volcker rule that limits trading activities by banks. Also, the government would no longer be able to designate non-bank institutions as  systemically important,  which triggers increased oversight. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan evaluator of legislation, estimates the bill would save the federal government $24 billion over a decade, mostly by lifting the government's authority to step in and unwind failing institutions. Republicans described the act as a jobs-creator, saying Dodd-Frank's numerous requirements made it impossible for community banks to lend to small businesses. They said changing the independent CFPB would make the agency more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats said the legislation would bring about another economic catastrophe by eliminating vital checks on the financial system. They said the CFPB changes, including eliminating its complaints database, would make it easier for firms to take advantage of consumers along the lines of the housing crisis, where millions were trapped in mortgages they could not afford. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in its entirety, even though it has Trump's backing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democrat, initially conceived of the CFPB and was Obama's first choice to lead it. She is expected to rally opposition in the form of a filibuster against changes to the agency. Still, Crapo lauded the bill's passage in the House as a  significant and thoughtful effort,” a sign he may include some of its provisions in a future bill.   The CHOICE Act makes a positive move away from government micromanagement, and returns to basic principles of safety and soundness and market-driven principles,  he said in a statement.

Any plan to go private would likely require the company to raise as much as $4.5 billion in outside capital and an additional $1.5 billion in private equity, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Binetti. Finding that much money could be difficult as the department store sector faces its greatest test since last decade's financial crisis.   While the ownership structure could allow the Nordstrom family to be more forceful in pushing toward a privatization, we're cautious about a department store's ability to secure a bid of this magnitude given the structural headwinds facing the sector today.  Nordstrom has a market value of $7.4 billion after its shares surged on Thursday following the company's announcement that a group of family members was looking at taking the company private. The group together already owns about 31 percent of the company. The upscale Seattle-based clothing and accessories retailer, like most rivals, has struggled to grow earnings in recent years as consumers do less shopping at big malls in favor of more specialized stores or buying online.  As a result, the assets of physical retailers - including stores, leases and warehouses - are losing value, making it difficult to structure a deal, said Neil Saunders, managing director at retail research firm GlobalData.  Even though Nordstrom is doing better than others, department stores are under pressure so the value of the assets they've got against their debt could decline,  he said. Mixed Record  The option of going private has had mixed success in the retail sector. Mervyn's and Linens 'n Things took bankruptcy protection after private equity-led buyouts. Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU.O) and Dollar General Corp (DG.N) fared better. Kathy Gersch, a former Nordstrom vice president who now works as a retail industry consultant at Kotter International, said Nordstrom's long family history might help it find an investor.   I think financing this kind of deal could be potentially attractive, where they know the family have their own money in it and they understand the business,  she said. Investment banking sources said value-oriented private equity investors might see the industry's difficulties as a good opportunity to take a gamble on Nordstrom, with its rich family history, as opposed to rivals such as Macy's Inc (M.N). The family made it clear in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday that it would consider no other transactions, essentially ruling out a merger with another retailer.

House passage of the CHOICE Act is the farthest Republicans have gotten so far in undoing regulations they say hurt small banks and make the government responsible for bailing out big financial institutions should they fail. Republican President Donald Trump is pushing for deregulation across the federal government. Next week the Treasury Department is expected to release the first in a series of reports on lightening financial rules and re-interpreting Dodd-Frank provisions.  Lawmakers in the near future could also approve smaller bits of legislation to undo specific measures in Dodd-Frank, one of the biggest achievements of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Earlier on Thursday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, a Republican, said he would hold several hearings in coming months with the goal of  ultimately passing a meaningful and bipartisan reform package.  On a day when the national spotlight was on the Senate testimony of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the fight over repealing Dodd-Frank consumed the House. The bill was approved along party lines by a vote of 233-to-186 after four hours of often-loud debate. The most powerful Democrat in the chamber, California's Nancy Pelosi, described the legislation as  dastardly.  The argument even spilled over to a House committee hearing on the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. There, Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro demanded that acting CFTC chair J. Christopher Giancarlo, a Republican, provide three examples in writing to prove his statement that overregulation was hurting the economy. Authored by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican, the CHOICE Act allows banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or holding onto more capital. While the act was meant to address bankers' concerns, many in the banking sector do not support it because they consider the required capital level too high. Also, the American Bankers Association expressed disappointment that the bill had retained Dodd-Frank limits on debit card fees. The act restructures the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created to guard against fraud in lending. It eliminates the Volcker rule that limits trading activities by banks. Also, the government would no longer be able to designate non-bank institutions as  systemically important,  which triggers increased oversight. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan evaluator of legislation, estimates the bill would save the federal government $24 billion over a decade, mostly by lifting the government's authority to step in and unwind failing institutions. Republicans described the act as a jobs-creator, saying Dodd-Frank's numerous requirements made it impossible for community banks to lend to small businesses. They said changing the independent CFPB would make the agency more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats said the legislation would bring about another economic catastrophe by eliminating vital checks on the financial system. They said the CFPB changes, including eliminating its complaints database, would make it easier for firms to take advantage of consumers along the lines of the housing crisis, where millions were trapped in mortgages they could not afford. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in its entirety, even though it has Trump's backing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democrat, initially conceived of the CFPB and was Obama's first choice to lead it. She is expected to rally opposition in the form of a filibuster against changes to the agency. Still, Crapo lauded the bill's passage in the House as a  significant and thoughtful effort,” a sign he may include some of its provisions in a future bill.   The CHOICE Act makes a positive move away from government micromanagement, and returns to basic principles of safety and soundness and market-driven principles,  he said in a statement.

The new cruise rocket is  a powerful attack means capable of striking any enemy group of battleships attempting at military attack on the DPRK from the ground at will,  KCNA said. DPRK is short for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Pyongyang launched what appeared to be several land-to-sea missiles early on Thursday off its east coast, which flew about 200 km (124 miles), South Korea's military said. The missile launch came less than a week after the United Nations Security Council imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea, and drew condemnation from South Korean President Moon Jae-in who has hoped to engage Pyongyang in dialogue. North Korea's official media routinely report on such missile launches the following day.  The launched cruise rockets accurately detected and hit the floating targets on the East Sea of Korea after making circular flights,  KCNA said, referring to the sea that divides the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The rocket, tested from a tracked mobile launcher, was a new weapon North Korea displayed for the first time in a military parade earlier this year, KCNA said. Experts said the new anti-ship missile has four launching canisters. North Korea unveiled a number of new weapons at a massive military parade on April 15 to mark the anniversary of the birth of the state's founding leader and has since tested some of them. Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the mainland United States. The isolated country, which has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016 in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, says the program is necessary to counter U.S. aggression.

The move marks the first time the agency has called for the removal of an opioid painkiller for public health reasons and comes after a panel of advisers concluded in March that the drug's benefits did not outweigh the risks.  We are facing an opioid epidemic - a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA's newly appointed commissioner said in a statement. Opioids were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015 and opioid overdoses have quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It remains to be seen whether Endo will comply with the FDA's request. The company said in a statement it is  evaluating the full range of potential options as we determine the appropriate path forward.  If Endo refuses to withdraw the product, the FDA could offer the company an opportunity for a hearing to make the case for why the product should not be removed. If, after the hearing, the FDA decided to withdraw its approval, Endo could, in theory, sue the agency.  Despite the FDA's request to withdraw Opana ER from the market, this request does not indicate uncertainty with the product's safety or efficacy when taken as prescribed,  the company said.   Opana ER was approved in 2006 and a reformulated version was introduced in 2012.     In March a panel of advisers to the FDA voted 18-8, with one abstention, that the drug's benefits no longer outweighed the risks. Data showed that while nasal abuse rates fell, the rate of intravenous abuse increased. The drug has also been associated with a serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C, the agency said, as well as a serious blood disorder known as thrombotic microangiopathy.      If Endo resists taking this off the market immediately, the people who are injured or killed as a result of it being on the market longer than it should, there will be a wave of product liability litigation against the company,  said Sidney Wolfe, founder and senior adviser to consumer watchdog Public Citizen.     Ohio filed a lawsuit in May against the pharmaceutical industry, charging that a number of companies, including Endo, Purdue Pharma, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Johnson & Johnson and Allergan Plc conducted misleading marketing campaigns that downplayed the drugs' addictiveness. Other states and cities have filed similar lawsuits. Gottlieb said the agency will  continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product's risks outweigh its benefits, not only for its intended patient population but also in regard to its potential for misuse and abuse.  Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Opana ER is a declining asset whose sales are expected to fall to $97 million in 2019, down from an estimated $134 million in 2017.

(Reuters) - Prosecutors on Thursday sought to use Bill Cosby's words against him at his sexual assault trial, showing interviews to jurors in which the comedian acknowledged giving his accuser pills before engaging in what he described as consensual  petting.  The introduction of Cosby's own statements on the trial's fourth day marked a new phase of the case after days of testimony from two of his accusers. Cosby, 79, faces charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, a former employee of his alma mater Temple University, at his Philadelphia-area home in 2004. The married star of the 1980's hit television family comedy  The Cosby Show  has faced similar allegations from dozens of women. He has denied all of the claims. Only Constand's accusation has resulted in criminal charges because the other alleged incidents are too old to prosecute. In a sworn deposition taken during Constand's 2005 civil lawsuit, which was later settled for an undisclosed sum, Cosby described an earlier encounter with Constand, when he began touching her midriff.

I don't hear her say anything, and I don't feel her say anything, and so I continue and I go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection. I am not stopped.  The deposition's unsealing in 2015 by a federal judge prompted prosecutors to reopen the case and bring charges later that year. Cosby also said he gave Constand 1-1/2 Benadryl pills on the night of the alleged assault after she said she was tense and sleep-deprived.

In a police interview in 2005 that was also shown to jurors, Cosby said what followed was consensual  petting.  Cosby lawyer Brian McMonagle focused on discrepancies in Constand's 2005 statements to police, including her initial failure to mention the earlier encounter, when she said she rebuffed his advances. Prosecutors on Friday are expected to continue presenting jurors with portions of Cosby's deposition, including his admission that he gave the sedative Quaalude to young women.

Any plan to go private would likely require the company to raise as much as $4.5 billion in outside capital and an additional $1.5 billion in private equity, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Binetti. Finding that much money could be difficult as the department store sector faces its greatest test since last decade's financial crisis.   While the ownership structure could allow the Nordstrom family to be more forceful in pushing toward a privatization, we're cautious about a department store's ability to secure a bid of this magnitude given the structural headwinds facing the sector today.  Nordstrom has a market value of $7.4 billion after its shares surged on Thursday following the company's announcement that a group of family members was looking at taking the company private. The group together already owns about 31 percent of the company. The upscale Seattle-based clothing and accessories retailer, like most rivals, has struggled to grow earnings in recent years as consumers do less shopping at big malls in favor of more specialized stores or buying online.  As a result, the assets of physical retailers - including stores, leases and warehouses - are losing value, making it difficult to structure a deal, said Neil Saunders, managing director at retail research firm GlobalData.  Even though Nordstrom is doing better than others, department stores are under pressure so the value of the assets they've got against their debt could decline,  he said. Mixed Record  The option of going private has had mixed success in the retail sector. Mervyn's and Linens 'n Things took bankruptcy protection after private equity-led buyouts. Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU.O) and Dollar General Corp (DG.N) fared better. Kathy Gersch, a former Nordstrom vice president who now works as a retail industry consultant at Kotter International, said Nordstrom's long family history might help it find an investor.   I think financing this kind of deal could be potentially attractive, where they know the family have their own money in it and they understand the business,  she said. Investment banking sources said value-oriented private equity investors might see the industry's difficulties as a good opportunity to take a gamble on Nordstrom, with its rich family history, as opposed to rivals such as Macy's Inc (M.N). The family made it clear in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday that it would consider no other transactions, essentially ruling out a merger with another retailer.  Flexibility is one of the key thoughts behind the family wanting to bring the company back into private control,  Saunders told Reuters, given the company would likely find it easier as a private company to restructure operations or invest in e-commerce.

Britain's world number one has made a career out of solving puzzles during matches -- making up for a lack of one killer shot by utilizing one of the best brains in men's tennis,  said the Swede who was also known for his smart tactics.  Murray will have to raise his level against Stan, but Andy Murray is not one of those players who plays well or badly, he plays the right way or the wrong way,  according to Wilander, who presents Eurosport's flagship show 'Game, Set and Mats'.   Andy knows the right way to play Stan. The confidence factor will fall into place because he will know his game plan. It's all about playing the right way, the right match, and Murray is a genius at that.  Wawrinka proved in beating Novak Djokovic in the 2015 French Open final that he can blast anyone off the court with his groundstrokes and punishing serve, but Murray defused the Swiss's game in last year's semis with a tactical masterclass. Rafael Nadal's forehand is one of the most destructive shots ever seen while his semi-final opponent Dominic Thiem's single-handed backhand, loaded with fizzing topspin, is also becoming one of the most feared weapon's in tennis. Murray often needs a few extra shots to finish rallies, although it would be foolish to downplay the lethal nature of his groundstrokes. But it is the Scot's tennis brain that has helped him win three grand slam titles, said Wilander.  We tend to think Murray has less power than Nadal,  he said.  Nadal just tries to hit as many forehands as possible and they are very clever forehands but he just gets guys on the run.  Murray doesn't have that shot. He has to plot his way through every point. So I think he is getting more out of his game than most players. That's not saying he is over-achieving.  But to compete with some of these great ball strikers and beat them handily, often, that's down to his street sense on the court. He's a genius. He can sense when to play the right shot.  He feels every point. He's very complicated. He's so intense, he gets frustrated because he knows what's going on, he feels every situation. To try and explain what Murray feels on a tennis court is a waste of time.  There have not been any players ever who feel the moments, feel the tactics better than Murray.

Through the first 10 games without their All-Star center fielder, the Angels have not shown any signs of falling apart. They erupted on Thursday for their best offensive outing since Trout tore a thumb ligament, rallying from an early three-run deficit to thump the Detroit Tigers 11-4 at Comerica Park. Los Angeles is 5-5 since Trout's injury.  Losing the best player in the game is obviously a big blow to the team but what are you going to do? Just give up for the rest of the season and not win games?  said second baseman Danny Espinosa, who smacked three hits and drove in three runs.  Every team that has gone to the playoffs and every team that has been successful, it's next guy up. You've got to keep going, you've got to keep pushing.  Andrelton Simmons had two hits during a six-run seventh inning and wound up with three hits, two runs scored and two RBIs. Eric Young Jr. supplied three hits, three runs scored and an RBI for the Angels (31-32). Related CoveragePreview: Angels at TigersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch Just clutch hitting all day to get us back into it,  Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said.  When (Tigers starter Michael Fulmer) made a mistake, we hit it hard. That's something we haven't been doing at times. We've been a little challenged to score some runs. But today, when there was a pitch that was hittable, we hit it hard and put it into play. Just an overall good day.  Winning pitcher JC Ramirez (6-4) lasted five innings, allowing four runs on 10 hits. Nicholas Castellanos had three hits, including a double and homer, for the Tigers (29-30). Ian Kinsler also contributed three hits and scored twice. Fulmer (6-4) gave up five runs on nine hits in 4 1/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. He had pitched at least six innings in his previous 11 starts.  Some days, whatever you throw just gets hit,  Fulmer said.  I felt like I made some good pitches and I felt like I made some bad pitches. They hit both of them. Sometimes you just have to tip your cap to them.  Fulmer cruised through the first two innings before the Angels' bats came alive.  I just think I need to mix up my pitches a little better,  he said.  The first time through the order, like tonight, I threw mostly all fastballs and I got ground balls and weak fly balls and I was happy with that. Get to the 7-8-9 guys and they start putting balls in play and they find holes, just (by) being really aggressive.  Miguel Cabrera's RBI single gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead in the first inning. The ball took a funny hop past right fielder Kole Calhoun, allowing Kinsler to score from second without a throw. Detroit made it 3-0 in the second. Castellanos drilled an opposite-field shot to lead off the inning. With two outs, Kinsler doubled and Alex Avila followed with another double to center field. The Angels broke through on Espinosa's run-scoring double in the third, but the Tigers got that back on Castellanos' two-out, RBI single in the bottom of the inning. Los Angeles batted around and knocked out Fulmer with a four-run fifth to take a 5-4 lead. It could have scored even more if not for a defensive gem by center fielder Andrew Romine. Juan Graterol, Simmons and Calhoun had run-scoring singles and Albert Pujols added a sacrifice fly. With runners at the corners and two outs, Ben Revere ripped a liner toward the gap in left-center field. Romine made a driving grab, robbing Revere of a two-run extra-base hit. The Angels blew the game open with their six-run seventh against relievers Arcenio Leon and Daniel Stumpf. C.J. Cron and Espinosa rapped two-run singles. Simmons began and finished off the outburst with a leadoff double and an RBI single. NOTES: Detroit C James McCann will be activated from the 10-day disabled list for the weekend series in Boston. McCann (left hand laceration) was hit by a pitch in Houston on May 25th. ... Tigers RHP Justin Verlander threw a 20-25 pitch bullpen session Thursday under the watchful eyes of manager Brad Ausmus and pitching coach Rich Dubee. Verlander, who is scheduled to start Saturday, exited his last start Sunday during the third inning because of right groin tightness. ... Angels LF Cameron Maybin (left oblique muscle contusion) took batting practice on Thursday in Detroit and is expected to be activated from the disabled list on Friday. ... The Angels, who currently have seven pitchers on the DL, have used 41 players this season.

President Donald Trump's abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comey's dismissal. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putin's  associates hacked information, paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow's role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russia's role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clinton's use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying:  I will tell you this, Russia: if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.  He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration.  As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,  Trump said, although he added:  It could have been others also.  Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed.  The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?  he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted:  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.  Did the FBI probe continue after Comey's dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey's departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey's firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on  Restoring Confidence in the FBI  that recommended Comey's dismissal. Rosenstein's memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton's use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein's view was that Comey's decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation. Was Comey's firing related to the FBI's Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBI's Russia probe.  I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that,  Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agency's investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear  the cloud  hanging over his presidency, according Comey's testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agency's probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a  duty to correct  if that changed.  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him  mildly nauseous  that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called  Showboat  to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was  consumed with election meddling  at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey's Senate testimony proved the president was not under investigation. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) said on Thursday it would make automatic braking systems standard on an estimated 1 million 2018 model cars and light trucks sold in the United States, including high-volume models such as the Rogue and Rogue Sport compact sport utility vehicles, the Altima sedan, Murano and Pathfinder SUVs, LEAF electric car, Maxima sedan and Sentra small car.  Nissan sold about 1.6 million vehicles in the United States last year.  Rival Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) has said it will make so-called automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all its U.S. models by the end of this year. Overall, however, most automakers are not rushing to make automatic brake systems part of the base cost of mainstream vehicles sold in the competitive U.S. market. The industry has come under pressure from regulators, lawmakers and safety advocates to adopt the technology, which can slow or stop a vehicle even if the driver fails to act. So far, only about 17 percent of models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety offered standard collision-avoiding braking, according to data supplied by the auto safety research group backed insurance industry. Many of the models with standard collision-avoiding brake systems are luxury vehicles made by European or Japanese manufacturers. The systems require more sensors and software than conventional brakes, and automakers said they need time to engineer the systems into vehicles as part of more comprehensive makeovers.  Last year, 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022.  Safety advocates have petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to begin a regulatory process to require the technologies, but the agency has said the voluntary agreement will result in faster deployment than a formal rule-making process. NHTSA says the technology could eliminate one-fifth of crashes.  Do the math. That’s 5 million crashes every year - 20 percent reduction means 1 million less. Those are big numbers,  Mark Rosekind, the NHTSA's then-administrator, told Reuters last year.   But customers would likely experience the benefits of the technology infrequently. The technology to enable a car to drive itself is far more costly, but industry executives foresee autonomous vehicles driving revenue-generating transportation services that could be attractive to investors.   General Motors Co (GM.N) offers automatic braking as optional equipment on about two-thirds of its models. The company did not say on Thursday how many vehicles have the technology as standard equipment. GM has not made public its plans to make the technology standard across its lineup.  Any time you have a voluntary agreement you have a spectrum of implementation,  Jeff Boyer, GM's vice president for safety, told Reuters earlier this week. Asked when GM would roll out standard automatic braking, Boyer said,  let's just say we honor the voluntary commitment.  Ford Motor Co (F.N)  has a plan to standardize over time,  the company said in a statement on Thursday. Currently, automatic braking systems are optional on several 2017 Ford and Lincoln models, and will be offered on certain 2018 models including the best-selling F-150 pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) offers automatic braking as optional equipment in nine model lines, using cameras and radar to detect hazards ahead. The company has said it will meet the 2022 target for making the systems standard. As 2018 models roll out during the second half of this year, more vehicles will offer automatic braking, said Dean McConnell, an executive with Continental AG (CONG.DE)'s North American business. Continental's automatic braking technology systems will be on certain Nissan models.   We see it accelerating,  he said.  It varies. There are some (automakers) that are being aggressive  and others that are waiting. Nissan did not disclose how much prices for vehicles would rise to offset the cost of standard automatic emergency braking. The 2018 models will be launched later this year. Currently, Nissan, like most carmakers, offers automatic braking as part of a bundle of optional safety and technology features. A 2017 Nissan Sentra compact sedan has a starting price of $17,875. To buy the car equipped with automatic braking requires spending another $6,820 for a Sentra SR with a premium technology package. German auto technology suppliers Continental and Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] will supply the systems, Nissan said.

Any disruption in any mature region or market that is relevant for us is a reason for concern,  Chief Executive Tom Enders told reporters. Referring to the aviation blockade against Qatar imposed by Saudi Arabia and others this week, Enders said:  That's a development that is troubling for our industry, for many industries. We sincerely hope that these disruptions are not developing to a long-term conflict.  The bust-up between Arab powers has dealt a blow to Gulf carriers already hurt by low oil prices and laptop bans and exposed the sensitivity of Gulf hubs to regional uncertainty,  delegates at an airlines meeting said this week.. Analysts say any prolonged disruption could prompt Qatar to delay taking aircraft deliveries from Airbus and Boeing. Speaking at a media briefing ahead of the June 19-25 Paris Airshow, Enders played down suggestions that Airbus, the world's second-largest planemaker behind Boeing (BA.N), was too reliant on the Middle East.   We are far from being over exposed… to this region,  he said, noting it made up 13 percent of unfilled orders. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders speaks during a news conference on the aerospace group's annual results, in London, Britain February 24, 2016.Hannah McKay I think this region will remain important and relevant even allowing for some recouping, some consolidation; nobody can exclude that for the long term.  With talks looming on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Enders said Airbus's UK plants were among its most competitive and warned against crimping this advantage through restrictions on people or goods.  We are a company that is obviously very interested in the free flow of people. The mobility between our sites in Europe is crucially important,  he said.

Enders was speaking shortly before a shock exit poll suggested that UK Prime Minister Theresa May had failed to maintain an overall majority after calling an election to strengthen her Conservative government's position ahead of EU negotiations. Several companies have expressed concerns over a so-called 'hard Brexit' under which trade tariffs could apply. Enders said  any British government paying attention to the importance of the aerospace industry is well aware of what is at stake . Analysts say Airbus is expected to press UK governments for continued support for the aerospace industry as the price for maintaining the same level of UK investment for future aircraft programs.

Now she stands one match away from becoming the first unseeded player in the professional era to win the women's title at the French Open and the first Latvian grand slam champion. Ostapenko trained as a ballroom dancer for seven years but seems more suited to thrashing the fluff off tennis balls. On Thursday, in a frenetic match of 16 breaks of serve and in which she made 45 unforced errors, some of which would have had Evert wincing, she was irresistible at times.  She showed good nerves throughout the match,  Evert said later.  She has been working on that with her coach.  She came out like a thunderstorm in the third set.  Ostapenko's best chance of winning the final will be to play a similar way against the wily Halep, who can reach world number one if she takes the title. Although Evert says that would be a tall order.  I don't think many players win their first grand slam final,  she said.  I would be surprised if she came out and hit winners all over the court like she has been doing. But I might be wrong. Anything could happen.  With such an attacking game, backing Ostapenko could be a precarious business. But Evert is clearly impressed and believes she has the game to profit from the uncertainty surrounding some of the biggest names in the women's game. Serena Williams, the 23-times major champion, is pregnant, double Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is just back after being stabbed, five-times major champion Maria Sharapova has only recently returned from a doping ban and former world number one Victoria Azarenka has been out after having a baby.  In the women's (game) there has been a big gap. That gap won't be there at Wimbledon because (Maria) Sharapova will come back, Victoria (Azarenka) will come back, (Petra) Kvitova will be better than ever,  Evert said.  You are going to have some added faces but this one is wide open. Who is going to step up and want it more. Halep has the best chance but Ostapenko is really shining.

Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for aggressive measures against undocumented immigrants and strengthening voter identification laws, touted his tough on immigration record at an announcement event for next year's race.   Strong borders and respect for rule of law are essential to our country and to our state,  Kobach said.   Kansas is the sanctuary state of the Midwest. We are the only state in the five state area that has done nothing to discourage illegal immigration.    Measures would include ending sanctuary policies in Kansas counties, cutting public benefits and welfare to undocumented people, ending in-state tuition for undocumented students at state universities and insuring that state and local law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities, he said.  As secretary of state, Kobach was a strong proponent of tightening Kansas' voter identification statutes since he was elected in 2010, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who said the rules were meant to prevent voter fraud.

Trump created a commission last month to investigate voter fraud following his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival in the 2016 U.S. election.  Since July 2015, Kobach has secured nine convictions for voter fraud in Kansas, according to a May statement from his office.  Kobach, an Ivy League and Oxford educated former Department of Justice official, said in addition to tackling illegal immigration, he would crackdown on lobbying in state capital Topeka as well as fight tax increases if elected.   He was highly critical of a move by Republican lawmakers on Tuesday to override a veto by Republican Governor Sam Brownback of legislation that would raise taxes, saying there was no need to feed the  government monster.   The measure essentially rolls back income tax rate cuts the state enacted in 2012 that led to budget shortfalls. The higher rates are expected to raise $591 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $633 million in fiscal 2019, according to a legislative analysis of the bill.

What started as a childhood dream of winning the America's Cup has become an obsession to become the first British challenger to lift the  Auld Mug  and bring it  home . Ainslie's first shot at achieving that ended on Thursday, when a team from New Zealand, one of only four countries to have won the cup, beat his Land Rover BAR crew in the semi-final of the 35th America's Cup challenger series in Bermuda. [L8N1J55S7]  We knew it was going to be incredibly tough at the first attempt,  Ainslie told a news briefing after the race.  Ultimately we weren't able to catch up with the existing teams in time,  sailing's most successful Olympian, who is not used to losing, added. He has won the cup before, as tactician with Oracle Team USA in their 2013 comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand. But Ainslie wants to win it for  Queen and country  and under the banner  Bring The Cup Home  set about mounting his own challenge, launching BAR with the aim of doing something British teams have tried and failed to do on some 20 occasions.  From Table to Bermuda Getting an America's Cup boat on the water, let alone competing with Oracle Team USA and Artemis Racing, which are both backed by billionaires, costs tens of millions of dollars.  I couldn't be prouder of the team today ... Three and a half years ago a few of us were sitting around a table in London ... what we have we have achieved today is incredible,  Ainslie said in the televised briefing. Ainslie managed to raise 90 million pounds ($116 million) to fund his campaign, building a massive team headquarters in Portsmouth on the south coast of England. This base looks south across the Solent to where he now lives with his wife the sports presenter Georgie Thompson and daughter Bellatrix in the aptly named village of Seaview. His  commute  to work is either on a high speed ferry or in his own RIB speedboat across the channel where he hopes one day to defend the cup for Britain. To do so he will need to keep bringing the money in. Land Rover BAR has been part funded by wealthy private investors with a passion for sailing, including entrepreneur Keith Mills and Dixons Carphone Chairman Charles Dunstone. Ainslie paid tribute to both men's involvement on Thursday and said that Land Rover was renewing its partnership with BAR to compete for the next America's Cup. Corporate Sponsors In order to succeed, Ainslie has attracted corporate sponsors such as Land Rover, BT, BAE Systems and Siemens who have provided financial backing and technical know-how. One supporter who has set Land Rover BAR apart is Britain's Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, who has sailed with Ainslie and is patron of the 1851 Trust, the charity he has set up to get young people to discover science and technology through sailing. As well as being team principal, skipper, part-time fund-raiser and ambassador, Ainslie has managed to attract an impressive team to the BAR stable, including chief executive Martin Whitmarsh who was previously at McLaren Formula One. On the water he signed up Jono Macbeth, a 44-year-old New Zealander who has three America's Cup wins, as sailing team manager and enlisted Giles Scott as tactician on his catamaran  Rita , the name Ainslie gives to all his racing boats. As ever with Ainslie, no sooner was he back on dry land on Thursday than he was looking to his next challenge.   Already the work is starting on the next campaign ... and we will be that much stronger next time,  he vowed.

Pavlopoulos told Die Welt newspaper in an interview published Friday that Greece had implemented pension cuts and tax reforms as promised, and Germany should also keep its promises and approve some debt relief.  I appeal to Wolfgang Schaeuble not to let the German election influence his decision (on debt relief). This is about something bigger; it's about Europe,  the Greek president said. Greece this week urged European lenders to offer incentives that would boost growth and help break an impasse between the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund on the size of relief the country needs to make its debt sustainable. During a meeting of euro zone finance ministers last month, Greece, its euro zone lenders and the IMF failed to agree on the debt relief measures to be implemented after its current bailout expires in 2018, mainly because of different growth assumptions. They are now aiming for a deal at a June 15 Eurogroup meeting. Germany and some other European countries are worried that any concessions could affect the pace of economic reforms in Greece and want any debt relief put off until 2018. The IMF has said it will not participate financially in the country's latest bailout unless the issue is clearly addressed. Pavlopoulos told Die Welt he had worked closely with Schaeuble when they were both interior ministers and believed the German minister would find a way to enable some debt relief.  I know that Mr. Schaeuble is a role model when it comes to sticking to the rules ... Now my chance has come to demand that the German finance ministry sticks to the rules,  he said.  Wolfgang Schaeuble is strict, but just, and that is why he will find a formula that allows us to reduce the mountain of debt.  He said Greece's request would not result in any problems for Germany, noting that German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in the ruling coalition, also believed Greece had lived up to its reform promises and was acting in good faith. He said he did not believe that German voters would cast their election votes on the basis of Greece debt relief, noting that perhaps the German government should remind its citizens that Greece had made huge sacrifices to get a grip on the debt crisis, and it had not cost Germany a single euro.

This weekend’s assault by jihadists at London Bridge and the Borough Market area will keep security issues at the fore in the final days of campaigning before the June 8 vote.  But the recent violence is unlikely to shift voting intentions one way or another, any more than the May 22 suicide bombing in Manchester did. Rather, it’s the surge in support among young people for the main opposition Labour Party that has been shifting the polls.  When Prime Minister Theresa May called a surprise early general election on April 18, her ruling Conservative Party was so far ahead in the polls that she appeared on course for a landslide victory, reinforcing her authority in the crucial Brexit negotiations with the European Union. But since then the gap has narrowed, to such an extent that some projections suggest May will not win an overall majority. The result will hinge upon how many young people turn out to vote in an election that has exposed a stark generational divide.  Britain’s two main parties have traditionally divided along class lines, with Labour building on its working-class base and the Conservatives bolstered by their middle-class support. But now age, even more than class, distinguishes the two parties. Pollster Ipsos MORI shows Labour outpolling the Conservatives by 30 or so percentage points among 18 to 34-year-olds but trailing behind by a similar margin among those 55 and older.  MORE FROM REUTERS UK Conservatives on course for bigger majority: poll Wall St. slips as it waits for U.K. vote, Comey testimony   Anti-Mafia mayor looks to put Palermo on tourist map Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party at an election campaign event in Newcastle, June 5, 2017. Support for Corbyn has been surging among young voters.Andrew YatesThe importance of age in modern British politics was already apparent in last year’s referendum on whether to leave the European Union. The “exit” camp narrowly beat out those who wanted to remain, 52 percent to 48 percent. But that narrow margin disguised a chasm between young and old. According to pollster YouGov, just 29 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds supported exit, compared to 64 percent of those aged 65 or older. Voters under 50 backed staying in the EU, whereas 50 to 64-year-olds as well as those 65 and older supported leaving.  The general election is not a rerun of the referendum. For one thing, 3,303 candidates from dozens of parties are contesting a total of 650 seats, whereas the Brexit poll was on a single issue that cut across party lines. For another, the decision to leave the EU is now wearily accepted, even by many who voted to remain. That has stymied the hopes of the pro-European Liberal Democrats, who dreamed of restoring their fortunes in the center of politics by mobilizing the more youthful “remain” voters with their promise of a second referendum on the outcome of the Brexit talks. Instead the party is again likely to win only a handful of seats.  Labour, not the Liberal Democrats, is attracting younger voters in what has become a two-party race between them and the Conservatives, outside Scotland and Northern Ireland. Labour has made a blatant pitch for younger voters by promising the abolition of university tuition fees and a big expansion in publicly-funded childcare. The offer seems to be working, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a political lookalike to America’s Bernie Sanders (who said he was “impressed” by Corbyn on a recent trip to Britain), attracts admiring youthful crowds on the campaign trail.  The prominence of generational issues in the election reflects the divergent fortunes of young and old since the 2008 financial crisis. Young workers have had a rough ride since then. Though jobs have been plentiful, real wages for 20-year-olds have fallen. By contrast, real incomes for those who are 60 and older have risen. Austerity has brought cuts in working-age benefits but not to state pensions, which are protected by a “triple lock” ensuring they increase each year by the inflation rate, growth in average earnings, or 2.5 percent – whichever is highest.  Enjoying apparently impregnable support among the retired, May attempted to curry favour among young voters with plans to trim the generosity of state help for the old, including the replacement of the triple lock with a “double lock,” which dropped the 2.5 percent minimum. Her most controversial idea was to get older people to pick up more of their social care bill by drawing down most of their assets, including the value of their homes – deferring payment until after they die. The proposal backfired, as it was instantly dubbed a “dementia tax.” The prime minister was forced into a swift U-turn that did nothing for her supposed “strong and stable” leadership.  Despite May’s misstep over social care and the upsurge of support for Labour, fueled by generational gripes among younger people, most pollsters continue to think that she will win the election even if the scale of such a victory is now quite uncertain. The main reason is that turnout differs by age. There are not just more older people as Britain ages; they are also much more likely to vote. In the Brexit referendum 90 percent of those 65 and older turned out to cast their ballots. This contrasted with 64 percent for people aged 18 to 24 and a similar share for 25 to 39-year-olds.  Different expectations about turnout explain the divergence between polls. Those showing Labour snapping at the heels of the Conservatives assume a high turnout among younger people, based on their declared intentions. By contrast, polls showing the Conservatives comfortably ahead assume that actual turnout will be more in line with past experience.  The generational tension revealed in the election is a taste of what is to come in Britain as the bills for an aging society continue to rise. And the country is not alone. Italy’s general election will pit the incumbent Democratic Party, supported by older voters, against the insurgent Five Star Movement, which appeals to discontented youth. Population aging, the silent force behind so much economic and social change, is transforming politics as well.  About the AuthorPaul Wallace is a London-based writer.

Sterling weakened by nearly 2 cents to $1.27 after the poll suggested May's Conservative Party would not win enough seats in Parliament to take office alone, a result that would plunge domestic politics into turmoil and could delay Brexit talks. Comey told U.S. lawmakers in a congressional hearing he had no doubt that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election but was confident that no votes had been altered. The Dow briefly hit a record intraday high of 21,265.69 during his testimony, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record high after a boost from Yahoo and Nvidia shares. The FTSEurofirst 300 of top European equities briefly hit a three-week low of 1,526.29 after the ECB said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump more stimulus into the region's economy. In reference to Comey's testimony, Jefferies & Co money market economist Thomas Simons said:  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here. So it's not particularly impactful for thinking about... Trump's economic agenda to go through.  MSCI's all-country world equity index was last down 0.08 percent, at 467.24.

Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.04 percent at 1,528.71. May had called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiation, and she been expected to win a larger parliamentary majority.  Theresa May appears to have lost her electoral gamble,  wrote Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments, in a briefing note.  Major risks lie ahead for the pound, and for risk-sensitive assets globally.  Ecb Decision The euro hit its lowest since May 31 against the U.S. dollar, of $1.1196, after the ECB announcement. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.4 percent at 97.143. Oil prices edged lower, with benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude prices hitting respective one-month lows of $47.56 and $45.20 after an unexpected surge in U.S. inventories and the return of more Nigerian crude aggravated concerns about a worldwide glut. Brent crude settled down 20 cents, or 0.42 percent, at $47.86 per barrel. U.S. crude settled down 8 cents, or 0.17 percent, at $45.64 per barrel. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher as investors focused +on next week's expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, with benchmark 10-year yields last at 2.195 percent, compared with 2.180 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar's gains pushed gold prices lower. Spot gold prices were last down 0.6 percent at $1,278.50 an ounce.

What started as a childhood dream of winning the America's Cup has become an obsession to become the first British challenger to lift the  Auld Mug  and bring it  home . Ainslie's first shot at achieving that ended on Thursday, when a team from New Zealand, one of only four countries to have won the cup, beat his Land Rover BAR crew in the semi-final of the 35th America's Cup challenger series in Bermuda. [L8N1J55S7]  We knew it was going to be incredibly tough at the first attempt,  Ainslie told a news briefing after the race.  Ultimately we weren't able to catch up with the existing teams in time,  sailing's most successful Olympian, who is not used to losing, added. He has won the cup before, as tactician with Oracle Team USA in their 2013 comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand. But Ainslie wants to win it for  Queen and country  and under the banner  Bring The Cup Home  set about mounting his own challenge, launching BAR with the aim of doing something British teams have tried and failed to do on some 20 occasions.  From Table to Bermuda Getting an America's Cup boat on the water, let alone competing with Oracle Team USA and Artemis Racing, which are both backed by billionaires, costs tens of millions of dollars.  I couldn't be prouder of the team today ... Three and a half years ago a few of us were sitting around a table in London ... what we have we have achieved today is incredible,  Ainslie said in the televised briefing. Ainslie managed to raise 90 million pounds ($116 million) to fund his campaign, building a massive team headquarters in Portsmouth on the south coast of England. This base looks south across the Solent to where he now lives with his wife the sports presenter Georgie Thompson and daughter Bellatrix in the aptly named village of Seaview. His  commute  to work is either on a high speed ferry or in his own RIB speedboat across the channel where he hopes one day to defend the cup for Britain. To do so he will need to keep bringing the money in. Land Rover BAR has been part funded by wealthy private investors with a passion for sailing, including entrepreneur Keith Mills and Dixons Carphone Chairman Charles Dunstone. Ainslie paid tribute to both men's involvement on Thursday and said that Land Rover was renewing its partnership with BAR to compete for the next America's Cup. Corporate Sponsors In order to succeed, Ainslie has attracted corporate sponsors such as Land Rover, BT, BAE Systems and Siemens who have provided financial backing and technical know-how. One supporter who has set Land Rover BAR apart is Britain's Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, who has sailed with Ainslie and is patron of the 1851 Trust, the charity he has set up to get young people to discover science and technology through sailing. As well as being team principal, skipper, part-time fund-raiser and ambassador, Ainslie has managed to attract an impressive team to the BAR stable, including chief executive Martin Whitmarsh who was previously at McLaren Formula One. On the water he signed up Jono Macbeth, a 44-year-old New Zealander who has three America's Cup wins, as sailing team manager and enlisted Giles Scott as tactician on his catamaran  Rita , the name Ainslie gives to all his racing boats. As ever with Ainslie, no sooner was he back on dry land on Thursday than he was looking to his next challenge.   Already the work is starting on the next campaign ... and we will be that much stronger next time,  he vowed.

American headlines such as that in the New York Times describing the country as “reeling” are wide off the mark. Indeed, mocking such coverage is itself a coping strategy for us. If anything, London and Manchester in particular – like New York after 9/11 – are showing a muscular, communal self-confidence since coming under attack in recent weeks.  As in World War Two, when London and other cities endured the repeated air raids of the Blitz, people are scared but not prepared to show weakness. There’s a robust, almost savage pride in the armed police response that left all three attackers dead within eight minutes of the first emergency call.  By the time police arrived, it now appears that the three knife-wielding militants were being pushed back by customers wielding bottles and chairs. A Romanian baker hit one over the head with a crate. Such tales will stick in British mythology for a long time. Knowing that corner of London, I would expect nothing less.  MORE FROM REUTERS Third London attacker said to have been flagged to UK police Cosby sex assault case: 'America's dad' on trial No one doubts the U.K. is facing a serious problem. With the May 22 Manchester bombing, as well as the vehicle and knife attack in Westminster exactly two months earlier, the tempo of attacks on civilians is now even greater than at the height of Irish Republican Army bombing campaigns in the 1970s and ’80s.  Britons don’t believe America covered itself in glory after the recent attacks. The ludicrous inability of the U.S. national security infrastructure to keep even the most basic operational detail secret after the Manchester bombing provoked widespread frustration amongst both officials and the public.  President Donald Trump’s tweets have hardly helped, particularly his attacks on London’s first Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan. For all the assumptions that the attacks would inflame communal tensions, the opposite may be happening, most particularly in the affected cities.  Sunday night’s Manchester concert, showcasing a range of local and international artists and attendees from across ethnic communities, was a particularly striking show of solidarity.  Some parts of Britain's security response worked well, others less so. Gaps have been identified. There is now a genuine and urgent debate on what to do next, one that will inevitably feed into the U.K. election campaign ahead of polling day on June 8.  Britain’s police might be under-resourced and mostly unarmed, but they have proved amongst the best in the world when it comes to an immediate response. They have been preparing for situations like these since the 2008 Mumbai attacks killed 164 people, and both their training and efforts in refining command-and-control paid off on Saturday night.  That’s not to say there haven’t been oversights elsewhere. Government buildings in places like Whitehall have long been surrounded by bollards, but concrete obstacles were not put in place on London’s most important bridges until Monday morning, more than a day after the attacks. That should have happened sooner.  MORE REUTERS COMMENTARY Armed police officers walk outside Borough Market after an attack left seven dead and dozens injured in central London.Peter NichollsBritish voters are sleepwalking to a painful Brexit What Trump gets wrong about the Middle East In many respects, Britain’s Muslim communities hold the key to stopping assaults claimed by groups like Islamic State, whether carried out by recent British converts, second-generation migrants or anyone else. No one disputes that there have been problems in integration, even if talk of predominantly Muslim “no go areas” in the U.K. remains a gross over-exaggeration.  The good news, however, is that it appears friends and relatives of the attackers in both Manchester and London had already expressed concern about them to the authorities. On Sunday, the Muslim Council of Britain announced a new campaign to ensure that happens more often.  That says something reassuring about Britain’s relationship with its Muslim population. The issue, it seems, is that such reports were not followed up.  People leave the area with their hands up after the June 3 attack near London Bridge.Neil HallIt’s important not to be too judgmental here. Police and security services are invariably overstretched, and inevitably individuals will slip through nets. But we have to do better, particularly when those around an individual are openly telling authorities there is a threat.  This is dangerous territory for Prime Minister Theresa May. As Home Secretary from 2010 until last year, she was responsible for the police and law enforcement – and she is hugely unpopular with rank-and-file officers.  At one conference in 2015, May was told by an award-winning front-line Manchester officer that cuts to community police units would make it much harder to track potential attackers – exactly what  appears to have happened in these assaults. The video has been widely shared in the last two weeks.  A botched snap election campaign was already undermining her position before the latest London attack. An expected landslide victory has evaporated amid U-turns and a bizarre unwillingness to face discussion and debate. Some within her own party are now openly calling for her resignation.  That almost certainly won’t happen. In the last weeks of the election, Britain’s opposition Labour Party has been surging in the polls but it may not have closed the gap.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s greatest weakness  could still be his willingness to talk with the Irish Republican militants who attacked the U.K. 30 years ago. His statements this weekend, however, have been a full throated defense of Britain as an inclusive liberal democracy, pledging greater support for the police and security services.  Even if Corbyn does not win, Labour’s most left-wing manifesto in a generation has proved remarkably popular. Labour mayors Khan in London and Andy Burnham in Manchester have provided firm, inspiring leadership during these attacks, and either could be a future party leader. I wrote last week that opposition to Trump, Putin and extremism in mainland Europe seemed to have given centrist politicians new heart. Something similar may be happening on the British left now, and these attacks will help shape it.  Last Friday afternoon, one of Britain’s former top counterterrorism officials told me that most individuals who join Islamic State or conduct attacks do so because they are desperate for a compelling identity, a path that offers excitement and redemption that they cannot find elsewhere.  The potent public response to the latest attacks sends a different message. It tells would-be assailants they will be swiftly gunned down and dubbed cowards. But it also offers them a real option to find their place in a society that welcomes diversity while venerating crate-throwing bakers, concert-goers and armed response officers.  There will almost certainly be more attacks – or attempts at them. But they will bring the country closer together, not the other way around.  Britain has always relished defining itself as under attack. At times that can be  toxic – as it may yet prove with Brexit. But in my grandparents’ time, that dogged determination held off Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and created the Welfare State. The nation is perfectly capable of producing such greatness again.

Such an offense could be the basis for eventual impeachment proceedings against Trump. But proving obstruction of justice is far from clear-cut, because it hinges on intent, and legal experts differed sharply on whether it might apply to Trump and his dealings with Comey and the FBI probe. Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed that Trump had directed him to drop the FBI's probe into Michael Flynn, who was being investigated as part of a wider investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion by Trump's campaign team. Comey also said he thought Trump fired him last month because he was unhappy with how he was conducting the Russia probe. Marc Kasowitz, Trump's personal lawyer, said after Comey's testimony that  the president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone.  The following describes obstruction of justice and whether Comey's testimony could lead to either a prosecution or impeachment of the president. What is obstruction of justice? There are several state and federal laws that make it crime to interfere with a court case, law enforcement investigation or government administrative proceeding.  To convict someone of obstruction of justice, prosecutors need to show that person intended to interfere with an investigation or proceeding. It does not matter whether the person succeeded or not.  Can a president be charged with obstruction of justice?  The U.S. Constitution does not directly address whether the president can be criminally prosecuted. Many lawyers contend the president is therefore immune from prosecution. But this is an  unresolved legal debate,  said Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School. The constitution does explicitly provide for impeachment of the president for  treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  Congress is free to interpret high crimes and misdemeanors to include obstruction of justice, and it was one of the charges Congress prepared against President Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached. David Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School, said Congress can define obstruction of justice as it sees fit but would likely look to the federal criminal law for guidance.  However, impeachment is a political process that is currently viewed as highly unlikely given Trump's fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress. The process begins in the House of Representatives, which votes to initiate impeachment proceedings much like a grand jury would vote to indict in a criminal case. A vote to impeach requires a simple majority and leads to a Senate trial in which a group of House lawmakers act as prosecutors and the senators serve as a jury. A two-thirds vote is required for conviction, which would result in the removal of the president from office. Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was convicted by the Senate.  Two House Democrats, Representatives Al Green and Brad Sherman, said this week they were drafting what are known as articles of impeachment against Trump. Their effort has gained little traction in Congress and even many Democratic members say the effort is premature. Did Comey's testimony support an obstruction charge?  Comey testified that Trump told him during a Feb. 14 conversation that Flynn was a  good guy  and that he  hoped  Comey could see his  way clear  to dropping the probe into him. Comey told the Senate panel he interpreted the president's statement as a  direction.   Several legal experts said the conversation could be construed as an act of obstruction. They said Trump's intent to interfere with the investigation could be inferred from his conduct, such as telling advisors like Jared Kushner and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Comey's direct boss, to leave the room before the conversation with Comey.  “Asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing,” Wright said. What else might support an obstruction charge against Trump? Laura Donohue, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said Trump's firing of Comey could also constitute obstruction of justice. Though the president has the authority to fire an FBI director, it would be a crime to do so in order to halt the Russia investigation, she said.  Comey's testimony suggested that was the president's intent, said Donohue. “He wanted to scuttle the investigation – it is hard to see it any other way,” she said. Wright also said Trump's comment in a television interview soon after he fired Comey that he had the Russia issue in mind when he dismissed the FBI chief was evidence of his intent.  Comey sidestepped the question when asked on Thursday if he thought that Trump had engaged in obstruction of justice, saying this was a question for Robert Mueller, a former FBI chief appointed by the Justice Department last month as a special counsel to probe the Russia issue.  Why might Trump's conduct fall short of obstruction? Some legal experts said the president could say he was merely vouching for Flynn's character and voicing concerns about how the Russia probe was interfering with his ability to function in office.  Comey made it clear that the president made a request not a demand,  said Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School,  and (Comey) testified that he didn’t accede to it.   Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, also said there were no grounds for obstruction charge against Trump.   This hearing may have hurt the president's feelings but it doesn't hurt his legal case,  he said.  I think the record just moves further away from any credible claim of obstruction of justice.

He's earned it. He's been in this league for a long time, and he's, I think, at the top of his game at the biggest time.  Barring a collapse of epic proportions, Durant will finally become an NBA champion in the coming days and likely be named Finals MVP, less than a year after ripping out the hearts of Oklahoma City fans by leaving the Thunder. That move by the four-times scoring champion drew criticism as it came just weeks after the Warriors denied Durant and the Thunder a trip to last year's Finals by storming back from a 3-1 series deficit. Added to the fact that he joined a Warriors team that won the NBA title in 2015 and followed that up by winning a record 73 games last season before falling to Cleveland in seven games, Durant was considered a villain by many. Durant's current team mates, however, call him unselfish when it comes to understanding how he can impact the game each night.  It took a while for it to kind of reveal itself consistently as the regular season went on,  said Warriors guard Stephen Curry.  But once it clicked and the habits started to become second nature, it was kind of beautiful to watch and an amazing kind of style to play and watch unfold.  Durant hit the game-winning three-pointer in the closing stages of Game Three on Wednesday and the former league MVP said he remains focused on just playing hard.  That's what we always talk about, we all just want to have some fun but play disciplined,  said Durant.  And so that's a battle I'm trying to go through more so than worrying about how I'm playing, how great I'm playing. I'm just trying to be solid for my team mates.

The peso gained after data showed a jump in inflation to an eight-year high, backing expectations of more central bank interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates lift the appeal of the peso to foreign investors.         The peso advanced as far as 18.1625 per dollar, its strongest level since Nov. 9, when Trump's surprise victory drove the currency to a record low on fears he would rip up a trade deal with Mexico.     But the peso bounced back and has been the best-performing major currency this year, up around 14 percent against the dollar as the Trump administration moved toward more constructive talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.     If the peso firms past 18.16, it would be trading at its strongest level since last August.     Meanwhile, Brazil's real firmed after the majority of judges on the country's top electoral court agreed to exclude testimony by executives from conglomerate Odebrecht SA.      The ruling potentially strengthens Temer's assertions that his campaign received no illegal funding when he ran as former leftist President Dilma Rousseff's running mate in 2014.      The court is expected to rule by Friday on whether to annul the election and unseat Temer.     A favorable verdict would back bets that Temer may be able to cut pension spending and reform labor laws, seen as critical to curb growth of public debt and shore up investor trust.

President Donald Trump's ordinarily red-hot Twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, was dormant during the three-hour hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, although another Trump helped carry the mantle. Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, live tweeted throughout Comey's testimony, taking the ex-FBI director to task for his version of what the president told him. Twitter had a field day with other moments of Comey's testimony, including his revelation that he broke a date with his wife in order to have dinner with Trump and his use of the exclamation  Lordy.  Comey's disclosure that the person who leaked his memos of meeting with Trump was a Columbia Law School professor led to a stampede on the school's website, causing it to crash. Here are some highlights of what excited Twitter during the testimony. Son Stands in for Trump Trump Jr. took issue with Comey's comments about whether the president was ordering him to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  Knowing my father for 39 years when he 'orders or tells' you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,  he tweeted.  (here)  Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that,  he concluded, adding the hashtag  #givemeabreak . (here) With his father's Twitter handle silent, @DonaldJTrumpJr became the 10th most mentioned Twitter handle in the Comey conversation, according to social media analysis firm Brandwatch. 'Lordy' One remark in particular from Comey got the Twittersphere buzzing. U.S. President Donald Trump gestures at the Infrastructure Summit with Governors and Mayors at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 8, 2017.Yuri Gripas Lordy, I hope there are tapes,  he told the committee regarding whether Trump had recorded their conversation.  Lordy  quickly became the focus of numerous memes, animated graphics and calls for T-shirts. Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary got into the act, tweeting out the definition of  Lordy  as a word used to  express surprise or strength of feeling.   (here) Twitter said Comey's  Lordy  remark was among the top three most tweeted moments during the testimony.

In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9. During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations,  to sort that out.   I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning,  Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president who he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI Flynn probe. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached by Congress, although his fellow Republicans who control the Senate and House of Representatives have shown little appetite for such a move. Comey did not make major new revelations about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the president's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trump's presidency, especially as the FBI probe has already ensnared not only Flynn but also Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Asked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added,  Again, I take the president's words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.  Comey repeatedly said there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. 'Lies, Plain and Simple' Comey said Trump's administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying that the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.  Those were lies, plain and simple,  Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trump's administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election by discrediting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through the hacking and disclosure of damaging emails and other steps. Russia has denied such interference. The White House as denied any collusion with Moscow. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on.  We're under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever,  he said.  We know how to fight and we will never give up,  Trump added. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey's testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there is no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last year's election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and  asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.  Comey said he shared the memo with a professor at Columbia Law School, a reference to Daniel Richman, who confirmed to Reuters he was the one Comey referred to in his testimony. Kasowitz said that  we will leave it the appropriate authorities  to determine whether Comey's leak  should be investigated along with all those others being investigated.  'Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes' Comey said he did not know if there are tapes of his conversations with Trump but said if so they should be made public.  Lordy, I hope there are tapes,  Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because  I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.  From Capitol Hill to San Francisco's Castro district, Comey's appearance attracted television  watch parties  beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the  Super Bowl of Washington.  U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comey's testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trump's presidency. Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, who the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Sergei Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the president's request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trump's position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation.  Yes,  Comey replied. Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said.  He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way,  she said. Comey's testimony drew new attention to Sessions and his contacts with Kislyak. Comey said he did not discuss Trump's pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with Sessions because the FBI leadership team believed the attorney general would later recuse himself from the Russia probe.  We were also aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,  Comey said, without giving more details. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding,  I'll just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.

Many growers who were finished planting the corn they will harvest this autumn took advantage of steep gains to sell supplies remaining from last year. Massive global corn stockpiles kept prices below the cost of production for much of this year for many growers while stubborn farmers holding on to their grain squeezed profit margins for processors that turn corn into feed and the biofuel ethanol.     Kirk Leifer, who grows corn in southern Illinois, said he sold about 10 percent of last year's harvest this week when futures hit $3.87 and $3.90 per bushel.  It's a good bit above our break-even and we're making some money,  Leifer said, adding he held off on sales for months as futures traded in a relatively narrow range.     Chicago Board of Trade corn futures hit $3.91-3/4 per bushel, the highest level since June 28, 2016, before settling 1 cent higher at $3.85-3/4. That is up from corn's roughly seven-year low of $3.01 reached last August.     Corn futures trading volume surged to a record 1.091 million contracts on Wednesday and Thursday's volume was estimated at a robust 776,442 contracts, according to the CME Group. [CBOT/VOL] [VOL/CBOT] Volumes soared as commercial grain handlers sold futures to hedge new long positions in physical supplies while speculative investors were buying back earlier short bets on worries that hot temperatures forecast later this week could stress young corn plants in the Midwestern crop belt, traders said.  We wrote more ticket orders yesterday than we wrote in the entire month of May ... And sales are still heavy today,  Diana Klemme, a broker at Grain Services Corp, said by phone. Klemme said ethanol plants and corn rail shippers slashed bids to buy from farmers, reflecting the increased sales. Some corn end users now have bought enough corn to last through July, potentially limiting further gains in prices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will update U.S. corn stockpile totals on June 30. U.S. corn supplies as of March 1 were a record 8.616 billion bushels, up from 7.822 billion in 2016, USDA said.

This much is certain. But if they are going to climb above the .500 mark to stay and make a realistic push toward the postseason, the Reds need consistent outings from their starting pitchers.  As good as we are offensively, we can't win slugfests often enough,  said manager Bryan Price. This week's four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals showed just how good the Reds could be if their starting pitching holds up. On Thursday afternoon, Joey Votto belted a two-run homer to highlight a 4-for-4 performance as Cincinnati completed its sweep of the Cardinals with a 5-2 victory at Great American Ball Park. Scott Feldman (5-4) pitched a gem for the Reds (29-30), allowing only four hits with no walks and four strikeouts through seven innings. This after right-hander Tim Adleman allowed a run over seven innings on Tuesday. By the end of June, the Reds expect to have injured starters Brandon Finnegan and Homer Bailey back in the rotation.  The way that we're capable of scoring runs, if we can keep the team in the game like we did in this series, good things are going to happen,  Feldman said.  Got to give the guys in our lineup credit. Makes our job all that more important to just limit the damage because we know our guys can really swing the bats.  Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at RedsSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchThe Reds swept the Cardinals in a four-game series for the first time since May 5-8, 2003, barely a month after Great American Ball Park opened.  All-around, a great series,  Price said.  This group is chasing wins, not (individual) numbers.  Adam Duvall, batting fourth behind Votto on Thursday, went 3-for-4 with a double and an RBI. Matt Carpenter hit a two-run home run for St. Louis (26-32), which now has lost a season-high seven straight games for the first time since 2013. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny lamented his team's lack of execution throughout the four-game series. During the Reds' three-run fifth inning on Thursday, St. Louis missed a cutoff man, and a high throw from catcher Yadier Molina on a stolen base attempt sailed into center allowing a run to score.  We've had lots of messages, and the message is be consistent,  Matheny said.  When you go through this stuff ... the first place you look is in the mirror, figure out what each and every one of us can do better. We've got a lot of guys who have been through runs like this. This is baseball. It's heavy right now, there's no doubt. We're going to snap out of this.  Raisel Iglesias struck out two in the ninth to earn his 12th save. Feldman retired the first nine batters he faced before Carpenter led off the fourth inning with a single. Feldman then retired three straight batters to strand Carpenter at third. Cardinals starter Mike Leake walked a tightrope through the first four innings, with Cincinnati collecting seven hits and a walk but no runs. The Reds had the bases loaded with one out in the fourth before Billy Hamilton grounded to Carpenter, who stepped on first then threw home where Scooter Gennett was tagged out to complete an inning-ending double play. Cincinnati finally broke through against Leake in the fifth. The combination of Votto and Duvall combined to go 6-for-6 through the first five innings. Duvall's one-out double in the fifth drove home Votto to put the Reds ahead. Gennett then delivered an RBI single to make the score 2-0.  I thought I had pretty decent stuff,  Leake said.  They were putting the ball in play, finding some holes here and there. Being able to make a pitch when I needed to was big today.  Leake (5-5) allowed two earned runs on 10 hits through five innings. Votto's two-run home run on the first pitch he saw from Tyler Lyons made the score 5-0 in the sixth. It was his 16th home run of the season, with seven coming on the first pitch. The series featured Gennett's historic four-homer night on Tuesday, Patrick Kivlehan's three-run pinch-hit home run to tie the score in Wednesday's win, and Votto's four-hit performance Thursday. But, was it a turning point for the Reds?  It's really early in the season,  Votto said.  We've had some good stretches so far. I don't know, we'll see.  NOTES: Reds LHP Brandon Finnegan will start for Double-A Pensacola on Sunday. He has been on the disabled list since April 16 with a left shoulder injury. ... The Reds do not expect RHP Anthony DeSclafani (elbow) to throw off the mound until late June and not likely to return until early August. ... Cardinals CF Dexter Fowler batted second, snapping his streak of 240 consecutive starts as a leadoff hitter. The last time he didn't bat leadoff was July 6, 2015. He went 0-for-4 with a strikeout.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-reds-writethru-idUSMTZED688TFH4B"},

Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. Comey said Trump pressured him to drop an investigation of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and told Comey that he needed his loyalty even though FBI directors are supposed to work independently from the White House. Trump did not directly comment on the allegations, but his personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, tried to discredit Comey's testimony.  The president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone,  Kasowitz said in a brief appearance before television cameras.  The president also never told Mr. Comey, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' He never said it in form and he never said it in substance.  Kasowitz said Comey's testimony made it clear that Trump was not being investigated for collusion with Russian officials and that the president felt  completely vindicated.  The attorney also attacked Comey for testifying that he used a friend to leak to a reporter his notes on a meeting with Trump. Kasowitz said the leak contained  privileged communications with the president.   We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether these leaks should be investigated along with all the others that are being investigated,  Kasowitz said. Legal experts questioned Kasowitz's contention that Trump's private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications. Comey said he had hoped the leak would prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Kasowitz is playing a lead role in handling Trump's responses to the Russia investigation.

The armed drone  hit dirt  and there were no injuries or  damage done to the coalition patrol in southern Syria. But U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, told reporters the drone meant to attack them and dismissed the possibility it had fired a warning shot.  This clearly showed a threat even if it were a warning shot; it was something that showed a hostile intent, a hostile action and posed a threat to our forces because this drone still had munitions that were still on it,  Dillon said. He added that it was the first known time that pro-Syrian government forces had fired at coalition forces in the area. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the munition landed a few hundred yards from coalition forces and failed to explode. The official added that a U.S. F-15 fighter jet was used to strike the drone, which was likely Iranian-made but that further analysis was being carried out.  Dillon said the United States had earlier in the day carried out a strike against two pro-Syrian government pick-up trucks with weapons that had moved against U.S.-backed fighters near the southern town of At Tanf.  It was the third such strike, and the second this week, by the Pentagon, which has sought to stay out of Syria's civil war to focus firepower instead on Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  The concern is that such strikes could take away attention from the fight against Islamic State militants.  Unfortunately, there have been (these) incidents that have taken our focus away from fighting ISIS,  Dillon said, using an acronym for Islamic State.   The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) launched their assault to capture Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto Syrian capital. For months, air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition have helped them encircle Raqqa, which Islamic State seized in 2014 and has used as a base to plan attacks abroad. On Tuesday, the United States launched an air strike against Iranian-backed fighters who it said posed a threat to U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in southern Syria. A military alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad threatened on Wednesday to hit U.S. positions in Syria, warning its  self-restraint  over U.S. air strikes would end if Washington crossed  red lines . In recent days, the U.S. military has repeatedly warned massing forces to stay away from a 'deconfliction zone' near a garrison used by American special forces and U.S.-backed fighters around At Tanf. The zone was agreed with Russia, Syrian President Bashar al Assad's ally. Assad is also backed by Iran and Shi'ite militias.     Tanf is part of a region known as the Badia, a vast, sparsely populated desert territory that stretches to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders and was declared a military priority by Syria's foreign minister in May.

After careful consideration, the agency is seeking removal based on its concern that the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks,  the agency said in a statement. The move comes after a panel of advisers concluded in March that the benefits of Opana ER, which was approved in 2006 and reformulated in 2012 to resist abuse, did not outweigh the risks. While nasal abuse rates fell, the rate of intravenous abuse increased. The withdrawal marks the first time the agency taken steps to remove an opioid pain medication due to the public health implications and comes amid an intense national debate about the abuse of opioids. Opioids were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015 and opioid overdoses have quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  We are facing an opioid epidemic - a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA's newly appointed commissioner said in a statement. Opana ER has also been associated with a serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C, the agency said, as well as a serious blood disorder known as thrombotic microangiopathy. The move coincides with a lawsuit filed on May 31 against the pharmaceutical industry by Ohio, charging that a number of companies, including Endo, Purdue Pharma, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Johnson & Johnson and Allergan Plc conducted misleading marketing campaigns that downplayed the drugs' addictiveness. Some other states and cities have filed similar lawsuits. Gottlieb said the agency will  continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product's risks outweigh its benefits, not only for its intended patient population but also in regard to its potential for misuse and abuse.

Poloz said he is comforted by recent signs of economic strength even as the central bank warned that rising consumer debt levels and an unbalanced housing market have raised household vulnerabilities.                   It seems as if the market is still having a hard time coming to grips with a tone that seems to be more constructive,  said Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins.

The steady profile for the currency came ahead of Canada's employment report for May due out on Friday.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell again on Thursday, with a sell-off continuing the day after data showed a surprise surge in U.S. crude inventories.

The U.S. dollar        held onto gains against a basket of currencies as investors took stock of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to the U.S. Senate, while the euro weakened after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold.                  Canadian housing starts dipped in May as construction intentions fell in Toronto, another sign that one of the country's hottest real estate markets might be cooling down.

Key Points:     * Comey said Trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a great job. * Comey said administration chose to defame him and FBI by saying organization was in disarray. Comey said  those were lies, plain and simple'.  * Comey said he has no doubt Russia interfered with U.S. election. Comey says he is confident no votes cast in 2016 election were altered * Comey says it is not for him to say whether Trump tried to obstruct justice in their conversations * Comey says found conversations with Trump very disturbing * Comey says Trump did not ask him to stop Russia investigation * Comey says FBI became aware of Russia cyber intrusion in late summer of 2015 Reaction: SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI:  From the statement released yesterday, just from the headlines, it sounded like it was pretty benign, so the action in the market, not just so far today, but in general over the last couple of months is the market certainly doesn't think there's going to be much that comes out of this, and I think largely that's because if there was something that's going to come out, as leaky as things seem to be, we would have heard something more than what we've been hearing so far.  So I think the market thinks that's the likely outcome.  JOHN CANAVAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY “He didn’t offer that much that was new. He confirmed all the previously reported concerns. Concerns about the interactions (between Comey and Trump) remain. There was a very muted market response.   It leaves us where we were before. It becomes that much more difficult for the Trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package. Anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected. You are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018, possibly in 2019.   A lot of the initial euphoria for strong fiscal stimulus has already been unwound, primarily in the bond market. Even without fiscal stimulus, the economy would be able to maintain its current momentum. We are looking for steady growth next year. In our view, this would allow the Fed to raise next week and likely one more time this year either in September or in December.   DAN SCAVINO JR., WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL MEDIA, ON VERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNT “Sorry Dems- nothing here. No votes were altered by Russians in the 2016 election. POTUS or team NEVER asked to stop election investigation.” ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT WUNDERLICH SECURITIES IN NEW YORK  To the extent it doesn't seem to be a 'gottcha' moment here, the market's plodding along.”  Unless something comes out that's outside the realm of the expected, that's what we should expect. I wouldn't say the market's taking action either way here.   The market looked at this as one of three major events today. Along with this you've got the ECB and the UK election. It's a pretty catalyst filled day.   It feels like Comey is pretty good at staying in the middle of the fairway in his responses.   If they haven't been able to tease anything out of him in the first two hours they're probably not going to get more. I think the market is looking at this as a non-market moving event much like the ECB meeting was.   THOMAS SIMONS, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFRIES & CO., NEW YORK “(The testimony) doesn’t appear to be super substantive. My read on the prepared remarks yesterday was that there was nothing particularly stirring there.   I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here that there has been any illegal activity by high-ranking officials, so it’s not particularly impactful for thinking about the impact for Trump’s economic agenda to go through or anything like that.   JON ADAMS, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO. “We would need to see more evidence as far as explicit direction from the president for there to be a more significant market reaction. We’ve been worried about complacency in the market around political risk as investors have become immune to the daily noise out of Washington. We ask ‘does this impact economic growth or earnings growth?’, and so far the answer is no to both of those questions.”  OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN WASHINGTON.  So far we haven't had any major surprises or any kind of bombshells released. The dollar-yen ran up a little bit as the testimony got underway, suggesting a little bit of a relief on the fact that we are not likely to get a smoking gun from James Comey that we did not already know.  We are not likely to get any new revelation that suggests that the President's behavior was anything other than  maybe inappropriate and certainly likely fell short of the bar for obstruction of justice.  Outside of a little bit of a move higher in dollar-yen, there's really not much that is going on.    STEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO  “It’s the James Comey show. Nobody cares. None of this is going to matter. The Republicans are going to say there is nothing to see here, move along. There is no ‘there,’ there, in my opinion, which is why stocks aren’t reacting.... At best what we have here is a president who has zero political experience probably said something he shouldn’t have said. I don’t see it becoming a bigger issue.   I don’t think this is going to move any needle in any direction. It’s not significant enough that the Republicans are going to bail on Trump and the Democrats are going to make a lot of noise about it. But at the end of the day people care about unemployment, job growth and more important issues than this, in my opinion.” BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT BB&T; WEALTH MANAGEMENT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA  The hearings should be mostly a non-event for stocks unless there is some kind of unforeseen 'smoking gun' either way – detrimental to the president or beneficial to him.   Because the president did not invoke executive privilege, it raises the likelihood that nothing happens during the hearings; i.e., there is nothing secret or detrimental to keep out of the hearings.   Separately, it looks like the market is looking for excuses to go higher as it dances around all-time highs.  Earnings are rising, rates are falling (supporting higher PEs), and the technical indicators show the market in an uptrend, so if the hearings maintain the status quo, it could move money off the sidelines into stocks.  TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SEAPORT GLOBAL HOLDINGS, NEW YORK: “At the end of the day, former FBI Director Comey hasn't really revealed anything new, in my view, so bond prices are either treading water to heading lower.” DONALD TRUMP JR., SON OF U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ON VERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNT “Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that. #givemeabreak” FAIZA PATEL, CO-DIRECTOR, LIBERTY & NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM AT THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE IN NEW YORK CITY “Comey's notes will be very useful for Mueller. They are detailed, close in time notes so will carry weight, even potentially legal weight. They were made before Comey was fired and so he had no grudge against Trump when he wrote them.” ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MA  “Nothing I’ve heard so far changes my view that the president did not obstruct justice.” LAURA DONOHUE, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER, PROFESSOR OF LAW, WASHINGTON D.C. “If the President directed Comey to drop the investigation, with an improper purpose, then it is a violation of the law.” “TIM KAINE, DEMOCRATIC US. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA, ON VERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNT “Trump and his team brought their own cloud in with them. It’s not the investigation that’s the cloud. It’s their own actions.  #ComeyDay” TERRY SANDVEN, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST AT U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS. “Today is about Washington and the drama surrounding former FBI director James Comey's testimony and the talk about the demise of President Trump's presidency or growth agenda seems premature, short of a smoking gun.  I think after today's testimony, focus will quickly shift back to his pro-growth agenda, mainly less regulation, tax reform, healthcare reform and infrastructure spending.  But clearly all eyes are on Washington and I expect equities to generally trend sideways today short of any new revelations coming out of the testimony.” STOCKS: Stocks were little changed as Comey's testimony kicked off, trading slightly lower-to-flat, then moved slightly ahead.   BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices were lower ahead of Comey's testimony and pared losses as he testified.  FOREX: The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies and then pared gains slightly as Comey's testimony began.

Maduro, 54, who calls himself the  son  of Chavez and guarantor of his late mentor's socialist ideals, has cast the constituent assembly plan as the way to restore peace after two months of anti-government unrest that has killed 67 people. Critics, including some traditional government supporters, have said there is no need to rewrite the constitution reformed by Chavez in 1999, and insist that a referendum should be held to determine if the country wants such an assembly.  I think with this (assembly) we are destroying President Chavez's legacy,  Luisa Ortega, the prosecutor who broke with Maduro several weeks ago, said outside the Supreme Court.  Chavez ruled Venezuela from 1999-2013, winning a plethora of elections due to his oil-fueled social welfare policies, charisma, and connection with the poor. He is still revered by many, though critics argue that his populist policies are the base for the current economic meltdown.  Opposition leaders are calling for a general election to settle Venezuela's crisis. They have said that the assembly plan is a sham with skewed rules to ensure the socialists remain in power.  A woman reacts at the place where 17-year-old demonstrator Neomar Lander died during riots at a rally against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, June 8, 2017. The sign reads:  Neomar, entertainer for ever .Ivan Alvarado A constituent (assembly) behind the backs of the people cannot be,  Ortega added, also denouncing the  ferocious repression  of anti-Maduro protests.   Those opposed to the assembly are called traitors, fascists, terrorists - we cannot live in a country like that,  Ortega said.  Slideshow (2 Images)The pro-government Supreme Court has already shot down one appeal against the constituent process lodged by Ortega, the highest-profile dissenter from within government since the protests started in April. On Thursday, she asked the court to block the constituent process put in place by Maduro and the national election board. Opposition protesters have been on the streets near-daily for more than two months demanding elections, foreign humanitarian aid, freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, and autonomy for the opposition-controlled National Assembly.  They call Maduro a dictator who has wrecked the OPEC nation's economy. The 54-year-old president says they are right-wing  fascists  seeking a coup. The latest fatality from the unrest was 17-year-old protester Neomar Lander, who died during clashes with security forces in Caracas on Wednesday.

Japanese core consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in Aprilfrom a year earlier, as companies remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away price-sensitive households. Wage growth also remains tame, dashing central bankers' hopes that a tightening job market will lead to higher wages and give households more income to spend.  There is still a long way to go until the price stability target of 2 percent is achieved,  Kuroda said in a speech in Oxford, England. Part of the problem is the size of Japan's elderly population. Kuroda noted that about one-third of the population are pensioners, who are less keen to see prices rising and eating into the value of their pension payments.  This is certainly a challenge,  he said. But the main downward pressure on Japanese inflation had come from falling global oil prices, he said, adding that the global economy had remained weak in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008.  The performance of the global economy has been by no means satisfactory,  he said. Kuroda defended the central bank's so-called  quantitative and qualitative easing  program of heavy asset buying, saying it had helped stabilize inflation expectations.  QQE has produced its intended effects,  he said. After three years of the program failed to lift inflation significantly, the BOJ reframed its policy goal last year to one capping long-term interest rates from one targeting the pace of money printing. Under the new framework, the BOJ guides short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and 10-year bond yields around zero percent. It also maintains its pledge to increase its bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen.

HCR, which accounts for nearly all of Quality Care's revenues, failed to make a full rent payment in June. It owes about $300 million in past rent, the landlord said in a regulatory filing. Quality Care said it is asking lenders for a term loan of up to $400 million and a $100 million letter of credit to refinance current debt and provide working capital. The company said it hoped to have a commitment by June 15. Moody's downgraded Quality Care on Tuesday and put the rating on review given uncertainty surrounding its ability to reach an out-of-court restructuring deal with HCR. HCR ManorCare could not be reached for comment. On Wednesday, the company said in a statement on its website that it has been renegotiating its master lease agreement for several months and remains committed to high-quality patient care.   HCR's leadership team continues to vigorously work to get this issue resolved to the benefit of our company and those we serve,  the company said. Quality Care Properties was spun off of HCP Inc (HCP.N), a large healthcare real estate investment trust or REIT, in 2016 as HCR ManorCare was in decline.  Private equity firm Carlyle Group bought HCR ManorCare in a 2007 leveraged buyout for $6.3 billion and sold the properties to HCP for $6.1 billion in 2010. U.S. nursing homes have struggled to reconcile declining reimbursements with increasing costs for medical supplies, insurance, aging buildings and litigation.   Most of the challenges of HCR have been similar to those facing their peers, but HCR's ability to address them has been hampered by the amount of leverage from the LBO,  said Fitch analyst Britton Costa. Quality Care would have to give up its REIT status, which provides favorable tax treatment, but buying HCR would give it a better chance for expanding in the healthcare industry.  Given Quality Care's restricted cash flow, a deal to become an owner and operator with HCR makes sense to enable strategic growth,  said Matthew Caine, managing director of SOLIC Capital Advisors. In addition to operating low-margin skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, HCR also runs memory care communities, outpatient rehabilitation clinics and home health care agencies, which are considered areas for growth.

The settlement announced by California's Department of Insurance on Thursday resolves charges that Applied Underwriters Inc and California Insurance Co steered prospective customers to unapproved or unexpectedly costly policies, using  illegal side agreements  that exposed policyholders to greater risks. California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones had last June halted the Berkshire units' sale of unapproved  EquityComp  policies after finding that one policy subjected Shasta Linen Supply Inc, a Sacramento employer of 63 people, to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra costs. Vermont and Wisconsin regulators enacted bans of similar products in those states. Thursday's settlement allows the resumption of EquityComp sales in California, provided that companies can absorb their risks, Jones said in a statement.  This is a significant victory in protecting California businesses from sophisticated bait and switch marketing tactics,  Jones said.  We have gone to the limit of our authority over workers' compensation insurance products in winning concessions that eliminate oppressive contract terms.  Jeff Silver, general counsel of Applied Underwriters, said in a statement the accord provides  certainty  that EquityComp is  fit for the marketplace. We are pleased to now resume selling this product in California.  Workers' compensation insurance typically covers lost wages and medical costs for employees injured on the job. The case put a spotlight on lesser-known parts of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's insurance operations, which also include the Geico car insurer, the General Re reinsurer and a business that protects against large and unusual risks.

The financials group climbed 1 percent after the Bank of Canada said the recent liquidity strain at Home Capital Group Inc was specific to that company and that the broader alternative lending system works.  I think people took some confidence from the comments suggesting the central bank sees Home Capital as an isolated occurrence and still considers the underlying financial system to be fairly robust,  said Colin Cieszynski, senior market analyst at CMC Markets Canada. Bank of Nova Scotia rose 1.6 percent to C$77.85 and Toronto-Dominion Bank added 1.2 percent to C$65.06. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc also added to the positive sentiment, jumping 9.4 percent to C$17.96 after saying it would sell its iNova Pharmaceuticals business for $930 million as part of a debt reduction plan. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed up 50.95 points, or 0.33 percent, at 15,423.09. Six of its 10 main sectors slipped, although advancers outnumbered declining stocks by a ratio of 1.3 to 1. Gold miners were among the heaviest weights, falling as investors assessed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony as containing no significant surprises. Gold futures fell 1.0 percent to $1,277.1 an ounce, while Barrick Gold Corp fell 1.5 percent to C$22.45 and Goldcorp lost 2 percent to C$18.48. Eldorado Gold Corp slumped 9.4 percent to C$3.85 after Greece said it would take the miner to arbitration over a gold mining investment. Base metals miners jumped as copper prices advanced 2.2 percent to $5,746.50 a tonne after better-than-expected Chinese economic data allayed some concerns about oversupply. First Quantum Minerals Ltd jumped 7.7 percent to C$11.75.  It tends to have some big swings off commodity prices, that's not unheard of for them,  Cieszynski said. Teck Resources Ltd gained 3.6 percent to C$24.50, while Hudbay Minerals jumped 10.9 percent to C$7.40 after receiving a permit to move forward with a copper project in Arizona. ECN Capital Corp ended up 3 percent at C$3.76 after the commercial financing company said it would buy U.S.-based Service Finance Holdings LLC for C$410 million ($304 million) in cash.

Stanford University and Georgetown University business schools are planning to offer  fintech  courses for MBA students for the first time this fall. New York University is planning a new course for undergraduates after launching a fintech specialization in its business school last year. They join the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Columbia University's business school and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Sloan School of Management, which all launched similar programs in recent years. The new courses are being driven by student demand, officials from those universities told Reuters in interviews. A number of prominent startups have exploded onto the fintech scene in recent years, fostering interest in mobile payment apps like Venmo, digital loan platforms like SoFi and robotic wealth managers like Betterment.  Ten years ago everyone wanted to go into investment banking or in the trading side,  said Reena Aggarwal, Director of the Georgetown Center for Financial Markets and Policy.  Now the students are much more interested in innovation.  NYU's undergraduate course, for instance, attracted enrollments from twice as many students as expected. But the burgeoning industry is so diverse that academics said it is difficult to construct a syllabus for financial technology 101. There are no textbooks and few professors have fintech expertise.  For fintech, some people mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; some people mean the technology JPMorgan uses for trading,  said Angela Lee, Columbia Business School's chief innovation officer.  Everyone thinks it's sexy, and a lot of people use it colloquially without knowing what it is.  Instead of developing traditional syllabuses, universities have been teaching students how markets are disrupted by new technology, helping them develop business ideas or offering classes on narrower topics. For instance, MIT taught a course on blockchain, the technology that first emerged as a system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin. Stanford's course will focus on financial inclusion, or designing affordable products and services for disadvantaged customers, said Kenneth Singleton, a management professor who will teach the class. Universities have also invited financial technology executives to lecture.  There is no ready-made teaching material that you can put together,  Antoinette Schoar, a professor of finance at MIT Sloan, said in an interview.  You have to try your own curriculum or develop real life cases.  Those involved with the programs said learning about fintech can help students' careers, whether they join traditional Wall Street firms or launch their own companies. They said it has also helped attract high-quality students. One Wharton student, David Gogel, enrolled after developing an interest in fintech while working at American International Group Inc. He is now co-president of the FinTech Club, one of the largest professional organizations at the school, with 260 members.  Part of the reason I chose Wharton was because of its investment in fintech,  he said in an interview.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-students-fintech-idUSL1N1J529S"},

Ali Kourani, 32, of New York City and Samer El Debek, 27, of Dearborn, Michigan, were arrested on June 1, federal prosecutors in Manhattan announced Thursday. Both have appeared in Manhattan federal court, according to prosecutors. Lawyers for Al Kourani and El Debek could not immediately be reached for comment. In a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday, prosecutors said Kourani attended Hezbollah-sponsored weapons training in Lebanon as a teenager in 2000 before lawfully coming to the United States in 2003. He became a U.S. citizen in 2009, going on to earn a bachelor's and a master's degree, the complaint said. Prosecutors said Kourani worked for Hezbollah while in the United States, identifying potential weapon suppliers; identifying people affiliated with the military of Israel, Hezbollah's adversary; and gathering information about U.S. airport security and about military and law enforcement facilities in New York City. They said Kourani received additional weapons training, including on a 2011 trip to Lebanon. In a separate criminal complaint, prosecutors said El Debek, a U.S. citizen, was recruited by Hezbollah in 2007 or 2008 and began taking a salary from the organization. Over the years, prosecutors said, El Debek received weapons training, including in bomb-making. They said he carried out missions for Hezbollah in Thailand to clean up materials used to make explosives that had been left behind in a house, and in Panama, where he gathered information about security and the Panama Canal and Israeli Embassy. Both men, who remain in custody, are charged with providing material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy, and illegal weapons possession. Hezbollah, a Shi'ite group aligned with Iran and the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 1997.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, whose rulings were upheld on appeal, oversaw the cases that pitted the successive governments of Presidents Nestor Kirchner and then his wife Cristina Fernandez against creditors, including billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer's Elliott Management. Daniel Pollack, whom Griesa in June 2014 appointed Special Master in the case to facilitate a negotiated settlement between the parties, said the judge had surgery as the result of an accident on Saturday.  Judge Griesa made an enormous contribution to the resolution of the Argentine debt litigation and it will be remembered as one of the great achievements of his career. It has been an honor for me to work with him as Special Master on the Argentina cases,  Pollack said. Griesa, the former chief judge for the Southern District of New York, is 86 years old. The Argentina cases, as well as some others on Griesa's docket, were reassigned to Judge Loretta Preska. A court official declined to comment on Griesa's health status, but emailed a response to a Reuters query saying:  Judge Griesa has not left the bench and is still a Senior United States District Judge.  Creditors who held out from two prior government debt restructuring offers in 2005 and 2010 finally agreed to a multibillion-dollar settlement in the early days of President Mauricio Macri's administration in February 2016. This effectively ended the long-standing dispute and allowed Argentina, which defaulted on roughly $100 billion in sovereign debt in early 2002, to re-enter the international capital markets. According to Pollack, the government estimates that nearly 98 percent of all holdout creditors have agreed to settlements.

In an internal memo announcing Zames' departure, Dimon thanked him for his 13 years of service but did not say why he was going. A person familiar with the matter said Zames, who did not return a call seeking comment, wanted to run a company on his own and saw JPMorgan's upper management ranks as too crowded. The exit stirs up, once again, one of Wall Street's favorite parlor games - trying to work out who will succeed Dimon, 61, at the helm of the largest U.S. bank. At 46, Zames was the youngest of the six contenders and had the advantage of knowing all segments of the bank, after overseeing areas including cyber security, technology and real estate. Zames also played a central role in keeping the bank stable amid financial turmoil. He helped stabilize Bear Stearns, after JPMorgan acquired the investment bank during the 2007-2009 crisis, and transformed JPMorgan's chief investment office and treasury arm after the so-called  London Whale  scandal in 2012. More recently, he was focused on critical technology and cyber functions.   While I am sad to see him leave, I respect his decision and all he has done for JPMorgan Chase,  said Dimon. In the memo, Dimon detailed a new organizational structure in which the five other potential successors - Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, Corporate and Investment Bank CEO Daniel Pinto, Consumer and Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith, Asset Management CEO Mary Erdoes and Commercial Bank CEO Doug Petno - divvy up Zames' responsibilities. With Dimon showing no inclination to relinquish his role, a raft of potential successors has left the bank in recent years. Many have gone on to lead other institutions, including Barclays PLC (BARC.L) CEO Jes Staley, Standard Chartered PLC (STAN.L) CEO Bill Winters and former Visa Inc (V.N) CEO Charles Scharf. Michael Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, which owns about 6 million JPMorgan shares, said the bank still has lots of highly capable leaders.  They've built up such a high quality bench that a lot of these senior executives are going to be attractive to other companies,  he said. Zames will receive discretionary payments of $4.625 million on Feb. 1, 2018 and $4.5 million a year later. He has agreed not to compete with JPMorgan until Feb. 1, 2018, not to solicit clients for a year after that date and not to hire employees of the bank before Feb. 1, 2020.  Jamie has been a true mentor to me, and it has been a privilege to be a member of his team. I'm confident I will continue to benefit from his guidance and wisdom in the future,  Zames said in the memo.

Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor, setting a June 20 deadline to be in  substantial compliance  with the decrees. Lawyers representing the state's 3 million Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over the state fully funding other priorities, including debt service on bonds and pensions. Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the state's bills, has not offered a  lawful basis  for not paying the Medicaid providers the $2 billion they are owed.  Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this court’s previous orders,  the judge's latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. As a result of the stalemate, Illinois' backlog of unpaid bills reached $14.9 billion this week. Mendoza said the real solution is enacting a budget.  The lack of a budget for the last two years has created a situation in which we now have more court-ordered and state-mandated payments than we have revenues to cover them,  she said in a statement. Tom Yates, executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing Medicaid recipients in court, said more money is being sought at this time to ensure access to medical care, not an immediate payment in full.  I think the talks will have little different tenor now because the judge makes it pretty clear she expects more money to flow to Medicaid providers,  he said.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed what is known as Senate Bill 8 into law on Tuesday and it takes effect from Sept. 1. It also includes a ban on the most common method of second-trimester abortion. Texas is the most-populous Republican-controlled state. Its abortion restrictions have often been fiercely defended by the state's lawyers and copied by other socially conservative states.  Texas legislation on abortion is typically amplified because the state can be a beacon for restrictions nationwide,  said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. The anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, praised Abbott and the legislation, calling it the  most significant pro-life victory  of the regular legislative session. Texas crafted a regulation on fetal tissue disposal last year after it suffered a stinging defeat in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court struck down separate abortion restrictions, which were backed by the state's Republican leaders, regarding doctors and facilities. The Texas fetal tissue regulations were more stringent than regulations in almost every other state, which typically allow aborted fetal tissue to be disposed of in a similar manner as other human tissue, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In January, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin put a temporary halt on the fetal tissue disposal regulation, saying the Texas rule imposed  undue burdens on a woman's right to seek a previability abortion.  After that, the Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill that included the regulation on fetal tissue disposal, with many party leaders saying the measure was necessary to preserve human dignity. Abortion rights providers have said the regulation would require the tissue to be treated differently than other human tissue, add another stigma to abortion and increase costs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/texas-abortion-idUSL1N1J528E"},

On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission named Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin as new co-directors of enforcement.  In an exclusive interview ahead of the formal announcement, the two said they were deeply concerned about cyber threats and see the topic as a major enforcement priority.  The greatest threat to our markets right now is the cyber threat,  said Peikin, who was still wearing a guest badge because he has not yet received his formal SEC credentials yet.  That crosses not just this building, but all over the country.  The SEC has started to see an  uptick  in the number of investigations involving cyber crime, as well as an increase in reports of brokerage account intrusions, Avakian said. As a result, the agency has started gathering statistics about cyber crimes to spot broader market-wide issues. The kinds of cyber crimes the SEC has been noticing range from stealing information for the purpose of insider trading, to breaking into accounts to either steal assets, trade against them or manipulate markets. Last year, for instance, the SEC accused a U.K.-based man with hacking into numerous accounts, placing unauthorized trades and then profiting by trading the same stocks in his own personal account.  I think we will see the cyber threat continue to emerge,  Avakian said. Avakian has been serving as acting director of enforcement since December. It is her second stint at the agency, having rejoined in 2014 after working in private practice at the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. Steve Peikin, co-director of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC),  is shown in this February 11, 2013 handout photo provided June 8, 2017.  Courtesy Sullivan & Cromwell/Handout via REUTERSPeikin, a former federal prosecutor, will join the SEC on June 26 from Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm where newly appointed SEC Chairman Jay Clayton also worked. He has represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Barclays PLC (BARC.L), as well as Michael Coscia, the first person to be criminally convicted under a new law that aims to prevent traders from “spoofing” the market by putting in bids with the intent to cancel them.  The dual enforcement role can help prevent problems by allowing officials to recuse themselves when conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest exist.  During Clayton's confirmation hearing, some lawmakers raised concerns that his prior work at Sullivan & Cromwell could lead him to go easy on Wall Street or create too many recusals that cause the commissioners to deadlock on cases. A similar arrangement was in place under former SEC Chair Mary Jo White and co-enforcement directors Andrew Ceresney and George Canellos. White and Ceresney each came to the SEC from the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. Both Avakian and Peikin stressed that enforcement efforts at the SEC will continue to be  vigorous  and that conflicts will not impede the division's activities.   There is no room for bad actors,  Avakian said. For instance, despite President Donald Trump describing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), an anti-bribery statute, as a  horrible law  that should be changed, the two said they expect the SEC will continue to pursue such cases. They also said they expect the SEC will continue to weigh whether corporate penalties are appropriate in certain cases.  I think it is fair to question whether a particular penalty is actually achieving the result,  Peikin said,  But I wouldn't expect to see...a vacation from corporate fines and penalties.

According to the sources, who requested anonymity since the plan remains private, state officials and financial advisors are deciding on final terms for the sale - an auction to take place in the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Those details include the pricing range for the shares of Cesp, as the utility is known, one of them said. State officials told Reuters last July that improved power-sector regulation under President Michel Temer has increased the allure of a sale.  The long-dormant privatization of Cesp is key for São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin to raise cash to cut an onerous debt burden and kickstart investment ahead of next year's elections. Class B shares, Cesp's most widely traded class of stock, partially reversed earlier losses following the news. The stock fell 0.3 percent to 16.50 reais on Thursday after having shed as much as 2.5 percent in early morning trading. Both the media offices of the state of São Paulo and Cesp declined to comment. The company's stock has climbed about 35 percent since July, when the officials confirmed plans to exit Cesp. The local electricity industry has seen a flurry of takeovers in the past year as longtime shareholders like debt-laden regional governments try to stem the impact of Brazil's harshest recession ever. If São Paulo goes ahead with the sale, it would mark the revival of a plan that stalled 15 years ago in the face of a drought and a power-rationing crisis. São Paulo state, Brazil's wealthiest, hired Banco Fator SA to carry out an appraisal of the fair value of Cesp's stock. The state owns 40.5 percent of Cesp's capital, including 95 percent of the utility's voting stock. A full sale of the state's stake could fetch almost 2 billion reais ($611.5 million), based on current prices and without taking into account any premium, according to Thomson Reuters calculations. Both the federal government and other states are in the process of disposing of power assets for similar reasons.  Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA and Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA plan to divest generation and transmission assets, including their stakes in some of Brazil's largest hydroelectric dams - Santo Antônio and Belo Monte.

Tera Group Inc accused the banks of coordinating a boycott of its seven-year-old TeraExchange platform by refusing both to send it any CDS transactions, and to clear and settle any CDS trades that customers wanted to handle there. It also said the banks used their 95 percent market share to require that trading follow a protocol known as  request for quote,  which Tera described as opaque and inefficient. Tera said this enabled banks to boost profit by keeping traders in the dark about prices, defeating a goal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, while instilling a  great fear of retaliation  against traders who defected to rival platforms.  Faced with Dealer Defendants' unyielding boycott, TeraExchange has been shut out of the CDS market,  Tera said in its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan, which the complaint said control 40 percent of the CDS market, declined to comment. Lawyers for Tera did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tera Group is based in Summit, New Jersey, while TeraExchange is based in New York. The other defendants are Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG , Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc , Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS Group AG. Tera is seeking unspecified damages, which would be tripled if a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act were found. It sued the same 12 banks in April 2016 for allegedly conspiring to block customers from trading interest rate swaps on its platform. That lawsuit was later combined with three similar lawsuits, and that litigation remains pending, court records show. Thursday's case is Tera Group Inc et al v.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others this week severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar, the world's biggest LNG producer, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism. In one of the earliest signs of the effect on the LNG market, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) sent an LNG cargo from the United States to Dubai, shipping data shows, after the United Arab Emirates banned Qatari ships from entering UAE ports. A cluster of 17 LNG tankers are now moored off the coast of the Qatari LNG export facility at Ras Laffan, up from seven on Monday. Gas prices in the United Kingdom spiked on Thursday, with the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) price for July TRGBNBPMN7 up over 4.5 percent after two Qatari tankers that were likely bound for the UK changed course, according to Reuters shipping data.   It is unclear why those tankers shifted movements, though traders said they may be diverted around the continent of Africa rather than transit the Suez Canal, which is where they were expected to go. Traders worry that Egypt might bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal, though it is bound by international treaties not to block the canal. Analysts still do not see an interruption in supply in the LNG market, even with Qatar's role as the world's largest producer.  Only Egypt and the UAE are boycotting Qatari cargos so they are the only countries that might see U.S. volume replace Qatari,  said Theodore Michael, senior LNG analyst at energy data provider Genscape in Boulder, Colorado. Egypt, however, continues to buy LNG from Qatar brought in by Swiss commodity trade houses, like Trafigura, Glencore (GLEN.L) and Vitol, which take ownership of the cargoes at the Qatari port and do not use Qatari ships, analysts and traders said. One source said four tankers were expected to deliver Qatari LNG to Egypt over the next two weeks. Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said the UAE was  exploiting a trading position as a political tool,  noting that about 40 percent of UAE power depends on natural gas from Qatar. As exclusion zones took effect, Qatar's fleet of LNG vessels anchored off the UAE's port in Fujairah prior to the diplomatic cut-off has moved out.  Shell has a deal to supply the Dubai Supply Authority (DUSUP) with LNG which it typically sources from Qatar. But the ban meant it had to source the LNG from elsewhere.  Shell's Maran Gas Amphipolis tanker, carrying around 163,500 cubic meters of LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana, was initially headed toward Kuwait's port of Mina Al-Ahmadi but rerouted Wednesday for Dubai's port of Jebel Ali. The tanker is currently unloading at DUSUP's floating import terminal at Jebel Ali, data showed.   Shell, as the largest LNG trader, would have a high probability of managing some of this,  said Robert Ineson, managing director, global LNG, at IHS Markit in the Houston area.  A shutdown of Qatar's exports, either by pipeline or via LNG, would be highly disruptive to global gas markets. We think this is not likely,  he said. Eben Burnham-Snyder, spokesman at Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), said earlier this week that the company - currently the only supplier of U.S. LNG - will keep sending cargoes around the world. U.S. cargoes can be rerouted based on market conditions.

The Nasdaq Composite posted a record closing high boosted by gains in Nvidia and Yahoo. Traders had been on tenterhooks ahead of Comey's testimony to a Senate committee, his first since being fired by Trump on May 9. His prepared remarks had been made public Wednesday. The market's concern on the issue is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for their agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.

The S&P; 1500 construction and engineering index rose 1.4 percent and a gauge of construction materials' stocks added 1.5 percent.  If there was something (damning) that's going to come out, as leaky as things seem to be, we would have heard something more than what we've been hearing so far,  said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. Also supporting infrastructure stocks, specifically steel companies, was an announcement from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that a national security review of the U.S. steel industry will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers. The S&P; 1500 steel sector index jumped 4.1 percent, the most since April 20. In his statement, Comey said the president lied in describing their encounters and that he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, but was confident that no votes had been altered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.84 points, or 0.04 percent, to end at 21,182.53, the S&P; 500 gained 0.65 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,433.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.38 points, or 0.39 percent, to 6,321.76. Other analysts were not so rosy about the effect of Comey's testimony on the Trump agenda.  It leaves us where we were before. It becomes that much more difficult for the Trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package,  said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey.  Anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected. You are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018, possibly in 2019.  Utilities stocks fell the most on the S&P; 500 as Treasury yields rose, tracking German Bund yields, after the European Central Bank upgraded its growth forecast for the euro zone even as it suggested its stimulus plan will remain in place as inflation remains subdued. The S&P; utilities sector was down 0.88 percent, the most since mid March. Traders kept an eye on the UK as Britons voted in a snap election predicted to give Prime Minister Theresa May a larger parliamentary majority, which she hopes will strengthen her hand in looming divorce talks with the European Union. Among specific stocks, Nordstrom jumped 10.3 percent to $44.63 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private. Alibaba shares were up 13.3 percent to $142.34 after the company said it expects revenue growth of 45 to 49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. Yahoo, which has a 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba, gained 10.2 percent to $55.71. Chipmaker Nvidia jumped 7.3 percent to $159.94 after Citigroup reiterated its bullish view on the stock and said longer term it could hit $300. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 7.07 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.62 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the first to include official numbers from the territory of Puerto Rico, which on Monday declared that its Zika epidemic had ended, based on data showing the number of new cases has fallen. The CDC on Thursday reiterated its recommendation that pregnant women not travel to Puerto Rico, noting that Zika remains a risk for pregnant women there and anywhere else the mosquito-borne virus is active.  Zika virus poses a serious threat to pregnant women,  said CDC Acting Director Dr Anne Schuchat.  Women in the U.S. territories and elsewhere who have continued exposure to mosquitoes carrying Zika are at risk of infection. We must remain vigilant and committed to preventing new Zika infections.  The report reviewed 2,549 cases of women with possible Zika infection who completed their pregnancies, of which 1,508 had confirmed infections. Besides Puerto Rico, the cases came from American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from Jan. 1, 2016, through April 25, 2017. Of these confirmed cases, more than 120 pregnancies, or about 5 percent, resulted in Zika-associated birth defects, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Among the women infected during their first trimester of pregnancy, 8 percent had babies with Zika-associated birth defects. That compared with 15 percent in a prior study of birth defects among women from U.S. states and the District of Colombia, most of whom became infected during travel to Zika-affected countries. The CDC said because the newer report is much larger, the findings are not statistically different. About 5 percent of women infected during their second trimester and about 4 percent infected in their third trimester had babies with Zika-related birth defects, showing the virus remains dangerous throughout a woman's pregnancy. The report represents the largest number of completed pregnancies with lab-confirmed Zika virus infections to date. The CDC had stopped reporting Zika pregnancy outcomes for U.S. territories last fall because not all were using the same case definitions. Puerto Rico has its own Zika pregnancy registry. In its June 2 report, Puerto Rico's health department listed 38 cases of birth defects among more than 3,700 Zika-affected pregnancies.  Peggy Honein, who leads the CDC's Zika pregnancy and birth defects task force, said the CDC in late June will resume regular reporting of the number of completed pregnancies and birth defects from U.S. territories. Honein said in a conference call with reporters that each jurisdiction may keep its own website using its own case definitions, but as of June 22, all U.S. territories will be using the same standard as the CDC case definition for U.S. states and the District of Columbia in the CDC registry. Schuchat said on the call the CDC is paying for the pregnancy registry using emergency funds allocated for Zika last year. She declined to speculate about future funding. The Trump administration has proposed a 17 percent cut in CDC's budget for fiscal 2018, its smallest in 20 years. As mosquito season ramps up in the continental United States, scientists predict local transmission is likely to occur only in the two areas where it was active last year - Miami and Brownsville, Texas. That is because Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are present in those two locations year-round, Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, reported in the journal Nature.

The judge instructed Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Bernstein Liebhard to produce memos they sent to institutional investors that are deciding whether to opt out of a $2 billion settlement with several of the bank defendants in the forex case, as well as the firms’ follow-up email exchanges with a few of those institutions.  Judge Schofield’s order came in response to a motion to compel from class counsel at Scott & Scott and Hausfeld. The class lawyers accused Quinn Emanuel and Bernstein of spreading false information about the settlement in order to bait big institutions to bail on the class action and hire Quinn and Bernstein to bring individual opt-out cases.  As Quinn partner Daniel Brockett told me in a phone interview Thursday, class members have a right to independent advice about whether to participate in or opt out of a class settlement and that Quinn did nothing wrong in sharing its analysis of the class settlement with large, sophisticated institutions.  Quinn Emanuel, according to its opposition to the motion to compel, sent its original memo to eight such institutions, six of which are already Quinn clients. Stanley Bernstein of Bernstein Liebhard additionally distributed the Quinn memo to 15 of his clients. None of the Bernstein clients, according to Brockett, have hired Quinn.  One of them, however, apparently shared the Quinn memo with Scott & Scott, which led to a fight over whether to compel disclosure of the document and its progeny. Ostensibly, class counsel’s motive is to assure that class members are receiving only accurate information about the proposed settlement. Quinn Emanuel’s original memo, according to the motion to compel, was sprinkled with inaccuracies, including the incorrect assertion that the opt-out deadline is in June. (It’s been indefinitely postponed.) Overall, class counsel told Judge Schofield, the memo’s untrue implication was that they had rushed into settlements without adequate leverage against the banks.  Quinn, of course, said it didn’t mean to disparage class counsel but only to highlight the strength of the case against forex defendants. Either way, according to the firm, it would have been within its rights to question the strategy of lawyers for the class. “Sophisticated entities weighing the opt-out decision are entitled to hear candid and confidential views from independent counsel,” Quinn’s filing said. “There is no need for class counsel to intervene to ‘protect’ such entities from hearing any such criticism.” (Quinn Emanuel’s filing also said the firm corrected its mistake about the opt-out deadline in subsequent communications with prospective opt-outs and was committed to providing only accurate information to class members.)  Judge Schofield will be able to figure out whether Quinn was falsely bashing class counsel when she sees the documents in camera. But it seems to me that the real story of the fight over the opt-outs memo is how viciously firms are fighting to represent financial services clients in Europe.  Yes, Europe. The spat over Quinn’s memos to prospective opt-out clients took place in the U.S. forex class action – but if you believe Quinn Emanuel, the subtext is that Scott & Scott, in particular, is hoping to play a big role in forex litigation for clients with European claims. (As you may recall, the U.K. recently changed its laws to make it possible for plaintiffs to band together in antitrust actions like the forex case.) Quinn claims Scott & Scott may actually be on a fishing expedition for contact information on Quinn clients abroad.  By its own admission, Quinn Emanuel is encouraging multinational institutions with big forex damages to seek a “global solution” instead of risking the release of claims in the U.S. class action. It is also scouting for European clients, whose statute of limitations isn’t up for a while. Among its competitors, the firm said in its brief in the U.S. case, is Scott & Scott. “Class counsel (particularly Scott+Scott) has engaged in a sweeping media campaign to market themselves and solicit individual plaintiffs in Europe,” Quinn said in its opposition brief. “The court should not discount the notion that class counsel’s demand for years’ worth of attorney-client communications and work product has less to do about protecting of class members, and more to do with their effort to compete with Quinn Emanuel for business.”  Scott & Scott didn’t deny the competition for European clients in its response to Quinn’s filing, but said the European angle is beside the point. “This dispute is, and always has been, about the misrepresentations made to U.S. class members about the U.S. litigation and settlements,” the brief said.  For now, Judge Schofield is allowing Quinn and Bernstein Liebhard to redact identifying information about client contacts from the communications they turn over to Scott & Scott and Hausfeld. She has called for briefing on whether the firms must disclose followup emails to class counsel and on what the consequences, if any, Quinn and Bernstein should face for contacting prospective opt-outs.  Christopher Burke of Scott & Scott declined a request to comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-quinn-idUSKBN18Z2SV"},

According to the sources, who requested anonymity since the plan remains private, state officials and financial advisors are deciding on final terms for the sale - an auction to take place in the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Those details include the pricing range for the shares of Cesp, as the utility is known, one of them said. State officials told Reuters last July that improved power-sector regulation under President Michel Temer has increased the allure of a sale.  The long-dormant privatization of Cesp is key for São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin to raise cash to cut an onerous debt burden and kickstart investment ahead of next year's elections. Class B shares, Cesp's most widely traded class of stock, partially reversed earlier losses following the news. The stock fell 0.3 percent to 16.50 reais on Thursday after having shed as much as 2.5 percent in early morning trading. Both the media offices of the state of São Paulo and Cesp declined to comment. The company's stock has climbed about 35 percent since July, when the officials confirmed plans to exit Cesp. The local electricity industry has seen a flurry of takeovers in the past year as longtime shareholders like debt-laden regional governments try to stem the impact of Brazil's harshest recession ever. If São Paulo goes ahead with the sale, it would mark the revival of a plan that stalled 15 years ago in the face of a drought and a power-rationing crisis. São Paulo state, Brazil's wealthiest, hired Banco Fator SA to carry out an appraisal of the fair value of Cesp's stock. The state owns 40.5 percent of Cesp's capital, including 95 percent of the utility's voting stock. A full sale of the state's stake could fetch almost 2 billion reais ($611.5 million), based on current prices and without taking into account any premium, according to Thomson Reuters calculations. Both the federal government and other states are in the process of disposing of power assets for similar reasons.  Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA and Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA plan to divest generation and transmission assets, including their stakes in some of Brazil's largest hydroelectric dams - Santo Antônio and Belo Monte.

The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the first to include official numbers from the territory of Puerto Rico, which on Monday declared that its Zika epidemic had ended, based on data showing the number of new cases has fallen. The CDC on Thursday reiterated its recommendation that pregnant women not travel to Puerto Rico, noting that Zika remains a risk for pregnant women there and anywhere else the mosquito-borne virus is active.  Zika virus poses a serious threat to pregnant women,  said CDC Acting Director Dr Anne Schuchat.  Women in the U.S. territories and elsewhere who have continued exposure to mosquitoes carrying Zika are at risk of infection. We must remain vigilant and committed to preventing new Zika infections.  The report reviewed 2,549 cases of women with possible Zika infection who completed their pregnancies, of which 1,508 had confirmed infections. Besides Puerto Rico, the cases came from American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from Jan. 1, 2016, through April 25, 2017. Of these confirmed cases, more than 120 pregnancies, or about 5 percent, resulted in Zika-associated birth defects, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Among the women infected during their first trimester of pregnancy, 8 percent had babies with Zika-associated birth defects. That compared with 15 percent in a prior study of birth defects among women from U.S. states and the District of Colombia, most of whom became infected during travel to Zika-affected countries. The CDC said because the newer report is much larger, the findings are not statistically different. About 5 percent of women infected during their second trimester and about 4 percent infected in their third trimester had babies with Zika-related birth defects, showing the virus remains dangerous throughout a woman's pregnancy. The report represents the largest number of completed pregnancies with lab-confirmed Zika virus infections to date. The CDC had stopped reporting Zika pregnancy outcomes for U.S. territories last fall because not all were using the same case definitions. Puerto Rico has its own Zika pregnancy registry. In its June 2 report, Puerto Rico's health department listed 38 cases of birth defects among more than 3,700 Zika-affected pregnancies.  Peggy Honein, who leads the CDC's Zika pregnancy and birth defects task force, said the CDC in late June will resume regular reporting of the number of completed pregnancies and birth defects from U.S. territories. Honein said in a conference call with reporters that each jurisdiction may keep its own website using its own case definitions, but as of June 22, all U.S. territories will be using the same standard as the CDC case definition for U.S. states and the District of Columbia in the CDC registry. Schuchat said on the call the CDC is paying for the pregnancy registry using emergency funds allocated for Zika last year. She declined to speculate about future funding. The Trump administration has proposed a 17 percent cut in CDC's budget for fiscal 2018, its smallest in 20 years. As mosquito season ramps up in the continental United States, scientists predict local transmission is likely to occur only in the two areas where it was active last year - Miami and Brownsville, Texas. That is because Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are present in those two locations year-round, Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, reported in the journal Nature.

Schulz's rating dropped six percentage points to 36 percent over the past month, the poll showed.  Schulz and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) had hoped to unseat Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in Sept. 24 national elections, but the party has lost momentum after initial gains seen after Schulz took over the party's leadership in January. Merkel's approval rating rose one percentage point to 64 percent in the latest poll, her best showing since August 2015, shortly before she opened the doors to over a million refugees mostly from the Middle East, the pollsters said. In a direct election, 53 percent of Germans said they would vote for Merkel, up four percent from last month, while support for Schulz dropped seven percent to 29 percent, according to the poll of 1,503 eligible voters taken June 7 and 8. The center-left SPD, junior party in Merkel's current right-left coalition, had hoped to form a government on its own with smaller parties. The poll showed Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats winning 38 percent of the vote, a gain of one percent from early May, while the Social Democrats dropped three percentage points to 24 percent.  The pro-business Free Democrats gained two percentage points to 10 percent, while the pro-environment Greens dropped one percentage point to 7 percent, the Left party gained one point to eight percent and the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) dropped one point to 9 percent.

Polisario in May filed a claim to hold the Danish charter vessel Ultra Innovation, carrying 55,000 tonnes of phosphate rock from Morocco's Office Cherifien de Phosphate (OCP),  through Panama to the Port of Vancouver for the Canadian company Agrium. The detention of the vessel was a new legal tactic by the independence movement in its conflict with Morocco over Western Sahara, a disputed territory where the two sides fought a war until a 1991 ceasefire.  The court ruled that a domestic court is not the appropriate venue to consider purely political matters. It also ruled there is indeed no evidence demonstrating that the cargo on board belongs to the plaintiffs,  OCP said in a statement. Panama court authorities were not immediately available for comment to confirm the OCP statement. Polisario said its lawyers were not aware of such a decision. In late May, Panama judicial sources and Agrium said the shipping company posted a bond for the release of the ship. By trying to seize Moroccan phosphate vessels, Polisario had tested a European court ruling last year that Western Sahara should not be considered part of the Moroccan kingdom in EU and Moroccan deals. Polisario said phosphate shipped from the disputed territory does not belong to Morocco. Western Sahara has been disputed since 1975, when Morocco claimed it as part of the kingdom and the Polisario fought a guerrilla war for the Sahrawi people's independence. A 1991 ceasefire split the region in two between what Morocco calls its southern provinces and an area controlled by Polisario. Morocco's OCP is the world's leading phosphate exporter and operates in the Moroccan-held areas. U.N.-backed negotiations have failed for years to end the dispute. Morocco wants the region to have autonomy within Moroccan sovereignty. Polisario wants to hold a referendum on self-determination, including on the question of independence.

New Zealand's 5-2 victory over the British crew led by Ben Ainslie means they progress to the America's Cup challenger play-offs this weekend when they will face either Sweden's Artemis Racing or SoftBank Team Japan. Helmsman Peter Burling thanked his shore team for getting the New Zealand catamaran back to racing condition after it  pitch-poled  in a semi-final race against Ainslie on Tuesday, damaging the hulls and shredding their towering  wing  sail.  We are through into the #LVAC Finals!Thanks for a great battle @LandRoverBAR ! #etnz , the New Zealand team tweeted. The New Zealand crew have been outstanding throughout the 35th America's Cup challenger races in Bermuda's Great Sound, achieving the first 100 percent  flying  time, when the hulls stayed out of the water on foils for the whole race.  Related CoverageSweden level America's Cup sailing semi-final at 3-3 with win over JapanNew Zealand won the first race of the day despite a poor start, piling the pressure on the British team who struggled to match their opponents for speed and stability. Land Rover BAR managed to get away from New Zealand again and this time maintain their lead in the second race, matching their opponents for speed and managing to shake off the stability gremlins which have dogged them previously. But in the final race of the day, Burling got the better start and barely looked back as he left Ainslie in his wake. Both teams have had to overcome problems in their quest to become the challenger to America's Cup holder Oracle Team USA. Land Rover BAR lost two points on the first day of racing when they had a problem with their wing, but managed to get a point back on Tuesday when New Zealand capsized. Ainslie thanked his crew at the end of the last race for the best performances of the competition, but their effort was not enough to fulfil the British dream to  bring the cup home  to Britain, where it was first won in 1851 by the schooner America.  The challenge continues, we will be back stronger. Our goal to win the 36th America's Cup starts today,  Land Rover BAR said on Twitter. In the other semi-final encounter, Sweden's Artemis Racing also managed to keep themselves in the contest, beating SoftBank Team Japan three times in a row to bring the score to 4-3. The last encounter of the day between the Swedish and Japanese teams was decided by a penalty call near the end of race, when Japan's skipper Dean Barker was judged not to have given Nathan Outteridge enough room around a mark.  We knew we had the power and had to keep chipping away, we saw the opportunity and stole the victory,  Outteridge said in televised comments on BT Sport.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others this week severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar, the world's biggest LNG producer, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism. In one of the earliest signs of the effect on the LNG market, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) sent an LNG cargo from the United States to Dubai, shipping data shows, after the United Arab Emirates banned Qatari ships from entering UAE ports. A cluster of 17 LNG tankers are now moored off the coast of the Qatari LNG export facility at Ras Laffan, up from seven on Monday. Gas prices in the United Kingdom spiked on Thursday, with the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) price for July TRGBNBPMN7 up over 4.5 percent after two Qatari tankers that were likely bound for the UK changed course, according to Reuters shipping data.   It is unclear why those tankers shifted movements, though traders said they may be diverted around the continent of Africa rather than transit the Suez Canal, which is where they were expected to go. Traders worry that Egypt might bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal, though it is bound by international treaties not to block the canal. Analysts still do not see an interruption in supply in the LNG market, even with Qatar's role as the world's largest producer.  Only Egypt and the UAE are boycotting Qatari cargos so they are the only countries that might see U.S. volume replace Qatari,  said Theodore Michael, senior LNG analyst at energy data provider Genscape in Boulder, Colorado. Egypt, however, continues to buy LNG from Qatar brought in by Swiss commodity trade houses, like Trafigura, Glencore (GLEN.L) and Vitol, which take ownership of the cargoes at the Qatari port and do not use Qatari ships, analysts and traders said. One source said four tankers were expected to deliver Qatari LNG to Egypt over the next two weeks. Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said the UAE was  exploiting a trading position as a political tool,  noting that about 40 percent of UAE power depends on natural gas from Qatar. As exclusion zones took effect, Qatar's fleet of LNG vessels anchored off the UAE's port in Fujairah prior to the diplomatic cut-off has moved out.  Shell has a deal to supply the Dubai Supply Authority (DUSUP) with LNG which it typically sources from Qatar. But the ban meant it had to source the LNG from elsewhere.  Shell's Maran Gas Amphipolis tanker, carrying around 163,500 cubic meters of LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana, was initially headed toward Kuwait's port of Mina Al-Ahmadi but rerouted Wednesday for Dubai's port of Jebel Ali. The tanker is currently unloading at DUSUP's floating import terminal at Jebel Ali, data showed.   Shell, as the largest LNG trader, would have a high probability of managing some of this,  said Robert Ineson, managing director, global LNG, at IHS Markit in the Houston area.  A shutdown of Qatar's exports, either by pipeline or via LNG, would be highly disruptive to global gas markets. We think this is not likely,  he said. Eben Burnham-Snyder, spokesman at Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), said earlier this week that the company - currently the only supplier of U.S. LNG - will keep sending cargoes around the world. U.S. cargoes can be rerouted based on market conditions.

About 6,000 head of market-ready, or cash, cattle on Wednesday in the northern U.S. Plains brought $135 per cwt, compared to roughly $137 there a week earlier.

Paris and Cairo have nurtured closer economic and military ties in recent years and with the rise to power of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that relationship has improved with both sides concerned by the ongoing political vacuum in Libya and the rise of jihadist groups in Egypt.  Speaking after a day of meetings in Cairo, including with Sisi, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who in his previous role as defense minister had developed a personal relationship with Sisi, said  the two allies had a  common vision  on how to tackle Islamist militants.   We had meetings on fighting terrorism and the stabilization of Libya,  Le Drian said during a meeting with Pope Tawadros II, head of the Egyptian Coptic Orthodox Church.  An attack at the end of May on the Coptic community in the southern city of Menya by Islamist militants killed 29 people.   Egypt is the central element for regional stability and when it sways the whole region sways,  Le Drian said.  Le Drian's visit was the second by a French minister this week. Defence Minister Sylvie Goulard held talks with her Egyptian counterpart on Monday on how to reinforce security cooperation including the best way to enhance monitoring of Egypt's borders.  Diplomats have said that Paris is reviewing its position on the Libyan conflict, with new President Emmanuel Macron deciding to push the issue to the top of his foreign policy agenda.  Libya is a priority for France,  a French diplomat said.  Libya is split between a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, which is loosely supported by militias in the west that includes Islamist groups backed by Turkey and Qatar, and eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, which the United Arab Emirates and Egypt support. The UAE sees Egypt's leadership as a firewall against militants and has given Cairo financial and military support, Western and Arab diplomats say.    We cannot let the situation of instability that is benefiting terrorists and traffickers continue on Egypt's borders and at the gates of Europe continue,  Le Drian told reporters.  Some Western states, including France, have also given Haftar military support to help fight Islamists in Libya's east, but diplomats say that he will ultimately have to sit down and negotiate with the U.N.-backed government of Fayez al-Seraj and militias in the west.  French officials said there was now a growing convergence of views with Egypt and the UAE to push all sides back to the negotiating table, which would see a round of shuttle diplomacy in the coming weeks to form a consensus among the outside players to first push Haftar and Seraj together. The diplomatic row between Qatar and major Arab states including Saudi Arabia and Egypt may also provide an opportunity to pressure western militias, officials said.

Comey told U.S. lawmakers in the congressional hearing he had no doubt that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election but was confident that no votes had been altered. The Dow briefly hit a record intraday high of 21,265.69 during the testimony, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record high after a boost from Yahoo and Nvidia shares. Investors were awaiting the outcome of the UK general election as Britons voted on Thursday in a snap vote predicted to give Prime Minister Theresa May a larger parliamentary majority. The FTSEurofirst 300 of top European equities briefly hit a three-week low of 1,526.29 after the ECB said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump more stimulus into the region's economy. In reference to Comey's testimony, Jefferies & Co money market economist Thomas Simons said:  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.2 percent at 96.967. Oil prices edged lower, with benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude prices hitting respective one-month lows of $47.56 and $45.20 after an unexpected surge in U.S. inventories and the return of more Nigerian crude aggravated concerns about a worldwide glut.  The market is catching its breath after the inventory report which, as far as the oil market was concerned, stunk,  said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Brent crude settled down 20 cents, or 0.42 percent, at $47.86 per barrel. U.S. crude settled down 8 cents, or 0.17 percent, at $45.64 per barrel. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher as investors focused instead on next week's expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, with benchmark 10-year yields last at 2.195 percent compared to 2.180 percent late Wednesday. The dollar's gains pushed gold prices lower. Spot gold prices were last down 0.63 percent at $1,278.30 an ounce.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with the small Gulf Arab state on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran - charges Qatar calls baseless.  Several other countries later followed suit. Would-be mediators including U.S. President Donald Trump and Kuwait's ruling emir have struggled to ease a crisis that Qataris say has led to a blockade of their nation. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar had not yet been presented with a list of demands by countries that cut off diplomatic and transport ties, but insisted the matter be solved peacefully.   We have been isolated because we are successful and progressive. We are a platform for peace,  he told reporters in Doha in a defiant tone.  We are not ready to surrender, and will never be ready to surrender, the independence of our foreign policy,  he said, warning that the dispute threatened the stability of the region. Saudi Arabia's closure of Qatar's only land border sparked fears of major price hikes and food shortages for its population of 2.7 million people, with long queues forming as some supermarkets began running out of stock. With supply chains disrupted and anxiety mounting about deepening economic turbulence, banks and firms in Gulf Arab states were trying to keep business links to Qatar open and avoid a costly firesale of assets.  We're not worried about a food shortage, we're fine. We can live forever like this, we are well prepared,  Sheikh Mohammed said. He said Iran was ready to help with securing food supplies in the emirate, an investment powerhouse and supplier of natural gas to world markets but tiny and reliant on imports. Turkey has meanwhile brought forward a planned troop deployment to Qatar and pledged to provide food and water supplies to its Arab ally, which hosts a Turkish military base. Related CoverageQatar state TV shuts down website after hacking attemptsEgypt calls for U.N. inquiry into accusation of Qatar ransom paymentA senior UAE official accused Qatar of escalating the row by seeking help from Turkey and Iran.  The request for political protection from two non-Arab countries and military protection from one of them could be a new tragic and comic chapter,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, wrote on Twitter. Mediation Efforts Falter Trump initially took sides with the Saudi-led group before apparently being nudged into a more even-handed approach when U.S. defense officials renewed praise of Doha, mindful of the major U.S. military base hosted by Qatar that serves, in part, as a launchpad for strikes on Islamic State insurgents. In his second intervention in as many days, Trump urged action against terrorism in a call with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Wednesday and offered help in resolving the crisis, including through a meeting at the White House. But a Qatari official said on Thursday the emir would not be accepting the invitation.  The emir has no plans to leave Qatar while the country is under a blockade,  the official told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: A traditional wooden fishing Dhow is seen in port near modern glass and steel buildings on the Doha skyline, Qatar February 9, 2010.Jacky Naegelen/File PhotoThe White House said Trump was continuing to talk with all partners. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was also ready to support diplomatic efforts  if desired by all parties,  his spokesman said. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, who has said Gulf states could resolve the dispute among themselves without outside help, traveled to Muscat on Thursday to meet his Omani counterpart. But there have been few signs of progress as officials from Qatar and its Arab neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) pursue shuttle diplomacy.  The feeling here is that it is going to take a while to fix. It is more about preventing things from getting worse,  said one diplomat in Kuwait, whose leader was in both the UAE and Qatar on Wednesday for consultations.  It Is a Blockade!  The UAE's national postal group suspended services to Qatar and the UAE aviation authority said it had closed air space for traffic to and from Doha.  Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017.StringerThe Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Authority also reimposed a ban on oil tankers linked to Qatar calling at ports in the UAE, reversing a decision to ease restrictions and potentially creating a logjam of crude cargoes.  It is a blockade! Like that of Berlin. A declaration of war. A political, economic and social aggression,  a Qatari diplomat said.  We need the world to condemn the aggressors.  Authorities tried to calm nerves on Wednesday, releasing a video showing a shop with shelves brimming with food and reassuring Qataris - the wealthiest people in the world per capita - that their quality of life would not be hit. The International Monetary Fund said it was too early to assess the economic impact. But in a sign of the damage, Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday as its riyal currency fell to an 11-year low. Al Jazeera Caught in Row Qatar has backed Islamist movements but strongly denies supporting terrorism. It provides a haven to anti-Western groups like the Afghan Taliban, Palestinian Hamas and Algeria’s Islamic Salvation Front but says it does not accept its neighbors' view that any group with an Islamist background is terrorist.  Egypt on Thursday called for the United Nations Security Council to launch an investigation into accusations, denied by Qatar, that it paid a ransom of up to $1 billion to  a terrorist group active in Iraq  to release kidnapped members of its royal family.  In an interview with BBC radio, UAE Ambassador to Russia Omar Saif Ghobash said Qatar had to choose between supporting extremism or supporting its neighbors.  Qatar needs to decide: Do you want to be in the pocket of Turkey, Iran and Islamic extremists? They need to make a decision; they can't have it both ways,  he said.  The Saudi newspaper al Watan published what it called a list of eight  extremist organizations  seen as working to destabilize the region from Qatar, including Qatar's Al Jazeera news channel, that were targeted by Gulf Arab states. State-funded Al Jazeera's acting director general, Mostefa Souag, dismissed accusations that its reportage is pro-Islamist and amounts to meddling in the affairs of other Arab states.  We don't interfere in anybody’s business, we just report,  he told Reuters at Al Jazeera's Doha headquarters. A company source later said the network was combating a large-scale cyber attack but remained operational, and Qatar's official state TV said it had shut down its website temporarily after facing hacking attempts. Qatar said last month its state news agency had been hacked and false statements attributed to its ruler posted, helping ignite this week's rift with other Arab states.

Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and several other countries severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-foe Iran, charges Qatar says are baseless. Qatar has denied trying to pay ransom money to secure the release of 26 Qataris, including members of the country's ruling royal family, abducted in Iraq by unidentified gunmen. The Qataris were released in April, some 18 months after they were abducted during a hunting trip in southern Iraq.  It is everywhere in the news that Qatar paid up to $1 billion to a terrorist group active in Iraq in order to release members of its royal family,  senior Egyptian U.N. diplomat Ihab Moustafa Awad Moustafa told the Security Council.  This violation of the Security Council resolutions, if proved correct, shall definitely have a negative bearing on counterterrorism efforts on the ground,  he said.  We propose that the council launch a comprehensive investigation into this incident and other similar incidents.  U.N. Security Council resolutions call on states  to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments or from political concessions and to secure the safe release of hostages.  A Qatar diplomat said the country abides by all U.N. Security Council resolutions on countering terrorism, including eradicating sources of financing for terrorism. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is ready to support any diplomatic efforts to resolve tensions between Qatar and other Gulf Arab states  if desired by all parties,  his spokesman said on Thursday.  The Secretary-General is following the situation in the Middle East with deep concern,  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.  He urges countries in the region to avoid escalating tensions and work instead to overcome their differences.

Investors still await the outcome of Britain's national election and opinion polls on the eve of the election showed Theresa May's Conservative Party leading between 5 and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority.                  Earlier in the session, the euro        declined after the European Central Bank cut its forecasts for inflation and said that policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme.                               A weaker euro versus the dollar erodes the buying power of euro zone investors for gold, which is priced in the U.S. currency.     Spot gold        was down 0.7 percent at $1,277.95 an ounce by 4:04 p.m. EDT (2004 GMT). U.S. gold futures         for August delivery shed 1.1 percent to settle at $1,279.50.         Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed President Donald Trump had directed him to drop a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the broader Russia investigation. However, he did not make any major new revelations about alleged links between Trump or his associates and Russia.                    One of the big drivers behind gold's move is the dollar catching a little bit of its footing ... if you look at the way gold is trading, until it breaks out of that recent trend around the $1,270-$1,275 area and get back into $1,260s it's hard to be bearish,  said Joshua Graves, markets strategist at RJO Futures.      I think the expectation going into the trade today was that gold could catch a bid with the Comey testimony and the uncertainty of the ECB meeting, so if you look at where gold is trending in the future, I think we will we see a run back to that $1,300 level. There just might need to be more geopolitical tension.      Some investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve policy meeting next week where a rate hike is widely expected.      Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar.     UBS strategist Joni Teves, however, said that a growing list of global uncertainties along with macro forces are expected to push gold higher, so any dips would be an opportunity to build or add to positions.       We think that investor allocations to gold remain small compared with other assets. An extension of gold's gains up ahead raises the risk that many would have to play catch-up,  she said in a note.      In other precious metals, palladium        climbed 2.5 percent to $855.22 an ounce. In the previous session it hit its highest in nearly three years but shed its early gains to end 2.3 percent lower.          Commerzbank technical analyst Karen Jones advised bullish investors to be wary of the palladium market.      It will shortly encounter the 16-year resistance line at $867/68 and, with a 13 count on the daily chart, we would tighten up stops (on long positions) considerably,  she said in a note.     Platinum        fell 0.4 percent to $938, while silver        lost 1 percent to $17.38.

No NBA team have ever found their way back after losing the first three games of a best-of-seven series but James was not ready to admit defeat.  My mindset is to try to get every game. Tomorrow's another important opportunity for us and for myself, obviously, to continue the series,  said James, who had a game-high 39 points in the Game Three loss.  It's been a long season, and you hate for it to end this way. So mentally and physically, I got to prepare myself for that.  Perhaps most frustrating for the Cavaliers, who host Game  Four on Friday, is that after two lopsided losses to open the series they returned home and played their most complete game of the Finals only to blow six-point lead in the closing minutes. The Cavaliers, however, are no stranger to defying odds. They became the first team to triumph after falling into a 3-1 Finals deficit when they beat the Warriors in seven games last year. But the challenge is far more difficult this time, not only because of the bigger deficit but also given the sheer talent of a Warriors group looking to become the first NBA team to win a title without suffering a single postseason loss.  I knew it was going to be one of the toughest challenges I've had because of the firepower they have, because of the mindset that they were going to have. And they're a hungry group. You can sense that,  said James. The Warriors beat Cleveland in the 2015 Finals, lost the rematch a year later after putting together a record-setting 73-win regular season, and then signed four-times scoring champion Kevin Durant to bolster a roster overflowing with talent. According to James, the Warriors, who have not lost four consecutive games since 2013, have all the pieces needed to dominate the NBA for years to come.  There have been times throughout my career where I played teams that were just in the midst of something that can last for a long time. And obviously this team is built to be able to do that with the talent that they have,  said James.  So we'll see what happens. Obviously you never know what's going to happen, but as it stands right now, they look pretty good as far as the future.

Comey, fired by U.S. President Donald Trump on May 9, testified before a Senate committee on Thursday that he was disturbed by Trump's bid to get him to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Comey, however, would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. The Senate was investigating whether the Trump campaign team conspired with Russia to influence the U.S. presidential election last year.  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here that there has been any illegal activity by high-ranking officials, so it's not particularly impactful for thinking about the impact for Trump's economic agenda,  said Tom Simons, money market economist, at Jefferies in New York. Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York, noted that the more important driver for the market was next week's expected rate hike. Rate futures have fully priced in a Fed tightening at the June 14 policy meeting. The European Central Bank's decision on Thursday not to cut interest rates as the euro zone economy rebounded, as well as remarks by its president, Mario Draghi, spurred a brief initial drop in U.S. yields, in line with those of German bonds. The ECB also said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump stimulus into the region's economy. Draghi said in a news briefing that reducing asset purchases in the region was not discussed at the meeting, and that the ECB would be in the market for a long time. The ECB estimated inflation of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.3 percent in 2018, compared with its forecasts of 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively in March. That is well below its target of just under 2 percent. In late trading, U.S. 10-year notes were last down 4/32 in price, with yields at 2.193 percent, compared with 2.180 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. 30-year bonds fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.852 percent, compared with Wednesday's 2.837 percent.

Ali Kourani, 32, of New York City and Samer El Debek, 27, of Dearborn, Michigan, were arrested on June 1, federal prosecutors in Manhattan announced Thursday. Both have appeared in Manhattan federal court, according to prosecutors. Lawyers for Al Kourani and El Debek could not immediately be reached for comment. In a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday, prosecutors said Kourani attended Hezbollah-sponsored weapons training in Lebanon as a teenager in 2000 before lawfully coming to the United States in 2003. He became a U.S. citizen in 2009, going on to earn a bachelor's and a master's degree, the complaint said. Prosecutors said Kourani worked for Hezbollah while in the United States, identifying potential weapon suppliers; identifying people affiliated with the military of Israel, Hezbollah's adversary; and gathering information about U.S. airport security and about military and law enforcement facilities in New York City. They said Kourani received additional weapons training, including on a 2011 trip to Lebanon. In a separate criminal complaint, prosecutors said El Debek, a U.S. citizen, was recruited by Hezbollah in 2007 or 2008 and began taking a salary from the organization. Over the years, prosecutors said, El Debek received weapons training, including in bomb-making. They said he carried out missions for Hezbollah in Thailand to clean up materials used to make explosives that had been left behind in a house, and in Panama, where he gathered information about security and the Panama Canal and Israeli Embassy. Both men, who remain in custody, are charged with providing material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy, and illegal weapons possession. Hezbollah, a Shi'ite group aligned with Iran and the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 1997. The cases are United States v. Kourani, No. 17-mj-4151, and United States v. El Debek, No. 17-mj-4154, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others this week severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar, the world's biggest LNG producer, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism. In one of the earliest signs of the effect on the LNG market, Royal Dutch Shell sent an LNG cargo from the United States to Dubai, shipping data shows, after the United Arab Emirates banned Qatari ships from entering UAE ports. A cluster of 17 LNG tankers are now moored off the coast of the Qatari LNG export facility at Ras Laffan, up from seven on Monday. Gas prices in the United Kingdom spiked on Thursday, with the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) price for July up over 4.5 percent after two Qatari tankers that were likely bound for the UK changed course, according to Reuters shipping data. It is unclear why those tankers shifted movements, though traders said they may be diverted around the continent of Africa rather than transit the Suez Canal, which is where they were expected to go. Traders worry that Egypt might bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal, though it is bound by international treaties not to block the canal. Analysts still do not see an interruption in supply in the LNG market, even with Qatar's role as the world's largest producer.  Only Egypt and the UAE are boycotting Qatari cargos so they are the only countries that might see U.S. volume replace Qatari,  said Theodore Michael, senior LNG analyst at energy data provider Genscape in Boulder, Colorado. Qatar's foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said the UAE was  exploiting a trading position as a political tool,  noting about 40 percent of UAE power depends on natural gas from Qatar. As exclusion zones took effect, Qatar's fleet of LNG vessels anchored off the UAE's port in Fujairah prior to the diplomatic cut-off has moved out. Shell has a deal to supply the Dubai Supply Authority (DUSUP) with LNG which it typically sources from Qatar. But the ban meant it had to source the LNG from elsewhere. Shell's Maran Gas Amphipolis tanker, carrying around 163,500 cubic metres of LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana, was initially headed toward Kuwait's port of Mina Al-Ahmadi but rerouted Wednesday for Dubai's port of Jebel Ali. The tanker is currently unloading at DUSUP's floating import terminal at Jebel Ali, data showed.  Shell, as the largest LNG trader, would have a high probability of managing some of this,  said Robert Ineson, managing director global LNG at IHS Markit in the Houston area.  A shutdown of Qatar's exports, either by pipeline or via LNG, would be highly disruptive to global gas markets. We think this is not likely.  Eben Burnham-Snyder, spokesman at Cheniere Energy Inc said earlier this week that the company - currently the only supplier of U.S. LNG - will keep sending cargos around the world. U.S. cargoes can be rerouted based on market conditions.

Minoxidil - known by the popular brand name Rogaine - was 40 percent more expensive when it was marketed as a foam to women than when it was advertised to men, researchers found.  Ethically it seems pretty questionable to be charging women more for the same thing,  said senior author Dr. Jules Lipoff, of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. Lipoff said a trip to a store led to the study, because he noticed the listed price per ounce for minoxidil was more for the box marked for women than the box marked for men. The drug is used to treat male- and female-pattern hair loss, which affects 80 million people in the United States, the researchers write in JAMA Dermatology. Minoxidil is available over the counter as a 5 percent solution for men and a 2 percent solution for women - both to be used twice per day. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a 5 percent foam version of the medicine for men to be used twice per day. The agency approved the same foam for women in 2014 for use once per day. For the new study, the researchers collected 41 minoxidil products between July and November 2016 from the nation's largest retail chains in Indiana, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania. Those chains were CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Target, Walgreens and Walmart. The prices of minoxidil solution and foam were compared per 30 milliliters of the product. The price per 30 ml of 2 percent solution for women averaged to $7.61, compared to $7.63 per 30 ml of 5 percent solution for men. While the difference in price per 30 ml of solution was not statistically significant between the male and female products, Lipoff pointed out that it could still be interpreted as women paying more for the medicine. After all, he said, women are paying the same price for less than half of the active ingredient found in the solution marketed to men. There is a possibility that the added inactive ingredients in the women's solution leads to a more costly product, he said. The argument can't be made for the 5 percent foam, though, because the product advertised to men is identical to the product marketed to women. Yet, the price per 30 ml of 5 percent minoxidil foam was $11.27 for the product marketed to women, compared to $8.05 for the product marketed to men. Minoxidil is currently only sold as a foam under the brand name Rogaine by Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc. A spokesperson for the company said Men's Rogaine Unscented Foam and Women's Rogaine Unscented Foam are priced the same on its website, but he could not speak for the prices of individual retailers. Lipoff told Reuters Health that most dermatologists he knows recommend people only use the foam version of minoxidil marketed to men because of the price difference.  I tell all of my patients that I’m treating for hairloss to not buy Women's Rogaine,  he said.  I explain to them that it’s the same product, but you pay more because you’re a woman.

The former FBI director said the U.S. president lied on several occasions, and he illustrated Trump’s knack for self-sabotage. The fresh hits to his credibility can only further hobble the White House’s economic agenda.  The highly anticipated Senate Intelligence Committee appearance by Comey, who was fired in May, didn’t produce a knockout blow. Most of his assertions had already been reported. He also backed the president’s claim that Comey told Trump he wasn’t personally under investigation. The S&P; 500 and other markets rose during the hearing.  But in an extraordinary accusation, Comey said Trump lied about him, the FBI and an open investigation. He said he began documenting his encounters with the president after his first meeting in January because he was concerned Trump “might lie” about the discussions. He was also confused by the “shifting explanations” for his firing. The president told Comey the dismissal was based on Justice Department recommendations. Trump later told NBC News it was because of the FBI’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties to the Trump campaign. Trump also said the FBI was in disarray. “Those were lies, plain and simple,” Comey said. Comey also said Trump didn’t tell the truth about an FBI investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who resigned in February over misleading statements he made to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. Trump told reporters he hadn’t pressured Comey to drop the Flynn investigation. The former FBI boss claimed otherwise, recalling that Trump said he hoped Comey could see to “letting Flynn go.” Comey also said he leaked his memos on his Trump meetings to the media after the president indicated in a tweet that he may have tapes of their conversations. He said he hoped his move would spur the appointment of a special counsel. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named in that role last month. His inquiries, and the work of various Congressional committees, will keep the cloud of Russia allegations hanging over the administration.  The White House is already struggling to make progress on trade pacts, tax reform and health care. The picture Comey painted of the president will further undermine the willingness of trade partners and Democrats to deal with him. The self-proclaimed dealmaker could find it more challenging to get to signing on the dotted line.

Brent crude LCOc1 fell 20 cents to settle at $47.87 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down 8 cents to $45.64 a barrel.  The market is catching its breath after the inventory report which, as far as the oil market was concerned, stunk,  said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  The market continues to be impatient with the OPEC and non OPEC cuts and is looking for more data world wide that inventories are indeed falling.  Oil prices have slipped below $50 a barrel despite a pledge by the world's largest exporters, led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to extend a cut in production of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) into next year. OPEC agreed to output cuts in November, and shortly after that Russia and other non-OPEC producers also agreed to cut production in an effort to reduce a global glut that has forced prices into a steep and long-lasting slump. Last month the countries agreed to extend the cuts, yet global supplies of crude remain strong, especially in the United States where booming shale production has the country on track to rival Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude output. On Wednesday, prices fell 5 percent after data showed U.S. inventories of crude oil and gasoline surprisingly rose last week. [EIA/S] U.S. crude production fell to 9.318 million barrels per day, the first drop in four weeks, according to data on Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration. But Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that for the oil market, the high U.S. inventory figures  overshadowed any moderation in production.  Adding to concerns about the swelling global supplies, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Wednesday lifted a force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing all the country's crude grades fully online for the first time in 16 months. Nigeria, along with Libya, is exempt from the production cut made by the OPEC and its 11 partners.  Unless data are released that make the latest inventory build appear an anomaly, oil prices are hardly likely to make any lasting recovery,  Commerzbank said in a note.

Authorization was obtained by CTC Centro de Tecnologia Canavieira SA, which developed the technology and made the application seeking approval in December 2015, Chief Executive Officer Gustavo Leite told Reuters in an interview.  CTNBio was not immediately available to comment on the approval. Leite said it would take at least three years for the first shipments of sugar produced from GM crops to reach export markets because of the pace of propagation of new cane varieties.  Brazil has about 10 million hectares of sugarcane fields and potential to plant GM cane in up to 15 percent of this area,  Leite said. Given the characteristics of the crop, this may take 10 years to achieve, he said. Brazil exports sugar to about 150 countries and some 60 percent of them do not demand regulatory approval to import sugar made from genetically modified organisms.   Approval from CTNBio is crucial for the ones which do,   Leite said. CTC has made applications to clear sale of sugar made from GM cane in the United States and Canada. It will seek regulatory approval in China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and Indonesia. CTC said the new variety is resistant to the insect Diatraea saccharalis, known locally as 'broca-da-cana' (cane borer), one of the main plagues in Brazil's sugarcane fields, with an estimated 5 billion reais ($1.52 billion) of annual losses to producers. The GM cane contains the gene Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), widely used in other crops.  In the future CTC, majority owned by firms including Copersucar SA and Raízen Energia SA, intends to introduce traits that will make sugarcane tolerant to another insect and a herbicide, Leite said. Sugar industry officials hailed the approval, but said adoption is likely to depend on each company's commercial strategy. Jacyr Costa, Brazil director for Tereos, said the country will profit from increased productivity of its cane fields, adding science is instrumental to achieve this.  The adoption of GM cane is an individual decision by each company, but it is great to have this option,  he said. Fábio Venturelli, chief executive officer of São Martinho, said producers will consider potential consumer backlash against GM products before switching to GM cane.

Yields on bonds due in 2024 climbed to 5.15 percent in secondary market trading where the yield on a top-rated bond maturing that same year was only 1.42 percent, according to Municipal Market Data.   It's a real meltdown today,  MMD analyst Randy Smolik said. Illinois already had the widest so-called credit spreads among the 50 states over MMD's benchmark triple-A yield scale. The spread on its 10-year bonds widened to a record 335 basis points at the end of trading on Thursday from 280 basis points on Wednesday, MMD reported.  For 20-year bonds, the spread widened to a record 290 basis points from 256 basis points. This signals even higher borrowing costs for the nation's fifth-largest state.  This drop today should be a wake-up call,  said John Mousseau, director of fixed-income at Cumberland Advisors, adding that the market appears to be reaching a tipping point on bad news about Illinois. Late on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow said Illinois' action to make only minimal payments to healthcare providers in the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled due to an ongoing budget impasse does not comply with existing federal consent decrees. While the judge did not specifically push Medicaid payments ahead of other state priorities like debt service on bonds and pensions, she set a June 20 deadline for Illinois and healthcare advocates to reach a deal resulting in  substantial compliance  with the decrees that stem from federal court cases filed in 1992. That could be tough given the state's nearly $14.8 billion unpaid bill pile as of Wednesday and $1.85 billion of monthly priority payments that flow to bonds, pensions, schools, payroll and other mandated areas that consume 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk.

The vote will decide whether May or her Labour Party rival Jeremy Corbyn takes control of Britain's exit from the European Union - a two-year negotiation which will plot a new course for the $2.6 trillion economy. The prime minister called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, to win more time to deal with the impact of the divorce and to strengthen her grip on the Conservative Party. While she is still expected to win, with a lead of between one percentage point and 12 points in polls released over recent days, financial markets are now digesting a bigger range of outcomes than they previously had considered. Landslide May Victory Sterling rallied in April when May called the vote as investors bet her then-large poll lead would translate into a big majority, reducing uncertainty over whether she would have the mandate required to negotiate on Britain's behalf and then drive the deal through parliament. The snap election pushes back the date of the next planned national election from 2020 - just after Britain is due to have quit the EU - to 2022, giving May more time to put the exit deal in place and potentially reducing political risk over how the deal is implemented. Some also take the view that a big majority would allow her to make compromises with Brussels, in contrast to a hardline approach to date that has prioritized issues like immigration and trade over access to Europe's lucrative single market. That all helped push sterling to an eight-month high of $1.3048 on May 18, since when it has weakened. U.S. bank Citi said a majority of more than 100 seats would lower the risk of a chaotic EU exit, but also reduce the chance that Britain could remain a member of the EU single market.  Ultimately, with a big majority for the Conservatives confirming a 'hard-but-smooth' Brexit base case, we think that abating uncertainty risks could see GBP/USD head towards 1.34 in the near term,  Citi strategists said in a note last month. May Wins With Enhanced Majority The Conservatives' lead fell sharply after May announced plans to make elderly voters pay more toward their old-age care, while Corbyn has gained ground thanks to popular policies such as renationalization and higher taxes for the rich. Whilst still broadly predicting May will improve on the 12-seat victory her predecessor David Cameron won in 2015, the narrowing polls suggest a majority that might fall well short of a 100-seat or more landslide. Bank analysts say that would not undermine the central scenarios which have helped the pound in the past month but might struggle to drive it much higher.  We think our base case (a 70-seat Conservative majority) will result in sterling rallying back to the $1.30-1.3150 range,  analysts from Canada's Bank of Montreal said in a note to clients.   Foremost, this would be the result of market relief that the most bearish result (a Labour victory) didn’t come to pass.  May Wins but No Overall Gains: 12-Seat Majority or Less If May does not handsomely beat the 12-seat majority  Cameron won in 2015, her electoral gamble will have failed, her ability to drive Brexit reform through parliament will be diminished and she will go into talks later this month looking weaker.  A betting shop worker carries a board displaying odds for scenarios in the general election outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London, Britain, June 7, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneThe converse view is that with less room for maneuver domestically, she will be able to reject compromises proposed by Brussels and drive a harder bargain, knowing that EU negotiators will not want May to execute her threat of leaving without a deal. For investors the over-riding factor is likely to be greater uncertainty about whether there will be a deal on Brexit and what it will look like.  Citi said anything less than a 40-seat majority could increase political risks and uncertainty for the Brexit process, pushing sterling lower.  May’s potential dependence on minorities such as hard Brexiteers or hard Remainers would raise the risk of 'chaotic Brexit', but also the chance of a much softer Brexit than she currently aims for,  analysts from the U.S. bank said. The near- to medium-term reaction would likely be a fall in sterling to $1.20, but with the potential for it to rise as high as $1.50 if the political situation evolved in a way that forced May to soften her demands on Brexit, they added. Hung Parliament: No Clear Winner Slideshow (2 Images)If neither main party wins a clear majority, markets will have to deal with considerable uncertainty over who will form the next government and what compromises the eventual prime minister will have to make to get the support of other parties. In 2010, when the Liberal Democrats held the balance of power, markets reacted to the uncertainty by selling sterling. This time round the choice is likely to be even less clear, with the Liberal Democrats greatly reduced in number and the pro-EU Scottish National Party likely to have more influence. The Conservatives' positioning on Brexit and, to a lesser extent other domestic issues like austerity, makes it unlikely that it could find a willing coalition partner, making a Labour-led government the most likely outcome from a hung parliament. JP Morgan said that despite the uncertainty, that outcome could generate a rise for sterling.   A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite a negative for sterling,  analyst Paul Meggyesi said in a note distributed to media on Tuesday and sent to clients at the end of last week.  But in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-center parties ... might actually be GBP positive.  Corbyn Victory A clear win for Corbyn, whose less than two-year-old leadership has been marked by poor ratings, divisions among his party and a failed coup attempt, would force many investors to redraw their assumptions on both Brexit and the fiscal outlook. History shows that sterling tends to weaken on big moves towards Labour in the polls and analysts and London-based traders say they would be braced for an immediate dive in the pound if Corbyn won. Longer term, however, analysts from a number of banks highlight the potential for both more borrowing to fund economic stimulus and the increased likelihood that Corbyn will negotiate a closer trading relationship with the EU than May would have done.  At first GBP may suffer as a result from the UK shifting to the left-leaning side of politics and investors’ expectations of larger deficit financing,  analysts from Japan's Nomura said in a note.  But because of the higher real yields we would expect and hopes of a soft Brexit - or indeed no Brexit at all - this should eventually provide support to the currency.

A modestly leveraged buyout of the $7.6 billion U.S. clothing seller – recently most famous for dropping first daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing line – looks doable with members of the eponymous family rolling over their stakes. The growing list of retailers struggling with debt should sound a note of caution, though. The shopkeeping sector's troubles, including dwindling foot traffic in malls, have taken their toll and before Thursday's pop following news of the family's take-private interest, Nordstrom's shares were down 16 percent this year. Still, the company is in better shape than Macy's, for example, which is closing a raft of stores. Tough action to weather the downturn could be easier to implement without the quarterly earnings treadmill. And the weakened share price helps the numbers add up for the Nordstrom family and any partners they bring in. Suppose they offer a 30 percent premium to Wednesday's closing price of $40.48 a share. That would value the existing equity at $8.7 billion. Add $2.1 billion of net debt, and the total buyout value would be $10.8 billion. A debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times would be fairly restrained for a buyout. Assume that's doable. Using the just over $1.6 billion consensus estimate from Eikon for EBITDA in the financial year to next January, debt could cover some $6.5 billion of the deal price. That leaves $4.3 billion of needed equity – but with family members owning more than 30 percent of Nordstrom's stock at present, rolling over their stakes at the buyout price would account for over 60 percent of that, Breakingviews calculates. They'd need about $1.6 billion of additional cash, a manageable check for a private-equity partner to write provided the family's plans for the company over the coming years looked lucrative enough.   Though a leveraged deal is feasible, the Nordstroms need to play it carefully. A slew of retailers, including J.Crew and Neiman Marcus, are running into financial difficulties after years of private-equity ownership and burdensome borrowing that have stripped them of cash reserves and operational flexibility. An aggressively tailored structure would be risky. That aside, though, Nordstrom could be well suited for a buyout.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Brent crude LCOc1 fell 20 cents to settle at $47.87 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down 8 cents to $45.64 a barrel.  The market is catching its breath after the inventory report which, as far as the oil market was concerned, stunk,  said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  The market continues to be impatient with the OPEC and non OPEC cuts and is looking for more data world wide that inventories are indeed falling.  Oil prices have slipped below $50 a barrel despite a pledge by the world's largest exporters, led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to extend a cut in production of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) into next year. OPEC agreed to output cuts in November, and shortly after that Russia and other non-OPEC producers also agreed to cut production in an effort to reduce a global glut that has forced prices into a steep and long-lasting slump. Last month the countries agreed to extend the cuts, yet global supplies of crude remain strong, especially in the United States where booming shale production has the country on track to rival Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude output. On Wednesday, prices fell 5 percent after data showed U.S. inventories of crude oil and gasoline surprisingly rose last week. [EIA/S] U.S. crude production fell to 9.318 million barrels per day, the first drop in four weeks, according to data on Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration. But Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that for the oil market, the high U.S. inventory figures  overshadowed any moderation in production.  Adding to concerns about the swelling global supplies, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Wednesday lifted a force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing all the country's crude grades fully online for the first time in 16 months. Nigeria, along with Libya, is exempt from the production cut made by the OPEC and its 11 partners.  Unless data are released that make the latest inventory build appear an anomaly, oil prices are hardly likely to make any lasting recovery,  Commerzbank said in a note.

Yields on bonds due in 2024 climbed to 5.15 percent in secondary market trading where the yield on a top-rated bond maturing that same year was only 1.42 percent, according to Municipal Market Data.   It's a real meltdown today,  MMD analyst Randy Smolik said. Illinois already had the widest so-called credit spreads among the 50 states over MMD's benchmark triple-A yield scale. The spread on its 10-year bonds widened to a record 335 basis points at the end of trading on Thursday from 280 basis points on Wednesday, MMD reported.  For 20-year bonds, the spread widened to a record 290 basis points from 256 basis points. This signals even higher borrowing costs for the nation's fifth-largest state.  This drop today should be a wake-up call,  said John Mousseau, director of fixed-income at Cumberland Advisors, adding that the market appears to be reaching a tipping point on bad news about Illinois. Late on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow said Illinois' action to make only minimal payments to healthcare providers in the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled due to an ongoing budget impasse does not comply with existing federal consent decrees. While the judge did not specifically push Medicaid payments ahead of other state priorities like debt service on bonds and pensions, she set a June 20 deadline for Illinois and healthcare advocates to reach a deal resulting in  substantial compliance  with the decrees that stem from federal court cases filed in 1992. That could be tough given the state's nearly $14.8 billion unpaid bill pile as of Wednesday and $1.85 billion of monthly priority payments that flow to bonds, pensions, schools, payroll and other mandated areas that consume 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk.

The 35-year-old, whose future at under-performing McLaren is already uncertain beyond this season, was asked at the Canadian Grand Prix if it was true he had told Spanish television he would retire rather than do such a number of races.  Yes,  he replied.  I started when the calendar was 16 races, plus the tests,  continued the Spaniard.  Now we keep on increasing the races year after year and I think we are in a number that is quite demanding already.   The preparation, the sponsor events, the tests, the commitments you have plus 20, 21 races, I think is already enough.  I consider that a good quality of life is more important than to do more seasons in F1 -- so if the calendar stays between 20-21...I’ll be happy to continue. If it’s increasing, like NASCAR, that they have 40 or 50 races, it’s not for me.  The 2017 calendar has 20 races but next year will see it grow to 21 with France and Germany returning and Malaysia leaving. Liberty Media, Formula One's new American owners, have big plans to reshape the sport and are targeting new venues in key markets, including another race in the United States and Asia.  We want to work in partnership with our teams in terms of determining where we go, but our view is that we’d like to go above 21 (races),  Formula One's commercial managing director Sean Bratches told Reuters last week. He did not specify an upper limit. McLaren's executive director Zak Brown told Reuters on Wednesday that he would welcome a second race in the United States, another in China, one in South Africa and ideally a return to India although that looked unlikely.  We still aren’t where we need to be in China. You could have a race in Beijing and Shanghai and I don’t think you’ve saturated Asia,  he said. He warned, however, that the sport needed to preserve its exclusivity. And it also depended on the venues.  If we are at 21 (races) and you are talking that the 22nd can be New York, then yes! If you told me the 22nd was Nebraska, no,  he said. Piecing together the calendar is never so simple, with many of the sport's constituents looking for different things and concerned about budgets and the impact on team staff. Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton said he agreed with Alonso but the Mercedes driver stopped well short of saying he would leave if the calendar continued to expand.  I understand what Fernando is saying and I tend to agree with it,  said the Briton.

Authorization was obtained by CTC Centro de Tecnologia Canavieira SA, which developed the technology and made the application seeking approval in December 2015, Chief Executive Officer Gustavo Leite told Reuters in an interview.  CTNBio was not immediately available to comment on the approval. Leite said it would take at least three years for the first shipments of sugar produced from GM crops to reach export markets because of the pace of propagation of new cane varieties.  Brazil has about 10 million hectares of sugarcane fields and potential to plant GM cane in up to 15 percent of this area,  Leite said. Given the characteristics of the crop, this may take 10 years to achieve, he said. Brazil exports sugar to about 150 countries and some 60 percent of them do not demand regulatory approval to import sugar made from genetically modified organisms.   Approval from CTNBio is crucial for the ones which do,   Leite said. CTC has made applications to clear sale of sugar made from GM cane in the United States and Canada. It will seek regulatory approval in China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and Indonesia. CTC said the new variety is resistant to the insect Diatraea saccharalis, known locally as 'broca-da-cana' (cane borer), one of the main plagues in Brazil's sugarcane fields, with an estimated 5 billion reais ($1.52 billion) of annual losses to producers. The GM cane contains the gene Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), widely used in other crops.  In the future CTC, majority owned by firms including Copersucar SA and Raízen Energia SA, intends to introduce traits that will make sugarcane tolerant to another insect and a herbicide, Leite said. Sugar industry officials hailed the approval, but said adoption is likely to depend on each company's commercial strategy. Jacyr Costa, Brazil director for Tereos, said the country will profit from increased productivity of its cane fields, adding science is instrumental to achieve this.  The adoption of GM cane is an individual decision by each company, but it is great to have this option,  he said. Fábio Venturelli, chief executive officer of São Martinho, said producers will consider potential consumer backlash against GM products before switching to GM cane.

Poland, the Baltic states and others argue that Nord Stream 2 would increase the European Union's dependence on Russia's Gazprom, which already supplies about a third of the bloc's gas. Supporters say it will mean cheaper gas supplies for Europe.  You know that my view about this project is negative,  Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who now chairs summits of EU leaders, wrote in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.  It will not serve the best European interest,  Tusk said in the letter, addressed to Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the executive European Commission which is preparing to negotiate with Russia on the project.  Opponents of the pipeline also note that it would bypass Ukraine, thereby harming the interests of the pro-Western government in Kiev at a time when Russia remains under EU sanctions over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Gazprom's European partners n the Nord Stream 2 project include Germany's Uniper, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. The European Commission, comprised of 28 officials, one from each EU state, is working on a proposal for a mandate to launch negotiations with Russia on the pipeline to ensure it meets EU laws.  I encourage you to be determined in demanding that all our rules stemming from the legal obligations ... as well as our political objectives are applied to this project in full,  Tusk said in his letter to Juncker. In commenting on the letter, which has not been made public, a spokesman for the Commission said on Tuesday:  The Commission is an institution based on law. We therefore cannot take arbitrary decisions favouring a project, or blocking another on the basis of preferences.   The European Commission is now working on the legal framework that will ensure that the construction of such an important infrastructure does not happen in a legal void,  said the spokesman, Margaritis Schinas. He said he hoped member states would endorse the proposal. Three sources in Brussels said the Commission was likely to approve on Friday the negotiating mandate proposal, which would then have to be endorsed by EU states before any talks with Moscow start.  Two other officials said those countries opposed to the Nord Stream extension were working through their nationally appointed commissioners to make the mandate more demanding.

Arsenic is one of the most common elements in the Earth's crust and a natural contaminant in water in many regions of the world. While previous research has found high levels of arsenic in the water associated with a variety of birth complications in places like China, Argentina and Bangladesh, less is known about what happens to babies in places where pregnant women drink water with small amounts of arsenic.  For the current study, researchers examined data on 428,804 births in Ohio from 2006 to 2008 to see how birth outcomes differed based on county-level arsenic exposure in the water. Because up to 80 percent of homes in some counties had private well water - for which arsenic data wasn’t available - researchers restricted their analysis to counties where less than 10 percent or 20 percent of homes used well water. In counties where less than 10 percent of the population used private wells, arsenic in public drinking water was associated with 14 percent higher odds of very low birth weight babies and 10 percent higher odds of premature deliveries, researchers report in Environmental Research.   Arsenic contamination varies geographically, based on underlying geology,  said lead study author Kirsten Almberg, a public health researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago.   Testing your drinking water for a variety of contaminants including arsenic and lead is sound advice,  Almberg said by email.  The study found negative birth outcomes even when women lived in counties where tap water might expose them to arsenic levels below 10 micrograms per liter (10 ug/L), the maximum amount considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Almberg noted. This suggests EPA regulations may not protect women from reproductive problems linked to arsenic, she said.  The study didn't find an association between higher use of tap water at the county level and a risk of very premature infants or infants being small for their gestational age but not very low birth weight. Drinking water with arsenic did appear linked to a higher risk of low birth weight babies, but the added risk was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.   The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how specific levels of arsenic in drinking water might lead to negative birth outcomes.  Other limitations include incomplete or missing arsenic measurements for certain counties at certain points of time during the study, as well as the possibility that pregnant women drank water from sources that weren't measured in the study.   The disadvantage is that we don't know exactly how much of the arsenic-tainted water the mothers were consuming, so the study simply assumes an overall average for each county,  said Philippe Grandjean, chair of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.   This means that it is not possible to explore whether greater adverse effects were seen in births where the mother had consumed much public water, as compared with mothers who preferred bottled water,  Grandjean, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  Overall, this imprecision means that the study probably underestimated the adverse effects, and that arsenic is more toxic to the baby than the authors calculated.  Women who are worried about arsenic exposure during pregnancy should get their water tested if they use a private well, said Xindi Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Municipal water supplies should already get routine testing.  They can also take a folate supplement because this can potentially reduce the toxicity of arsenic during pregnancy, Hu, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.   I won't suggest drinking only bottled water because it should be just a short-term emergency response, not a long-term solution,  Hu said.  What is even more severe, bottled water is not necessarily cleaner or safer than tap water.

Traders had been on tenterhooks ahead of Comey's testimony to a Senate committee, his first since being fired by Trump on May 9. His prepared remarks had been made public Wednesday. The market's concern on the issue is whether the Trump administration can put the investigation behind it and revive momentum for their agenda of lower taxes and looser regulations. Bets on that agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs. The Trump 'reflation trade' that favored banks and sectors linked to infrastructure spending, among others, was back Thursday, with the S&P; 500 financial sector up 1.2 percent. The S&P; 1500 construction and engineering index rose 1.5 percent and a gauge of construction materials' stocks added 1.4 percent.  If there was something (damning) that's going to come out, as leaky as things seem to be, we would have heard something more than what we've been hearing so far,  said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. Also supporting infrastructure stocks, specifically steel companies, was an announcement from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that a national security review of the U.S. steel industry will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers. In his statement, Comey said the president lied in describing their encounters and that he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, but was confident that no votes had been altered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19.19 points, or 0.09 percent, to 21,154.5, the S&P; 500 lost 2.87 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,430.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.27 points, or 0.18 percent, to 6,308.65. Other analysts were not so rosy about the effect on Comey's testimony on the Trump agenda.  It leaves us where we were before. It becomes that much more difficult for the Trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package,  said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey.  Anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected. You are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018, possibly in 2019.  Utilities stocks fell the most on the S&P; 500 as Treasury yields rose, tracking German Bund yields, after European Central Bank upgraded its growth forecast for the euro zone even as it suggested its stimulus plan will remain in place as inflation remains subdued. The S&P; utilities sector was down 1.3 percent, the most for any day since early March. Traders kept an eye on the UK as Britons voted in a snap election predicted to give Prime Minister Theresa May a larger parliamentary majority, which she hopes will strengthen her hand in looming divorce talks with the European Union. Among specific stocks, Nordstrom jumped 8.6 percent to $43.95 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private. Alibaba shares were up 12.9 percent to $141.82 after the company said it expects revenue growth of 45-49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Yahoo , which rose 9.7 percent, while the largest decliner was Advance Auto Parts, down 3.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.96-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

On Thursday, GM signalled a deal may be possible earlier than expected.  We confirm that the closing is expected to take place in the second half of 2017 as planned, and that the date of 31 July constitutes a first assumption for the earliest possible date, subject to the decision of the competition authorities,” Opel said in a statement. Germany's Allgemeine Zeitung was first to report the closing date could be as early as end July. A swift closing has been made possible because GM formally agreed to protect factory jobs by signing binding contracts last week, a trade union source told Reuters.  GM signed agreements handing workers co-determination rights at Opel Automobile GmbH, the new company that will be sold to PSA, and guaranteed it had set aside enough provisions to fund pension liabilities, the source said.

The settlement announced by California's Department of Insurance on Thursday resolves charges that Applied Underwriters Inc and California Insurance Co steered prospective customers to unapproved or unexpectedly costly policies, using  illegal side agreements  that exposed policyholders to greater risks. Jones had last June halted the Berkshire units' sale of unapproved  EquityComp  policies after finding that one policy subjected Shasta Linen Supply Inc, a Sacramento employer of 63 people, to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra costs. The Berkshire units had agreed three months later to stop selling unapproved EquityComp policies in California. Vermont and Wisconsin regulators enacted similar bans in those states.  This is a significant victory in protecting California businesses from sophisticated bait and switch marketing tactics,  California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement.  We have gone to the limit of our authority over workers' compensation insurance products in winning concessions that eliminate oppressive contract terms,  he added. Applied Underwriters and California Insurance had no immediate comment. Workers' compensation insurance typically covers lost wages and medical costs for employees injured on the job. The case put a spotlight on lesser-known parts of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's insurance operations, which also include the Geico car insurer, the General Re reinsurer and a business that protects against large and unusual risks. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units, but insurance still generates about one-fourth of its profit.

Richard Boomgaardt, who lives in Britain and was head of State Street's transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud on July 12. The plea, disclosed in a court calendar notice on Thursday, would make him the second former State Street executive to plead guilty in the case, which is pending in federal court in Boston. Edward Pennings, a former senior managing director in State Street's London office, agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, according to court records filed on Tuesday. Pennings, who also lives in Britain, is scheduled to enter his plea on June 28. Lawyers for Boomgaardt and Pennings did not respond to requests for comment. The former State Street executives are among three who have been charged by U.S. prosecutors since April 2016 in connection with the probe. The bank agreed in January to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of £22.9 million, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. From 2010 to 2011 Pennings, Boomgaardt and Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president, conspired to add the secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for certain clients, prosecutors said. The clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios, prosecutors said. McLellan has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and wire fraud charges. His trial is scheduled for October. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. McLellan, et al, No. 16-cr-10094, and U.S. v. Boomgaardt, No. 17-cr-10167.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/state-str-fraud-idUSL1N1J51TP"},

This is their only way into al-Mishlab, the first district the Kurdish and Arab militias have swept into, in what the coalition says will be a long and difficult battle for Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto  capital  in Syria.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) launched their assault to capture the city this week.  As artillery and coalition aircraft pounded targets in the city, SDF fighters moved in small groups into the district during a media trip organized by the SDF.   The comrades are advancing and Daesh forces are collapsing in front of us, but there are snipers obstructing our movements, and they are also shelling our positions with mortars,  said an SDF fighter who gave his name as Khalil. For months, air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition have helped them encircle Raqqa, which Islamic State seized in 2014 and has used as a base to plan attacks abroad. In a statement sent to Reuters, coalition spokesman Colonel Joseph Scrocca said the militants' resistance had been  minimal  outside the city and that they were retreating  to protect their fortifications inside the city .  A few civilians left farmland near Raqqa on Wednesday, waving white flags to SDF fighters heading toward al-Mishlab on a road littered with blown-up vehicles.  At the gates of the city, a bridge lay collapsed, testament to the air strikes that have left Islamic State with no way in or out except by boat across the Euphrates river.  A Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter carries his weapons as he gestures in the al-Mishlab district at Raqqa's southeastern outskirts, Syria June 7, 2017. Picture taken June 7, 2017.Rodi SaidLarge plumes of smoke rose nearby. SDF fighters crossed the river into the district through pathways made of piles of rocks, soil and pipes.  A field commander who gave her name as Clara said fighting continued in some parts of the district. Islamic State militants had drawn on mines, car bombs, and suicide attackers as they sought to defend the district in recent days, she said.  The SDF fighters moved in units of five or less, waiting in bombed-out buildings or trenches for air strikes to clear the way for further advances, they said. With every movement, the unit commander relayed their GPS coordinates for pilots to pinpoint SDF and enemy positions. Slideshow (7 Images)Away from the frontlines, fighters in green camouflage uniform, some with colourful scarves wrapped around their heads, unloaded crates of weapons from trucks.  An SDF field commander said the coalition had recently delivered the weapons, including mortar bombs.   These weapons recently arrived to us because we had sent our fighters for training by coalition forces,  said Ankiza Mahmoud, the commander of an SDF unit, one of many Kurdish female fighters taking part in the attack.  Some of the fighters unloading weapons wore the shoulder patch of the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF's most powerful component. Its role in the Raqqa campaign has strained ties between the United States and NATO ally Turkey, which fears growing Kurdish ascendancy along its border.  The United States said last week it had started supplying arms to the YPG for the Raqqa assault, deepening Turkey's anger. Ankara views the YPG as a part of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey. Yet the militia has emerged as the main U.S. parter in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria.  The shipment of weapons reached the eastern outskirts of Raqqa city on Wednesday, and the newly trained SDF fighters would soon head to the frontlines, they said.

From Capitol Hill to San Francisco's Castro district, television  watch parties  beckoned politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the  Super Bowl of Washington.  The drama around Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by President Donald Trump last month drew the kind of communal public interest more often associated with major sporting events and awards shows. Every seat was taken at the Union Pub in Washington, located in the shadow of the building where Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee for about three hours from 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). Comey accused Trump of dismissing him to try to undercut the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia's alleged efforts to influence the election. The pub had promised to buy patrons a round of drinks every time Trump, a prolific Twitter user, tweeted during Comey's testimony - but drinkers were out of luck. The president did not launch a single public retort during the hearing, although his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., sent several tweets attacking Comey.   (Comey) did in no uncertain terms call Trump a dishonest person,  said Jared Sorhaindo, 30, who works as a researcher.  That was one of the things that I thought would make Trump fly off the handle.  A man watches a television showing former FBI director James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, in Tonic bar in New York City, U.S., June 8, 2017.Joe PenneyMark Johnson, 69, self-employed from Rockville, Maryland, was one of the few Republicans in the packed bar and defended the Republican president.  It is kind of selective outrage on the part of Democrats, and I don't think that what Trump did rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors,  Johnson said, referring to one of the standards that can trigger congressional impeachment proceedings against a president. Slideshow (8 Images)At Houston’s Axelrad Beer Garden, a crowd of 200 people applauded when Comey called Trump’s rationale for firing him “lies, plain and simple.” Texas leans Republican but Houston, the largest city in the state, voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in November.  So far, no smoking gun,  said Cesar Robles, 35, watching the hearing at the bar.  Not much is going to be done  as a result of the testimony, he said. Back at the Union Pub in the nation's capital, Joseph Cortese, a 22-year-old intern working for a Republican congressman, said the hearing was overblown and would not affect Trump or his agenda. Some Democrats have suggested Trump could be impeached and removed from office if he was found to have sought to hinder the Russia probe in a way that obstructed justice. That is seen as very unlikely given Republicans control both chambers of Congress.  I think the media and liberals are going to have to move on and accept the fact that Donald Trump is going to be president for the next four years,  Cortese said.

The report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the first to include official numbers from the territory of Puerto Rico, which on Monday declared that its Zika epidemic had ended, based on data showing the number of new cases has fallen. The CDC on Thursday continued to reiterate its recommendation that pregnant women not travel to Puerto Rico, noting that Zika remains a risk for pregnant women there and anywhere else the mosquito-borne virus is active.  Zika virus poses a serious threat to pregnant women and their babies, regardless of when the infection occurs during the pregnancy,” said CDC Acting Director Dr. Anne Schuchat.  Women in the U.S. territories and elsewhere who have continued exposure to mosquitoes carrying Zika are at risk of infection. We must remain vigilant and committed to preventing new Zika infections.  Besides Puerto Rico, the report included data on 1,508 Zika-confirmed pregnancies in women from American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from Jan. 1, 2016 through April 25, 2017. Of these, more than 120 pregnancies, or about 5 percent, resulted in Zika-associated birth defects, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Among the women who were infected during their first trimester of pregnancy, 8 percent had babies with Zika-associated birth defects. That compared with 15 percent in a prior study of birth defects among women from U.S. states and the District of Colombia, most of whom became infected during travel to Zika-affected countries. The CDC said because the newer report is much larger, the findings are not statistically different. About 5 percent of women infected during their second trimester and about 4 percent infected in their third trimester had babies with Zika-related birth defects, showing that the virus remains dangerous throughout a woman's pregnancy. The report represents the largest number of completed pregnancies with lab-confirmed Zika virus infections to date, the CDC said.

However, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency government panel which reviews proposed takeovers of U.S. businesses by foreign entities on national security grounds, remains a concern for Chinese firms, according to the survey by the China General Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated CGCC Foundation. A quarter of the 213 Chinese companies that responded to a questionnaire consider the CFIUS review to be politicized and opaque, the survey said.  Though CFIUS for most respondents does not appear to be a major investment barrier, its impact falls disproportionately on large covered transactions, those deals in which a foreign entity gains control of a U.S. listed company.

Going private would accelerate Tivity Health's ongoing transformation, that included changing its name from Healthways earlier this year and divesting its total population health division, which uses coaching and clinical protocols to improve the overall health of employees and insurance plan members. Tivity Health's deal talks are preliminary, and there is no certainty that negotiations with buyout firms or other potential acquirers will advance and lead to any deal, the sources said. They asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.  Tivity Health declined to comment.  Tivity Health shares jumped as much as 10 percent on the news, and were up 4 percent at $37.91 in afternoon trading in New York, giving the Franklin, Tennessee-based company a market capitalization of $1.5 billion.  Following a strategic review, Tivity Health last year decided against an outright sale, instead opting to divest its population health unit to Sharecare Inc, a U.S. health and wellness online platform co-founded by TV personality Dr. Oz. As part of that deal, Tivity paid ShareCare around $25 million to take on the loss-making division, which made up more than a third of Tivity Health's revenues.  In exchange, Tivity Health received a claim on up to $30 million in ShareCare common stock, which could be reduced if losses from the population health business exceed $25 million.  Tivity's stock has tripled since then, as investors cheered the divestment. The deal significantly widened Tivity Health's margins and focused it on its faster growing businesses, which sell healthy lifestyle products and services, primarily to seniors. Tivity Health's main businesses are SilverSneakers, a program that provides regular exercise and social opportunities for seniors; Prime Fitness, which helps people stick with fitness plans; and WholeHealth Living, a specialty health benefits manager.   Changes at the company were catalyzed by hedge fund North Tide Capital, which in 2014 installed three board members and a new chief executive at the company.

Distressed and confused, Hadiza roamed the streets until her older brother found her and took her to a shelter for vulnerable girls and young women - many of whom are victims of child labor, sexual violence, early marriage and teenage pregnancy.  They took me in and provided for me - everything from food to shelter to clothing to education right up until university,   Hadiza, now 32 and a graduate in information technology, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from her home in Yola.  Hadiza is one of thousands of girls and women who have received support from the Centre for Women and Adolescent Empowerment (CWAE) that has come under attack repeatedly since it started in the late 1990s for going against Islamic values. As well as helping the girls, the organization supports their parents, giving them money so they can send their daughters to school rather than making them sell wares on the streets or marrying them off in the predominantly Muslim city. Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children in the world, more than 10.5 million, and 60 percent of them are girls, according to the United Nations children's fund (UNICEF).  Parents feel that the only way they can survive is to send their girls to roam around and carry things on their heads to sell,  said CWAE coordinator Turai Kadir.  If we do not assist the parents, they cannot allow their girls to go to school.  The center is also caring for and providing education to girls and women uprooted by jihadist group Boko Haram's eight-year insurgency to establish an Islamic caliphate, which has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced 2.7 million.  Opposed and Attacked In cases when the CWAE cannot dissuade parents from giving their daughter away for marriage, they instead ask community leaders to intervene or approach the girl's husband directly.  We pay nannies to look after the girls' children while they are in school,  said Kadir, adding that the group's funding comes mostly from wealthy benefactors.  We also look for funds to build crèches in schools, and clinics for pregnant mothers.  At least four in 10 girls in Nigeria are married before they turn 18, while almost a fifth are wed before 15, UNICEF data shows. Yet the prevalence of child marriage nationwide has fallen by nine percent since it was made illegal in 2003.  Forced marriage has reduced drastically,  said Kadir, explaining how the center helps current and former child brides to return to education or learn new vocational skills.  Yet the work carried out by the civil society group has been opposed by many people in Yola who believe promoting girls' and women's rights goes against the values and teachings of Islam. Rates of child marriage and literacy among girls are far worse in the mainly Muslim northeast, where there is a deep-rooted patriarchy, than in the rest of Nigeria, activists say.  Our office has been attacked a number of times,  said Kadir.  People have broken in and carted off equipment, there were times when people threw stones at our building, and some Alsatians we bought to guard the office were killed.  Kadir and her team, however, are undeterred in their work.  Every family needs to understand that their child has a right to go to school,  she said.  Because she is your child does not mean you have the right to put her in a cage.

The cutbacks come as the bank's Zurich neighbor UBS (UBSG.S), the world's largest private bank, also considers moving hundreds of staff out of London as Britain prepares to embark on divorce talks with the European Union. UBS and Credit Suisse joined big U.S. investment banks in setting up their European headquarters in London, giving them access to the European Union market. But now Brexit is forcing the Swiss and others to seek alternatives. For Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), the job cuts, which will take its London staff to roughly 5,000, is part of a paring down of its London operations that began in 2015 as the bank restructured under Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. One Credit Suisse executive said privately that high bonuses and the cost of doing business in the British capital made it difficult for Credit Suisse to turn a profit on its London operation. Brexit, he said, reinforced the determination to act.  A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the investment bank as a whole had  strong profit growth  and that the program of company-wide job cuts was most advanced in London. The bank does not provide a breakdown for the performance of its London operations.  The scale of the London cuts reflects a change in approach towards Europe's biggest financial center. Before it embarked on its cutbacks, Credit Suisse employed more than 9,000 staff and contractors in the city.  For the Swiss banks, it was always important to be in London, not least to be close to your wealthy customers,  Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel, said.  With Brexit, London has certainly lost some significance.   For Credit Suisse, which was under pressure to cut costs anyway, as well as UBS, the timing is fortunate. Brexit is a good opportunity.  The scaling back in London coincides with a shift in focus by both UBS and Credit Suisse towards Asia, the region with the fastest-growing number of millionaires. Other European centres could also benefit. Credit Suisse, which already has operations in Poland, opened a branch in Dublin more than a year ago, while UBS could bolster its base in Frankfurt. But UBS is biding its time in London until the end of this year before making any decisions on staff moves, one senior executive said, redoubling lobbying efforts for the status quo in finance to remain after Brexit. It expects roughly 1,000 staff in City of London may have to move after Brexit. But the number could be higher. Its chief executive Sergio Ermotti said up to 30 percent of its roughly 5,400 employees in London could be affected. If Britain's EU departure is abrupt and with no trading agreement in place to cover finance, one senior UBS employee, who asked not to be named, said the Swiss bank could be forced to move the majority of its London staff. Having earlier declined to comment, UBS said that was not correct.  Swiss bankers are still hoping for a smooth Brexit but frustration is growing over the lack of clarity so far.

Researchers examined data on drinking habits and death records for almost 15,000 adults who were followed for almost three decades. Compared to participants who said they never got drunk, people who did this at least once before age 15 were 47 percent more likely to die during the study period, while getting drunk at 15 or older was associated with 20 percent higher odds of death.  Early onset of drinking and drunkenness are associated with alcohol use disorders, and therefore may play a role in elevated alcohol use disorder-related mortality rates,  said lead study author Hui Hu, a public health researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville. But the study results suggest that addiction isn't the only factor contributing to premature deaths for early drinkers, Hu said by email.  We found that an estimated 21 percent of the total effects of early drunkenness were mediated through alcohol use disorders, suggesting that many other factors in addition to alcohol use disorders may play important roles,  Hu said.  To explore the connection between early drunkenness and a premature death, researchers analyzed data from interviews conducted in the early 1980s that asked people if they had ever had a drunken episode and how old they were the first time it happened. Most participants were between 18 and 44 years old when they completed the interviews.  A total of 9,089 participants, or 61 percent, said they had been drunk, with most of them first getting drunk at or after age 15. About 13 percent of the people who had been drunk did this for the first time before they turned 15.  About 37 percent of the people who got drunk before age 15 had diagnosed alcohol use disorders at the time of the baseline interviews, compared to an 11 percent rate of these disorders in the overall group, researchers report in Drug and Alcohol Dependence.  By the end of the study period, 26 percent of those who had been drunk before age 15 had died, compared to about 23 percent of those who got drunk later and 19 percent of those who had never been drunk.  The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how people's age when they first get drunk influences how long they live.  Another limitation of the study is that researchers combined people who said they never got drunk and people who abstained from alcohol altogether into one category. They also didn't distinguish between teens who got drunk at 13 or 14 from kids who got drunk even younger, the authors note.   We know that alcohol abuse leads to earlier mortality, but it is also possible that earlier abuse reflects other genetic or environmental characteristics that lead to earlier mortality,  Dr. Michael Criqui, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  Early drunkenness might point to other risk factors such as risk-taking behavior, mental health issues or a lack of social or economic support that might influence overall health and longevity, noted Dr. Gregory Marcus, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn't involved in the study.   No one should interpret these data to mean that their fate is sealed,  Marcus said by email.  On the contrary, these findings are useful exactly because they may help us identify those at risk so we can prevent these adverse outcomes.  Because the increased mortality risk exists even among people without alcohol addiction, it's possible that people who aren't diagnosed with alcohol use disorders might still need be careful about how much they drink, said Joy Bohyun Jang of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.   Those with alcohol use disorders may receive attention to their alcohol use behaviors by practitioners or they themselves may be cautious about their alcohol use,  Jang, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  But what this study tells us is that those without alcohol use disorder may need the same level of attention if they experience drunkenness early in their life.

By the end of the year, if all five of the projected appeals materialize, there will be further delays of several months in fully staffing and taking up these appeals,  Bhatia told an audience at the WTO in Geneva.  This problem cannot be expected to go away by itself.  The WTO is run by its 164 members, and any change to its rules or working practices needs to be agreed unanimously. Even the smallest tweak to the rules can be contentious. Reform of the WTO's dispute settlement rules has been on the table for years, but there is no sign of progress.  Bhatia said the rules were set up to ensure prompt resolution of disputes, because  in the world of commerce, time really is money . But in recent years, the system had  substantially ceded ground on this , he added.  More disputes were now being appealed, especially the more complicated ones, and more cases went on to a second stage where the parties argued over whether or not the defendant had complied with the original ruling, he said.  The largest WTO cases include a dispute between the European Union and the United States over funding for aircraft giants Boeing and Airbus, and a four-country attempt to stop Australia's stringent anti-tobacco laws.  Recent appeals have covered diverse areas of trade law, including environmental protection, renewable energy subsidies, tax evasion, money laundering, patent protection, food safety, animal welfare, consumer information and more, Bhatia said.  During the tobacco dispute, Australia complained that the countries that brought the litigation were deliberately holding up proceedings to discourage other countries from introducing similar anti-tobacco legislation.   To the extent that delays in dispute resolution involve delays in the assertion of the rule of law, they provide an incentive to those who benefit from those delays,  Bhatia said.

The unknown gunmen attacked the convoy as it drove toward Juba on a highway linking the South Sudan capital with Nimule, on the country's southern border with Uganda. The ambush happened in an area called Moli, 140 km (85 miles) from the capital, even though the convoy was escorted by members of a joint army and police force that guard convoys traveling in the dangerous region.  At around 11 am, the convoy of buses and other vehicles coming from Nimule heading to Juba fell into an ambush near Moli village,  Brigadier-General Daniel Justin Boulogne, a South Sudan police spokesman, said.  The shooting happened at the first car of our organized force. The attackers opened fire on them and four vehicles were burned. We have confirmed 14 people were shot and 35 others wounded,  he said. The attackers fled as the security escort returned fire. Boulogne said authorities were still working to establish an official casualty list. Police do not know how many people were in the convoy in all, he said. South Sudan, the world's youngest country, has been mired in civil war since President Salva Kiir dismissed his deputy Riek Machar, in 2013.  In April 2016 the United States and other Western nations backed a peace accord that saw Machar return to the capital and again share power with Kiir. But the deal fell apart less than three months later and Machar and his supporters fled the capital, pursued by helicopter gunships. The fighting has forced more than three million people from their homes and has increasingly followed ethnic lines, leading the United Nations to warn of potential genocide.

Yields on bonds due in 2024 climbed to 5.15 percent in secondary market trading, according to Municipal Market Data, while Illinois' so-called credit spread over MMD's benchmark triple-A scale jumped to as much as 380 basis points.  It's a real meltdown today,  MMD analyst Randy Smolik said. He added that spreads over the scale widened by as much as 100 basis points for some bonds issued by Illinois, which already had the widest spreads among the 50 states. Late on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow said Illinois' action to make only minimal payments to healthcare providers in the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled due to an ongoing budget impasse does not comply with existing federal consent decrees. While the judge did not specifically push Medicaid payments ahead of other state priorities like debt service on bonds and pension, she set a June 20 deadline for Illinois and healthcare advocates to reach a deal resulting in  substantial compliance  with the decrees. That could be tough given the state's nearly $14.8 billion unpaid bill pile as of Wednesday and $1.85 billion of monthly priority payments that flow to bonds, pensions, schools, payroll and other mandated areas that consume 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. The consent decrees, which stemmed from cases filed in 1992, require Medicaid funding despite the state's budget problems.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-bonds-idUSL1N1J51MN"},

Frustrated at frequent engine failures and a lack of performance along with regular grid penalties, the twice world champion made his feelings clear.  We have to win,  the Spaniard told reporters at the Canadian Grand Prix when asked what it would take to have him stay.  If we are winning before September, or something like that, I will make a decision I will stay.  That looks a very tall order for McLaren, the only team yet to score a point this season and without a grand prix victory since 2012. The excitement and satisfaction of running up front at last month's Indianapolis 500, a race he entered instead of the showcase Monaco Grand Prix on the same day, clearly stoked Alonso's competitive fires. His goal remains a third Formula One world championship and if that cannot be accomplished with McLaren, then he will look elsewhere.  I want to win, I joined this project because I want to be world champion, and we are not in that position,  said Alonso.  If you don't see things changing and you are not in a competitive position maybe you change projects.  That is all I can say right now. Until I sit down with myself, in September, October, whenever, I cannot say anything 100 percent. The third world championship is my biggest priority.  Adding to the uncertainty around McLaren is the possibility the team could dump Honda in favor of another engine supplier. McLaren executive director Zak Brown told Reuters on Wednesday that the partnership with Honda has not worked so far and the team are now approaching a  fork in the road  and a parting of the ways was a real option. A sympathetic Brown said in that same interview that he totally understood Alonso's frustration because it matched his own, but hoped that the Spaniard would not make any rash decisions.  I think it will be purely dependent upon does he think we’re going to have a competitive race car next year,  said Brown.  He wants to race at the front of the field. And I get it.   There’s zero tension between Fernando Alonso and McLaren, the relationship has never been healthier. We’re frustrated together.  Fortunately he doesn’t have to make a decision today, we’re not asking him to make a decision today. We’ve been clear that we want him to stay and he’s been clear he wants to stay but we need a better race car so that’s where our attention is on.

Mostefa Souag dismissed accusations by some Arab powers that Al Jazeera is interfering in their affairs through its reports and defended the network's professionalism.  All this talk about Jazeera interfering in other countries' affairs is nonsense. We don't interfere in anybody's business, we just report,  he told Reuters in his office at the network's headquarters in Qatar's capital.  If we bring (in) guests who are opposing certain governments, does that mean we are interfering in the countries' business? No. Al Jazeera's editorial policy is going to continue the same regardless of what happens with this event.  The state-funded television network is at the center of the dispute in which Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties and transport links on Monday with Qatar, which supplies natural gas to world markets. Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives also cut ties with Qatar later. Qatar says the moves to isolate it over alleged ties to terrorism, which it denies, are endangering stability in the Gulf region. After Souag spoke, a source at the broadcaster said it was combating a large-scale cyber attack on its media platform, but all its entities remained operational.  Founded in 1996 as part of Qatar's efforts to turn its economic power into political influence, Al Jazeera won millions of viewers across the Arab world by offering uncensored debate rarely seen on other local broadcasters in the region.

Regrets Over Office Closures  Slideshow (8 Images)But the network has caused suspicion among many governments over the air time it gave to Islamist groups in Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Arab rulers also accuse Qatar of using it as a mouthpiece to attack them.  This is a question that comes again and again, the government and how much they interfere,  said Souag.  We have never had any communication with them. Literally we don’t have any communication with them.  Souag regretted that Saudi Arabia had closed Al Jazeera's office in Riyadh, a move that international media watchdog Reporters Without Frontiers called  a political decision that amounts to censoring this TV broadcaster.   Jordan has also closed down Al Jazeera's office in Amman and     local media in the countries that cut ties with Qatar have suggested the pan-Arab network could be shut down in an effort by Qatar to appease its neighbors.  We are very sorry that some countries decided to stop Jazeera from working,  Souag said.  Jazeera is going to continue covering all these countries as much as we can. We hope these decisions will be revoked.  He added:  If they have a political problem with Qatar, they (should) discuss it with the government - not with Al Jazeera.

The former banker, Jorge Arzuaga, is expected to plead guilty over his role in the corruption related to FIFA, the governing body for soccer, one of the people said. A lawyer for Arzuaga declined to comment, while Arzuaga did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, which is prosecuting the FIFA case, also declined to comment. More than two years after FIFA officials were arrested at a five-star Zurich hotel, Julius Baer is trying to minimize the fallout over its connection to the scandal as it wants to ensure that a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) is not jeopardized. Switzerland's third-largest private bank agreed to a DPA in 2016 after running afoul of the U.S. Department of Justice over helping wealthy Americans dodge taxes. A spokesman for Julius Baer said it fired an employee in 2015  after he had admitted having violated applicable laws and internal policies . But the employee, who sources told Reuters was Arzuaga,  never told anyone at the bank that any account was being used as a conduit for bribes and that indeed he denied having such knowledge , the spokesman added. The bank has been cooperating on the FIFA investigation and there is no indication it will impact its DPA, which requires Julius Baer to steer clear of wrongdoing for three years to ensure that charges are dismissed, the spokesman said. Gustavo Raitzin, Julius Baer's head of Latin America, and Marc Sulser, a regional team leader, have met prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's office in New York in recent months, sources said. The two bankers, who the Julius Baer spokesman said declined to comment, told the prosecutors they were unaware the bank was allegedly being used as a conduit for bribery. Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General said on Thursday it is investigating a former bank employee linked to the FIFA probe but the bank is not under investigation. A source familiar with the matter said the person is Arzuaga and the Swiss investigation could be resolved next week. Private Banker in Zurich Arzuaga, an Argentinean national who worked in Zurich as a private banker, handled accounts for sports marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco, several people familiar with the matter said. Burzaco, the former CEO of an Argentine sports TV company pleaded guilty in 2015 to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud conspiracies, admitting to bribing soccer officials for a decade in exchange for marketing rights to tournaments. Burzaco, a former Citigroup investment banker, avoided arrest in Zurich but later turned himself in and is due to be sentenced in November. His lawyer declined to comment. Citi said last year it had received a subpoena from prosecutors relating to the FIFA probe and was cooperating with authorities. A spokesman declined further comment. Arzuaga told Raitzin that he was worried about the accounts he was managing for Burzaco after the May 2015 arrest of seven FIFA officials in a raid on a Zurich hotel, one source said. Julius Baer advised him to get a lawyer and began an inquiry, firing him not long after the raid, the source said. Arzuaga is cooperating with U.S. officials and, two sources said, has told them that Raitzin and Sulser were aware of an account at the bank holding money for Julio Grondona, the number two official at FIFA who died in 2014. An account for Grondona at Julius Baer held millions of dollars, one of the sources said, but was affiliated with Burzaco, the person said. Raitzin and Sulser have denied Arzuaga's allegations, two people said. The bank knew that Burzaco was a client, but not Grondona, one of the people said. Arzuaga is under investigation in Switzerland over whether he tried to conceal that Grondona was the beneficial owner of an account, the person said. Arzuaga has admitted he received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Burzaco's sports TV company, the person said. After initially concentrating on FIFA officials and sports executives, U.S. prosecutors are now focusing on the role of banks, sources said, including UBS which said this year it was cooperating with inquiries and Israel’s Bank Hapoalim. A UBS spokesman declined comment, while a spokeswoman for Hapoalim declined to comment on  any dialogue between the American authorities and the bank's representatives.  Accounts Arzuaga handled for Burzaco at Credit Suisse, his previous employer, are also under scrutiny, one source said. Credit Suisse, which acknowledged U.S. and Swiss investigations in its 2016 annual report, declined comment.

In its semi-annual Financial System Review, the central bank said the market largely viewed the alternative lender's situation as  idiosyncratic to  Home Capital, and Governor Stephen Poloz later defended the sector as one which provides an important service.  There are lots of folks out there who are self-employed or have recently moved to Canada, other cases where they just don't have the paperwork it takes to walk in and be approved at a bank for a mortgage in 60 seconds because they don't fit the template,  Poloz told a news conference.  So this alt-lending sector does an important service, it fills that space ... and as you can tell from the stats that have been published, they have very, very low default rates, so it's a business that works.  Home Capital, which accounts for about 1.5 percent of Canadian mortgage lending, was Canada's biggest non-bank lender and typically the first port of call for would-be borrowers who did not meet banks' more stringent lending criteria. The rapid withdrawal of deposits at Home Capital beginning in April coincided with allegations by the Ontario Securities Commission that the company failed to adequately disclose a 2014-2015 review of mortgage origination business partners and underwriting processes, remediation actions and associated effects on business operations, the bank said. The company has said the accusations are without merit. The central bank said depositors were sensitive to information about the lending industry amid rising household indebtedness and housing market imbalances - the two biggest vulnerabilities to Canada's financial system.  This focus was particularly acute for HCG because its main business is mortgage lending to borrowers who do not meet all the lending criteria of traditional financial institutions,  the bank said. It added that federal financial sector authorities are  working collaboratively  to monitor HCG, which said in late May that it continues to work on developing longer-term liquidity solutions.

Slovenia promised to sell 50 percent of NLB this year and another 25 percent in 2018 in exchange for the European Commission's approval of state aid to the bank in 2013. The government, in a statement, said state-owned Slovenian Sovereign Holding (SDH), which is coordinating the NLB sale, set a price range of 55 to 71 euros per share, which would value the bank at 1.1 billion euros to 1.4 billion euros ($1.2 bln-$1.6 bln).  The government has not approved the minimum sale price,  Cerar told reporters after a cabinet meeting, adding it would seek a solution with the European Commission. The Commission said talks would continue.  We are in constructive contact with the Slovenian authorities. We cannot speculate further at this stage,  a spokesperson for the European Commission said. Analysts said the government would get about 1 billion euros at most for the whole bank, significantly less than 1.55 billion euros it put into the bank in 2013 to prevent it from collapsing under a large amount of bad loans. Last month the government also refused to give guarantees for what could amount to about 400 million euros in compensation to Croatian banks, who repaid depositors of NLB's predecessor Ljubljanska Banka and are now demanding the money from NLB. Ljubljanska Banka closed its business in Croatia after Slovenia declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 and Slovenia wants the repayment agreement to be part of succession talks between the ex-Yugoslav states. Slovenia has been reluctant to privatise its major companies and banks in recent decades so the government still controls about 50 percent of the economy and about 44 percent of the banking sector. NLB is the biggest company on the government's privatisation list and no other major sales are expected before a general election which is due in the middle of 2018. Slovenia sold 34 percent of NLB to Belgian banking group KBC in 2002 but later refused to allow KBC to acquire a majority stake in the bank. In 2012 KBC sold its stake back to the state.

The unknown gunmen attacked the convoy as it drove toward Juba on a highway linking the South Sudan capital with Nimule, on the country's southern border with Uganda. The ambush happened in an area called Moli, 140 km (85 miles) from the capital, even though the convoy was escorted by members of a joint army and police force that guard convoys traveling in the dangerous region.  At around 11 am, the convoy of buses and other vehicles coming from Nimule heading to Juba fell into an ambush near Moli village,  Brigadier-General Daniel Justin Boulogne, a South Sudan police spokesman, said.  The shooting happened at the first car of our organized force. The attackers opened fire on them and four vehicles were burned. We have confirmed 14 people were shot and 35 others wounded,  he said. The attackers fled as the security escort returned fire. Boulogne said authorities were still working to establish an official casualty list. Police do not know how many people were in the convoy in all, he said. South Sudan, the world's youngest country, has been mired in civil war since President Salva Kiir dismissed his deputy Riek Machar, in 2013.  In April 2016 the United States and other Western nations backed a peace accord that saw Machar return to the capital and again share power with Kiir. But the deal fell apart less than three months later and Machar and his supporters fled the capital, pursued by helicopter gunships. The fighting has forced more than three million people from their homes and has increasingly followed ethnic lines, leading the United Nations to warn of potential genocide.

Frustrated at frequent engine failures and a lack of performance along with regular grid penalties, the twice world champion made his feelings clear.  We have to win,  the Spaniard told reporters at the Canadian Grand Prix when asked what it would take to have him stay.  If we are winning before September, or something like that, I will make a decision I will stay.  That looks a very tall order for McLaren, the only team yet to score a point this season and without a grand prix victory since 2012. The excitement and satisfaction of running up front at last month's Indianapolis 500, a race he entered instead of the showcase Monaco Grand Prix on the same day, clearly stoked Alonso's competitive fires. His goal remains a third Formula One world championship and if that cannot be accomplished with McLaren, then he will look elsewhere.  I want to win, I joined this project because I want to be world champion, and we are not in that position,  said Alonso.  If you don't see things changing and you are not in a competitive position maybe you change projects.  That is all I can say right now. Until I sit down with myself, in September, October, whenever, I cannot say anything 100 percent. The third world championship is my biggest priority.  Adding to the uncertainty around McLaren is the possibility the team could dump Honda in favor of another engine supplier. McLaren executive director Zak Brown told Reuters on Wednesday that the partnership with Honda has not worked so far and the team are now approaching a  fork in the road  and a parting of the ways was a real option. A sympathetic Brown said in that same interview that he totally understood Alonso's frustration because it matched his own, but hoped that the Spaniard would not make any rash decisions.  I think it will be purely dependent upon does he think we’re going to have a competitive race car next year,  said Brown.  He wants to race at the front of the field. And I get it.   There’s zero tension between Fernando Alonso and McLaren, the relationship has never been healthier. We’re frustrated together.  Fortunately he doesn’t have to make a decision today, we’re not asking him to make a decision today. We’ve been clear that we want him to stay and he’s been clear he wants to stay but we need a better race car so that’s where our attention is on.

Yields on bonds due in 2024 climbed to 5.15 percent in secondary market trading, according to Municipal Market Data, while Illinois' so-called credit spread over MMD's benchmark triple-A scale jumped to as much as 380 basis points.  It's a real meltdown today,  MMD analyst Randy Smolik said. He added that spreads over the scale widened by as much as 100 basis points for some bonds issued by Illinois, which already had the widest spreads among the 50 states. Late on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow said Illinois' action to make only minimal payments to healthcare providers in the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled due to an ongoing budget impasse does not comply with existing federal consent decrees. While the judge did not specifically push Medicaid payments ahead of other state priorities like debt service on bonds and pension, she set a June 20 deadline for Illinois and healthcare advocates to reach a deal resulting in  substantial compliance  with the decrees. That could be tough given the state's nearly $14.8 billion unpaid bill pile as of Wednesday and $1.85 billion of monthly priority payments that flow to bonds, pensions, schools, payroll and other mandated areas that consume 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. The consent decrees, which stemmed from cases filed in 1992, require Medicaid funding despite the state's budget problems.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-bonds-idUSL1N1J51JF"},

A final survey backed other opinion polls in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the Conservatives had widened their lead following a tricky campaign in which their support appeared at times to be ebbing away.  But as many as one in five voters was still undecided this week after a seven-week campaign overshadowed in the later stages by two Islamist attacks that killed 30 people in Manchester and London in less than two weeks. Most polling stations had increased security as they opened at 0600 GMT, with armed police expected to reinforce regular officers at some locations. May smiled but did not speak to media as she and her husband Philip voted in the village of Sonning on the River Thames in her Maidenhead constituency.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn grinned broadly and gave the thumbs-up to reporters and party workers as he voted in Islington, north London.  I'm very proud of our campaign,  he said.    An Ipsos MORI poll for the London Evening Standard on Thursday put the Conservatives on 44 percent and Labour on 36 percent, a wider lead than a week ago but one which would not give the landslide win foreseen when May called the election seven weeks ago.  The Conservatives had a wobble last week, but have regained a clear lead in the last few days,  said Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI. Headline rates for sterling, hit two-week highs in morning trade in London after the latest polls before later slipping back on concern the election was too close to call.    Market bets on how volatile the pound will be over the next 24 hours surged to their highest in a year.   The market has not bet everything on having a nice clear outcome - it knows we might get a surprise,  said Societe Generale chief macro strategist Kit Juckes.  The only outcome that's got enough clarity to get short-covering is a bigger Conservative majority.  Related CoverageFinal UK opinion poll shows PM May's Conservatives' lead wideningFactbox: How will the United Kingdom election work?From landslide for May to upset defeat - scenarios for UK electionVoting ends at 2100 GMT and an exit poll will be issued then. The first handful of seat results are expected to be announced by 2300 GMT, with the vast majority of the 650 constituencies due to announce results between 0200 GMT and 0500 GMT on Friday morning. Both main parties were on the defensive after Saturday's van and knife attack in the heart of London. May faced questions over cuts in the number of police officers during her six years as interior minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn drew criticism for, among other things, voting against some counter-terrorism legislation. Police investigating the London attacks said they had arrested three more suspects late on Wednesday. Two of the men, aged 27 and 29, were held on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism while the third was detained over suspected drugs offences.  In the final hours of campaigning, both leaders returned to their core campaign messages.  If we get Brexit right, we can build a Britain that is more prosperous and more secure, a Britain in which prosperity and opportunity is shared by all,  May said in a last appeal to voters to trust her to  knuckle down and get the job done . After becoming prime minister without an election in the turmoil that followed last year's EU referendum, May wants a personal mandate and a parliamentary majority bigger than the one she inherited from predecessor David Cameron. Basing her campaign on the slogan of  strong and stable leadership , she has said she alone could face the 27 other EU leaders and clinch a deal that would give Britain control over immigration policy while ensuring favorable trading terms. Britain's Primer Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip leave a polling station in Sonning, Britain, June 8, 2017.Eddie KeoghShe has portrayed Corbyn as the weak and hapless leader of a spendthrift party that would hit voters with a  tax bombshell , crash the economy and flounder in the Brexit negotiations. Corbyn has hit back that Conservative fiscal austerity imposed since 2010 has hurt the poor and widened social inequalities. Views from Brussels May's campaign has not gone to plan, and as the poll leads of 20 points or more she was enjoying when she called the early election in April have shrunk, talk of a landslide victory has faded and her personal standing has taken a hit. As a result, the extent of her control over her fractious party and of her margin for maneuver going into the Brexit talks will hinge on the size of her majority, and on whether it is perceived to be a significant improvement on Cameron's. Provided she wins, she will have averted at least one risk: by pushing back the date of the following election to 2022 rather than 2020 as originally planned, she has ensured she will not face crunch time in the Brexit talks at the same time as an election. Slideshow (35 Images)Some in the EU are hoping May does increase her majority, on the basis that the main risk for the bloc is a collapse in talks, and that is more easily avoided with a British government that is not vulnerable at home.  We need a government strong enough to negotiate,  a senior EU lawmaker told Reuters. But others have sought to downplay the impact of the election regardless of the outcome, suggesting that it was little more than a domestic political sideshow.  Will the election of more Tory (Conservative) MPs give May a greater chance of securing a better Brexit deal? For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance,  wrote Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, in an opinion column in the Guardian newspaper.  Maybot  May's troubles began on May 18, when she announced a new policy on care for the elderly that quickly proved unpopular. She backtracked days later, prompting opposition critics to pour scorn on her central claim to offer strong leadership. Opponents were quick to remind voters that May had campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU before embracing Brexit after the referendum, and that she had insisted for months an election would not be in the national interest before calling one. May has reacted by sticking to her campaign messages, endlessly repeating the same slogans and appearing mostly at tightly controlled events - prompting many in the media to deride her as an uninspiring  Maybot . Meanwhile, veteran left-winger Corbyn, who was written off as a no-hoper by most political analysts, surprised on the upside with a policy-rich campaign that drew large, fervent crowds to his events - although skeptics say his appeal in the broader electorate is limited. He proposes building a fairer society through policies such as raising taxes for the richest 5 percent, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds ($315 billion) in infrastructure - plans which the Conservatives say are fiscally irresponsible.  Labour’s campaign has already changed the face of British politics,  Corbyn said in a final campaign rally.  As we prepare for government, we have already changed the debate and given people hope. Hope that it doesn't have to be like this, that inequality can be tackled, that austerity can be ended, that you can stand up to the elites and the cynics.

Promises made by political parties in the run-up to the June 11 election to improve the economy and increase salaries have not convinced Tasholli that his children would have a better future in Kosovo.      If I had a chance I would leave with my bike to Europe, now, this minute,  said Tasholli, who supports a family of six. More than nine years since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, nearly one third of the population is unemployed while the average salary is around 300 euros a month. But the country's growth remains strong mainly thanks to remittances from abroad which account for around 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).  The government of prime minister Isa Mustafa collapsed in a no confidence vote a month ago after the opposition accused it of failing to meet its pledges to improve the lives of Kosovo's 1.8 million people. Agron Bajrami, editor in chief of Kosovo's leading newspaper Koha Ditore, said one month was not enough for political parties to prepare for the election.   Not a single party had time to prepare a detailed plan and explain how economic growth will be reached,  he said. Switzerland of the Balkans During the campaign, parties have promised economic growth of 8 percent a year and to raise public sector wages by up to 40 percent. Kadri Veseli, president of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, told supporters:  Kosovo will be the Switzerland of the Balkans.  Opinion polls point to a coalition of parties run by the war-time commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) who fought Serb forces during the 1998-99 conflict. Former prime minister Ramush Haradinaj, a candidate to become PM again, said he would renegotiate a border deal with Montenegro, which the European Union sees as a condition to lifting visa-free travel for Kosovars.  Serbia, which considers Haradinaj a war criminal, says his election would slow the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, a pre-condition for both countries to progress towards EU membership.  Serbia refuses to recognise Kosovo's independence and with its ally Russia is blocking its United Nations membership.  Besart Bojaj, 22, an architecture student from Klina, spent more than 200 euros to apply for a visa to Sweden and explore options to get a masters degree. His counterparts from Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania do not need a visa.  Kosovo is the only country in the region that does not have visa-free travel with the EU because of its failure to agree the border deal with Montenegro.   We are treated as cows, we have enough to eat but no right to get out of the cage and see what is happening around us,  said Bojaj.

Pointing to Canada's two largest housing markets, Toronto and Vancouver, where prices have more than doubled in recent years, Poloz said the longer prices rise unsustainably, the more he becomes concerned about a correction. In its semi-annual Financial System Review, the central bank laid out heightened concerns about Canada's long housing boom and consumer debt binge, saying that rapid acceleration in home prices combined with record levels of household debt pose a risk to Canada's financial system. But the bank said Canada's mortgage market is different than the one that existed in the United States prior to the housing crash, and Poloz pointed to signs of economic strength that have finally emerged in Canada's economy.  At this stage, I'm just comforted by the fact that the economy is showing better dynamics and that does go into this equation of financial risk as a positive. It means that the resilience is rising in the background, even if the vulnerabilities are also rising in the foreground,  Poloz told a news conference. Economists said the upbeat tone on the economy could suggest the bank was inching towards an eventual interest rate increase. The Bank of Canada cut rates twice in 2015 to stimulate the economy amid an oil price slump, but the cheap borrowing costs have helped fuel the housing boom and consumer debt. The bank is  accepting the economy is doing a little bit better right now and taking that maybe half a step further  in believing their forecast for economic growth will come to pass, said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. Still, the bank warned that the share of uninsured mortgages is growing and some are showing riskier characteristics, including longer amortizations and the use of secondary loans and credit as buyers stretch to get into the expensive market. It also said the greater use of home equity lines of credit could be contributing to vulnerabilities, echoing concerns raised by a consumer agency on Wednesday. Rapid price gains in Toronto suggest the market has entered a phase in which these  extrapolative expectations  are becoming more pervasive and speculative buying is taking place, the bank said in the report.

Going private, which would involve raising debt, would be a risky but potentially profitable bet by Nordstrom's founding family and largest shareholder bloc that the company can reshape itself and emerge from the retail meltdown stronger. Shares of the Seattle-based clothing and accessories retailer were last up 11 percent after having surged as much as 18 percent in their biggest intraday percentage gain since February 2009. The company now has a market value of about $7.4 billion. The move comes as U.S. malls have been struggling with slowing customer traffic and as mall anchors like Nordstrom and Macy's Inc are trying to revive sales. Nordstrom in May reported first-quarter same-store sales that fell short of estimates, triggering a drop in its shares. Shares of other U.S. department store chains also rose after Nordstrom's announcement. Dillard's Inc gained as much as 6.3 percent, Macy's rose 3.3 percent and Kohls Corp climbed 1.3 percent in Thursday morning trading. Going private may help Nordstrom restructure its business, which is more difficult as a public company, said Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of Vivaldi, a consulting firm that works with retail brands.  It's the right move,  he said. The exploration of going private, which could add to the retailer's debt, comes amid a wave of store closures and bankruptcies in the retail industry. High-end department store chain Neiman Marcus, meanwhile, went private in 2005 and said in March it is exploring options as it seeks relief from its swelling debt pile. But going private may be slightly easier for Nordstrom, analysts said.  Nordstrom is not highly levered, they have quite a bit in their way of real estate assets so is it probably easier for them to actually get this transaction done,  said Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE. Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle, Nordstrom went public in 1971. The retailer, known for its high-end department stores and customer service, sells designer items including Jimmy Choo stilettos and Burberry trench coats. Nordstrom operates 354 stores in 40 states and owns stores in Canada and Puerto Rico. It also runs Nordstrom Rack, an off-price discount clothing and accessories chain. Taking It Private In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the department store operator said the group formed to consider going private had not made a formal proposal. The group comprises Chairman Emeritus Bruce Nordstrom, his sister Anne Gittinger, President James Nordstrom and co-Presidents Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom. The group, which owns 31.2 percent of the company, said it was not interested in selling its stake to third parties or voting for an alternative deal. With the Nordstrom family's share ownership, the odds of a deal getting done are higher, said Chuck Grom, analyst with Gordon Haskett. The ownership would appear to satisfy the requirements of a leveraged buyout transaction, he said. Grom estimates at a share price of $46, retailer would need to raise $5.45 billion to $8.19 billion of additional debt to fund the takeout. The largest shareholders in the company from the group include Bruce Nordstrom with 16.9 percent of outstanding shares, followed by Gittinger with 9.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Peter and Blake Nordstrom own about 1.7 percent each.  Because of the changing dynamics in the retail environment, the group is evaluating whether the long-term interests of the issuer (Nordstrom) are better served as a privately held company,  the members of the Nordstrom family said in a filing. The company's board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore the possibility of any transaction that could be made by the group. The committee said it had entered into an agreement with the Nordstrom family members over some standstill provisions that would prevent them from taking certain actions until Jan. 31, 2019. The special committee has hired Centerview Partners as its financial adviser and Sidley Austin as legal counsel. With Thursday’s stock gains, Nordstrom short sellers who had been having a profitable year took a hit. With the stock up 11.5 percent in late morning trading, that had erased about three-quarters of the estimated $186 million gain on paper in 2017 for Nordstrom short sellers, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

The killings took place when the Islamists attacked and took over the town of Af Urur.   Now we confirm 38 people, mostly soldiers, died and 18 others were wounded. I believe some were captured alive and taken away,  Major Mohamed Abdi, a Puntland military officer, told Reuters.  Numerous, heavily armed al Shabaab fighters attacked us from every direction and after hours of fierce battle I was among those who ran for their lives.  Bari regional Governor Yusuf Mohamed told Reuters the Puntland military had recaptured the town.      The assault came days after Puntland sentenced to death five al Shabaab members arrested on April 26 as they drove a vehicle carrying barrels packed with explosives into Bosaso, Puntland's capital. Af Urur lies about 100 km (60 miles) south of Bosaso, near the Galgala hills, an area controlled by al Shabaab. Its fighters have attacked and captured the town several times.  Al Shabaab fighters killed local residents of the town including elders, women and children. It is the norm of al Shabaab to kill civilians when they are defeated,  a statement from the Puntland president's office said.  Al Shabaab will regret killing civilians. We shall eliminate the fighters who hide in Puntland areas.  The al Qaeda-linked Islamist group said it had killed 61 soldiers after overrunning the military base. The numbers given by officials and al Shabaab often differ. Abdiasis Abu Musab, a spokesman for al Shabaab, said the military had not recaptured Af Urur by force.  We just left it peacefully after killing 61 soldiers and capturing 16 military cars,  he said.  Al Shabaab more often launches attacks on the capital Mogadishu and other regions controlled by Somalia's federal government. It aims to drive out African Union peacekeepers, topple the Western-backed government and impose its strict version of Islam. Attacks are comparatively rare in Puntland, where the security forces are relatively regularly paid and receive substantial U.S. assistance. The region is also home to a splinter group of al Shabaab that has sworn allegiance to Islamic State. Security sources say a small contingent of foreigners is there as well.

The majority of judges on Brazil's top electoral court (TSE) argued to exclude testimony by executives from conglomerate Odebrecht SA, potentially strengthening Temer's assertions that his campaign received no illegal funding when he ran as former leftist president Dilma Rousseff's running mate in 2014.      The court is expected to rule by Friday on whether to annul the election and unseat Temer. A final decision, however, could take months if an unfavorable verdict is appealed by Temer to the Supreme Court.      Traders fear a protracted judicial process could delay Temer's bid to cut pension spending and reform labor laws, seen as critical to curb growth of public debt and shore up investor trust.     The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.9 percent.      Cia Energética Paranaense stock was one of the biggest decliners after the power utility confirmed plans to raise funds through a sale of shares.

The banking group is implementing the company's AI technology to automate anti money-laundering investigations that have traditionally been conducted by thousands of humans, the bank's Chief Operating Officer Andy Maguire said in an interview last week. The vast majority of anti money-laundering investigations at banks do not find suspicious activity, resulting in a waste of resources, according to the startup. In a pilot of Ayasdi's technology, HSBC saw the number of investigations drop by 20 percent without reducing the number of cases referred for more scrutiny, according to the startup.   It's a win-win,  Maguire said.  We reduce risks and it costs less money.   Banks have been ramping up their use of AI and automation over the past year to save money and time on cumbersome and manual processes ranging from compliance checks to customer service.  At the same time they have been working more closely with young financial technology companies and reducing the amount of technology that gets built in-house.  A handout graphic from the company Ayasdi Inc. shows their anti-money laundering machine intelligence technique. Ayasdi/Handout via REUTERSOne of the financial technology areas that has seen significant collaboration has been so-called  regtech , or technology that can help financial institutions stay compliant with regulations and avoid hefty fines in areas such as money laundering or market manipulation.   In 2012 HSBC agreed to pay a $1.92 billion in fines to U.S. authorities for allowing itself to be used to launder drug money out of Mexico and other compliance lapses.   To cope with increased regulatory scrutiny and a swathe of new rules, banks went on a compliance hiring spree in the years following the financial crisis. Anti-money laundering checks  is a thing that the whole industry has thrown a lot of bodies at it because that was the way it was being done,  Maguire said. Banks have recently started cutting back on compliance hiring as they start deploying new technology that can help automate some of the tasks. Maguire said AI technology can help with compliance because it has the ability  to do things human beings are not typically good at like high frequency high volume data problems  or augment human capabilities.  Ayasdi's Executive Chairman and co-founder Gurjeet Singh was in January appointed to HSBC's new technology advisory board, which provides advice and guidance to the bank on digital strategy.

At the general synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church in Edinburgh, over two-thirds of each house of bishops, clergy and laity voted in favor of the change. Britain legalized same-sex marriage in 2014 but no major Christian church had so far allowed same-sex weddings. This opens the way for gay Christians from any Anglican Church to marry in Scotland - but puts the Scottish church at odds with the rest of the world's Anglican community.  This is a momentous step,  David Chillingworth, head of the Scottish Episcopal Church, told the gathering after the vote.  By removing gender from our marriage canon, our church now affirms that a same-sex couple are not just married but are married in the sight of God.  The approval of same-sex marriage by the church was praised by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights groups.  This step allows couples to celebrate their love within their faith and sends a really positive message to other LGBT people, both here and around the world,  Colin Macfarlane, director of LGBT charity Stonewall Scotland, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  It signals that members of the church welcome, recognize and respect LGBT people as part of the faith community.  Chillingworth said the ruling was not unanimous and no member of the clergy would be made to preside over same-sex weddings against their will. The Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church opposed Britain's decision to allow same-sex marriages.  This same decision is difficult and hurtful for others whose integrity in faith tells them that this decision is unscriptural and profoundly wrong,  he said.

In the wake of the deadly Islamist-inspired attacks in Europe over the past two years, tech companies have come under increased pressure to do more to help police investigations, and law enforcement officials have bemoaned the slow process required to access data stored in the cloud in other EU member states. The European Commission will present three options to EU ministers which will form the basis of a future legislative proposal, including the possibility for police to copy data directly from the cloud, EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told Reuters on Wednesday.  I am sure that now in the shadow of the recent terrorist attacks and increasing threats in Europe there will be more understanding among the ministers, even among those who come from countries where there has not been a terrorist attack,  she said. EU justice ministers meet in Luxembourg on Thursday and will discuss the Commission's options. Based on their preferences, the EU executive will then come forward with a proposal by the end of the year or early 2018, Jourova said. The least intrusive option involves allowing law enforcement authorities in one member state to ask an IT provider in another member state to turn over electronic evidence, without having to ask that member state first. The second option would see the companies obliged to turn over data if requested by law enforcement authorities in other member countries. As an example, police in Italy seeking electronic evidence stored in Ireland would currently have to ask the Irish authorities to retrieve the evidence for them, a process critics say is slow and cumbersome. However, many in the tech community have voiced concern about allowing governments to force companies to turn over data stored in another country, fearing it could erode customers' privacy and make them less likely to use cloud services if they thought the data could be seized. FILE PHOTO - European Consumers Commissioner Vera Jourova holds a joint news conference on transatlantic data transfers, in Brussels, Belgium November 6, 2015.Delmi Alvarez/File PhotoMicrosoft Corp (MSFT.O) fought and won a high-profile battle in the United States against the Department of Justice's request that it turn over emails stored on a server in Ireland. The Commission weighed in for Microsoft in that case, saying data held by companies in the EU should not be directly accessed by foreign authorities outside formal channels of cooperation. BSA, representing major software companies including Intel (INTC.O), Microsoft and Oracle (ORCL.N), urged the EU to provide clarity and predictability for businesses.  We urge EU legislators to pursue measures that guarantee clarity and predictability, without putting service providers in ‘conflict of law’ situations,  said Thomas Boue, director general for policy, EMEA. The most intrusive option being considered by the EU could be envisaged in situations where authorities do not know the location of the server hosting the data or there is a risk of the data being lost, Jourova said.  This third option is kind of an emergency possibility which will require some additional safeguards protecting the privacy of people,  she said. Such safeguards include requiring that law enforcement requests are necessary and proportionate.  You simply cannot massively collect some digital data for some future use,  Jourova said. The types of data that could fall within the scope of the law will also be discussed on Thursday, with options ranging from non-content data such as location or traffic data to personal communications data.  My preference is to go for this as an extraordinary measure for extraordinary threats, for high gravity criminal offences such as terrorism and there I am in favor of enabling the use of personal data,  Jourova said, adding that no decision has yet been taken.

Because people with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis - collectively known as IBD - require specialized care, having to travel long distances to get it may lead to worse outcomes, the study team writes in the journal Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Advances in drug therapy have increased IBD patients’ treatment options and starting these therapies early may be key to success, the authors write. Previous studies have also found that mortality is much lower in IBD patients who are treated by gastroenterologists who specialize in these diseases, they note. “There’s a good amount of literature now that high volume hospitals and specialist experience is important for better IBD outcomes. However, we also recognize that access to such care is not always possible,” senior study author Dr. Ashwin Ananthakrishnan told Reuters Health in an email. “So we wanted to examine to what extent geographic barriers such as distance may place in influencing IBD outcomes,” said Ananthakrishnan, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The researchers used zip code and medical information from a registry that includes adult IBD patients who get their care at the hospital to place 2,136 patients into one of four groups based on travel distance from their homes. The average travel distance in each of the groups was 2.5 miles for those who lived closest, 8.8 miles, 22 miles and 50.8 miles for those who lived furthest from the hospital.  Based on treatment records, the study team found that patients who lived the furthest from the hospital had more than double the likelihood of needing surgery compared to those who lived the closest.  “Greater travel distance may affect need for surgery in patients with IBD by impeding early initiation of effective treatment,” the authors write.  The patients who lived the furthest away were also 69 percent more likely than those living closest to the hospital to need immunotherapy drugs and more than twice as likely to need biologic therapies.  “I think it is important for us to understand what it is that may be done differently at high volume centers - perhaps earlier initiation of effective and steroid-sparing therapy, appropriate thresholds for surgery, expert surgeons, etc.,” Ananthakrishnan said. We need to identify those differences and replicate them in more remote centers since it is not possible for all patients to receive their entire care at high-volume centers, he added. “From a patient standpoint, it is important for them to be engaged in the management of IBD, understand risk profiles of treatment, importance of effective treatment early, and their likelihood of complications or disease progression,” Ananthakrishnan said. Patients should also discuss their problems with their gastroenterologist if they are not getting the answers to these questions, he said. Ananthakrishnan noted that telemedicine would be helpful to answer some of these questions.  “Not all questions can be answered through (telemedicine), and I think care of some patients can be complicated. But for many, it should be ok,” he said. Among the limitations of the study is that it only involved one location, and it’s possible that patients who lived the furthest away were referred to the hospital because their cases were more severe. “There is need for further studies to determine how specialized IBD care may be provided in a decentralized way to optimize patient outcomes,” the authors write.

During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations,  to sort that out.   I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning,  Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI probe of Flynn. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on.  We're under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever,  he said. Comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the president's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trump's presidency, especially as the FBI probe has ensnared not only Flynn but Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. Comey's testimony drew renewed attention to Sessions and his relationship with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak.  After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Related CoverageTrump still standing, but damaged by Comey's testimonyInstant View: Comey accuses Trump administration of defaming himTrump lawyer criticizes Comey's leak to news mediaAsked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added:  Again, I take the president's words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.  Comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. 'Lies, Plain and Simple' Comey said Trump's administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.  Those were lies, plain and simple,  Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trump's administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election.  The Russian investigation is going to go on and it's not going to stop and the president should have known that,  committee member Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told MSNBC. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey's testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last year's election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. Former Federal Bureau of Investigations Director James Comey departs after testifying before a closed session of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 8, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinNBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in mid-June.   Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist. Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman confirmed to Reuters he was the friend to whom Comey was referring. Kasowitz said that  we will leave it to the appropriate authorities  to determine whether Comey's leak  should be investigated.  Legal experts questioned Kasowitz's contention that Trump's private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications. 'Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes'     Comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with Trump, but that if so, they should be released. Slideshow (9 Images) Lordy, I hope there are tapes,  Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because  I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.  From Capitol Hill to San Francisco's Castro district, Comey's appearance attracted television  watch parties  beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the  Super Bowl of Washington.  U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comey's testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trump's presidency.  Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, whom the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Kislyak. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the president's request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trump's position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation.      Yes,  Comey replied.     Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said.  He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way,  she said.  Regarding Sessions, Comey said he did not discuss Trump's pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with the attorney general because the FBI leadership team believed Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russia probe.  We were also aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,  Comey said, without giving more details. The Justice Department later issued a statement saying that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe only because he had been part of Trump's campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding:  I'll just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.

Comey on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia, but did not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.27 percent at 97.01. Against the yen, the greenback was up 0.26 percent to 110.07 yen, after rising to a two-day high of 110.38 yen.  So far we haven’t had any major surprises or any kind of bombshells released,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.  The dollar-yen ran up a little bit as the testimony got underway, suggesting a little bit of a relief on the fact that we are not likely to get a smoking gun from James Comey that we did not already know.  The euro fell after the ECB cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme. The euro, which weakened on Wednesday on reports that the ECB would cut its inflation forecasts, was down 0.4 percent to $1.121, after dipping to $1.1196, its lowest since May 31.  Even though it was well telegraphed over the last 24 hours, the future expectations on inflation came in a bit lower than the market had been anticipating,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.  That sort of weighed on the euro.  The euro has risen against the dollar in the past five months, partly due to the greenback's weakness, but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018. Meanwhile, sterling fell against the dollar while market bets on how volatile the currency will be over the next 24 hours touched their highest in a year, as Britain voted in a national election that some polls have suggested is too close to call. Sterling hit a two-week high of $1.2936 earlier in the session after polling organisations' last surveys, but weakened later in the day to trade down 0.18 percent at $1.2936.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released liquidity rules in October 2016 to improve the information available to mutual fund investors and make sure that firms can convert their investments to cash and meet redemption requests during market volatility.   The regulator specifically criticized leveraged loans, as trades can take six times longer to settle than bonds, which puts the asset in a ‘less liquid’ investment category. Loan settlement times rose to 18.9 days in the first quarter of 2017, from 17.8 days in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to IHS Markit data. The Loan Syndications & Trading Association recommends seven-day settlement, while bond and stock trades will be completed in two days from September.   Firms are running their funds through simulations to see if they comply, sources said. Third-party service providers are also developing programs to classify investments into four buckets as required by the rule, based on times that it would take to convert holdings to cash without significantly changing their value. Managers need to ask: “What does the portfolio look like when bucketed; what do you think a reasonably stressed version of your portfolio looks like; what do you think redemption pressures might be?” said Nathan Greene, co-head of the asset management group at law firm Shearman & Sterling.   Firms have also set up internal working groups with members from their compliance, legal, operations and portfolio management teams to assess the rule and develop their strategy, he said. Mutual funds are preparing for the regulations but are hoping that trade associations will convince the SEC to delay the December 2018 compliance date and release a frequently-asked-questions document to give further clarity.   Funds need more time because new compliance systems are time consuming to build, and their resources are stretched trying to meet multiple regulations at the same time. Investment Company Institute (ICI) then General Counsel, David Blass, said on March 13 that the SEC should keep an open mind about revisiting some regulations, including the liquidity risk management rule, to “prevent any negative unintended consequences or unnecessary costs.”  “The SEC’s liquidity rule is quite complex, and is proving enormously expensive, time-consuming, and challenging to implement,” according to an ICI statement. “For those reasons, we are exploring with members ways to make the rule more workable and implementation less burdensome.”   An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. Several third-party service providers and mutual fund administrators are developing software programs that could help with compliance as managers consider their options.  IHS Markit is expanding its existing liquidity services to include a data field for the number of days it will take to liquidate a position, an estimate of the pricing impact and the SEC bucket that the asset would fall into, Dan Huscher, director of fixed-income pricing at the firm, said.  The firm discussed the rule at a roundtable with more than 100 participants in San Francisco on April 28 and plans to have the new information available in the third quarter of this year, he said. Long settlement times are not curbing investors’ interest in loans. Loan funds experienced 28 straight weeks of inflows through May 24 on the back of rising interest rates, according to Lipper.  “The market has begun to head in the right direction with efforts being made to improve the loan cycle on both the buy- and sell-sides,” said Adrian Marshall, head of the loan portfolio management desk at BlackRock.  BlackRock is also beginning work on the rule’s classification and reporting requirements. “The market understands what regulators are saying and how to adapt, but more work needs to be done in terms of continuing to improve loan settlement times,” he said.

Ross told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that he believes there is  a genuine national security issue that must be considered in this case,  the second major signal in two days that the Trump administration is preparing new steel import restrictions.   In a speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Trump said:  Wait until you see what I'm going to do for steel and for your steel companies. We're going to stop the dumping, and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. You'll be seeing that very soon.  The steel review under a Cold War-era trade law would result in a  thoughtful  set of recommendations for Trump to consider for action, Ross said. He has previously said he expected to complete the study by the end of June. Ross identified three kinds of actions that could be recommended: imposing tariffs above the current, country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel products; imposing quotas limiting the volume of steel imports; and a hybrid  tariff-rate quota  option that would include quotas on specific products with new tariffs for imports above those levels. Choosing the latter option would help mitigate concerns over steel price inflation from tariffs, Ross said. Some steel users have voiced concerns that import limits would cause price increases that would make them more vulnerable to foreign competitors.  The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,  Ross said.  So we're very mindful of the need both to protect the domestic steel producers from inappropriate behavior on the part of foreign dumpers, but also to protect the steel consumers, the steel fabricators, the auto companies and everybody else who uses steel.

The struggling commodities trader is trying to extend a separate US$2bn loan as finding an investor to recapitalise the business looks increasingly difficult, leaving debt restructuring or bankruptcy as the most likely options, several sources said. Noble reported a surprise quarterly loss of US$129.3m for January-March and said that it will not be profitable for two years.  I’m fairly bearish on the whole thing, there are rumours that the company will file for Chapter 11 in the next couple of weeks,  a secondary loan trader said. Noble’s market value has shrunk to just over US$300m from US$6bn in February 2015, after Iceberg Research questioned its accounts. Its share price collapsed and credit ratings downgrades, management upheavals, asset writedowns, asset sales and a fundraising ensued. The secondary price of the US$1.1bn loan, which was put in place in May 2015, has been volatile this year. The credit was trading at around 75% of face value at the beginning of the year, rose to around 90 at the end of March, but has fallen heavily in the last month, two loan traders said.  There were a few trades at around 49 or 50, but the quotes are now lower in the 40s. It has fallen 45 points in the last month,  the secondary loan trader said. Some banks are now unable to sell as the price has dropped too low to get approval for a sale, a distressed loan trader said. The company’s bonds have also collapsed to distressed levels. Noble and its lenders have appointed legal counsel as the company struggles to maintain access to the US$2bn loan while time runs out to find an investor. Noble Group has appointed financial restructuring adviser Moelis and law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which typically specialise in complex and aggressive debt restructuring situations, as well as Morgan Stanley.  Noble has appointed the most active and aggressive restructuring advisers. When they were mandated, the secondary loan price dropped. The view from the market was that if they were hiring those guys, things must be pretty bad,  the secondary loan trader said. Restructuring adviser Alvarez & Marshal and law firm Clifford Chance have been hired to advise Noble’s US lenders and Clifford Chance is acting for lenders in HK, Reuters reported. Pitches for the European lenders took place on Wednesday, with Deloitte, PwC and FTI all vying for the mandate, according to one restructuring adviser.

While the ECB lifted economic growth projections, it said it saw inflation of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.3 percent in 2018, compared with its March forecasts of 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively. The ECB targets inflation of just under 2 percent. ECB chief Mario Draghi added that  substantial  amounts of stimulus through its unprecedented asset purchase scheme were still needed and that there was no discussion of future tapering at the meeting.  The market's initial assessment is that the ECB is not quite as close to policy normalization as previously thought,  said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London.  Euro zone government bond yields fell broadly, with some hitting multi-month lows. Germany's 10-year yield -- the bloc's benchmark -- hit a six-week low of 0.244 percent DE10YT=TWEB before rebounding late in the day to 0.26 percent. France's 10-year government bond yield FR10YT=TWEB fell to its lowest since January at 0.64 percent, down 3 bps on the day.  The euro, which had climbed as much as 10 percent in the last five months as the dollar weakened and euro zone growth and inflation picked up, fell back to a one-week low of $1.1195 EUR=EBS after the ECB meeting.  It was around $1.1230 when ECB chief Mario Draghi began speaking, leaving it almost half a percent lower on the day.      A surging euro was hit by a reality check today as ECB President Mario Draghi took a surprisingly cautious tone in his post-meeting statement, choosing to overlook an improved growth picture and instead focus on lower inflation,  said Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners.

Pricing now suggests investors do not anticipate a hike in the ECB's deposit rate over the next year.  Italian Cheer Southern European yields also hit multi-month lows, extending falls from earlier in the day as the chance for snap elections in Italy appeared to recede.  A deal struck among Italy's main political parties over a new electoral law has unraveled, a senior figure from the ruling Democratic Party said after his group lost a parliamentary vote on a proposed amendment.  This decreases the chances of election this year, and the market seems to be taking the view that bad news later is good news now,  said Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire.   Though yields fell further after the ECB meeting, this was the main driver for peripheral yields today.  Spanish 10-year yields hit their lowest since January at 1.47 percent ES10YT=TWEB, and Italian equivalents fell 12 basis points in their biggest one-day slide since December. IT10YT=TWEB. This cut the Italian yield gap over German benchmarks to its narrowest in a week, at 191 bps.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released liquidity rules in October 2016 to improve the information available to mutual fund investors and make sure that firms can convert their investments to cash and meet redemption requests during market volatility.   The regulator specifically criticized leveraged loans, as trades can take six times longer to settle than bonds, which puts the asset in a ‘less liquid’ investment category. Loan settlement times rose to 18.9 days in the first quarter of 2017, from 17.8 days in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to IHS Markit data. The Loan Syndications & Trading Association recommends seven-day settlement, while bond and stock trades will be completed in two days from September.   Firms are running their funds through simulations to see if they comply, sources said. Third-party service providers are also developing programs to classify investments into four buckets as required by the rule, based on times that it would take to convert holdings to cash without significantly changing their value. Managers need to ask: “What does the portfolio look like when bucketed; what do you think a reasonably stressed version of your portfolio looks like; what do you think redemption pressures might be?” said Nathan Greene, co-head of the asset management group at law firm Shearman & Sterling.   Firms have also set up internal working groups with members from their compliance, legal, operations and portfolio management teams to assess the rule and develop their strategy, he said. Mutual funds are preparing for the regulations but are hoping that trade associations will convince the SEC to delay the December 2018 compliance date and release a frequently-asked-questions document to give further clarity.   Funds need more time because new compliance systems are time consuming to build, and their resources are stretched trying to meet multiple regulations at the same time. Investment Company Institute (ICI) then General Counsel, David Blass, said on March 13 that the SEC should keep an open mind about revisiting some regulations, including the liquidity risk management rule, to “prevent any negative unintended consequences or unnecessary costs.”  “The SEC’s liquidity rule is quite complex, and is proving enormously expensive, time-consuming, and challenging to implement,” according to an ICI statement. “For those reasons, we are exploring with members ways to make the rule more workable and implementation less burdensome.”   An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. Several third-party service providers and mutual fund administrators are developing software programs that could help with compliance as managers consider their options.  IHS Markit is expanding its existing liquidity services to include a data field for the number of days it will take to liquidate a position, an estimate of the pricing impact and the SEC bucket that the asset would fall into, Dan Huscher, director of fixed-income pricing at the firm, said.  The firm discussed the rule at a roundtable with more than 100 participants in San Francisco on April 28 and plans to have the new information available in the third quarter of this year, he said. Long settlement times are not curbing investors’ interest in loans. Loan funds experienced 28 straight weeks of inflows through May 24 on the back of rising interest rates, according to Lipper.  “The market has begun to head in the right direction with efforts being made to improve the loan cycle on both the buy- and sell-sides,” said Adrian Marshall, head of the loan portfolio management desk at BlackRock.  BlackRock is also beginning work on the rule’s classification and reporting requirements. “The market understands what regulators are saying and how to adapt, but more work needs to be done in terms of continuing to improve loan settlement times,” he said.

Ross told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that he believes there is  a genuine national security issue that must be considered in this case,  the second major signal in two days that the Trump administration is preparing new steel import restrictions.   In a speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Trump said:  Wait until you see what I'm going to do for steel and for your steel companies. We're going to stop the dumping, and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. You'll be seeing that very soon.  The steel review under a Cold War-era trade law would result in a  thoughtful  set of recommendations for Trump to consider for action, Ross said. He has previously said he expected to complete the study by the end of June. Ross identified three kinds of actions that could be recommended: imposing tariffs above the current, country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel products; imposing quotas limiting the volume of steel imports; and a hybrid  tariff-rate quota  option that would include quotas on specific products with new tariffs for imports above those levels. Choosing the latter option would help mitigate concerns over steel price inflation from tariffs, Ross said. Some steel users have voiced concerns that import limits would cause price increases that would make them more vulnerable to foreign competitors.  The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,  Ross said.  So we're very mindful of the need both to protect the domestic steel producers from inappropriate behavior on the part of foreign dumpers, but also to protect the steel consumers, the steel fabricators, the auto companies and everybody else who uses steel.

The move comes after repeated complaints from some European airlines, notably Air France KLM and Lufthansa , about Gulf carriers receiving illegal government subsidies, charges Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad all deny. The proposal, which needs to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states before becoming law, would allow EU governments and airlines to submit complaints to the European Commission about any alleged discriminatory practices they face in non-EU countries or illegal subsidies benefiting non-EU airlines. Should the Commission find that the practices of a third country or airline are causing injury, or threat of injury, to European airlines it will be able to impose financial penalties or suspend some ground and other services, but not flights, and rights of the overseas airline in Europe.  We want to ensure that Europe remains a leader in international aviation, well connected to fast-growing markets, with efficient European skies,  EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement. The proposal will not interfere with bilateral air services agreements between countries setting out where and how often airlines can fly. Germany and France have previously called for such rules but some other EU member states have been staunchly opposed to the idea on the grounds they could harm bilateral deals and reduce connectivity in Europe. Many also saw it as a protectionist move to shield uncompetitive European carriers, something the Commission denies.  In aviation there is never going to be a level playing field,  an EU official said.  We're not here to protect those airlines if they have not put in place a good business model.  ACI Europe, representing Europe's airports, said the proposed regulation should ensure equality of opportunity.  This will hopefully allow us to move on from mere allegations and somewhat sterile debates to established facts and legal action, where needed,  said ACI Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec. Dubai-based Emirates said the aim should be balanced and non-discriminatory regulation serving as a catalyst for increased European liberalisation.  As a financially transparent carrier with a 30-year track record of delivering air connectivity to and from Europe, Emirates welcomes the European Commission proposal to promote fair competition in the global aviation market,  a spokeswoman for the airline said. The Commission also published guidelines clarifying the application of EU ownership and control rules that limit non-EU investors' stakes in European airlines to 49 percent. Investments by foreign airlines in recent years, such as Etihad's 29 percent stake in Air Berlin, have triggered suspicions that the control is actually being exercised by non-EU investors. The Commission sought to make clear how it assessed the exercise of control of an airline to bring legal certainty for foreign investors.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-aviation-idUSL1N1J51FO"},

Marquez threw a bullpen session Tuesday and was fine. Manager Bud Black said the thumb was  still a little sore  but the swelling had subsided and the medical staff plus pitching coach Steve Foster thought Marquez might benefit from an additional day of rest. OF Raimel Tapia, who was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque Tuesday when infielder/outfielder Alexi Amarista was put on paternity leave, will have a longer stay with the Rockies. He was originally going to be with them Tuesday and Wednesday and go back to the minors when Amarista returns Thursday. But OF Gerardo Parra's right quadriceps strain put him on the 10-day disabled list and will extend Tapia's stay.

Patterson, who hit .444 (8-for-18) in 10 games with the Rockies last September, is hitting .216 with eight homers and 34 RBIs in 53 games at Albuquerque, raising his average from .188 at the end of April with three homers and 12 RBIs since.  I was hitting for power, but I wasn't putting together consistent at-bats,  Patterson said.  What I take pride in personally is being a hitter first and letting the power kind of come with that. It was kind of like the exact opposite. I was jumpy and wasn't having the whip or freedom that I normally have.  Patterson did not play Wednesday, and before the game, manager Bud Black said,  This could be a very short stay for Jordan, because we anticipate Amarista meeting us in Chicago. So this could be as short as they come.  3B Nolan Arenado went 3-for-5 with three RBIs, on a two-run double in the third and his second triple of the season in the sixth on Wednesday. This was Arenado's fifth three-hit game of the season; the last was Friday at San Diego. He tied his season-high with three RBIs. It was his fourth such game, the last coming Saturday at San Diego. RHP Jon Gray (left foot stress fracture) will leave Thursday for High Class A Lancaster, where he will throw a second simulated game Friday and then begin a rehab assignment early next week. Gray, who was injured in his third start April 13, threw 35 pitches in a simulated game Tuesday at Coors Field followed by fielding drills. When he begins his rehab assignment, Gray will have to build up to 80-90 pitches before returning to the Rockies, a process that is likely to take three starts. LHP Kyle Freeland did not allow a walk for the first time in 12 career starts on Wednesday. He allowed six hits and run in 6 1/3 innings with five strikeouts in his team-leading ninth quality start. The Rockies are 9-3 in games started by Freeland, who is 7-3 and leads major league rookie starting pitchers with a 3.34 ERA. RHP Adam Ottavino (right shoulder inflammation) threw a bullpen session Wednesday and is likely to be reinstated Friday at Chicago when he is eligible to come off the 10-day disabled list. Manager Bud Black said,  Adam felt fine, threw all his pitches, great life to them. We feel as though he's healthy. He feels great physically and mentally. There's a very good chance he could be activated when he's able to come off, which is Friday.  In 23 appearances, Ottavino is 0-0 with a 2.57 ERA with 15 walks and 15 hits allowed in 21 innings and 24 strikeouts. OF Gerardo Parra (strained right quadriceps) was placed on the 10-day disabled list Wednesday. He pulled up while trying to steal second base in the third inning Tuesday night. Manager Bud Black said the Rockies medical staff said Parra was doing a little better than they expected Wednesday. Parra will accompany the Rockies on their seven-game trip to Chicago and Pittsburgh and will be able to hit in the indoor cage. After Tuesday's game, Black said Parra would  be back in a couple weeks.  On Wednesday, Black said,  That still could be the case. Once you get into day four, five, six, we'll have a better idea (of the timetable).  In his past 13 games, Parra has gone 18-for-34 (.529) with six multi-hit games to raise his average from .254 to .318.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED688N9P27"},

It was never completely -- some days were a little bit better than others, but yeah, headed in the right direction,  Ellsbury said.  We have a plan of what we're going to do today so just looking forward to moving forward and getting back on the field as soon as possible. Right now, what I can do is get my work in and just cheer the guys on.  As of Wednesday, the only activity Ellsbury is currently doing is riding on the bike.

Alex had good stuff,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  His command wavered a little bit, four walks in six innings. But he was making pitches and putting guys away.  RF Kole Calhoun saw his seven-game hitting streak come to an end on Wednesday. Calhoun struck out twice in three at-bats against Detroit starter Buck Farmer, then tapped into a double play against closer Justin Wilson. Even with the streak, Calhoun is hitting .230 with a .313 on-base percentage. But manager Mike Scioscia has been steadfast with batting Calhoun in the No. 2 spot. DH Albert Pujols had a single in four at-bats on Wednesday. He has a career .374 average at Detroit's Comerica Park. That is the highest average he has at any ballpark during his career. Pujols is looking for his first extra-base hit since hitting his historic 600th home run on Saturday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-playerwatch-idUSMTZED688N9P1R"},

OF Mitch Haniger made his second straight rehab start for Triple-A Tacoma on Wednesday afternoon, his first playing in the field. Haniger was in right field and went 0-for-3 as the Rainiers lost to Reno 8-3. Haniger has been on the disabled list since April 26 with a grade 2 strain of his right oblique muscle. Mariners manager Scott Servais, who often talks about being more concerned with the health of players rather than results when it comes to rehab appearances, admitted he'd like to see Haniger swinging well before returning to the majors.  You certainly don't want a guy to come back and go 0-for-15,  he said. DH Nelson Cruz wasn't in the lineup Wednesday and could miss more time because of tightness in his right calf.  He's been trying to play through it but (Tuesday night) it was barking a little bit,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said. Cruz was taken out of a May 30 game at Colorado and again in the series opener against Minnesota. Servais said Cruz underwent an MRI on Wednesday.  He's been swinging the ball very well, but we're trying to play big picture,  Servais said. Cruz is batting .299, leads the Mariners with 14 home runs and the American League with 46 RBIs. RHP Felix Hernandez, on the disabled list since April 26 with bursitis in his right shoulder, struggled in a rehab start Tuesday night for Triple-A Tacoma. Hernandez allowed five runs on four hits in two innings, giving up a grand slam to Reno's Ildemaro Vargas.  I was supposed to go four innings, I just got two,  Hernandez told The News Tribune of Tacoma.  The timing was off, I couldn't get my rhythm. I felt weird. But pain free, and that's the most important thing.  Hernandez is scheduled to make another start for the Rainiers on Sunday before perhaps rejoining the major league rotation next week. DH Carlos Ruiz hit his first home run since April 27, 2016, a solo shot in the third inning off Twins starter Adalberto Mejia. The 12-year veteran catcher was making only his second career start as the DH, replacing the ailing Nelson Cruz. Six of Ruiz's 11 hits this season have been for extra bases (five doubles, one homer). RHP Yovani Gallardo pitched a season-high seven innings against Minnesota. Gallardo, who had lost his previous three starts and had failed to go longer than 3 2/3 innings in two of them, had only one bad inning Wednesday, giving up four runs in the fifth. Three of those came on a three-run blast by the Twins' Miguel Sano.  Whatever happens with one pitch, you can't do anything about it,  Gallardo said.  You've just got to keep putting up zeroes.  RF Ben Gamel extended his career-high hitting streak to 10 games with a ninth-inning single. The hit proved pivotal, as Mike Zunino's followed with a walk-off homer in a 6-5 win.  I was just trying to get a walk, hit, whatever it takes,  said Gamel, who is batting .410 (16-for-39) during the streak.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-playerwatch-idUSMTZED688N9P1P"},

He will be activated from the 10-day disabled list on Friday, according to manager Brad Ausmus. McCann required stitches on his left hand after getting hit by a pitch in Houston on May 25. John Hicks, who was called up when McCann was injured, will likely return to Toledo. 3B Nicholas Castellanos tossed his helmet in frustration and accidentally hit Miguel Cabrera in the face on Wednesday after being removed for a pinch-runner in the eighth. Manager Brad Ausmus spoke with Castellanos about the incident afterward.  Nick's a competitive guy,  Ausmus said.  He wants to run the bases. It was my call to put (Andrew) Romine in there at the time. He was upset he was pinch-run for because of his competitive nature.  Romine entered for defensive purposes and is also the team's best baserunner. LHP Blaine Hardy was optioned to Triple-A Toledo when RHP Buck Farmer was promoted, leaving the Tigers with a seven-man bullpen. Hardy was 1-0 with a 4.15 ERA in 17 1/3 innings pitched this season with the Tigers.  The demotion is not a sign of disappointment in Hardy, according to manager Brad Ausmus. Once Justin Wilson became the closer, Hardy had taken on a bigger role, helping bridge the gap to the ninth inning against left-handed hitters. RHP Buck Farmer was recalled from Triple-A Toledo and started Wednesday's game. He was outstanding, tossing 6 2/3 scoreless innings while giving up just three singles and striking out five. Farmer, who won his only other start of the season against the Chicago White Sox on May 27, collected his second career victory. Manager Brad Ausmus said Farmer is now a member of the rotation. He replaces Matthew Boyd, who was optioned to Toledo last week to work on mechanical issues. RHP Justin Verlander will throw a bullpen session on Thursday, which will go a long way in determining whether he'll make his scheduled start on Saturday. He had a clean MRI on Monday after departing Sunday's start in the third inning because of right groin tightness.  Tomorrow will be a good indicator how he feels but Friday might be the better one,  manager Brad Ausmus said about potential after-effects of the bullpen session. If he can't go, Warwick Saupold could receive a spot start. LF Justin Upton ripped his 12th homer of the season on Wednesday, a three-run shot off Angels reliever Yusmeiro Petit. Unlike last season, when Upton struggled until the last six weeks of the season, the high-priced left fielder has steadily produced in his second Tigers season. He leads the team in homers, runs scored (36) and RBIs (34).  Last year, he got off to an extremely slow start, especially by his standards,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  This year, he's been one of the more consistent offensive contributors we've had. He's come up with some big hits twice in the last few games.

Sano's 416-foot blast, over Seattle's bullpen in left-center field, gave the Twins a three-run lead in a game they lost 6-5.  Miguel hit a hanging curveball,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  It put us ahead but we just couldn't find a way to add on.  RHP Brandon Kintzler suffered his third blown save of the season Wednesday, giving up a two-run homer to right field Seattle's Mike Zunino with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.  I didn't know he could go the other way like that,  Kintzler admitted.  I left a pitch out over the plate and he did what he was supposed to do there.  Kintzler, who has 15 saves, got two groundouts to open the ninth before allowing a single to Ben Gamel. Zunino then hit a 2-1 pitch for the winner.  Kintzler has been real good, but a lot of the damage was done when we got behind hitters,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  He gets behind 2-0 and they get a base hit up the middle, and he gets behind 2-0 and the guys hits a homer.  LHP Hector Santiago was placed on the 10-day disabled list with shoulder soreness. Santiago lasted just 2 2/3 innings in Tuesday's series opener in Seattle, allowing five runs in a 12-3 defeat.  He just didn't feel quite right warming up,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  He tried to get loose (Wednesday) but said he was OK, not great. There's a lot of season to go. The 10-day DL is the right thing to try to get him back 100 percent.  RHP Chris Heston was claimed off waivers from the Los Angeles Dodgers and was expected to join the Twins in Seattle on Wednesday night.  A couple of years ago he spent about the entire season in the San Francisco rotation, so he's got some length and experience,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said. Heston started the season in the Seattle organization and pitched in two games, including one start, for the Mariners. He went 0-1 with a 19.80 ERA before being claimed off waivers by the Dodgers. Molitor said Heston could be a candidate to start Sunday in San Francisco unless he's needed out of the bullpen before then. RHP Nick Tepesch was released. He had been optioned to Triple-A Rochester on May 13. Tepesch started one game for the Twins, an 11-1 loss to Boston on May 6. In that game Tepesch pitched 1 2/3 innings, giving up seven runs, only one earned, on five hits, with two strikeouts and two walks 1B Kennys Vargas was recalled from Triple-A Rochester to take the place of SS Jorge Polanco on the roster. Polanco was placed on the bereavement list. Vargas put on a show in batting practice, hitting a ball into the upper deck in right field at Safeco Field. The only player reach that level during a game was retired slugger Mo Vaughn.  Where I think he'll fit in the lineup, we'll use him,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said of Vargas.  When Jorge gets back, we'll see where we're at.  SS Jorge Polanco was placed on the bereavement list Wednesday after the death of his grandfather, Maximo Polanco, in the Dominican Republic. Polanco flew back home to the Dominican on Tuesday night.

The final rating is in line with the expected rating Fitch assigned to the notes on 23 May 2017 (see  Fitch Assigns 'B(EXP)' Rating to UBA's Senior Notes'). Based on Fitch's assessment on expected recoveries in a liquidation scenario, a final Recovery Rating (RR) of 'RR4(EXP)' is also assigned to the notes, implying average recovery prospects. The final RR is also in line with the expected RR Fitch assigned to the notes on 23 May 2017 KEY RATING DRIVERS The final rating is in line with UBA's Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B'. In Fitch's view, the likelihood of default on these notes reflects the likelihood of default of the bank. According to Fitch's criteria, a bank's IDR usually expresses Fitch's opinion on the risk of default on senior obligations to third-party, non-government creditors as in Fitch's view these are typically the obligations whose non-performance would best reflect the uncured failure of the entity. Where a bank has a Long-Term IDR of 'B+' or below, Fitch usually assigns a RR to the entity's issues. RRs provide greater transparency on the recoveries component of Fitch's assessment of the credit risk of a low-rated issuer's securities. RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in UBA's IDR would affect the rating of the notes and may also affect recovery prospects and the RR. UBA's IDRs are driven by the bank's standalone financial profile, as reflected in the bank's 'b' Viability Rating (VR). UBA's VR and IDRs are primarily sensitive to further asset quality deterioration and capital deterioration as well as continued pressure on foreign currency funding and liquidity.

Comey told U.S. lawmakers in the congressional hearing he had no doubt that Russia had interfered with the election but was confident that no votes had been altered. Investors also await the outcome of the general election in Britain as voting began on Thursday in a snap vote predicted to give Prime Minister Theresa May a larger parliamentary majority. The FTSEurofirst 300 of top European equities briefly hit a three-week low of 1,526.29 after the ECB said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump more stimulus into the region's economy. It still judged the euro zone economy to be rebounding and signalled it would not cut interest rates further.  Comey might move the markets in the short term but I don't think it's going to affect the intrinsic values of what many large U.S. businesses are worth,  said Mike Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. MSCI's all-country world equity index was last down 0.33 points, or 0.07 percent, at 467.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last up 66.28 points, or 0.31 percent, at 21,239.97. The S&P; 500 was up 3.87 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,437.01. The Nasdaq Composite was up 15.12 points, or 0.24 percent, at 6,312.50. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.04 percent at 1,528.71. Ecb Decision The euro hit its lowest since May 31 against the U.S. dollar of $1.1196 after the ECB announcement. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.3 percent at 97.016.  Even though (the ECB decision) was well telegraphed over the last 24 hours, the future expectations on inflation came in a bit lower than the market had been anticipating,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.  That sort of weighed on the euro.  Sterling fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.2936 ahead of the British election outcome. Oil prices rebounded after benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude prices hit one-month lows of $47.56 and $45.20, respectively. Those troughs were hit after an unexpected surge in U.S. inventories and the return of more Nigerian crude aggravated concerns about a worldwide glut. Brent crude was last up 2 cents, or 0.04 percent, at $48.08 a barrel. U.S. crude was last up 12 cents, or 0.26 percent, at $45.84 per barrel. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher after the ECB's upgrade of its euro zone growth forecast, with benchmark 10-year yields last at 2.201 percent compared to 2.180 percent late Wednesday. The dollar's gains pushed gold prices lower. Spot gold prices were last down 0.72 percent at $1,277.13 an ounce.

Kofola announced on Thursday that 50.8 percent shareholder KSM Investment, controlled by the Samaras family which revived the communist-era brand in the 1990s, would combine its stake with that of shareholders Rene Musila and Tomas Jendrejek in a new company called AETOS. The newly established company will hold 56 percent but will raise that to 68 percent next month by buying shares from second-biggest shareholder CED Group at 440 crowns per share, for a total price of 1.18 billion crowns ($50.38 million). Kofola's shares closed at 406.60 crowns on Thursday. CED, a unit of private equity firm Enterprise Investors, currently holds 37.3 percent. At the same time, a Kofola subsidiary will launch a tender offer by the end of June for up to 5 percent of Kofola shares, also at 440 crowns a share. AETOS and CED have also agreed to work on a potential share offering or placement next year of CED's remaining shares, amounting to  around 25 percent of Kofola, and up to a 3 percent stake held by AETOS. The potential offering of CED's shares would end the Warsaw-based Enterprise Investors' decade-long involvement in Kofola. At the end of 2015 Enterprise Investors sold a 6 percent stake in Kofola through a public share offering in Prague for 23 million euros. Kofola said in a statement it would also put in place a dividend policy of paying at least 60 percent of consolidated net profits until 2020. Kofola was revived in the Czech Republic in 1996 by Greek native Kostas Samaras and has since expanded throughout central and eastern Europe, booking 7 billion crowns ($300 million) in revenues in 2016 and earning 342 million crowns in net profit. It is the second biggest soft drinks maker in the Czech Republic, competing with the likes of Coca Cola, and leads the Slovak and Slovenian markets.

Comey, who was investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, but was confident that no votes had been altered. Comey said he was disturbed by Trump's bid to get him to drop a probe into former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, but would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. Investors were concerned that any major revelation by Comey could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here. So it's not particularly impactful for thinking about ... Trump's economic agenda to go through,  said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies & Co in New York. Earlier on Thursday, the European Central Bank signaled no further interest rate cuts as euro zone prospects improved, but said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump more stimulus into the region's economy. Investors are also awaiting the results of the UK general election. Opinion polls show Theresa May's Conservative Party leading between 5 and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority.  The market cares because if Theresa May loses the majority that would be disruptive of the Brexit process,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  Getting back into something that seemed to be a fair and orderly process into something that's going to be more disruptive would not be a market positive.  At 12:36 p.m. ET (1636 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 68.55 points, or 0.32 percent, at 21,242.24 and the S&P; 500 was up 4.06 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,437.2. The Nasdaq Composite was up 14.46 points, or 0.23 percent, at 6,311.84. Six of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the defensive utilities index's 1.04 percent loss topping the decliners. Financials rose 1.59 percent leading the gainers. Shares of Alibaba Group Holding were up 11.3 percent at $139.78 after the company said it expected revenue growth of 45-49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. Yahoo, which owns a 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba, rose 8.3 percent. Nordstrom jumped 10.6 percent to $44.78 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,624 to 1,188. On the Nasdaq, 1,832 issues rose and 926 fell.

The central European country only took in 12 people out of its quota of 2,691 under the scheme to relocate 160,000 migrants from the EU's southern fringe. The government, which faces an election in October with the majority of the electorate opposed to accepting migrants, agreed on Monday to suspend the program entirely. This puts the Czechs on a collision course with the EU's executive.  I was very displeased to read in the press that the Czech government is considering to halt relocations entirely,  Juncker said in a speech at Prague's Charles University.   I sincerely hope that, as in so many other cases, European reason, spirit and values will prevail and that the Czech government will reconsider its course so that we do not have to resort to legal infringement procedures, (which) we will do if nothing changes.  The Czech government cited security concerns and the scheme's failure to function properly for its decision. [nL8N1J23TM] Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have refused to admit any asylum seekers under the scheme. Slovakia and Hungary have challenged the quotas in an EU court. The Commission has said it would decide in June on any legal cases against countries failing to take in their share of refugees and other migrants. Juncker said EU members benefited from solidarity within the bloc and therefore had to show solidarity with others.  I am trying to understand national sensitivities about this matter. But more than just a principle, solidarity is a state of mind that goes to the very heart of what the EU is about. Solidarity is also not a one-way street,  he said.

A new bill, passed by the Federal National Council on May 31 and now awaiting presidential approval, will give domestic workers 30 days paid vacation a year, one day off a week, medical insurance, and a contract before starting work. The UAE relies heavily on migrant labor with an estimated 8 million migrant workers making up more than 80 percent of its population, according to the International Labour Organization, with many domestic workers hired from Southeast Asia. But the Gulf Arab state has been slammed by groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) for allowing domestic staff to endure long hours, unpaid wages and abuse.   The new draft law, however, was described by human rights groups as a step in the right direction.  The protections given to domestic workers are quite decent,  Jakub Sobik of Anti-Slavery International, a London-based rights organization, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The UAE's Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation said in statement on its website this month that the bill, once signed into law,  will bring the rights and protections afforded domestic employees into line with other workers in the UAE . The law will also prohibit employment of domestic workers aged under 18 and aim to tackle discrimination.  It is the first time that domestic workers will be protected for better rights ... although considered very basic protections, they are very important,  said Rothna Begum, Middle East women's rights researcher at HRW. But while welcoming the legal change, rights organizations voiced concerns about its enforcement and implementation - like how labor inspections will be conducted.  Domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse because ... they work in private households,  said Sobik.  Another area of uncertainty for the organizations is the fact that the  kafala  or sponsorship system, that forces foreign workers to seek their employer's consent to change jobs or leave the country, is still in place.  Vani Saraswathi, associate editor at advocacy group Migrant-Rights.org that works to advance the rights of migrant workers in the Middle East, said there also needed to be a wider discussion on how domestic workers are viewed and treated.   We hope that people would be more careful about exploiting the workers, but laws alone are not going to reduce abuse. I think there has to be a far wider discourse,  Saraswathi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

The move comes after repeated complaints from some European airlines, notably Air France KLM and Lufthansa, about Gulf carriers receiving illegal government subsidies, charges Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad all deny.  The proposal, which needs to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states before becoming law, would allow EU governments and airlines to submit complaints to the European Commission about any alleged discriminatory practices they face in non-EU countries or illegal subsidies benefiting non-EU airlines. Should the Commission find that the practices of a third country or airline are causing injury, or threat of injury, to European airlines it will be able to impose financial penalties or suspend some ground and other services, but not flights, and rights of the overseas airline in Europe.  We want to ensure that Europe remains a leader in international aviation, well connected to fast-growing markets, with efficient European skies,  EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement. The proposal will not interfere with bilateral air services agreements between countries setting out where and how often airlines can fly. Germany and France have previously called for such rules but some other EU member states have been staunchly opposed to the idea on the grounds they could harm bilateral deals and reduce connectivity in Europe. Many also saw it as a protectionist move to shield uncompetitive European carriers, something the Commission denies.  In aviation there is never going to be a level playing field,  an EU official said.  We're not here to protect those airlines if they have not put in place a good business model.  ACI Europe, representing Europe's airports, said the proposed regulation should ensure equality of opportunity.  This will hopefully allow us to move on from mere allegations and somewhat sterile debates to established facts and legal action, where needed,  said ACI Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec. Dubai-based Emirates said the aim should be balanced and non-discriminatory regulation serving as a catalyst for increased European liberalization.  As a financially transparent carrier with a 30-year track record of delivering air connectivity to and from Europe, Emirates welcomes the European Commission proposal to promote fair competition in the global aviation market,  a spokeswoman for the airline said. The Commission also published guidelines clarifying the application of EU ownership and control rules that limit non-EU investors' stakes in European airlines to 49 percent. Investments by foreign airlines in recent years, such as Etihad's 29 percent stake in Air Berlin, have triggered suspicions that the control is actually being exercised by non-EU investors. The Commission sought to make clear how it assessed the exercise of control of an airline to bring legal certainty for foreign investors.

Private debt investors have been battling against an increasingly aggressive middle market environment, where portfolio yields have been eroded by several quarters of tightening spreads and covenant-lite volume has soared. Year-to-date middle market institutional issuance including deals still in process has reached US$18.08bn, already surpassing the US$10.67bn booked in the first half of last year, as larger rated middle market borrowers take advantage of demand from institutional loan buyers, such as Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO). Anesthesia services provider US Anesthesia is arranging a US$1.4bn first- and second-lien loan via the broadly syndicated loan market, the proceeds of which will be used to refinance the company’s more costly existing debt and fund a US$162m distribution to the company’s shareholders. At least eight business development companies have exposure to US Anesthesia’s existing credit facilities, data from Thomson Reuters LPC’s BDC Collateral show. The new US$950m first-lien term loan is guided in the 325bp-350bp over Libor range, compared to the existing spread of 500bp over Libor. Faced with minimum portfolio yield requirements, some middle market credit managers are unlikely to be able to stay in the deal. Without a significant supply of new money deals in which to invest as repayments accelerate, investors are forced to decide whether to chase the market down, holding onto assets they like, or to be taken out by the institutional market and hopefully earning favorable prepayment fees. “You don’t like to lose the asset, but at least you want to get paid on the way out,” said one middle market direct lender. New Deals US Anesthesia’s deal is being arranged by a syndicate of banks led by Goldman Sachs with Barclays, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Antares Capital, BMO and CapitalOne and has been rated - a first for the company. A credit rating significantly widens the base of potential investors. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Moody’s assigned a B2 corporate family rating. The first-lien debt carries a B1 rating and the second-lien loan carries a Caa1 rating. S&P; rated the company B and assigned a B rating to the first-lien debt and a CCC+ rating to the second-lien debt. The deal also includes a US$150m revolving credit facility and a US$300m privately-placed second-lien term loan. Ares and Metlife are among the lenders taking down the second-lien loan - both members of the existing syndicate, sources said. US Anesthesia’s current capital structure includes an US$850m term loan and US$210m second-lien term loan, which grew over time through a series of add-on transactions since investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe announced the formation of single-specialty physician services organization in 2012. The sponsor owns 44% of the company while the physician partners and management own the rest. The company now generates approximately US$200m in earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to sources. In another example of middle market companies jumping to the institutional loan market, travel document services provider CIBT Global Inc has finalised a US$515m covenant-lite loan backing the company's buyout by Kohlberg & Company. The transaction, split between a US$330m seven-year term loan, a US$120m eight-year second-lien term loan and a US$65m five-year revolver, saw first-lien pricing drop to 400bp over Libor with a 1% floor from 525bp. Pricing will step down to 375bp over Libor at 5.5 times total net leverage. The loan sold at a 99.75 OID, narrowing from the 99.5 offered at launch. The second-lien tranche tightened to 775bp over Libor with a 1% floor from guidance of around 800bp. The discount was 99, unchanged from guidance. An investor in the deal, who said he expected to hold onto the asset despite losing 125bp of spread, said a lot of people would exit that cannot go below 400bp. Antares Capital was lead agent on both the first- and second-lien facilities, joined by Goldman Sachs and Jefferies as joint lead arrangers. Owl Rock was a joint lead arranger on the second-lien loan. CIBT was also issued with a first-time B3 corporate family rating by Moody’s in May. Additional reporting by Andrew Berlin.

Richard Boomgaardt, who lives in Britain and was head of State Street's transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud on July 12. The plea, disclosed in a court calendar notice on Thursday, would make him the second former State Street executive to plead guilty in the case, which is pending in federal court in Boston. Edward Pennings, a former senior managing director in State Street's London office, agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, according to court records filed on Tuesday. Pennings, who also lives in Britain, is scheduled to enter his plea on June 28. Lawyers for Boomgaardt and Pennings did not respond to requests for comment. The former State Street executives are among three who have been charged by U.S. prosecutors since April 2016 in connection with the probe. The bank agreed in January to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of £22.9 million, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. From 2010 to 2011 Pennings, Boomgaardt and Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president, conspired to add the secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for certain clients, prosecutors said. The clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios, prosecutors said. McLellan has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and wire fraud charges. His trial is scheduled for October. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v.

But the tide may be shifting as the summer is beginning under a warmer and drier regime. Driven partially by mounting U.S. weather concerns, July corn on Wednesday broke above the $3.60-to-$3.80 per bushel range it had been trading in for three months and new-crop December corn topped $4.00 a bushel for the first time since March 6.  So far this year, the corn market seems particularly unwilling to latch on to weather-related U.S. crop worries. Planting weather was cold and wet in many parts of the Corn Belt and the current crop conditions are not as good as they have been in previous years. But corn futures stuck within the range anyway as traders are often unstirred over planting hardships so long as the weekly progress numbers align with averages, which they did this spring. Long-range weather stories are going to be an even tougher sell, and the hesitation is understandable considering the botched forecasts from many weather vendors last summer calling for potential drought.  Instead, plentiful rains arrived in the key months of July and August and U.S. corn ended up breaking the previous yield record by more than 3 bushels per acre in 2016. Yet some weather analysts have been pounding the drum for some time now about July and August 2017 possibly being hot and dry, just as corn will enter its grain filling stage. There are various meteorological and statistical reasons offered for the outlook, but the market seems to have tuned that all out for now. It might take a while longer for traders to buy into any hazardous grain-fill forecasts and for forecasters to regain the traders’ trust, but it seems as if the market is perking up at over weather at least in the near-term.  The summer’s first expansive atmospheric ridge – sometimes known as a “ridge of death” when it persists – will grip the Corn Belt this weekend, ushering in unseasonably hot and dry weather to places that do not need it (reut.rs/2r6OC6Z).  However, weather models as of mid-day Wednesday were calling for much more rain across the Midwest into mid-month than the previous day’s models. But if that forecast does not hold, corn futures could be heading even higher in the coming days. Wet Spring = Yield Loss? Ignoring the summer weather and putting the meteorology aside, the statistics point to a greater chance of below-trend yields when spring planting is much wetter than usual. In the top 20 wettest April-to-May periods over the last 50 years, some 13 of those years ended with corn yields more than 1 percent below the long-term trend. Yields were within 1 percent of average in three of the years, and the remaining four years recorded above-trend yields (reut.rs/2rBYAk8). April and May of 2017 ranked as the fifth wettest in the last 50 years across the U.S. Corn Belt. Only one of the top 10 wettest springs – the tenth in line – gave way to above-trend corn yields later in the summer.  To be fair, yield performance in two of the 20 wet spring years – 2004 and 1982 – was some of the best to date, though rainfall was notably greater during the 2017 spring.    And some of the worst-yielding years are also mixed in, including 1995, 1991, and 1983, all of which fell inside the top 10 wettest April-to-May periods.  Whether the yields that faltered in those 20 years did so over a hot and dry late summer or something else is an entirely different discussion. But the statistics make it clear that corn has a steeper hill to climb when the springtime is as rainy as it was in 2017, meaning there may be less room than previous years for weather woes later in the summer. Problem Areas Areas of concern already exist in various corners of the Corn Belt, and conditions may worsen over the next week given the drier, warmer forecast. Crop ratings in the Eastern Corn Belt are considerably below both average levels and last year. As of June 4, the amount of corn rated in good or excellent condition in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio was 59 percent, 46 percent, and 49 percent, respectively. The overly wet spring in parts of these states has led to a fair amount of replanting, disease and weaker plants. Historically, low ratings at this point in the season do not guarantee below-trend yields to the Eastern belt, but they apply more pressure to have near-perfect weather going forward.  Despite the rainy spring, many areas in the Eastern Corn Belt are now in need of rain again, but the forecast is fairly devoid for the next week. Together, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio produce one-quarter of the nation’s corn. In the Northern Plains, drought has been creeping into the picture. According to USDA’s weekly progress report, the amount of topsoil classified as short or very short of moisture grew by 50 percent in the Dakotas during the week ended June 4. Some 54 percent of topsoil in both states now carries this rating. North Dakota is best known as the top spring wheat-producing state, but corn production has become more prevalent both there and in South Dakota in recent years. The two states together produce about 9 percent of the U.S. corn crop.  If weather models continue to trend wetter into the middle of the month, the market’s concern will likely be sidelined for the time being until the next unfavorable pattern starts to surface in the forecasts.

The move comes after repeated complaints from some European airlines, notably Air France KLM and Lufthansa, about Gulf carriers receiving illegal government subsidies, charges Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad all deny.  The proposal, which needs to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states before becoming law, would allow EU governments and airlines to submit complaints to the European Commission about any alleged discriminatory practices they face in non-EU countries or illegal subsidies benefiting non-EU airlines. Should the Commission find that the practices of a third country or airline are causing injury, or threat of injury, to European airlines it will be able to impose financial penalties or suspend some ground and other services, but not flights, and rights of the overseas airline in Europe.  We want to ensure that Europe remains a leader in international aviation, well connected to fast-growing markets, with efficient European skies,  EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement. The proposal will not interfere with bilateral air services agreements between countries setting out where and how often airlines can fly. Germany and France have previously called for such rules but some other EU member states have been staunchly opposed to the idea on the grounds they could harm bilateral deals and reduce connectivity in Europe. Many also saw it as a protectionist move to shield uncompetitive European carriers, something the Commission denies.  In aviation there is never going to be a level playing field,  an EU official said.  We're not here to protect those airlines if they have not put in place a good business model.  ACI Europe, representing Europe's airports, said the proposed regulation should ensure equality of opportunity.  This will hopefully allow us to move on from mere allegations and somewhat sterile debates to established facts and legal action, where needed,  said ACI Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec. Dubai-based Emirates said the aim should be balanced and non-discriminatory regulation serving as a catalyst for increased European liberalization.  As a financially transparent carrier with a 30-year track record of delivering air connectivity to and from Europe, Emirates welcomes the European Commission proposal to promote fair competition in the global aviation market,  a spokeswoman for the airline said. The Commission also published guidelines clarifying the application of EU ownership and control rules that limit non-EU investors' stakes in European airlines to 49 percent. Investments by foreign airlines in recent years, such as Etihad's 29 percent stake in Air Berlin, have triggered suspicions that the control is actually being exercised by non-EU investors. The Commission sought to make clear how it assessed the exercise of control of an airline to bring legal certainty for foreign investors.

(GMF) to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions on GM and its subsidiaries follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS - GM The upgrade of GM's ratings is supported by fundamental improvement in the company's credit profile largely resulting from its work to improve product profitability while maintaining a relatively conservative balance sheet. Fitch expects the margin performance of GM's key North American operations to remain strong relative to its peers, while its aggressive efforts to restructure its global operations will drive further improvements in profitability and cash flow outside the U.S. Fitch expects the company to maintain a relatively strong liquidity position sufficient to protect against a downturn while keeping leverage near the low end of its peers. Concerns stemming from the ignition switch recall have largely abated, and Fitch expects any remaining recall-related cash costs to be manageable. CREDIT RISKS Credit risks include a slowing global auto market, including industry sales in the U.S. that Fitch expects to plateau at around 17 million units, and slower industry growth in China. In the U.S., the impact of slowing industry sales is exacerbated by higher industry price incentives, driven in part by a substantial increase in late-model off-lease vehicles hitting the used car market. Longer-term risks include expected changes in the global automotive technology landscape, including the advent of autonomous vehicles and regulatory-driven shifts toward increased vehicle electrification. Accompanying these changes will be an increasing number of new competitors trying to establish a foothold in the evolving auto market. These shifts will create pressures that will add to the host of challenges faced by the highly cyclical global auto industry. Fitch believes GM is generally well positioned to navigate these challenges, but they nonetheless pose some longer-term downside risk to the company's credit profile. GM's ratings also incorporate the risk that growth at GMF and changes in the financial subsidiary's leverage profile could put some pressure on the parent company. GMF's asset base continues to grow rapidly as it increases penetration in prime lending and retail leasing, and the financial subsidiary's debt/equity leverage has risen as GMF has borrowed to fund asset growth. Similar to the financial services operations of other manufacturers, higher leverage increases the potential that GM could need to step in to provide support to GMF in the event of a negative liquidity event. In a moderate to severe downturn, Fitch expects that GM would likely experience a significant cash outflow due to its inherent operating leverage, working capital profile, and capital expenditure needs. However, Fitch expects that the company's automotive net cash position of about $9.0 billion as of March 31, 2017 (excluding the Fitch adjustments noted below), along with about $14 billion of automotive revolver availability, would provide it with sufficient financial flexibility to withstand a severe decline in demand. GM's downturn strategy includes exercising discretion over a portion of its planned capital deployment which could further relieve liquidity pressures in a downturn. This could include reducing share repurchases, delaying certain capital expenditures, limiting pension contributions to only those that are mandatory, and holding dividends flat. In addition, various post-recession changes in GM's business profile have also positioned it to better withstand a downturn. The company's break-even sales level is lower as a result of restructuring actions and an increased use of global platforms, and its increasingly competitive product offerings are commanding higher net prices. NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND MOBILITY INITIATIVES Fitch believes GM is relatively well positioned to compete as new technologies alter personal transportation over the next decade, but uncertainty over the future technological landscape and competitive environment introduces significant risks as well. In particular, a large number of start-ups and technology companies from outside the traditional auto sector are actively working to disrupt the existing automotive business model, and GM, as well as other mass-market auto manufacturers, could face significant challenges in the face of a rapidly changing business environment. Much of GM's work in mobility has revolved around its OnStar system, which it has offered and evolved for over 20 years, and which can serve as a platform for various forms of vehicle communications. GM's mobility initiatives cover a wide range of potential solutions, from automated driving to ride sharing and car sharing. Compared to some of its competitors, GM has been a bit more willing to look outside the company for opportunities to acquire technologies, which has helped to accelerate its progress in these areas. Investments have included taking a $500 million stake in Lyft, Inc., acquiring of most of the assets of the former ride-sharing company Sidecar Technologies, Inc. and acquiring Cruise Automation, Inc., a specialist in autonomous-driving technologies. GM also began selling the Chevrolet Bolt for the 2017 model year, an electric vehicle with a 238-mile range that has been designed to incorporate various future mobility technologies. OPEL/VAUXHALL DIVESTITURE In March 2017, GM agreed to divest its European Opel/Vauxhall (Opel) unit to PSA Group (PSA). By divesting Opel, GM will shed a business that has not generated a positive operating profit for 17 years. GM will also avoid considerable future investments in the European business related to increasingly stringent fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the divestiture will allow GM to focus its investments on regions and products with significantly higher potential returns. On the other hand, it will leave GM with a smaller and less diversified business that will be more heavily dependent on the financial performance of its U.S. and China operations. GM will receive about $900 million in cash, as well as warrants in PSA with an estimated value of about $700 million. However, this will be partially offset by a roughly $400 million payment that GM will make to PSA to compensate for risks associated with the transfer of pension plans covering active Opel employees. Around the time of closing, GM also expects to make an additional debt-funded contribution of about $2.8 billion to fully fund the Opel pension plans that will be transferred to PSA. In conjunction with the divestiture, GMF plans to sell its European subsidiaries to a joint venture to be formed by PSA and BNP Paribas for about $1 billion. GMF will keep about $500 million of the proceeds to maintain its target leverage ratio and will transfer the other $500 million to GM via a special one-time dividend. Fitch has excluded the planned dividend from its forecasted FCF calculation due to its non-recurring nature. SOLID FCF POTENTIAL Fitch expects GM to generate automotive FCF after dividends of about $3 billion in 2017, which will result in an FCF margin of a little over 2% (excluding revenue from the Opel subsidiary that will be sold). Fitch expects capital spending to run in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range for the next several years as the company makes significant investments in new platforms and powertrains. However, this is lower than Fitch's previous expectation, as Fitch expects the Opel divestiture will reduce GM's capital spending needs by about $1 billion annually. GM's capital allocation strategy continues to prioritize investing in its business, maintaining strong credit metrics and returning remaining available FCF to shareholders through share repurchases. GM currently has a $5 billion share repurchase authorization in place with no end date. The company plans to increase the pace of share repurchases in 2017 in order to reduce its cash balance to a new target level of $18 billion from the previous $20 billion following completion of the Opel divestiture. Going forward, Fitch expects GM to manage its liquidity according to its cash target, increasing or decreasing share repurchases as necessary to keep its cash around the $18 billion target level. Beyond 2017, Fitch expects GM's automotive FCF to remain substantial for an auto manufacturer. Fitch expects GM's automotive FCF margins to run in the low-single-digits over the intermediate term, equating to a Fitch-estimated post-dividend FCF in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range. Fitch's longer-term FCF expectations assume that dividends from GM's China joint ventures decline somewhat from the current level of around $2 billion due to more challenging auto market conditions in the country. Fitch also expects capital spending to average around 6% of revenues over the next several years, while dividends are expected to run in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range, with the potential for higher dividend payouts offset by ongoing share repurchases. CREDIT METRICS STRENGTHENING GM's automotive credit profile continues to strengthen, and Fitch expects the improvement to be sustainable over the intermediate term. Fitch expects EBITDA leverage (debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA, including minority dividends) to remain below 1x over the next several years, despite a moderating demand environment. This also considers the incremental debt that GM expects to issue around the time the Opel divestiture closes in order to fund the contribution to pension plans that will transfer to PSA. Fitch expects GM's automotive debt will rise to about $13 billion following the close of the Opel divestiture from roughly $11 billion at March 31, 2017. Actual EBITDA leverage at March 31, 2017 was 0.6x. Funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage, which was 0.9x at March 31, 2016, is likely to remain low as well, although variability in FFO could cause more volatility in this metric. Fitch expects GM's automotive EBIT margins to run in the 5% to 6.5% range over the intermediate term, which are relatively solid, given the low-margin nature of the global auto manufacturing industry. Margins will be supported by the Opel divestiture, as Opel has not generated a positive EBIT margin since 1999. However, GM's margins are still likely to be pressured in its other global regions as slowing U.S. industry sales ratchet up competition in the North American market, South American sales remain weak, and sales in the Asia Pacific region remain uneven. Despite this pressure, Fitch expects North American margins to continue running near 10%, which is strong by historical standards, as the company continues to benefit from consumers' preference for light trucks and SUVs in a low-fuel price environment. According to Fitch's Criteria for Rating Non-Financial Corporates, when analyzing a corporate issuer with a captive finance subsidiary Fitch calculates an appropriate target debt-to-equity ratio for the finance subsidiary based on asset quality, funding and liquidity. If the finance subsidiary's target ratio is lower than its actual ratio, Fitch models an equity injection from the parent to the finance subsidiary to bring the ratio down to the target level. For GMF, Fitch calculated a target ratio of 5.0x, which is below its actual ratio of 8.6x at March 31, 2017. (For purposes of this analysis, when calculating the actual ratio, Fitch adjusted GMF's debt and equity to reflect its debt at principal value.) Fitch then assumed that GM makes a $5.6 billion cash-funded equity injection into GMF to bring GMF's debt-to-equity ratio down to the target level. Fitch has treated this cash injection as  not readily available cash  in its forecast models, as discussed further in  Liquidity  below. PENSION FUNDING The funded status of GM's pension plans has improved significantly over the past six years, in part due to the company shifting its U.S. salaried plan to an annuity in 2012. At year-end 2016, the company's global pension plans were underfunded by $18 billion on a GAAP projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis, leading to a funded status of 80%. The company's U.S. plans were 90% funded, with an underfunded position of $7.2 billion. GM contributed a total of $3.1 billion to its global pension plans in 2016, including $2.0 billion in debt-funded voluntary contributions to its U.S. hourly plan. In 2017, the company plans to contribute about $1 billion to its global pension plans, comprised of $970 million in contributions to non-U.S. plans and $73 million to U.S. non-qualified plans. KEY RATING DRIVERS - GMF The affirmation of GMF's IDRs and senior unsecured debt ratings are a result of the direct linkage to GM's ratings. Fitch considers GMF to be a 'core' subsidiary of GM based on actual and potential support provided to GMF from GM, an increasing percentage of GMF's earning assets related to GM, and strong financial and operational linkages between the companies. The ratings also reflect GMF's seasoned management team, improved funding profile, consistent operating performance, improving asset quality, and adequate liquidity. LEASE GROWTH VIEWED WITH INCREASING CAUTION Overall asset quality for the captive has improved as a result of the launch of a retail prime product in the U.S. in 2014, securing GM's lease exclusivity in 2015, and subvented loan exclusivity in 2016. Subprime loans (defined as loans with a FICO score below 620) represented 43% of the North America retail auto loan portfolio as of March 31, 2017, down from over 57% in 1Q16, as prime loan and lease originations increased to 75% of total originations compared with 68% a year ago. Roughly 87% of GMF's loans and leases now relate to financing new GM vehicles, as the company continues to transition to a full-service captive following GM's acquisition of AmeriCredit in 2010. Although North America lease originations declined slightly to $6.3 billion in 1Q17 from $6.7 billion in 1Q16, GMF's lease portfolio grew 52% year over year driven by continued market share gains from the lease subvention exclusivity on GM brands, which began in the first half of 2015. At 1Q17, GMF's lease portfolio represented 54% of North America earning assets versus 51% a year ago. Leasing involves additional risk for GMF as it exposes the company to residual value impairment, the risk of which has increased more recently as used car values are being negatively impacted by an increase in the supply of off-lease vehicles and increased incentives being offered on new vehicles. Fitch expects GMF to more conservatively assess residual values in order to minimize future losses as leased vehicles are returned and sold, particularly with used car values expected to moderate further over the near-to-medium term. IMPROVING CREDIT PERFORMANCE GMF's credit performance has remained fairly stable in recent years despite the shift in the portfolio toward prime assets, as higher losses from portfolio seasoning have been offset by the mix shift toward prime quality loans and leases. Retail auto net charge-offs were 1.9% 1Q17, unchanged from 1Q16. Fitch expects recovery rates on defaulted loans to experience downward pressure as used car values moderate from elevated levels, further supporting its view on normalizing credit trends and likely pressure on residual values. The net charge-off rate on retail auto loans in North America was 2.3% in 1Q17, down from 2.6% in 1Q16 despite the drop in recovery rate to 51.6% from 54.1%. PROFIT MARGINS COMPRESS FURTHER GMF's profitability is solid driven by its growth in earning assets, but margins and return ratios have gradually compressed reflecting the shift in the loan origination mix from higher-yielding, higher-risk subprime loans to lower-yielding, lower-risk prime and commercial loans. This trend is partially offset by an improvement in operating expense efficiency, driven by a higher prime credit mix and servicing scale. GMF's return on assets has steadily declined from over 3% in 2011, falling to 0.89% annualized in 1Q17, compared to 0.95% in 1Q16, which is more consistent with its peers. Fitch expects this downward trend to continue over the near-term, albeit at a more moderate pace. The pre-tax margin continued to compress, to 9% in 1Q17, down from 10.8% in the year ago quarter, given the mix shift toward prime lending. Fitch expects GMF to remain solidly profitable through the remainder of 2017, and for pre-tax income growth to be driven by strong earning asset growth, stable credit performance, and improved operating cost efficiency. Partially offsetting these positive drivers should be further net interest margin compression reflecting the mix shift toward lower-yielding assets, further downward pressure on used car values, and higher interest expense due to the ongoing shift toward a higher mix of unsecured funding. IMPROVING FUNDING PROFILE GMF's funding profile and diversification has steadily improved over the past few years, with increased utilization of the unsecured debt markets. Still, the company remains reliant on secured debt for a meaningful portion of its funding, with approximately 53% of funding in the form of ABS debt and secured revolving (warehouse) facilities as of 1Q17. Despite the recent improvement, secured funding as a percentage of total funding remains high relative to GMF's captive peers. Fitch expects unsecured debt as a percentage of total debt will continue to increase toward 50% of GMF's funding, which Fitch views favorably as it improves the firm's funding flexibility. LEVERAGE CONTINUES TREND HIGHER While leverage levels have increased in recent years to support portfolio expansion, Fitch believes the increase can be partly explained by the steady improvement in the asset quality of its portfolio since acquiring AmeriCredit, a subprime-focused auto finance company, in 2010. Leverage (measured as debt to tangible equity) was 10.3x at March 31, 2017, up from 8.4x a year ago. Management-calculated leverage (earning assets to tangible equity) was 10.9x at March 31, 2017, up from 8.8x a year ago but below the 11.5x ceiling currently permitted by the support agreement between GM and GMF. Fitch expects leverage to increase over the near term as earning assets continue to grow, before moderating over the medium term as earning asset growth normalizes. Should assets exceed $100 billion, the support agreement permits leverage to increase to 12x, which Fitch views as high in relation to its peers, most of which have higher asset quality. At current levels, GMF's leverage is roughly in-line with its auto captive peers, namely Ford Motor Credit Company ('BBB'/Outlook Stable) and Toyota Motor Credit Corporation ('A'/Outlook Stable), despite Fitch's view that GMF's underlying portfolio is of lower credit quality. Further increases in GMF's leverage without a commensurate improvement in asset quality of the earning assets, would be viewed negatively by Fitch. SOLID LIQUIDITY POSITION Fitch believes GMF's liquidity position is strong. Available liquidity was $12.4 billion as of March 31, 2017, including $2.7 billion in unrestricted cash, $8.3 billion of borrowing capacity on unpledged assets, $0.4 billion of borrowing capacity on committed unsecured credit lines and $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity on its intercompany credit facility. Liquidity is further enhanced by GM's decision to not take dividends out of GMF, except for the aforementioned one-time special dividend payment to GM related to the divestiture of GMF's European operations, for as long as it needs capital to support asset growth. Unsecured debt maturities are believed to be manageable, with $7.3 billion of debt maturing in 2017. The upgrade of GMF's short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F3' reflects potential liquidity support available from GM as well as GMF's good standalone liquidity profile, in terms of the short duration of its assets relative to its overall debt, low reliance on short-term debt and commercial paper issuance, solid asset quality, and strong cash flow generation capacity. EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARY IDRs REMAIN ON EVOLVING WATCH The long-term IDRs of GMF's European subsidiaries, Opel Bank GmbH, GMAC (UK) Plc, and General Motors Financial International B.V (GMI) remain at 'BBB-'. On March 30, 2017, Fitch placed the IDRs of these entities on Rating Watch Evolving, following the announced sale of GM's European operations to a 50%/50% joint venture between Banque PSA and BNP Paribas. The sale is subject to various regulatory approvals but is expected to close by the end of 2017 at which time Fitch expects to resolve the Evolving Watch. The Rating Watch Evolving does not extend to GMI's Euro Medium Term Note Programme, as it is guaranteed by GMF until the notes are fully repaid. DERIVATION SUMMARY GM's operating and financial profiles are generally in line with mass-market automotive peers at a similar rating level. The company has a relatively strong competitive position, with a top-five market share in most of the markets where it operates, including top positions in the U.S. and China. The company's product lineup has improved significantly in the post-recession period, which has translated to higher revenue and profit per vehicle, particularly in North America. GM's credit metrics are somewhat strong relative to similarly rated peers. EBIT and EBITDA margins have recently been at the higher end of peer group, driven by a strong performance in North America, and Fitch expects restructuring actions to support margins going forward. Post-dividend FCF margins have also been at the higher end and will be enhanced by lower capital spending following the Opel divestiture. Leverage remains low relative to its peer group, with debt/EBITDA below 1x, and Fitch expects it to remain low following the likely debt issuance later this year that will coincide with Opel divestiture. Capital deployment has been more shareholder-focused than some of its global peers, with the company expected to allocate all available post-dividend FCF to share repurchases after investing in its business, while maintaining its focus on investment-grade credit metrics. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --U.S. industry light vehicle sales total about 17 million units in 2017, and global sales rise in the low-single-digit range. --Beyond 2017, U.S. industry sales plateau at around 17 million units per year, the Chinese market grows at a low- to mid-single digit rate, and South America slowly improves, but other developing markets are uneven. --Over the intermediate term, GM's revenue growth is tied primarily to volume growth in the regions where it has a presence, as well as modest price increases, while global market share is held about constant. --The Opel divestiture is completed near year-end 2017. --GM issues $2.8 billion in debt in late 2017 to fund a contribution to Opel pension plans that will move to PSA. --The company discontinues Chevrolet sales in India and sells stakes in certain African truck operations to Isuzu. --Automotive EBITDA margins run in the 10% to 11% range following the Opel divestiture as production volumes grow modestly, the company makes continued progress on cost efficiencies, and profitability rises with new model introductions, while spending on mobility initiatives, as well as increased vehicle technology investments put some downward pressure on margins. --Capital spending runs at about 6% of automotive revenue over the intermediate term. --The company allocates all available post-dividend FCF to share repurchases. --The company maintains a target automotive cash balance of about $18 billion following the Opel divestiture, augmented by about $14 billion of automotive revolver availability. RATING SENSITIVITIES GM Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Maintaining a North American automotive EBIT margin above 10% on a sustained basis; --Maintaining a global automotive EBIT margin above 5.5% on a sustained basis; --Maintaining a post-dividend FCF margin of 2.3% or higher; --Maintaining gross EBITDA leverage in the low 1x range or below on a sustained basis. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A decision to reduce the company's automotive cash target to below $18 billion following the Opel divestiture; --A sustained period of negative FCF, excluding non-recurring items; --A material increase in leverage to fund shareholder-friendly activities; --An unexpected merger or acquisition that materially weakens the company's credit profile. GMF The long-term IDRs, senior unsecured ratings and Rating Outlook for GMF are linked to the ratings of its parent, with the exception of the IDRs of the three European subsidiaries, which are currently on Rating Watch Evolving pending the sale. GMF's ratings will move in tandem with its parent, although any change in Fitch's view on whether GMF remains core to its parent could change this rating linkage. Fitch cannot envision a scenario where GMF would be rated higher than the parent. A material increase in leverage without a corresponding improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio, an inability to access funding for an extended period of time, consistent and sustained operating losses and/or significant deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying loan and lease portfolio could become constraining factors on the parent's ratings. Additionally, were GM or GMF's liquidity profile to deteriorate materially, this could result in GMF's short-term IDR being downgraded to 'F3' from 'F2' even if the long-term IDR was unchanged. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects GM's automotive liquidity, including both cash and revolver capacity, to remain strong, which will provide the company with a substantial cushion in the event of an unexpected downturn. The company currently maintains an average cash target of $20 billion, approximately $2 billion of which is related to its European operations. Once GM completes the Opel divestiture, the company intends to target a lower cash balance of $18 billion on average. Fitch views the reduced liquidity target as sufficient to provide downside protection given the reduced size of the company following the divestiture. At March 31, 2017, GM's actual automotive cash, including marketable securities, totaled a little above $20 billion, in-line with its target level. In addition to its cash, GM's liquidity is enhanced by access to two primary unsecured revolvers, a $4 billion facility that matures in 2019 and a $10.5 billion facility that matures in 2021. Of the total capacity of $14.5 billion, $14 billion was available at March 31, 2017, after accounting for about $500 million in letters of credit. GMF has the ability to borrow up to $1 billion on the 2019 revolver and up to $3 billion on the 2021 facility, but it had no borrowings outstanding against either facility at March 31, 2017. The credit agreement for the primary revolvers contains a minimum liquidity covenant that requires the company to maintain minimum liquidity of $2.0 billion in the U.S. and $4.0 billion globally, including revolver availability. Including available capacity on its primary revolvers, GM's total automotive liquidity position was over $34 billion or nearly $23 billion net of automotive debt. However, in addition to the captive-finance adjustment discussed above, Fitch has treated $3 billion in cash as  not readily available  in its forecast, reflecting cash permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and cash that Fitch estimates is needed to cover seasonal changes in cash flows. However, even after excluding these amounts from its liquidity calculations, Fitch views GM's liquidity position as relatively strong and sufficient to help the company withstand a moderate to severe downturn.

Salt Lake City-based PolarityTE Inc's patented approach to tissue engineering is designed to use a patient's own healthy tissue to re-grow human skin for the treatment of burns and wounds. Despite recent advances in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgeons cannot give burn victims what they require the most — their skin. Current approaches to treat serious burns are  severely limited  in their effectiveness and in some cases, are rather expensive, PolarityTE's founder and CEO Denver Lough said in an interview. Epicel, a skin graft widely used in burn units that is sold by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Vericel Corp, does not result in fully thick and functional skin — which is PolarityTE's objective. PolarityTE conducted its pre-clinical study on wounded pigs at an animal facility in Utah. The use of therapy resulted in scar-less healing, growth of hair follicles, complete wound coverage and the progressive regeneration of all skin layers, the company said. As pig skin is more complex and robust than human skin, successful swine data is typically seen as a precursor to effectiveness in human trials. PolarityTE expects to begin a human trial later this year and the cell therapy could hit the market 12 to 18 months thereafter, said Lough, who served as senior plastic surgery resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital before creating PolarityTE last year.  If clinically successful, the PolarityTE platform could deliver the first scientific breakthrough in wound healing and reconstructive surgery in nearly half a century,  Lough said. The technology also has the potential to develop fully-functional tissues, including bone, muscle, cartilage and the liver, PolarityTE said. The company said it would  be opportunistic with financing,  to fund upcoming trials but declined to provide details. PolarityTE is backed by pharma industry veteran Phil Frost, currently the chief executive of OPKO Health Inc, and a small number of other industry executives. Shares of the company rose as much as 16.5 percent to $20.98 on the Nasdaq, but pared most gains to trade up 1.6 percent in the midday session on Thursday.

In the United States, former FBI director James Comey was testifying before a Senate committee on Thursday and said he was disturbed by President Donald Trump's bid to get him to drop a probe into the former national security adviser. Comey, however, could not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. Trump fired Comey on May 9. Treasury prices remained lower as Comey testified.  At the end of the day, former FBI Director Comey hasn't really revealed anything new, in my view, so bond prices are either treading water to heading lower,  said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York. The more important driver for the market, di Galoma said, was the expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve next week as well as U.S. long-dated Treasury debt auctions. Thursday's ECB remarks also had some impact on the market, with U.S. yields initially falling, in line with the decline in German bond yields immediately following the bank's comments, before eventually rising. Overall, the ECB signaled it planned no further interest rate cuts as euro zone prospects improved, but said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump stimulus into the region's economy. Draghi said in a press briefing that reducing asset purchases in the euro zone was not discussed at the meeting. He added that the ECB will be in the market for a long time.  The fact that it no longer expects interest rates to remain at present 'or lower' levels is a clear deliberate signal that policy makers are gradually becoming more hawkish,  said London-based Craig Erlam, senior market analyst, at OANDA. The ECB now expects inflation of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.3 percent in 2018, compared with its forecasts of 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively in March. That is still well below its target of just under 2 percent. Benchmark German 10-year bond yields hit session lows of 0.253 percent following the ECB comments. In midday trading, U.S. 10-year Treasuries were last down 5/32 in price, with yields at 2.198 percent, compared with 2.180 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. 30-year bonds fell 9/32 in price, yielding 2.851 percent, compared with Wednesday's 2.837 percent.

The vast oil sands deposits in northern Alberta are home to the world's third-largest crude reserves but also carry some of the world's highest production costs. With oil prices around $50 a barrel, it makes no economic sense to build new projects. International oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips have sold off billions in assets to Canadian producers since the start of 2017, stoking concerns about the future of the resource. Speaking on the fourth day of a five-day trip to China, Carr said the government's  minds are open  with regard to Chinese investment.  We think there are opportunities and we laid out, along with experts from industry, what we believe to be opportunities for them,  Carr told reporters on a conference call.  We would welcome investment from any nation that's interested in the oil sands. The trend of capital flows over the last little while has been international investors have been looking at their opportunities and decided to spread their resources, whereas Canadian investors have stepped up.  The previous Canadian government under Conservative Stephen Harper had a policy of limiting control of the oil sands by state-owned companies, such as China's CNOOC Ltd . They are still able to hold minority stakes in projects. Carr did not give details on what sort of investment Canada would welcome from China, but said his government is interested in looking at cases individually. Between 2005 and 2012 Chinese companies like PetroChina, CNOOC and Sinopec piled into the booming oil sands sector to secure China's energy needs. But some of those investments, like CNOOC's purchase of Nexen Energy, have been dogged with operational issues, raising questions over whether the Chinese would be reluctant to buy more oil sands stakes.  It's probably a question not of investing, but whether or not they sell,  said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn.  Non-Canadian entities have been selling the oil sands, why would the Chinese be different?  Last July Nexen indefinitely suspended plans to repair its Long Lake upgrader in northern Alberta after a deadly blast at the facility months earlier, leaving the fate of the facility in limbo.

(Akbank), Turkiye Is Bankasi (Isbank), Turkiye Garanti Bankasi (Garanti) and Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi (YKB). The Outlooks on all four banks are Stable. Isbank's and Akbank's 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) are driven by the respective banks' standalone creditworthiness, as captured by their respective 'bb+' Viability Ratings. Garanti's and YKB's 'BBB-' Long-Term IDRs are driven by potential support from the banks' controlling shareholders, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (A-/Stable) and Unicredit (BBB/Stable), respectively. The ratings of all four banks' domestic subsidiaries and of Akbank A.G. are equalised with those of their parent institutions and have been affirmed with Stable Outlooks. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS VRS OF ALL FOUR BANKS; IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS OF AKBANK AND ISBANK The four banks' 'bb+' VRs ' - in line with the sovereign Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR - reflect their solid franchises (the banks had market shares of between around 9% and 12% of sector assets at end-Q117) and generally reasonable financial metrics in terms of performance and capitalisation, notwithstanding a challenging operating environment. However, the banks' credit profiles are under moderate pressure from the weaker growth outlook in Turkey and the potential impact of this on their asset quality, performance and sufficiency of capital and liquidity buffers. The four banks reported reasonable headline asset quality ratios with non-performing loan (NPL) ratios (defined as loans overdue by 90 days/gross loans) ranging from a low 2.2% (Isbank) to a moderate 4.3% (YKB) of gross loans at end-1Q17 (sector average: 3.2%). This ratio does not take into account significant regulatory group 2  watch-list  loans, however, which ranged from 2.6% (Akbank) to 4.8% (Garanti) of gross loans at end-1Q17 and could result in NPL growth as loans season, in Fitch's view. A significant portion of  watch-list  loans - the most high-risk part of banks' performing loans - had also been restructured. In addition, headline NPL ratios do not reflect annual NPL sales, without which NPL ratios would have been moderately higher. Specific reserves coverage of NPLs was reasonable at end-1Q17, ranging from 76%-78% at Isbank, Garanti and YKB, broadly in line with the sector average of 78%, to a solid 97% in the case of Akbank. This resulted in generally low net NPLs-to-equity in all four banks. However, reserves coverage is weaker after adjusting for watch-list loans. At end-1Q17, including both specific and general reserves (held on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in accordance with local accounting standards) total reserve coverage of NPLs and group 2 watch list loans across the banks ranged from a fairly low 48% (Garanti) to a reasonable 76% (Akbank). Furthermore, the banks' asset quality ratios are likely to remain under pressure, as for the sector, given the weaker growth outlook and the banks' exposure, to varying degrees, to SMEs (which have proven among the most sensitive to a weakening operating environment). High foreign currency (FC) lending also increases credit risk given the recent rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira; FC lending ranged from 38% to 43% of the banks' gross loans at end-1Q17 and reflected exposure to some high-risk sectors such as energy-related project finance and construction/real estate lending. In addition, single-name concentration risk could bring volatility to the banks' asset quality ratios in the event that large exposures become non-performing. Nevertheless, the banks saw a decline in their NPL origination rates (defined as new NPLs-to- average performing loans) in 1Q17 (annualised basis) versus 2016 to between 0.9% (Akbank) and 1.7% (YKB). Net of loan recoveries, NPL generation rates were lower, at between 0.5% and 0.9% of average performing loans in 1Q17, reflecting increased collections and loan recovery efforts. The banks' performance has held up to date, despite the challenging operating environment, underpinned by solid franchises, economies of scale, a focus on cost control and generally above-sector-average margins. Reported returns on equity (ROEs) ranged from 15.1% (YKB) to 17.2% (Akbank, Garanti) in 1Q17 (sector average: 18.3%), supported by margin expansion, generally improving cost efficiency ratios and loan growth. Lending picked up in 1Q17 (nominal growth ranged from 4% to 8% at the four banks), primarily reflecting SME loans disbursed under the Credit Guarantee Fund, but to a lower extent at YKB. As a result of the latter, the banks could exceed their 2017 loan growth targets of 10%-13%. Nevertheless, performance ratios could weaken due to the weaker growth outlook and ongoing asset-quality weakness, which could drive up loan impairments as loans season. Reported ROEs should also be considered in light of the inflationary environment in Turkey. The banks' margins are tighter after adjusting for costs related to FC swaps; banks make opportunistic use of these according to need and pricing, and they can be significant at times. Fitch views the banks' capitalisation generally as sufficient to absorb moderate shocks to performance and asset quality and potential further local currency depreciation. However, the quality of the banks' capital is sound (primarily Tier 1); Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratios stood at a reasonable 11.8% (Isbank), 12.9% (Garanti) and 13.4% (Akbank) at end-Q117, but an only adequate 10.3% at YKB. Capitalisation is supported by reasonable internal capital generation - which improved in 2016 at all four banks - and generally low net NPLs-to-FCC. Pre-impairment profit provides a significant buffer to absorb losses, ranging from 24% to 29% of the banks' average equity in 2016. The banks have broad deposit franchises, which accounted on average for 66% of non-equity funding (excluding derivatives) at end-1Q17. However, the banks report generally high loans/deposits ratios as a result of significant FC wholesale funding attracted mainly on international markets. These stood at 115% (Akbank), 125% (Garanti), 130% (YKB) and 139% (Isbank) at end-1Q17 versus the sector average of 125%. However, the four banks' loans/deposits ratios were below sector average on an unconsolidated basis. FC wholesale funding comprised between around 21% and 27% of the banks' non-equity funding at end-1Q17. This has risen significantly since 2011 and a sizable component is short term, heightening refinancing risks.  However, in general the banks are endeavouring to extend the tenor of FC wholesale funding and fund loan growth with customer deposits. Their long-term local currency funding is limited, as it is for the sector. Fitch regards the FC liquidity positions of the four banks as adequate. Available FC liquidity - consisting primarily of placements with the Turkish Central Bank under the reserve option mechanism and maturing FC swaps - were broadly sufficient to cover short-term maturing liabilities at all four banks at end-2016. Nevertheless, liquidity profiles could come under pressure from a prolonged market stress. The presence of foreign shareholders provides additional comfort in this respect in the case of YKB and Garanti. KEY RATING DRIVERS: YKB's AND GARANTI's IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS YKB's and Garanti's IDRs and senior debt ratings are driven by potential support from Unicredit, (BBB/Stable), and BBVA (A-/Stable), respectively. Unicredit owns a 50% stake in YKB's holding company (which in turn holds an 82% stake in YKB). BBVA holds a 49.85% stake in Garanti but has full management control, a majority of seats on the board of directors and Garanti is fully consolidated into its financial statements. Fitch views Garanti and YKB as strategically important subsidiaries for their parent banks, as reflected in their '2' Support Ratings. Garanti's Long-Term FC IDR is constrained by Turkey's 'BBB-' Country Ceiling. SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS OF AKBANK AND ISBANK The 'B+' SRFs of Akbank and Isbank reflect the sovereign's modest ability to provide support in FC, considering the sovereign's moderate level of FC reserves. The banks' '4' SRs take into account their systemic importance and solid market shares, which stood at 9% (Akbank) and 12% of sector assets (Isbank), respectively, at end-1Q17. SUBORDINATED DEBT The 'BB+' subordinated notes ratings of YKB and Garanti are notched down once from their support-driven IDRs, while the 'BB' subordinated notes ratings of Isbank and Akbank are notched down once from their VRs. The notching includes one notch for loss severity and zero notches for non-performance risk in the case of all four banks. SUBSIDIARIES The ratings of Akbank AG, Ak Finansal Kiralama A.S., Ak Yatirim Menkul Degerler A.S., Is Finansal Kiralama A.S., Is Faktoring A.S., Is Yatirim Menkul Degerler A.S., Garanti Faktoring A.S., Garanti Finansal Kiralama A.S., Yapi Kredi Finansal Kiralama A.O., Yapi Kredi Yatirim Menkul Degerler A.S. and Yapi Kredi Faktoring A.S. are equalised with those of their respective parents, on the basis of support. Fitch believes all these entities are core, highly integrated subsidiaries and that support from parent banks should be forthcoming in times of need. Akbank AG's Deposit Ratings are aligned with the bank's IDR. In Fitch's opinion, debt buffers do not afford any obvious incremental probability of default benefit over and above the support benefit factored into the bank's IDR. Given the limited standalone profiles of all subsidiaries, Fitch has not assigned them any VRs. In all cases, the subsidiaries are majority-owned (above 75% stakes in most cases) by their respective parents, or group companies. The subsidiaries offer core products and services (including leasing, factoring and investment banking/brokerage) in core markets (all in Turkey, with the exception of Akbank AG, which is domiciled in Germany) reflecting their key roles in the groups. Akbank AG has strong synergies with its parent and serves a primarily Turkish customer base.  All subsidiaries share the same branding as their parents, are highly integrated into their banking groups in terms of risk and IT systems, and their senior management and underwriting practices are mostly drawn from parent banks. The subsidiaries are typically small relative to their parents, meaning any required support should be immaterial to the ability of the parent to provide it. The only entity to exceed 5% of its group's total assets at end-2016 was Akbank AG (7%). RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS OF YKB AND GARANTI Garanti's and YKB's IDRs are sensitive to a downgrade of Turkey's 'BBB-' Country Ceiling.  A downgrade of Unicredit would also likely result in a downgrade of YKB. Garanti's ratings would also likely be downgraded if there is a more than two-notch downgrade of BBVA. A sharp reduction in either of the parent banks' propensity to support their subsidiaries (not Fitch's base case) would also result in a downgrade of the subsidiary banks. Garanti's ratings could be upgraded in case of an upgrade of Turkey's Country Ceiling. VRS OF ALL FOUR BANKS; IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS OF ISBANK AND AKBANK The VRs of all four banks remain sensitive to a further weakening of the operating environment and the potential negative impact of this on their asset quality and performance and the sufficiency of their capital and liquidity positions. Likewise, if Turkish banks' access to wholesale funding markets becomes significantly restricted for a prolonged period, resulting in a deterioration of the four banks' FX liquidity positions, this could also result in VR downgrades. Upside for the banks' VRs is limited in the near term, given the challenging operating environment and that VRs are already at the level of the sovereign FC rating. Isbank's and Akbank's IDRs, National ratings and debt ratings are primarily sensitive to a change in their VRs. SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS OF ISBANK AND AKBANK The SRFs of Isbank and Akbank could be revised down if either (i) the Turkish sovereign is downgraded; (ii) the FC positions of the banks, or more generally Turkey's external finances, deteriorate considerably, or (iii) Fitch believes the sovereign's propensity to support the banks has reduced. The introduction of bank resolution legislation in Turkey aimed at limiting sovereign support for failed banks could also negatively impact Fitch's view of support propensity, and hence the banks' SRs and SRFs, but Fitch does not expect this in the short term. Upward revisions of the banks' SRFs are unlikely unless there is a marked strengthening of the sovereign's ability to support the banks in FC. SUBORDINATED DEBT RATINGS The notes' ratings are primarily sensitive to changes in their anchor ratings, namely the VRs of Isbank and Akbank and the IDRs of YKB and Garanti. The ratings are also sensitive to a change in respective notching due to a revision in Fitch's assessment of the probability of the notes' non-performance risk or in its assessment of loss severity in case of non-performance. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES The subsidiaries' ratings are sensitive to changes in (i) the parents' IDRs and National Ratings; and (ii) Fitch's view of the ability and propensity of the parents to provide support in case of need. The ratings could be notched from their respective parents' if i) the subsidiaries become materially larger relative to the respective parents' ability to provide support or ii) the subsidiaries' strategic importance is materially reduced through, for example, a substantial reduction in business referrals or integration. However, these considerations do not form part of Fitch's base case given the subsidiaries' small sizes relative to their parents and key roles within their respective groups.

Tanzania has ramped up spending in recent years to build a standard gauge railway, new roads and expand its ports. In his budget speech to parliament, Finance and Planning Minister Philip Mpango said the budget for the next fiscal year would continue in that vein.  The government plans to increase revenue, curb leakages of government resources, control expenditure and enforce public procurement legislation,  he said. Mpango said the government plans to borrow 6.17 trillion shillings in coming fiscal year from domestic sources and expects 3.97 trillion shillings from external concessional loans and grants. The government said it would seek an additional 1.59 trillion shillings from external non-concessional loans.  The government plans to narrow the budget deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2017/18 from 4.5 percent in 2016/17,  Mpango said. Tanzania expects its economy to grow 7.1 percent in 2017, up from 7.0 percent in 2016. It aims to contain inflation at 5 to 8 percent range in the 2017 calendar year, he said. Tax revenue is estimated at 14.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2017/18, up from an estimated 13.3 percent in 2016/17.  The government will protect the business community, but will not tolerate looting of national resources and tax evasion,  said Mpango. Some foreign investors said they have been unnerved by unpredictable policies from the government of President John Magufuli, while private-sector credit growth has been hampered by a steep drop in the money supply and a spike in non-performing loans. Mpango said the government will also scrap value-added tax on transit goods as part of plans to transform Tanzania into a regional trade and transport hub as it vies for cargo with neighbouring Kenya.  The objective of this measure is to reduce the costs incurred by transporters when using our ports and make them affordable and competitive. This will make Tanzania a preferred route for landlocked countries’ imports and therefore increase employment opportunities and government revenue,  he said. $1 = 2,232 Tanzanian shillings Reporting by Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala; Writing by George Obulutsa; Editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/tanzania-budget-idUSL8N1J559E"},

Salt Lake City-based PolarityTE Inc's patented approach to tissue engineering is designed to use a patient's own healthy tissue to re-grow human skin for the treatment of burns and wounds. Despite recent advances in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgeons cannot give burn victims what they require the most — their skin. Current approaches to treat serious burns are  severely limited  in their effectiveness and in some cases, are rather expensive, PolarityTE's founder and CEO Denver Lough said in an interview. Epicel, a skin graft widely used in burn units that is sold by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Vericel Corp, does not result in fully thick and functional skin — which is PolarityTE's objective. PolarityTE conducted its pre-clinical study on wounded pigs at an animal facility in Utah. The use of therapy resulted in scar-less healing, growth of hair follicles, complete wound coverage and the progressive regeneration of all skin layers, the company said. As pig skin is more complex and robust than human skin, successful swine data is typically seen as a precursor to effectiveness in human trials. PolarityTE expects to begin a human trial later this year and the cell therapy could hit the market 12 to 18 months thereafter, said Lough, who served as senior plastic surgery resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital before creating PolarityTE last year.  If clinically successful, the PolarityTE platform could deliver the first scientific breakthrough in wound healing and reconstructive surgery in nearly half a century,  Lough said. The technology also has the potential to develop fully-functional tissues, including bone, muscle, cartilage and the liver, PolarityTE said. The company said it would  be opportunistic with financing,  to fund upcoming trials but declined to provide details. PolarityTE is backed by pharma industry veteran Phil Frost, currently the chief executive of OPKO Health Inc, and a small number of other industry executives. Shares of the company rose as much as 16.5 percent to $20.98 on the Nasdaq, but pared most gains to trade up 1.6 percent in the midday session on Thursday.

It is a familiar picture for oil producers which have struggled with oversupply in the past three years, sending oil prices from above $100 a barrel to less than $50 a now. But it is proving a particular challenge for Kazakhstan, which has joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC nations in a pact to reduce output. Under the deal, Astana pledged to keep overall production at 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd). At the same time, it needs to reward investors in its giant Kashagan oil project that produces CPC but which started up last year five years behind schedule. So Astana is letting oil firms hike output from Kashagan in the Caspian Sea, which means it must cut from elsewhere. But the extra flows are piling pressure on CPC's already falling value. In 2013, light CPC crude traded at an average annual premium of $0.15 a barrel to dated Brent, then during 2014-2016 it slid to a discount of $0.11-$0.18. In the first five months of 2017, the discount had widened further to as much as $1.23.  Now it is more expensive to delay Kashagan again rather than sell discounted CPC Blend. Shareholders need the project to work now,  said one trader. Kashagan oil field has been developed by a consortium of China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL], Exxon Mobil, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Inpex and KazMunaiGas. Phase one cost $55 billion. Rising output from Kashagan has pushed up oil flows through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk. The pipeline, which also transports oil from other parts of Kazakhstan and Russia, pumped an average of 700,000 bpd in the past decade. But after Kashagan production began at the end of 2016, volumes rose to 900,000 bpd last year. That figure could rise this year to 1.2 million-1.3 million bpd, according to Caspian pipeline consortium which manages the pipeline.  The CPC Blend market is tough,  said one trader in the Mediterranean, traditionally the biggest market for the crude.  What's frightening is that we will have about 10 million tonnes extra of the grade to handle soon.  Mediterranean Restrictions Selling any light crude has been made tough due to cuts by OPEC, whose members have tended to reduce output of heavier oil preferred by some refiners, leaving the market awash with lighter grades. But CPC has characteristics that add to the challenge. Unlike Russia's main Urals export blend, CPC is a more difficult fit for refiners because it has a high level of mercaptans, a group of pungent gases.  In some Mediterranean refineries, CPC Blend processing is simply restricted due to the smell and harmful emissions, while it is also corrosive, so you can only process it if you have anti-corrosive coat on refinery units,  another trader said. In addition, more larger Suezmax crude carriers are being used to ship CPC as exports from Novorossiisk increase while the number of loading time slots remains limited. Some European ports will only take smaller Aframax vessels, traders said. This is pushing the blend to markets further afield.  Mediterranean refiners are not very keen on CPC, so the grade is now flowing worldwide, from Poland to Japan,  a source with a big European refiner said. Reuters Eikon data shows CPC Blend supplies to Asia increased sharply since the start of 2017, heading to markets where bigger Suezmax vessels help reduce transport costs. South Korea, India and Japan bought 800,000 tonnes, 700,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes of CPC respectively in January-May 2017. In the whole of 2016, those three countries bought 400,000 tonnes, 500,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes respectively. Elsewhere in Europe, Poland's PKN Orlen bought 700,000 tonnes of CPC this year for its Polish and Lithuanian refineries for the first time. But rising CPC shipments beyond its core Mediterranean market have not been enough to support its value. The grade that formerly balanced between premium and discount to BFOE has been traded far below dated Brent crude for six months, the longest period in its history, Reuters Eikon data showed.

Muslim Brotherhood leader Mursi, 65, was elected in 2012, then ousted by the military a year later after mass protests against his rule. He was immediately detained and was later sentenced to 20 years in jail.  We have filed a complaint today with the public prosecutor asking for an investigation into the medical negligence (Mursi) is facing,  said lawyer Abdel Moneim Abdel Maqsoud. Mursi's lawyer and family say he told them he experienced two diabetic comas this month and did not receive proper treatment in prison. He is demanding to be moved to a private hospital at his own expense. Former President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted by a popular uprising in 2011 and subsequently arrested and tried, spent most of his incarceration in a military hospital due to poor health. He eventually walked free. Sources at Egypt's prisons authority confirmed Mursi experienced a diabetic coma recently but denied he was being mistreated. They said he received the required treatment. A Reuters special report showed in 2015 that more than a hundred prisoners have died of medical neglect since the military takeover in 2013, most of whom were Islamists. The Muslim Brotherhood called on the United Nations and other international organizations to save Mursi's life.

Congo Republic, whose oil sector was ravaged by a dip in prices and production since 2014, has been rejuvenated by new projects scheduled to boost output by 25 percent to 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) next year and help an ailing economy hobbled by huge debt, civil unrest and deep-rooted corruption. The former French colony, ruled by President Denis Sassou Nguesso for all but five years since 1979, is expected to be the third largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa by next year, according to analysts. It is still a way off top African producers like Nigeria, where output is around 2 million bpd, and its new-found bounty will not affect oil prices. But a sustained rebound could help relaunch hospitals and water and power lines in one of the world's poorest countries, shelved during the downturn.  Congo is bucking the trend,  said Jean-Baptiste Bouzard, a sub-Saharan oil analyst at Wood Mackenzie, comparing the Central African country with the fading fortunes of nearby producers like Gabon, where output is falling. Oil production in Congo was dropping in 2012, squeezing an economy that relies on crude for most of its revenues. Then Italy's ENI found the Nene Marine oil field in shallow water 17 kms (10 miles) offshore. The 2012 discovery became the first in a string of finds off the country's Atlantic Coast that are now beginning to produce.  Five years ago, there were uncertainties over the country's remaining potential. ENI changed the game with the Nene Marine discovery,  said Bouzard. Nene Marine will by the end of this year produce 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent each day (boed) but has the potential to reach 150,000 boed in the coming years, an ENI spokeswoman said. France's Total in March started the country's biggest oil venture yet, called Moho Nord, which will have the capacity to hit 100,000 bpd. The Banga Kayo field, run by China's Wing Wah Petrochemical, will add 50,000 bpd by the end of 2017 or early 2018, the government said last month. Whether that will be enough to bring development to the country of around five million people, which adjoins the much larger Democratic Republic of Congo, is another question. Government revenues fell by more than half between 2014 and 2016 because of tanking oil prices, the World Bank says, costing thousands of jobs. Public debt runs at near 80 percent of GDP, according to the IMF. Meanwhile corruption continues to bleed the treasury. Thousands of  ghost workers  on the public payroll cost the state over $11 million a year, according to Maja Bovcon, senior Africa analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.  Starting production at the Moho Nord will unquestionably provide a welcome source of income,  Bovcon said. However,  rampant corruption and a dysfunctional bureaucracy help explain why Congo's goal of becoming an emerging economy remains a distant hope despite its vast oil wealth,  she said.

The vast oil sands deposits in northern Alberta are home to the world's third-largest crude reserves but also carry some of the world's highest production costs. With oil prices around $50 a barrel, it makes no economic sense to build new projects. International oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips have sold off billions in assets to Canadian producers since the start of 2017, stoking concerns about the future of the resource. Speaking on the fourth day of a five-day trip to China, Carr said the government's  minds are open  with regard to Chinese investment.  We think there are opportunities and we laid out, along with experts from industry, what we believe to be opportunities for them,  Carr told reporters on a conference call.  We would welcome investment from any nation that's interested in the oil sands. The trend of capital flows over the last little while has been international investors have been looking at their opportunities and decided to spread their resources, whereas Canadian investors have stepped up.  The previous Canadian government under Conservative Stephen Harper had a policy of limiting control of the oil sands by state-owned companies, such as China's CNOOC Ltd . They are still able to hold minority stakes in projects. Carr did not give details on what sort of investment Canada would welcome from China, but said his government is interested in looking at cases individually. Between 2005 and 2012 Chinese companies like PetroChina, CNOOC and Sinopec piled into the booming oil sands sector to secure China's energy needs. But some of those investments, like CNOOC's purchase of Nexen Energy, have been dogged with operational issues, raising questions over whether the Chinese would be reluctant to buy more oil sands stakes.  It's probably a question not of investing, but whether or not they sell,  said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn.  Non-Canadian entities have been selling the oil sands, why would the Chinese be different?  Last July Nexen indefinitely suspended plans to repair its Long Lake upgrader in northern Alberta after a deadly blast at the facility months earlier, leaving the fate of the facility in limbo.

Poloz on Risk of Housing Correction  We're only looking at what I call extreme events. So we're looking at something that is a little bit more probable than something else, both of them are still what economists call tail risks. Things that we need to be mindful of but no one is predicting that they're about to occur.   Moderate means more than low, and through time, I'm more comfortable observing that that risk that we talk about, the risk of a price correction in specific housing markets appears to be growing through time. It's not just a static thing, it's becoming more of a vulnerability, not less. That doesn't mean it's become highly probable.  Poloz on Signs of Economic Strength  It's important piece of the setting when we talk about these risks, that the economy has shown more signs of strength in recent months, and that we still have questions around sustainability and what risks we face on the macro front.  Poloz on Bank Actions and Oil Shock  It does appear that the actions that we took in 2015 have done a good job to facilitate the economy's adjustment to that shock. That's encouraging.  WILKINS ON CAUSES OF U.S. CREDIT CRISIS, CONTRAST TO CANADA  It is important to look at the U.S. experience and see to what extent there are similarities and differences and I think when you see house prices where they are and you see indebtedness it is quite tempting to draw parallels and at the same time when you understand what really led to the severity of the financial stress in the U.S., which was actually quite global in 2008 and 2009, it was related to a number of factors that are not present in Canada.  And one of them is just the underwriting standards in Canada are high and they are effectively enforced. We are not seeing the kind of ninja loans, if you remember those, just as an example, you look at delinquency rates, they are historically low, they still are.  I think really importantly is just the difference in laws, lenders in Canada have recourse to other household assets. It is not always the case in the U.S., and that changes the recovery rates for institutions if there is a problem but it also means that households have greater incentives to hang on and not walk away.  Wilkins on Securitization in Canada  And then I think finally and probably the most important thing is just how the mortgages were financed in the U.S. which related to very complex securitization products that packaged up risk and spread it around in a way that was completely mispriced and so when it unwound it just amplified the situation.  So what might have been a macro cycle ended up being a financial crisis. And so when you look at Canada we have much less securitization it's public, it's plain Jane.  Poloz on Alternative Lending Sector  There are lots of folks out there who are self-employed or have recently moved to Canada, other cases where they just don't have the paperwork it takes to walk in and be approved at a bank for a mortgage in 60 seconds because they don't fit the template.   So this alt-lending sector does an important service, it fills that space. It takes longer to kick the tires and do its credit approvals, but people do get a mortgage and as you can tell from the stats that have been published, they have very, very low default rates, so it's a business that works.  Poloz on Ratings for Canadian Banks  I see that (Home Capital situation) as unconnected to whether or not somebody is analysing the banking system as a whole and upgrading or downgrading ratings on the banks. That has traditionally been a focus on exposure to the housing sector, banks are always higly exposed, that's their bread and butter business. There are banks in the world that offload that stuff, they keep most of it on their balance sheet. That's a business model that's proven itself to be higly successful for a very long time. Whether they've been downgraded or not they are still extremely highly rated.  Poloz on Consumer Debt:  I'm reminded particularly by the correspondence flow that I get that there's an awful people out there who don't have mortgages, in fact have assets and are quite critical of how low interest rates are. So what happens when interest rates go up to those people is they have more income, they have more spending power. So it's important to understand that the average consumer out there is not the highly-indebted, 450 percent, consumer that we're concerned about in the tail distribution.  The average consumer has actually assets and no debt. So there's a lot of assets out there, which means then, the macroeconomic response to movements in interest rates has been more complicated by all this. It's not just people with mortgages affecting how that outcome play out.  Poloz on Possible Catalysts for House Price Correction  As time goes on you see more and more evidence that price increases in Vancouver and in Toronto have an element of speculation to them. So that's a separate, all-by-itself growing vulnerability. As I said before, the longer that goes, the bigger it gets, and the more you start to be concerned that not necessarily a global recession but just about anything could be responsible for causing a correction in housing.  A trigger or a catalyst that could be literally anything, it could be a change in policy or it could be what we saw in Vancouver a year ago was prices just got high enough that through their own weight, because you actually have to buy the house in the end and when the price gets really high it can be hard to finish that transaction, so people started to back away.  Poloz on Economic Resilience:  At this stage, I'm just comforted by the fact that the economy is showing better dynamics and that does go into this equation of financial risk as a positive. It means that the resilience is rising in the background, even if the vulnerabilities are also rising in the foreground. Poloz on Housing Market Speculation in Toronto, Vancouver:  The fundamental demand for housing in both of those markets. This is not by any stretch an entirely speculative situation. There are fundamental drivers that are pushing the demand for housing.  What we often forget is there's a supply side to this. The most important we've seen in Toronto is a very big rise in supply of houses that people are willing to sell ... There's an implied supply there, and that higher prices bring out those decisions.  Poloz on Rising Debt and Interest Rate Sensitivity  For every person that thinks that the vulnerability we're looking at will be a reason to hesitate to move interest rates higher, there's someone else who thinks it's a perfectly good reason to move rates higher.   Certainly what we're cognizant of is that there's been an increase in debt in the economy, so interest rate senstivity could be higher going forward than it has been historically.  Poloz on Debt and Housing  Debt is rising because people want to own a home. It's not really that complicated. And we've got solid fundamentals that are pushing the prices of those homes.   There are lots of other housing markets in Canada that are behaving completely normally. Fundamentals are solid, prices are rising gently, a little bit more than inflation maybe, but nothing untoward.   People borrow to buy a house but when we see the debt-to-income ratio rise, it is usually not because everybody who has got debt borrows some more, it is that some new family who has no debt has entered the housing market for the first time.   With the new rules in place we know that those folks have been stress-tested quite well. They are able to withstand as much as a 200 basis point renewal rate increase, because they got the income today to handle that even though that renewal might be five years from now, or it depends on what they have chosen. The point is that they have got time perhaps to have a higher income by then too. So in other words, the sustainability ingredients are all on the rise.

Or maybe the question should be, what's down with zinc?  London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc was trading just shy of $3,000 per ton as recently as late February. At one stage on Wednesday it hit a seven-month low of $2,427.50 and has since staged only a half-hearted recovery to $2,480.00.  All of the industrial metals have been hit by the chill coming off Beijing's attempts to cool an overheating shadow banking sector.  But zinc has been singled out for particular punishment. It is now the third worst year-to-date performer among the main LME-traded metals, besting only out-of-favor nickel and tin. And this despite what appeared to be every fund's favorite narrative of a fast-approaching supply crunch.  The funds have beaten a major retreat from the London zinc market.  If you believe the LME's Commitments of Traders Report, fund net long positioning was cut by around 883,500 tonnes between February and mid-May. There was a slight rebuild over the back end of last month but the most recent figures, covering the week to June 2, showed net length sliding again.  If you believe LME broker Marex Spectron's different take on speculative positioning, funds have turned net short on zinc.  Have they lost faith or is the recent fall-back just a strategic retreat?  Graphic on fund positioning on LME zinc:  tmsnrt.rs/2sG6VCb Graphic on zinc-lead relative value trade:  tmsnrt.rs/2r9gd7G Mission Accomplished? What has prompted the money men to reverse positioning on zinc?  There are as many strategies as there are funds but one or two key technical aspects of the recent market action are instructive.  The LME's figures show net fund length peaking on Feb. 14, one day after the benchmark three-month price had taken its second run at the $3,000 level.  This has long been a big-number target for bulls. This time last year there was bemused scepticism that someone had built up a long position on the $3,000 call option strike for June this year. Remember the price then was around $2,000.  Whoever had those options probably didn't do too badly, given zinc made its first attempt to get there in November last year with a high of $2,985.  The funds kept their faith at that stage but the second failed attempt on Feb. 13, when the bull charge ran aground at $2,980.50, seems to have persuaded many to cash in their chips and call it mission accomplished.  The fact that the price action had left a double-top on the charts would have whetted technical analysts' appetite for shorting zinc. The subsequent breach of a key uptrend line at $2,700 in early April even more so.  Compounding zinc's misfortunes has been its relationship with  sister metal  lead. At $610 per ton on Feb. 22 the zinc premium was as wide as it had been in 2007. Relative value traders, and there are many of them, have almost certainly been adding to the recent selling.  Shanghai Fizz All of which is ironic because zinc's slow-fuse bull story is starting to fizz.  True, significant tonnages of metal are still appearing on warrant in LME warehouses in New Orleans, reinforcing the sense that off-market stocks remain a key known unknown in the bull story. The last surge, totaling 22,100 tonnes, took place at the start of May.  LME stocks are still trending lower, though, last at 324,325 tonnes, down by 24 percent since the start of the year.  The real action, however, is taking place in China.  Visible stocks registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) have plummeted from almost 200,000 tonnes in March to 75,001 tonnes as of last Friday.  There seems to be a sticky front-month squeeze on the Shanghai market, the July contract trading at a consistent premium to the August contract for the last two weeks.  With several big local producers taking maintenance downtime, the arbitrage window for imports has opened.  April's imports of refined zinc at 47,500 tonnes were the strongest since March 2016.  My colleagues at Thomson Reuters GFMS suggest this metal  most likely came mainly from pre-existing stocks in Chinese bonded warehouse as the premium surged by 41 percent within the space of just two weeks . ( Base Metals Physical Trade/Arbitrage: May 2017 ) More may be on its way to replace it with physical traders anticipating further inflows in the coming months. All of which is written into the bull narrative.  China, the story goes, is going to be most acutely hit by the squeeze on raw materials, leading to stuttering domestic output of metal, leading to more imports.  So far, it would seem, so good.  Back for More?  Zinc is once again experiencing one of those disconnects between funds, fundamentals and technicals that we've seen before in this market. Fund length has been massively reduced since that second spike toward $3,000 with many taking profits before other, more nimble systems started feeding on the resulting deterioration in the charts. That process is still continuing.  However, if the current bullish news flow from the physical market keeps running at this rate, it's hard to believe there's not going to be a reaction from the money men.  Back in June 2016 those $3,000 call options sitting on June 2017 were a mark of zinc bulls' ambitions.  It's interesting, therefore, to consider the lie of the call option landscape in December this year. <0#MZNZ7+> There is market open interest all the way up to the $4,400 strike price, but the real stand-out in volume terms is the 1,800 lots (45,000 tonnes) resting at $3,500.  Not everyone, it seems, has given up on a zinc comeback.  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

Comments by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel marked the first international response to Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani's announced plans for a referendum to take place on Sept. 25.  Barzani heads the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq.   We can only warn against one-sided steps on this issue. The unity of Iraq is on the line,  Gabriel said in a statement.  Redrawing the lines of the state is not the right way and could exacerbate an already difficult and unstable situation, in Erbil as well as Baghdad.  Germany is a major partner for the Iraqi Kurds. It has provided 32,000 assault rifle and machine guns, as well as other weapons valued at around 90 million euros since September 2014. About 130 German soldiers are based in Erbil where they are providing training to the Peshmerga, Kurdish fighters.  I call on all sides to seek dialogue, to find consensus for dealing with open questions, and not to reignite conflicts in the disputed areas of Erbil and Baghdad,  Gabriel said. He said it was imperative to maintain unity within Iraq to enable the continued fight against the Islamic State militant group that has seized territory in Syria and Iraq.  The fight against Islamic State has not yet been won. Only  together will it be possible to take the next and perhaps most important steps to deal with the challenges to come,  he said.

Ante Ramljak said the money was arranged by bondholders led by Knighthead Capital Management and domestic banks, and the total included an 80 million euro loan Agrokor was granted in April. He said the 15-month loan had an interest rate of 4 percent annually and could be extended to 24 months, and was agreed under a so-called  roll-up  arrangement. This means that when the loan matures, Agrokor will settle some of its other debts to the lenders at the same time as repaying the loan. Ramljak also said the company had agreed a loan in delivered goods from suppliers worth up to 50 million euros. In total, when the new loan matures, Agrokor will repay 1.06 billion euros, including its obligations under the roll-up agreement, he said. According to Russia's Sberbank, a major lender to Agrokor, a roll-up arrangement would allow new creditors to claim superiority over previous debt to Agrokor. Earlier on Thursday, Sberbank said the commercial court in Zagreb had rejected its attempt to bar Agrokor from entering into new financing agreements on a roll-up basis. Agrokor's debt to Sberbank totals around 1.1 billion euros. Agrokor, which has around 60,000 employees, was put under state management in early April after it built up debts that amounted to at least 40.4 billion kuna ($6.1 billion) at the end of March. The company racked up debts during a rapid expansion, notably in Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Serbia.  This will be the last loan under crisis management,  Ramljak told reporters, adding the company should now enter a  calmer period  focused on restructuring and repaying creditors. $1 = 0.8911 euros Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Ivana Sekularac and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/croatia-agrokor-loan-idUSL8N1J54NZ"},

The STOXX 600  ended a choppy session flat in percentage terms, while Britain's blue chip FTSE index .FTSE was down 0.4 percent. European equities hit a session low while banking stocks .ST7P briefly turned negative after the ECB cut its inflation forecasts for the euro zone and signaled that it would not cut interest rates further.    Euro zone banks .SX7E also touched a session low and were last up 0.5 percent.  The biggest surprise has been that the ECB downgraded its inflation forecast and thereby automatically implies ... that it will provide monetary accommodation for quite a substantial time to come,  Dr. Frank Engels, head of multi-asset and investment committee at Union Investments, said.  In essence, it means the low interest rate environment will remain for quite a long time and that will be a headwind to the profitability of banks,  Union Investments' Engels added.     The pan-European benchmark has struggled since hitting a 21- month high in May with investors seeking fresh catalysts after a rally fueled by strong earnings and record inflows. On Thursday, the congressional testimony in the U.S. from ex-FBI director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump last month, also kept investors on the edge.  Markets are longing for more certainty, which will be needed in order to post the next leg higher. Today and tomorrow certainly have the potential to provide traders with a clearer outlook where the UK, the US and the Euro-zone is concerned,  said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets. In Britain, opinion polls on Wednesday showed that Prime Minister Theresa May was on course to increase her majority in parliament in Thursday's election, helping sterling. Bank stocks .SX7E .SX7P rose for a second day following the swift rescue of Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC by bigger rival Santander (SAN.MC), and Italian banks also recovered following on reports they could join the state in the rescue of troubled regional lenders in the Veneto region. [nL8N1J51MD] A source familiar with the matter said Rome was putting pressure on heavyweights Intesa SanPaolo (ISP.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) to take part so that other banks would follow their example. Intesa rose 1 percent higher and UniCredit gained 3.2 percent. The broader euro zone bank index .SX7E gained 1.8 percent.  The important thing is to get a solution fast and remove the uncertainty,  Stefano Fabiani, fund manager at Zenit said.  Santander wobbled a bit early yesterday but then it went positive. And it’s the same thing here.    Santander in Madrid rose 5.2 percent. While a 1.2 percent rise in basic resources .SXPP also helped broader gains, Utilities were another bright spot with RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) rising 2.3 and 4.2 percent respectively, adding to their rally in the previous session after a nuclear energy tax which penalized them was scrapped.

Be wary of becoming a victim of your own success, they say. Macron, a head of state who never before held elected office, is on a drive to shake up French politics, backed by a new centrist party of seasoned politicians, entrepreneurs and civil society activists. Perhaps even a bullfighter. Just a month ago, when the 39-year-old won the keys to the Elysee palace, Macron faced a huge question-mark over his party's chances of winning control of parliament and thus his ability to push through his reforms to revive the regulation-laden economy. Now, some opinion polls show him winning the biggest parliamentary majority for a French president since Charles de Gaulle's 1968 landslide. That, though, could pose some awkward questions for a party spanning the old left-right divide with a large contingent of political novices: How would he control the majority and avoid dissent within the ranks? And how would he balance political veterans and newcomers in key parliamentary positions?  Frederic Lefebvre, a center-right lawmaker who quit conservative Republicans party on Thursday, said Macron risked undermining his bid to renew French politics if his majority is seen as unrepresentative of the electorate.   A massive majority ultimately risks standing in the way of Macron's original mission ... which is to succeed in creating a new political mindset,  Lefebvre told France Info. Some Macron opponents are calling his future lawmakers  godillots , or yes men, a label given to De Gaulle's parliamentarians who were viewed as rubber-stamping his policies. LREM shrugs off the tag.  It is not a handicap to have life experiences that differ from those who follow a (career politician) path but in reality don’t represent society,  said Christophe Castaner, Macron's minister for parliamentary relations.  Nasty Fight  Macron, a former investment banker, wants deeper European integration. At home, where unemployment hovers near double digits, he promises to drive through a pro-business overhaul of the labor code to spur job creation. Yet a third of voters in the presidential election run-off on May 7 chose his rival Marine Le Pen, who has views diametrically opposed to his. In the first round, only about a quarter of those who voted picked Macron. So with polls now showing his Republic on the Move (LREM) party could win a majority of 100 seats or more in the 577-strong lower house of parliament, while Le Pen and tax-and-spend hard-leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon's France Unbowed party could get fewer than 20 seats between them, friction in the country is a concern, Macron's opponents say.  If Macron's candidates win, it will be a nasty fight,  Melenchon told Society magazine.   Melenchon said Macron  lacked the social base  to push through labor reforms that critics say would weaken the traditionally muscular trade unions. LREM retorts that its candidate list fits its declared aim of making French politics more representative.  They are men and women, citizens, unionists, business leaders, people who have real experience and who represent a little bit of France. To represent France, it’s a good thing to bring them together,  Castaner said earlier this week.

After nearly a quarter of a century at the helm of a company he founded in 1994, Hambro says he has begun addressing the succession issue and would consider selling at the right price. His objection is to what he terms a  takeover by stealth  of the London-listed company and a proposed change of the board, which would replace four of six board members - just when Petropavlovsk has returned to profit. One of the nominees is Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea Football Club, which had no immediate comment.  It is my belief that replacing the non-executive directors and myself on the board with their own nominees, is not in the interests of shareholders as a whole,  Hambro said of the plans of Vekselberg and other stakeholders. Hambro said he expected a ruling from London's takeover watchdog, which said it never comments on specific cases. Its rules on whether a formal takeover offer is necessary provide for examining whether shareholders are acting in concert, whether they have  a significant relationship  with nominees and when they crossed a threshold of 30 percent or more voting rights. Hambro is calling on an annual general meeting (AGM) in London on June 22 to vote against resolutions put forward by shareholders with a more than 30 percent stake in total. They are Vekselberg's conglomerate Renova, Sothic Capital Management and M&G.; All declined to comment. In separate resolutions, they call for new appointments to replace Hambro and non-executive directors Robert Jenkins, Alexander Green and Andrew Vickerman. In their place, in addition to Buck, they are nominating Vladislav Egorov, who works for the Renova group, Garrett Soden, who has worked for the Lundin group of companies for a decade, and Ian Ashby as chairman. Ashby headed BHP's  iron ore division from 2006 to 2012 and was named in May as a non-executive director at Anglo American, which declined to comment. Petropavlovsk in May announced Vickerman would become interim non-executive chairman after the June AGM. It has appointed recruitment specialists to find a permanent replacement for Hambro, who has agreed to stand down as chairman and become an executive director. Petropavlovsk returned to profitability in 2016 after restructuring to tackle its debts. Its share price has recovered to above eight pence from a low around 5 pence in early 2016. Following higher gold prices and lower costs, 2016 net profit stood at $31.7 million, compared with a 2015 net loss of $297.5 million.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 245,000 for the week ended June 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The report followed data on Tuesday showing job openings at a record high in April.   There is no sign of a pickup in the rate of layoffs. Against this backdrop of high job openings, firms appear to be holding on to their workers,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Claims surged by 20,000 in the prior week, with California, Tennessee, Kansas, and Missouri accounting for the bulk of the increase. Some of that increase was related to school summer breaks in which bus drivers and cafeteria workers were left temporarily unemployed. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 118 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 240,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 2,250 to 242,000 last week. The dollar rose against the euro after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold but cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back the central bank's massive bond-buying program. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher. Skills Mismatch Low layoffs and record high job openings suggest a deceleration in job growth in May was likely because companies could not find suitable workers. The economy created 138,000 jobs in May, well below the average monthly 181,000 jobs gained over the prior 12 months. The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000.  Labor market supply constraints are expected to bite into job creation but should also help to keep a lid on jobless claims as employers focus on retaining talent, so long as the economy continues to chug along,  said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Economists believe that labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March.  The Fed will continue to view the labor market data as signalizing that the economy remains at or near full employment,  said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.  Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 2,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended May 27. The so-called continuing claims now have been below 2 million for eight straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack. The four-week moving average of continuing claims slipped 750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.

The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showed consumption, including healthcare spending, increased at a faster clip than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published last month. Economists said the data suggested first-quarter consumer spending could be lifted by as much as eight-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.4 percent annual rate when the government publishes its third GDP estimate on June 29.  Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was reported last month to have grown at the start of the year at its slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2009.   This revision should be partially related to health care consumption, but other spending categories will likely play a role as well,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  The QSS data suggested first-quarter GDP could be revised up to as high as a 1.5 percent annualized rate from the 1.2 percent growth pace reported in May, according to economists.

The Port Authority circular was issued late on Wednesday and seen by Reuters on Thursday. It states:  Denial of entry into any of the Petroleum Ports, for all vessels arriving from, or destined to Qatar, regardless of its flag.  That was followed by a notice from the UAE's state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) on Thursday with the same language also seen by Reuters. The ban on all vessels carrying the Qatari flag and vessels owned or operated by Qatar remains in place and those ships will not be allowed into its petroleum ports, the port authority circulars said. The Abu Dhabi port authorities had eased the restrictions just a day earlier. The ban would potentially disrupt the common industry practice of co-loading oil cargoes from different countries onto a tanker to lower the costs of shipping. Preventing the co-loading of Qatari and other Middle East grades could add to refiners' transport costs and create logistical jams.  ADNOC has officially confirmed that we cannot co-load to and from (Qatar). So we need to find new vessels, then find co-loadings around the region,  said a source from an Asian refiner. Qatar is among the smallest of the Middle Eastern oil producers and refiners will load crude from there alongside bigger suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, and the UAE.  Re-tightening the restrictions on ships to and from Qatar will exacerbate the logistical issues that started on June 5 when Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Yemen severed ties with Qatar for allegedly funding terrorism.  This is the only thing that really matters - Qatar doesn't have that many vessels and most of their exports are co-loaded with other crudes,  the second shipbroker said. Despite the official ban, industry sources in both the Middle East and Asia indicated that the co-loading of Abu Dhabi crude along with Qatari oil may continue on a case-by-case basis. Customers under long-term contracts with ADNOC for crude may be given exemptions to the ban at ports including Das Island and Fujairah as long as the co-loaded cargo is not only from Qatar since ADNOC does want to upset those customers, said a Middle East-based industry source. Traders and refiners may explore alternatives like chartering smaller tankers or consider ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in the region to deal with the ban.  It's gotten to the point where we just want this to be over... we are scrambling again,  said a second Singapore-based shipbroker, adding that STS transfers could occur at designated areas offshore Oman.

The riyal hit an 11-year low of 3.6530 to the dollar late on Wednesday after Standard & Poor's cut Qatar's credit rating, citing this week's decision by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to sever diplomatic and transport ties with Doha. The dispute, over Saudi and UAE charges that Doha supports terrorism, triggered outflows of capital from Qatar which, if they persist, could eventually make it harder for authorities to maintain the riyal's peg of 3.64 to the dollar.  The central bank's move to gather data on the currency market was in response to this concern, Qatari commercial bankers said.  We now consider risks to external financing lines to the whole economy, including foreign direct investment, portfolio flows and to the financial sector, to be elevated, and this could lead to pressure on Qatar's pegged monetary arrangement,  said S&P.; The sources said banks in Qatar were asked to provide daily information on their foreign exchange trading, a daily statement of withdrawals and transfers from deposits worth at least 10million Saudi riyals ($2.7 million), and daily data oncash withdrawals and deposits.    Previously, banks were generally required to provide such information monthly.    The central bank also asked banks to supply on a weekly basis a breakdown of their customer deposits by maturity and type from Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt and other countries, the sources said. The central bank did not respond to requests for comment. The riyal rebounded to trade much closer to its peg in the spot market on Thursday; some traders said the central bank was supplying dollars to banks which wanted to close out their riyal positions, in order to avoid downward pressure on the currency.  There’s some stress in the Qatari riyal currency market but it’s too early to talk about pressure on the Qatari peg,  said a UAE treasury banker, who like most bankers declined to be named because of political sensitivities. S&P; estimated the government's liquid external assets were worth 170 percent of gross domestic product, a massive amount equivalent to nearly 10 years of the country's imports - a much higher degree of backing for its currency than most countries.  Tension Nevertheless, there were other signs of tension in Qatari financial markets on Thursday. The riyal remained under pressure in the offshore forwards market, which banks use to hedge against future moves in the currency. The cost of buying insurance against a Qatari sovereign debt default hit a seven-month high, and the cost of borrowing three-month riyal funds in the interbank market jumped to 2.16 percent, the highest in at least several years - a sign nervous banks were holding back funds. A major source of capital outflows from Qatar so far has been the stock market, which plunged 9.7 percent over three days before partially rebounding on Thursday. Some foreign portfolio managers sold stocks and sent the proceeds home. In addition, some banks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE are closing out Qatari riyal long positions and offloading part of their riyal assets to reduce their risk.  While Riyadh has told its banks it does not want them to do new business with Qatari institutions, neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE has yet clarified whether banks will be required to liquidate existing deals. Some bankers are cutting exposure now to limit the pain if they are forced into a firesale of assets. Other banks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have halted all transactions in the Qatari riyal, viewing them as too risky, although some remittances of money between the UAE and Qatar were continuing on Thursday, bankers said. A much bigger threat to the Qatari riyal than outflows from the stock market is the risk of an exodus in coming weeks and months from loans and deposits provided by foreign banks to Qatari banks. Foreign liabilities of Qatari banks increased to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015.

The deposits lie around Cinovec, a village with a tradition of mining since the 14th century and situated near the border with Germany, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of Europe's bid to build electric cars and develop battery technology. The resource, a term used for a deposit whose extent has yet to be proven by exploration, could amount to 1.3 million tonnes, or about 3 percent of the global lithium stock, according to the Czech Geological Survey. That would rank the Czech Republic behind Chile, China, Argentina, Australia and other nations with bigger lithium reserves. But surging global demand and hungry European industry are sparking international interest in the Czech deposits. Australia's European Metals, which bought exploration rights around Cinovec in 2012 and wants to start mining by 2019, said the resource could yield 20,800 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate, the processed ore that is sold to customers. Global demand is expected to rise three-fold to 535,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2025 from 2015, due to the boom in electric cars and electricity storage that has added to demand from making mobile phone batteries, Deutsche Bank said.  European Metals has dug exploratory shafts and plans to spend $393 million to develop the site near Cinovec, a village surrounded by forests and meadows and showing scars of surface mining for lignite that once employed many people in the area. The region now has the Czech Republic's highest jobless rate.  The permitting process is going along as it should be, everything is happening in an orderly fashion,  European Metals Managing Director Keith Coughlan told Reuters. The company has signed a memorandum on supply of lithium ore to HE3DA, a Czech startup battery producer.  HE3DA can be one of the biggest consumers,  HE3DA chief executive and founder Jan Prochazka told Reuters. Local Support A worker of Geomet company shows ore samples containing lithium at the company's office in the town of Dubi, Czech Republic, May 2, 2017.  Picture taken May 2, 2017.David W CernyThere are also other potential clients nearby. Daimler, owner of Mercedes-Benz, began construction in May of its second factory for lithium batteries, worth about 500 million euros, in Kamenz, a German town 90 km (56 miles) from Cinovec. Tesla Motors Inc. has also announced plans to build another  Gigafactory  for batteries, possibly in Europe, to match its plant in Nevada, the United States. European Metals still has steps to take before it can develop the mining site at Cinovec. It has to apply for permits from the State Mining Administration (SMA), a process that could last more than a year, an SMA spokesman said. It also needs approval from the Environment Ministry, which would consider any objections from nearby municipalities, although local communities have indicated they support the plan. Slideshow (6 Images) It would be a contribution to our town,  said Mayor Petr Pipal of Dubi, the municipality that includes Cinovec. Other companies are also showing interest in the resource.  Cinovecka Deponie, a unit of privately-owned Czech investment group RSJ, won permits to extract lithium from tailings left around Cinovec from past tin mining. It did not offer further details when contacted by Reuters. Albright Stonebridge Group, co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, made enquiries to the regional authorities about possible lithium extraction, Czech media reported. The group did not respond to Reuters queries. One challenge for miners is that ore around Cinovec contains relatively small amounts of lithium. Jaromir Stary, an expert at the Czech Geological Survey, said it contains four times less lithium in its ore than at the Greenbushes mine in Australia. But European Metals is undeterred. Its pre-feasibility study in April estimated costs at $3,483 per tonne of lithium carbonate, a level it said would ensure it could turn a profit. It said the magnetic-sensitive nature of Cinovec's ore makes processing cheaper than other types. Spot battery grade 99.5 percent lithium carbonate in China, where most lithium batteries are manufactured, now trades around 140,000 yuan ($20,575.53) per tonne, after a peak of about 171,000 yuan last year.

The currency bloc has been on its best economic run since the global financial crisis nearly a decade with millions of jobs created since the ECB's stimulus effort started. But inflation is barely moving upwards and growth may be plateauing, putting the ECB into a difficult spot. Acknowledging improved prospects, the ECB dropped a pledge to cut rates if necessary and gave up a long-standing reference to risks to the economy, declaring the outlook  balanced . Yet rate setters did not even discuss winding down the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) asset purchase scheme, kept rates below zero, and pledged very substantial accommodation. The ECB also cut most of its inflation projections, even as it predicted better growth, suggesting that it has been overestimating the impact of rapid job creation on wages and ultimately prices.   We consider that risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced,  ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference in the Estonian capital of Tallinn.  He said the bank removed the language about potentially lowering interest rates because ultra-low inflation risks have gone.  Related CoverageECB policy changes came without dissent - DraghiECB's Draghi drops reference to 'downside risks' to economy (But) if these risks were to reappear, we would certainly be ready to lower rates,  he said. With Thursday's decision, the ECB's deposit rate, its key policy tool, remains at -0.4 percent. Its monthly asset purchases will continue to total 60 billion euros a month and to run until at least December. The euro EUR= hit a one-week low of $1.11995, down around 0.4 percent on the day, as Draghi spoke. September? European Central Bank President Mario Draghi arrives to the news conference following the Governing Council meeting in Tallinn, Estonia, June 8, 2017.Ints KalninsPlaying down the significance of its new guidance and the forecast cuts, Draghi said the general path of inflation has not changed and rate cuts are not impossible, giving his message a dovish tilt.  Nothing substantial has happened to inflation except the price of oil and the price of food ... underlying inflation has remained the same year to year,  he noted. The next major test will come in September, when the bank will probably decide whether to continue bond buys beyond this year or start to wind them down, known as tapering.  There is a growing risk that tapering is slower and takes longer than the market currently expects,  Cosimo Marasciulo, a bond manager at Pioneer Investments said. Slideshow (8 Images)The ECB said it now saw inflation this year at just 1.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 1.7 percent and still short of its target of close to 2 percent. That would barely rise to 1.6 percent in 2019, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7 percent and further away from its official target of at or close to two percent. Economic growth this year was seen at 1.9 percent versus an earlier 1.8 percent forecast.  That came after the EU statistics agency Eurostat earlier revised up its estimate of first quarter growth to its fastest rate in two years, saying the economy of the 19-country euro zone expanded by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.9 percent year-on-year. The ECB's nuanced stance was also motivated by the big debts overhanging governments and companies, the piles of unpaid loans weighing on banks in countries like Italy and Portugal, and political uncertainty ahead of elections in Germany and Italy.    Any announcement on its quantitative easing (QE) program is seen not coming until the autumn, when policymakers hope the economic picture will have become clearer. German politicians in particular have called for an earlier end to QE, saying it is eroding the assets of savers and discourages other eurozone countries from pursuing reforms to make their economies more efficient. However Draghi there were no visible divisions at the Governing Council's meeting.  I didn't hear any dissenting voice ... with respect to the proposals,  he said.

Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission J. Christopher Giancarlo said the United States has always been comfortable regulating clearinghouses that are not in the country but in which U.S. traders participate.  But he said that if the European Union decides that euro-denominated swaps need to be cleared in Europe, instead of London, where they have historically been handled, that would raise questions about the U.S. position. Britain is currently in the throes of withdrawing from the European Union, raising questions about the financial hub of London.  And if the whole world were to go to that regime I think that would actually be detrimental to global markets, to global trade, to the dollar standing as the world's reserve currency,  he said at a Congressional hearing on the regulator's budget.

Expanding into beef and poultry would bring U.S.-based Smithfield [SFII.UL], the world's largest pork producer, more in line with competitors Tyson (TSN.N), JBS (JBSS3.SA) and BRF SA (BRFS3.SA), which each process pork, chicken and beef. Smithfield Chief Executive Ken Sullivan told Reuters he is interested in the potential of diversifying into other meats to broaden the company's product portfolio, though no deals were imminent.  We're a food company,  he said.  No one said that we're strictly a pork company.  Sullivan did not provide further detail, but parent WH Group is looking for targets in beef and poultry in the United States and Europe, according to Luis Chein, WH Group's director of investor relations. He declined to name specific targets. Chein declined to provide a timeline for expanding into the U.S. beef and poultry business or say how much money the company aims to spend.   It is an attractive time to enter the beef business, Chein said, because China last month agreed to resume U.S. imports after blocking most shipments since a U.S. scare over mad cow disease in 2003. WH Group, which spent $4.7 billion for Smithfield in 2013, still has firepower for further buying, with bank balances and cash of $1.14 billion at the end of last year and $2.72 billion in unutilized banking facilities, according to its latest annual report. Its search reflects wider disruption in the agriculture sector, where historically low grain prices have triggered a wave of consolidation among global seed and chemical companies. Cheap grain and strong demand for meat have generally helped increase operating margins for producers of pork, beef and chicken.  WH Group Chairman and CEO Wan Long (L) and Smithfield President and CEO Kenneth Sullivan attend a news conference on WH Group's annual results in Hong Kong, China March 29, 2016.Bobby YipThe meat sector also has seen a major player, JBS of Brazil, struggle for sales after inspectors in the country were accused of taking bribes to allow sales of tainted food. JBS, the world's largest meat packer, announced on Tuesday that it was selling assets in South America in the company's first deal since its founders admitted to paying bribes to Brazilian politicians in exchange for favors.  JBS, in response to questions from Reuters on Wednesday, said its core U.S. assets, including chicken company Pilgrim's Pride Corp (PPC.O), are not for sale. Slideshow (2 Images)A move to acquire beef and poultry assets would be an about-face for Smithfield, which agreed to sell U.S. beef operations to JBS in 2008 for about $565 million and a stake in turkey producer Butterball LLC for about $175 million in 2010.  But it would fit into the company's efforts to run the entire production process by reducing its dependence on outside producers, which currently supply Smithfield with beef and chicken to make into products such as hot dogs. Chein said it was  certainly the direction  for the company to mirror the vertically integrated model it has for the pork business in other meats. Smithfield owns most of the hogs it slaughters along with processing plants.  For us, the next step to develop our business is to consider other sources of animal protein,  Chein said. Chein said WH Group would prefer to buy assets such as slaughterhouses and processing plants to expand into beef and will consider all types of operations in the poultry supply chain. He added that the company sees big room for growth in beef and poultry consumption in China.  The United States had 808 federally inspected livestock slaughterhouses last year, down more than a third from 1990, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

He is demanding to be moved to a private hospital at his own expense. Former President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted by a popular uprising in 2011 and subsequently arrested and tried, spent most of his incarceration in a military hospital due to poor health. He eventually walked free. Sources at Egypt's prisons authority confirmed Mursi experienced a diabetic coma recently but denied he was being mistreated. They said he received the required treatment.

Sterling GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 had hit a two-week high of $1.2978 in morning trade in London after polling organisations' last surveys, but slipped back later in the day to trade down 0.2 percent at $1.2939 by 1555 GMT.  The pound gained as much as 4 percent after Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election seven weeks ago. Polls initially suggested a landslide win for May's Conservatives that was seen giving the prime minister a stronger hand in Britain's looming negotiations on leaving the European Union.  But sterling has since fallen from its highs as the polls have narrowed.   The market has not bet everything on having a nice clear outcome - it knows we might get a surprise,  said Societe Generale chief macro strategist Kit Juckes, adding that a Conservative victory would therefore be likely to drive a clearout of short positions and a stronger pound.   The only outcome that’s got enough clarity to get short-covering is a bigger Conservative majority.   Volumes of spot trading in sterling against the dollar were less than half of their normal daily averages, with the bigger price action in options contracts used by companies and investors to hedge against major swings in the currency.  Sterling overnight implied volatility surged past 30 percent against both the euro and the dollar EURGBPONO= GBPONO= before easing back a little later in the day.   Against the euro those were the highest rates since the aftermath of last year's Brexit referendum vote to leave the European Union, pointing to nerves that an upset could deny May an outright victory.    The pound is likely to stage a modest relief rally if the Conservatives secure a larger majority,  said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst with MUFG in London.    The final polls support that assumption revealing that the Conservatives hold an average lead of around 7.5 percentage points, which compares to the 6.5 percent advantage they won over the Labour Party in the 2015 elections.

Sterling GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 had hit a two-week high of $1.2978 in morning trade in London after polling organisations' last surveys, but slipped back later in the day to trade down 0.2 percent at $1.2939 by 1555 GMT.  The pound gained as much as 4 percent after Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election seven weeks ago. Polls initially suggested a landslide win for May's Conservatives that was seen giving the prime minister a stronger hand in Britain's looming negotiations on leaving the European Union.  But sterling has since fallen from its highs as the polls have narrowed.   The market has not bet everything on having a nice clear outcome - it knows we might get a surprise,  said Societe Generale chief macro strategist Kit Juckes, adding that a Conservative victory would therefore be likely to drive a clearout of short positions and a stronger pound.   The only outcome that’s got enough clarity to get short-covering is a bigger Conservative majority.   Volumes of spot trading in sterling against the dollar were less than half of their normal daily averages, with the bigger price action in options contracts used by companies and investors to hedge against major swings in the currency.  Sterling overnight implied volatility surged past 30 percent against both the euro and the dollar EURGBPONO= GBPONO= before easing back a little later in the day.   Against the euro those were the highest rates since the aftermath of last year's Brexit referendum vote to leave the European Union, pointing to nerves that an upset could deny May an outright victory.    The pound is likely to stage a modest relief rally if the Conservatives secure a larger majority,  said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst with MUFG in London.    The final polls support that assumption revealing that the Conservatives hold an average lead of around 7.5 percentage points, which compares to the 6.5 percent advantage they won over the Labour Party in the 2015 elections.  There has been a wide split in polling ahead of Thursday's vote - some surveys showing May only 1-3 points ahead while others give her an 8-10 point margin.

Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission J. Christopher Giancarlo said the United States has always been comfortable regulating clearinghouses that are not in the country but in which U.S. traders participate.  But he said that if the European Union decides that euro-denominated swaps need to be cleared in Europe, instead of London, where they have historically been handled, that would raise questions about the U.S. position. Britain is currently in the throes of withdrawing from the European Union, raising questions about the financial hub of London.  And if the whole world were to go to that regime I think that would actually be detrimental to global markets, to global trade, to the dollar standing as the world's reserve currency,  he said at a Congressional hearing on the regulator's budget.  So I think there are tremendous ramifications that come out of how the negotiators on both sides of the Brexit consider this.

The major FTSE 100 benchmark slid steadily throughout the session to close 0.4 percent lower at 7,449.98 points, after the European Central Bank signalled an end to more interest rate cuts, and ahead of results from Britain's parliamentary elections. Polls indicated Prime Minister May's gamble on securing a bigger Conservative majority would be rewarded with a win, though the surprise 2016 vote to quit the European Union meant investors were considering all scenarios. Mid-caps have outperformed the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 so far this year but the blue-chips have gained back some ground in recent weeks as tightening polls prompted greater caution on domestic stocks.  Some investors, possibly the market makers, have been told to get their books fairly straight rather than having long positions in stocks that could take a caning,  said Paul Mumford, manager of the Cavendish opportunities fund.  If you were to get a coalition, or Labour win, or a very small, difficult-to-work Conservative result, then the market would take it quite badly in the short term, the pound would drop and this would provide a boost to the exporters,  he added.  So the FTSE 100 has performed relatively well because people want to have an overseas hedge.  Inversely, a bigger majority for the Conservatives could prompt institutions to pick up some bargains among mid-caps, Mumford said. U.S. bank Citi advised investors to hedge political risk through the  UK 8 , a list of blue-chip stocks least exposed to domestic sales, while avoiding the  Anti UK 8  stocks with the greatest dependence on the British economy. Traders in the City of London prepared for a long night, with banks and brokers pulling in extra staff to cover for potential volatility as results trickle in. While macroeconomic events were front and centre of investors' minds, some company moves stood out. Centrica and SSE were among the top 10 blue-chip gainers. Their share prices have dipped in recent weeks as the election approached, with investors concerned about manifesto promises to cap energy prices or nationalise the companies. Firms going ex-dividend weighed, however, with Vodafone falling 4.8 percent and WPP down 2.7 percent. Among mid-caps, Berendsen jumped 11 percent, the most actively traded stock as investors cheered a merger with Elis after the French laundry firm sweetened its offer for the company. Elis' latest offer valued Berendsen at 2.2 billion pounds, or 1,250p a share, a 45 percent premium to its closing price before the initial takeover offer last month. Petrofac shares jumped more than 4 percent, among top European gainers, after the oil services firm sealed a 10-year deal with Petroleum Development Oman.

Comey said he was disturbed by President Donald Trump's bid to get him to drop a probe into former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, but would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. Comey said he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election, but was confident that no votes had been altered. Investors are concerned that any major revelation by Comey could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  The hearings should be mostly a non-event for stocks unless there is some kind of unforeseen 'smoking gun' either way – detrimental to the president or beneficial to him,  said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Separately, it looks like the market is looking for excuses to go higher as it dances around all-time highs. Earnings are rising, rates are falling, and the technical indicators show the market in an uptrend, so if the hearings maintain the status quo, it could move money off the sidelines into stocks.  Earlier on Thursday, the European Central Bank signaled no further interest rate cuts as euro zone prospects improved, but said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump more stimulus into the region's economy. Of interest is also the UK general election, with opinion polls showing Theresa May's Conservative Party leading between 5 and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority. At 11:50 a.m. ET (1550 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.04 points, or 0.1 percent, at 21,194.73. The S&P; 500 was up 0.29 points, or 0.011 percent, at 2,433.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 9.15 points, or 0.15 percent, at 6,306.53, easing from its all-time high of 6311.89. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the defensive utilities index's 1.29 percent loss topping the decliners. Shares of Alibaba Group Holding were up 10.3 percent at $138.54 after the company said it expects revenue growth of 45-49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. Yahoo, which owns a 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba rose 7.6 percent to $54.38. Nordstrom jumped 10.7 percent to $44.86 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,457 to 1,324. On the Nasdaq, 1,749 issues rose and 990 fell.

Comments by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel marked the first international response to Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani's announced plans for a referendum to take place on Sept. 25.  Barzani heads the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq.   We can only warn against one-sided steps on this issue. The unity of Iraq is on the line,  Gabriel said in a statement.  Redrawing the lines of the state is not the right way and could exacerbate an already difficult and unstable situation, in Erbil as well as Baghdad.  Germany is a major partner for the Iraqi Kurds. It has provided 32,000 assault rifle and machine guns, as well as other weapons valued at around 90 million euros since September 2014. About 130 German soldiers are based in Erbil where they are providing training to the Peshmerga, Kurdish fighters.  I call on all sides to seek dialogue, to find consensus for dealing with open questions, and not to reignite conflicts in the disputed areas of Erbil and Baghdad,  Gabriel said. He said it was imperative to maintain unity within Iraq to enable the continued fight against the Islamic State militant group that has seized territory in Syria and Iraq.  The fight against Islamic State has not yet been won. Only  together will it be possible to take the next and perhaps most important steps to deal with the challenges to come,  he said. The president of Iraq's ruling Shi'ite coalition told Reuters in April it would oppose a Kurdish referendum. A senior Kurdish official, Hoshiyar Zebari, told Reuters in April the expected  yes  vote would strengthen the Kurds' hand in talks on self-determination with Baghdad and would not mean automatically declaring independence. The Kurds play a major role in the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State (IS), the ultra-hardline Sunni Islamist group that overran about a third of Iraq three years ago and also controls parts of Syria.  Reporting by Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold  Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-germany-idUSL8N1J556Q"},

The government will not allow the direct export of minerals from mines,  finance and planning minister Philip Mpango said in his budget speech in parliament.  The government will set up clearing houses at international airports, mines and exit border points where a 1 percent clearing fee will be imposed on the value of mineral exports.  Mpango said the government would announce more details on the new mineral clearing fee at a later date. Last month, President John Magufuli fired his mining minister and the chief of the state-run mineral audit agency after an investigation into possible undeclared exports by mining companies. A second audit of the mining sector is now underway after Magufuli said the first audit committee said it found Acacia Mining had 10 times more gold in its containers than the company had declared, as well as undeclared minerals such as iron and sulphur. Acacia has denied any wrongdoing and said the state's audit of the company's gold and copper ore was inaccurate and has said it would consider its options in the east African country. Introduction of the clearing fee also comes after Magufuli ordered a ban on exports of gold and copper concentrates in March to push for domestic value addition of minerals through the construction of a copper smelter. Magufuli also announced in May that his government would enforce a new rule requiring mining companies to list on the country's stock exchange by August 23. Major foreign-owned mining companies in Tanzania that will be affected by the requirement to list on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange include Acacia Mining, AngloGold Ashanti and Petra Diamonds. Tanzania is Africa's fourth-biggest gold producer and also has vast deposits of coal, uranium and precious gemstones. Magufuli said he hoped the listings would bring more transparency and offer the public a share of the mining industry's profits. Since coming into office in November 2015, Magufuli has targeted large companies, particularly mining and telecoms businesses, in a crackdown on tax evasion.

Fitch has also affirmed the senior debt ratings of Reinsurance Group of America, Inc. (RGA) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions is provided at the end of this release. The ratings were affirmed because RGA continues to maintain its strong business profile as the largest provider of individual and group life reinsurance in North America and as one of the leading life and health reinsurers in the world. The ratings reflect the company's very strong long-term financial performance and earnings, strong risk-adjusted capitalization, and strong liquidity. RGA's ratings also consider its relatively high financial and operating leverage. Fitch believes RGA faces operating challenges in its core traditional life reinsurance business in the U.S., which has been subject to competitive pricing and declining cession rates. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch considers RGA's business profile to be strong. RGA has built upon its historical strength in the North American mortality market by diversifying geographically and by product. Offsetting these positives, diversification has increased the company's exposure to interest rate risk due to growth in asset-intensive businesses. RGA's capitalization and leverage are strong. However, Fitch considers RGA's financial leverage to be high for a life insurer. The financial leverage ratio was 35% at year-end 2016, and declined to 32.2% following the repayment of $300 million of senior notes in March 2017. The company's total financing and commitments ratio of 1.0x is also considered high. Fitch believes, however, that the group's ability to service its debt remains strong. Operating earnings-based interest coverage was 7.2x in 2016. Fitch views the statutory capitalization of RGA Reinsurance as strong, although the company relies on affiliated captive reinsurance to maintain target capital levels. RGA Reinsurance's reported risk-based capital (RBC) ratio was 365% at year-end 2016. RGA uses affiliated captive reinsurers primarily to manage the excess statutory reserves associated with its term-life book of business. Fitch views RGA's above-average reliance on captive reinsurance as a unique risk. New NAIC requirements regarding the use of captive reinsurers have been introduced that will allow RGA's current captive arrangements to remain in place but will place limitations on its ability to utilize captives to finance reserve growth related to future business. Fitch views RGA's run-rate profitability as very strong and in line with rating expectations. The company reported operating income of $633 million for 2016, up 11.6% from 2015. The improvement in 2016 results was primarily due to an increase in investment-related gains, higher investment income and improved mortality experience in the U.S. operations. Fitch anticipates competitive challenges in the company's core U.S. traditional business, higher mortality and morbidity in select non-U.S. markets, ongoing low interest rates, and the impact of weak foreign currencies will constrain profits over the medium term. Fitch has noted an increase in earnings volatility due to changes in RGA's operating profile. RGA's ratings consider the company's historical focus on traditional individual life mortality risk in the U.S. and Canada, where results have been relatively stable. The ratings also recognize that RGA's other business, including long-term care, longevity risk and group life and health, account for an increasing proportion of earnings. While individual mortality experience is still the dominant driver of operating earnings in the U.S. traditional segment, Fitch expects the trend towards potentially riskier financial solutions to continue. Fitch believes RGA's liquidity at the holding company level is strong. The holding company has committed to maintain cash and liquid assets of approximately $300 million. At year-end 2016, the holding company had $1.4 billion in cash and invested assets, or 9x projected 2017 interest expense. The next material upcoming debt maturity is in 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --A decline in GAAP earnings as evidenced by deterioration in GAAP interest coverage to below 6x; --RBC of RGA Reinsurance drops below 300% on a sustained basis; --GAAP asset leverage of 12x or higher. Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --RBC of RGA Reinsurance of 400% or more on a sustained basis; --Financial leverage maintained in the 28% range; --GAAP interest coverage of 9x or more; --GAAP asset leverage below 10x.

The investment was led by Open CNP, the corporate venture arm of French insurer CNP Assurance SA, with participation from the Digital Currency Group and existing investor Otium Venture, Stratumn said. Stratumn, which employs 15 people, said it will use the funding to develop its technology and double the size of its team by the end of 2018.  Our new investors will enable Stratumn to continue and accelerate its development and more effectively address growing needs in our markets,  Richard Caetano, co-founder and chief executive of Stratumn, said in a statement. The company said it has already developed projects with large companies including CNP Assurances, Allianz France, Nasdaq, and Thales SA. Large companies, including banks and market infrastructure providers, have ramped up investments in blockchain over the past year in the hopes of slashing costs associated with some of their most cumbersome processes, such as securities settlement and international payments. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared ledger of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, rather than a centralized authority. Proponents of the nascent technology say it offers a more secure and transparent way to record large amounts of data. Skeptics have warned the technology is still in its early days and may need several more years before it can be deployed on a large scale. As part of the deal, Stratumn and Nasdaq have also entered a partnership to conduct joint research and development activities on blockchain applications in capital markets, the companies said. Nasdaq declined to comment on how much it has invested in Stratumn. Nasdaq was one of the earliest supporters of the technology among large financial institutions. In May 2015 it announced it would use the technology to operate its market for shares of private companies and a few months later backed San Francisco-based blockchain startup Chain. The group is also looking to sell blockchain-based systems through its division that provides trading technology to exchanges and clearing houses globally.  An investment in Stratumn was a natural development for us given the experimentation projects we have successfully executed with Richard and his team over the past year,  Jean-Jacques Louis, Nasdaq head of corporate strategy, said in a statement.

DuBose's death fueled U.S. demonstrations against the use of lethal force by white officers against unarmed blacks and other minorities, an issue that renewed debate about racial bias by police.  Officer Ray Tensing, 27, shot once, hitting Samuel DuBose, 43, in the head, body-camera video showed, after stopping him for a missing front license plate on his car in July 2015. Tensing, who is white, is charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter in a retrial.      Ray Tensing, as he made that traffic stop, he didn't anticipate that Sam DuBose was going to drive off with Ray's arm caught in that car,  Stew Mathews told the jury during opening statements at a county courthouse in Cincinnati.  This all happened so quickly that instinctively Ray Tensing did the only thing he could do to save his own life,  Mathews added.     Tensing, who has pleaded not guilty and is free on a $1 million bond, was afraid he would be dragged and possibly killed as DuBose started to drive away, Mathews said after discussing how Tensing had reached into the car.

If DuBose had cooperated with Tensing during the stop, he would not be dead, Mathews said. During the traffic stop, Tensing asked DuBose to remove his seat belt and tried to open the car door. DuBose did not comply and closed the door. The vehicle started rolling forward slowly, and with his arm pinned against the steering wheel, according to his lawyer, Tensing pulled his gun and fired once.

The Rating Outlook is Positive. A complete list of ratings is outlined at the end of this release. As of March 31, 2017, IPG had approximately $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. The notes outstanding under the CP program will rank pari passu with IPG's other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness. IPG's $1 billion revolver, expiring October 2020, provides liquidity back-up to the CP program. Proceeds from amounts borrowed under the CP program are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of upcoming maturities. The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that IPG's credit protection metrics and credit profile are strong for the 'BBB' rating. IPG's operating profile has shown marked improvement since FY 2012 (EBITDA margins have improved more than 200bps), and the company continues to make progress in closing the gap relative to its peer group. Fitch believes this improvement will continue as the business grows and IPG further scales its cost structure while maintaining its conservative financial posture. KEY RATING DRIVERS --IPG's ratings reflect its position in the industry as one of the largest global advertising and marketing services holding companies, its diverse client base, and ample liquidity. --The ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the advertising industry and potential top-line volatility due to client wins or losses in any given year. IPG has reduced its exposure to U.S. advertising cycles by diversifying into international markets and marketing services businesses. For FY 2016, approximately 40% of IPG's revenues were generated outside the U.S. IPG delivered organic revenue growth of 5.0% and 2.7% in 2016 and first quarter 2017, respectively. The company expects organic growth in the range of 3%-4% in 2017. Fitch believes this is achievable given its current forecast for U.S. GDP growth and Worldwide GDP growth of 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively, for 2016. --Digital ad spend continues to capture more of the total advertising market. IPG remains platform-agnostic and the company remains focused on growing and strengthening its digital capabilities across their agency portfolio in line with market trends. --The risk of revenue cyclicality is balanced somewhat by the flexible cost structures of IPG and the other global advertising holding companies. IPG has made significant progress in improving EBITDA margins from 10.7% in FY 2009 to 15.1% in FY 2016. Fitch expects the EBITDA margin to remain around 15.0% for the 2017 fiscal year and expects IPG to remain at around this level, which is in line with peers, over the next two to three years, assuming low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth over this timeframe. --The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that IPG will manage unadjusted gross leverage to a level below 2.0x. Fitch expects capital deployment to go toward acquisitions, share buy backs and dividend growth. However, Fitch expects any such deployment to remain in the context of current ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for IPG include: --Margins expected to improve from cost controls and operating leverage; --Model assumes continued dividend growth; --Model assumes share buyback near prior ranges as well as ongoing acquisitions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch would consider an upgrade if IPG continues to demonstrate improvement in its operating profile, specifically maintaining EBITDA margins of approximately 15%, to bring them more in line with industry peers while maintaining leverage below 2.0x. Fitch is comfortable with management's willingness and ability to maintain its 'BBB' rating. However, a change in the company's posture regarding adequate bondholder protection over the near and long term could negatively affect the rating. This may include an unadjusted gross leverage greater than 2.75x, significant margin erosion, or sustaining free cash flow (FCF) margin below 3%. LIQUIDITY IPG's total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2017 was $1.9 billion (including capital leases). Fitch calculates unadjusted gross leverage at 1.6x. Fitch views IPG's liquidity as solid. IPG's liquidity position is supported by a cash balance of $775 million and marketable securities of $3.1 million as of March 31, 2017, in addition to $992 million of availability under its $1 billion revolving credit facility due Oct. 2020. The company's next two maturities are $300 million due in November 2017 and $250 million in 2022. Fitch-calculated FCF increased to $327 million in the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended March 31, 2017, from $267 in 2013. For 2017, Fitch expects FCF in the range of $400 million to $500 million, and that IPG can maintain sufficient liquidity to handle seasonal working capital swings. Fitch's FCF expectation also incorporates capital expenditures of $170 million to $200 million. In addition, Fitch's FCF expectations incorporate IPG's increased quarterly common dividend, to $0.18/share, for total annual cash dividend payments of approximately $280 million. IPG's U.S. pension plan was $31.6 million underfunded as of the end of 2016. IPG should have no issues meeting any required U.S. pension plan funding. In February 2017, IPG announced an additional $300 million share repurchase authorization, increasing total remaining authorization to $400.4 million as of March 31, 2017. The rating incorporates Fitch's belief that the company will deploy liquidity, including FCF, toward share repurchases and acquisitions in a disciplined manner. Fitch expects IPG to continue to target small bolt-on acquisitions, and the current ratings do not contemplate or expect a materially large acquisition.

Police said that 14 people were killed before government troops beat back the raid. Maiduguri is the center of the eight-year-old fight against Boko Haram, which has been trying to set up an Islamic caliphate in the northeast. The fighters attacked the city's suburbs with anti-aircraft guns and several suicide bombers, said Damian Chukwu, police commissioner of Borno State, of which Maiduguri is the capital.  A total of 13 people were killed in the multiple explosions with 24 persons injured, while one person died in the attack (shooting),  he told reporters. Osinbajo went ahead with his visit to Maiduguri, planned prior to the attack, launching a government food aid initiative to distribute 30,000 metric tonnes of grains to people displaced by the insurgency, his spokesman Laolu Akande said. President Muhammadu Buhari handed power to Osinbajo after going to Britain on medical leave on May 7. Aid workers and Reuters witnesses reported explosions and heavy gunfire for at least 45 minutes in the southeastern and southwestern outskirts of the city. Thousands of civilians fled the fighting, according to Reuters witnesses. The police commissioner said several buildings were set on fire but the military repulsed the fighters after an hour. The raid took place six months after Buhari said Boko Haram had  technically  been defeated by a military campaign that had pushed many insurgents deep into the remote Sambisa forest, near the border with Cameroon. More than 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram's campaign to establish a caliphate in the Lake Chad basin. A further 2.7 million have been displaced, creating one of the world's largest humanitarian emergencies. Despite the military's success in liberating cities and towns, much of Borno remains off-limits, hampering efforts to deliver food aid to nearly 1.5 million people believed to be on the brink of famine. The government food program launched by Osinbajo seeks to distribute grains to 1.8 million people delivered quarterly, his office said in an emailed statement. The acting president, speaking in Maiduguri, said a  comprehensive livelihood and support program  would be launched by the government within weeks.  A United Nations official on Wednesday said the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) has had to scale back plans for emergency feeding of 400,000 people in the region due to funding shortfalls.

The Socialist Integration Movement (SIM) party of Ilir Meta became the unavoidable king-maker, first in alliance with the Democrats and later jumping ship to govern with the Socialists. Rama and Basha thrashed out a deal in May agreeing to work on constitutional and electoral reform and back Albania's EU bid with one voice, but have not been clear if that means any form of government coalition.

Exclusion of the Odebrecht plea bargain testimonies by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal would strengthen Temer's assertions that his campaign received no illegal funding when he ran as former leftist president Dilma Rousseff's running mate in 2014. Justice Gilmar Mendes, who presides over the court known as TSE, said any ruling will have to take into account the country's stability and not compel Temer to step down for an unwarranted minor reason. Mendes as well as justices Napoleão Nunes Maia, Admar Gonzaga and Tarcísio Vieira argued against allowing the Odebrecht testimony. In recent plea-bargain testimony, Odebrecht executives told prosecutors they funneled millions of dollars under the table to the 2014 campaign of Rousseff and Temer. The Temer and Rousseff defense teams requested the testimony be scrapped by the court known as TSE, holding that it went beyond the scope of the original complaint filed by the Brazilian Social Democracy Party after it lost the 2014 election.  Temer has the votes to stay in office,  said Welber Barral, a Brasilia insider and political consultant who is following the case closely, as is most of the country and its investors. Barral said the court will most probably vote 4-3 to through out the case to annul the Rousseff-Temer ticket and its 2014 election victory for allegedly receiving donations illegally. Any of the seven judges, however, could ask for time to study the case, which could delay a final ruling for weeks. Temer opponents are counting on a TSE ruling against the scandal-hit president to force him from office. The country remains ensnared in a political crisis triggered last year by the impeachment of Rousseff. The Brazilian real and the benchmark Bovespa stock index slipped on Thursday on weak trading volumes, signaling increased investor caution over the outcome of the trial. Temer has canceled meetings to follow the court session on television in his presidential office, an aide said.  The president is confident his defense with prevail,  Temer spokesman Marcio de Freitas told Reuters. The court, which began hearing the case on Tuesday, is expected to rule later on Thursday or on Friday, though a final decision could take months if an unfavorable decision is appealed by Temer to the Supreme Court. If the TSE annulled the election result and forced Temer from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over, and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018.

Poland, the Baltic states and others argue that Nord Stream 2 would increase the European Union's dependence on Russia's Gazprom, which already supplies about a third of the bloc's gas. Supporters say it will mean cheaper gas supplies for Europe.  You know that my view about this project is negative,  Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who now chairs summits of EU leaders, wrote in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.  It will not serve the best European interest,  Tusk said in the letter, addressed to Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the executive European Commission which is preparing to negotiate with Russia on the project. Opponents of the pipeline also note that it would bypass Ukraine, thereby harming the interests of the pro-Western government in Kiev at a time when Russia remains under EU sanctions over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Gazprom's European partners n the Nord Stream 2 project include Germany's Uniper, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. The European Commission, comprised of 28 officials, one from each EU state, is working on a proposal for a mandate to launch negotiations with Russia on the pipeline to ensure it meets EU laws.  I encourage you to be determined in demanding that all our rules stemming from the legal obligations ... as well as our political objectives are applied to this project in full,  Tusk said in his letter to Juncker. In commenting on the letter, which has not been made public, a spokesman for the Commission said on Tuesday Brussels would adhere to the law in handling Nord Stream 2. Two sources in Brussels said the Commission may approve on Friday the negotiating mandate proposal, which would then have to be endorsed by EU states before any talks with Moscow start. Two other officials said those countries opposed to the Nord Stream extension were working through their nationally appointed commissioners to make the mandate more demanding. This could delay its approval in Brussels even before the proposal reaches member states for further talks.

The Outlooks on the IDRs are Stable. CFM's and Michelin Luxembourg SCS's long-term senior unsecured ratings are also affirmed at 'A-'. Fitch also assigned a long-term senior unsecured rating of 'A-' to debt issued by Michelin. CFM is the group's finance arm and the intermediate holding entity for Michelin's non-domestic operations. Fitch has also affirmed Michelin's and CFM's Short-Term IDRs as well as Michelin Luxembourg SCS's short-term debt at 'F2'. We have also assigned a debt rating of 'F2' to Michelin's short-term debt. The rating action reflects the group's solid and defensive business profile and our expectations that Michelin will maintain robust credit metrics in the foreseeable future. KEY RATING DRIVERS Defensive and Premium Positioning: Michelin derives a majority of its sales from the replacement market, which is more stable and profitable than the original equipment business. In addition, a large part of the revenue comes from the premium tyre segment, which is traditionally higher margin and faster growing than the overall market. Geographic diversification is also gradually increasing as a result of Michelin's bold investments in emerging markets. Free Cash Flow Weak but Stable: The company's free cash flow (FCF) margin has been quite low for the ratings, at less than 2% on average over the past 10 years. This is because robust underlying funds from operations (FFO) have been largely absorbed by ambitious capex, earmarked chiefly to finance growth in emerging markets, and a generous payout ratio. Equity-friendly actions have also included an active share buy-back programme coming after FCF and weighing on net cash generation. However, earnings and FCF held up during the economic recession and auto industry crisis in 2008-2009, and Fitch expects they will be sustained in future. We also acknowledge the solid cash generation excluding the effects from commodity prices on inventory. We project FCF to be hit by unfavourable working capital movements, the one-off interest payment on the zero coupon Oceane convertible bond and increasing dividends in 2017, leading to a decline in the FCF margin below 1%, but to rebound in 2018-2019 between 3.5%-4.5%. Record Margin: Michelin posted a record group operating margin of 12.9% in 2016, driven by solid earnings at its passenger car division which offset the weakening of the truck business. However, Michelin's profitability remains below that of several close peers as its margins are hindered by its cost structure and the bias of its production base towards France and the rest of Europe compared with other peers, as well as overcapacity issues in several plants. Measures to Boost Profitability: The group restructured operations to streamline its cost base and we believe that profitability will be improved in coming years. We expect a gradual increase in group operating margin towards 13%-13.5% by 2019 from additional cost savings, productivity gains, production reorganisation and price increases. These should offset unfavourable raw material prices, possible adverse foreign-exchange movements and cost inflation as well as higher depreciation and amortisation following the substantial increase in capex. Raw Materials, Currency Exposure: Michelin has a high exposure to foreign exchange due to currency translation risks and the difficulty in exactly matching production and sales. In addition, raw materials (RM) are a major part of Michelin's cost structure and their prices' historical high volatility has had a significant effect on operating margin. A high portion of this cost is typically hedged and covered by RM clauses, but such clauses and hedges only protect for a limited period. Nonetheless, Michelin has an excellent track record of passing on RM price increases to its customers. The group has again announced several price increases recently to reflect the increase in commodity costs in the past year. Financial Flexibility: Positive FCF has enabled the group to reduce debt steadily since the 2009 recession while FFO improved continuously. FFO adjusted net leverage declined from 3x at end-2009 to about 1x since 2013 in spite of significant capex spending and acquisitions. We expect it to remain below 1x through 2019, although we believe that acquisitions or other unplanned cash outflows may lead adjusted net leverage to increase temporarily above 1x. Financial flexibility is also supported by the group's ability to lower or delay investment in case of greater-than-planned earnings weakening. DERIVATION SUMMARY Michelin's strong business profile is supported by its position in the tire industry, which is less volatile and cyclical than other segments of the auto supply sector. The group is a leading and recognised player in its sector and compares adequately with large and global suppliers, including Robert Bosch GmbH, Continental AG, Delphi Automotive PLC and Faurecia S.A. Similar to the highest-rated auto suppliers, Michelin has a good geographical diversification, does not rely on any specific auto manufacturer and has an advanced technology leadership in segments it covers. With an EBIT margin of more than 12%, profitability is at the top end of the sector but Michelin's free cash flow margin is somewhat lower than most peers rated in the 'A' and 'BBB' category such as Caterpillar Inc. (A/Negative), Continental (BBB+/Stable), BorgWarner, Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and Delphi (BBB/Stable). However, cash generation remains strong on an absolute basis and has been stable historically. Adjusted net leverage is around 1x, higher than Bosch (F1 Short-Term IDR) and BorgWarner but similar to Continental and Delphi. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to increase by nearly 5% in 2017 and between 3%-4% in 2018-2019. - Group operating margin to increase towards 13.5% through 2019, as margins of the PC division strengthen gradually to 13.5%, Trucks recover slightly and remain at 10-10.5% and Specialty remains around 19%. This includes a neutral net effect from pricing and raw material price developments and the increasing gains from cost savings. - Substantial working capital outflow in 2017 followed by a moderate recovery in 2018-2019. - Capex intensity to decline continuously to about 7.5% of sales by 2019 as the peak of investments is passed. - About EUR100 million of share buybacks per year completing a pay-out ratio of about 35%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -FCF margin above 4%. -FFO adjusted net leverage below 1x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FCF margin below 2%. -FFO adjusted net leverage above 1.5x. - EBIT margin below 12%. LIQUIDITY Healthy Liquidity: Liquidity is supported by EUR1.5 billion of readily available cash at end-2016, according to Fitch's adjustment for minimum operational cash of EUR525 million and EUR83 million of restricted cash as reported by the group. Michelin has also access to a EUR1.5 billion committed and unutilised credit lines at end-2016. This is largely covering EUR1.2 billion in short-term debt, which include EUR150 million raised through commercial paper programmes. The maturity profile is not an immediate risk, with no major debt maturing before June 2019 (unsecured euro notes).

Finance minister Pravind Jugnauth, who is also the prime minister, told parliament total public spending would be 127.7 billion rupees ($3.69 billion) up from 110.6 billion rupees in 2016/17, while revenues would rise to 112.2 billion rupees up from 94.7 billion rupees.

Speaking in Paris, Meirelles said the decree, which aims to increase fines on banks to up to 2 billion reais ($610 million) from 250,000 reais currently, had been under study for some time. His comments were released by the finance ministry's press office. The decree announced this week would also allow the central bank to strike plea-bargain agreements with financial firms that admit breaching the law in exchange for softer fines or more lenient prison terms for their executives. The central bank is Brazil's banking and financial industry watchdog; the CVM, as the securities industry watchdog is known, oversees the functioning of capital markets.  This certainly gives more power to the central bank and the CVM to implement their measures,  Meirelles said, without elaborating on the size and scope of the new framework. President Michel Temer's decree, which was announced late on Wednesday, has about 180 days to be discussed and voted on in Congress to become law. Meirelles' remarks underscore that senior officials understand that a series of corruption probes investigating cozy ties between politicians and business people are taking place at a fast pace, requiring rapid action to fine-tune legislation. Analysts have said the move followed growing concern that some of the probes will begin ensnaring banks and other financial firms. In a statement earlier in the day, the central bank said the value of fines in eventual leniency agreements would depend on the gravity of the infractions committed, as well as the size and the financial capacity of a financial institution to bear with such a penalty. The decree is not retroactive, it said. The decree was announced at a time when Congress is launching an investigation into the stock and currency trades of JBS SA when news of a plea-bargain testimony from its owners surfaced. JBS, which is controlled by the Batista billionaire family, is the world's No. 1 meatpacker. Meatpacking is the latest sector of the economy to be hit by a three-year corruption investigation in Brazil known as  Operation car Wash.  Some analysts say the probe could extend into the financial sector. $1 = 3.2810 reais Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Writing by Alonso Soto; Editing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Frances Kerry","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-corruption-banks-idUSL1N1J50XS"},

Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-enemy Iran - charges Doha says are baseless.  In Tehran, Islamic militants attacked the Iranian Parliament on Wednesday, killing at least 13 in an assault that Iran's Revolutionary Guards blamed on regional rival Saudi Arabia. Around a third of the roughly 97 million barrels per day of oil that the world needs comes from the Middle East and yet as tensions have flared, the price has fallen to its lowest in a month, to below $49 a barrel. Qatar is the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas, but one of the smallest members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which on May 25 agreed with 11 of its rivals to extend an oil supply cut of 1.8 million barrels per day into 2018 to try to drain a multi-billion barrel global overhang of unused crude. Control Risks, a security consultancy covering issues ranging from advice for its clients on regional politics to resolving kidnappings, says it has increased its assessment of operational and political risk in Qatar.  Qatar stopping flow of gas ... to the UAE would be a significant escalation in the conflict and, at that point, I would start to get concerned,  Allison Wood, a consultant for Control Risks, said.  Obviously if you see Saudi troops mobilizing and heading toward to the Saudi/Qatari border that is another point of concern. Those are the two potential red flags that I'd be looking at.   Volatility, a measure of investor nervousness in the oil market LCOATMIV, has risen from January's two-year lows, but at around 30 percent, is still half what it was in January 2016, when Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran when its embassy in Tehran was stormed over Riyadh's execution of a Shi'ite Muslim cleric.  In 15 years, I've never known a time when regional tensions in the Middle East were absent in the oil price in the way that they are today,  said Investec portfolio manager Tom Nelson, who helps manage a part of the company's $114 billion in assets.  The view is really that the oil market is oversupplied and will remain oversupplied for a long time,  he said, adding that he believed global inventories would gradually start to drop over the second half of this year.  Middle East Instability The United States weighed in on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump praised the Gulf states' action against Qatar, even though the country hosts the largest U.S. air base in the region.     For me (the Qatari conflict) serves to remind us that the Middle East is not a stable place ... ultimately, there are always going to be these tensions,  Rohan Murphy, an energy analyst at asset manager Allianz Global Investors.  Everyone is analyzing the supply-side risk and not worrying about the risk of somewhere like Iran and you couple that with Libya output going down instead of up and then you could start seeing the signs in 2018 of the underinvestment of the last couple of years,  he said, referring to the resurgence of oil output in Libya after years of disruptions from violence. Even though global demand has been strong, the oil market is struggling with a third year in a row with sky-high inventories that seemingly refuse to drain, even though OPEC and non-members such as Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan have cut output. The roughly 3 billion barrels of oil in storage across the world's richest nations equate to around a month of demand and this cushion has insulated investors from disruption to supply.  Until the inventory overhang is clearly running down and much smaller than it is today, that sensitivity will remain relatively low,  said Richard Mallinson, an analyst for consultants Energy Aspects.  Geopolitics will matter but it's unlikely to be the overriding topic of market interest.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects SIAT's moderate business profile in the Italian marine insurance market, its strong capital and its extensive reinsurance coverage. SIAT's IFS rating is constrained by Italy's sovereign rating (BBB/Stable) due to its large exposure to Italian sovereign debt. SIAT held EUR69 million (54% of total invested assets) of Italian sovereign bonds at end-2016, about the size of its shareholders funds. SIAT's unconstrained IFS rating is 'BBB+'. SIAT is the second-largest Italian marine insurer with a strong market position. However, with EUR133 million of gross premiums and EUR366 million of total assets at end-2016, it is small in size. Fitch views SIAT as strategically  important  to UnipolSai (BBB/Stable), as defined in its group rating methodology. UnipolSai provides control function, asset management and procurement services to SIAT. In turn SIAT provides UnipolSai with technical and operational services in the marine business, given its role of hub of competence for marine insurance within the UnipolSai group. SIAT has a strong capital base, as reflected in a Fitch Prism Factor Based Model (Prism FBM) score of  Extremely Strong  at end-2016. SIAT's regulatory Solvency II ratio, calculated according to the standard formula, was also strong at 170% at end-2016. SIAT has no financial debt, which Fitch views positively. We expect SIAT to maintain strong capitalisation. SIAT's reinsurance utilisation ratio is high. The ratio of net written premiums to gross written premiums remained stable at 31% in 2016. Fitch believes SIAT's high use of reinsurance is commensurate with the risks the company assumes and stabilises financial results. The counterparty credit risk is mitigated by the fact that all SIAT's reinsurers are rated in the 'A' category or above. SIAT's reinsurance programme is a factor supporting its rating and Fitch does not expect material changes in 2017. SIATs non-life combined ratio net of reinsurance deteriorated to 86% at end-2016 (2015: 85%), but remained well above the median for its rating category. SIAT's net income increased to EUR6.2 million in 2016 (2015: EUR5.4 million). SIAT's 2012-2016 average return on equity was 8%, a level in line with companies rated in the 'A' category. Fitch expects SIAT's net profitability to remain at least at this level in 2017 and the combined ratio to remain below 100% in the medium term. RATING SENSITIVITIES SIAT's rating would likely be downgraded if the ratings of Italy or UnipolSai are downgraded. Combined ratio deteriorating above 100% for a sustained period could also result in a downgrade. SIAT's rating would likely be upgraded if Italy and UnipolSai are upgraded, provided that SIAT maintains its adequate credit profile.

AEB uses radar technology to monitor a vehicle's proximity to the one ahead and warns the driver through audio and visual displays to reduce speed, helping avoid or reduce the severity of potential collisions.  U.S. auto safety regulators said last year that 20 automakers, including Nissan, General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG and Honda Motor Co, had agreed to make automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all U.S. vehicles by 2022.

The e-commerce giant has doled out more than $1 billion in small loans to sellers in the past 12 months, compared with more than $1.5 billion it lent from 2011 through 2015, said Peeyush Nahar, vice president for Amazon Marketplace. Sellers have used the money to expand their inventory or discount items on Amazon, he said. Boosting sales for third-party merchants is lucrative for Amazon, which takes a cut of transactions on its site.  It also has made a business out of handling more leg work for sellers, too. They pay Amazon to fulfill their orders and boost their placement in search results, without which sellers might struggle to grab shoppers' attention. More than 20,000 small businesses have received a loan from Amazon and more than half of those have taken a second loan from the company, it said. Loans range from $1,000 to $750,000.

Although indoor tanning remains popular, especially among young non-Hispanic white women, even that group saw a roughly 30 percent decline in tanning bed use, researchers report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. “Indoor tanning and sunburns increase the risk for skin cancer, including melanoma,” said lead author Gery Guy of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.  Another recent study by Guy and colleagues found that indoor tanning among adolescents had dropped by more than half from 2009 to 2015. “Such reductions suggest that more people are getting the message about the damages of indoor tanning and understanding that tanned skin is damaged skin,” Guy told Reuters Health by email. For the current study, the researchers analyzed data from the annual National Health Interview Survey, a nationally-representative sample of about 25 million U.S. adults over age 18. Participants were asked about their use of indoor tanning and any sunburns they experienced, indoors or outdoors, during the past year.  In 2010, 5.5 percent of survey participants used indoor tanning, which dropped to 3.5 percent in 2015. Those figures include a decrease from 8.6 percent of women and 2.2 percent of men tanning in 2010 to 5.2 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, in 2015.  In the adult group that uses tanning beds the most - white non-Hispanic women between the ages of 18 and 21 - usage dropped from 31.8 percent in 2010 to 20.4 percent in 2015. The results also linked indoor tanning to sunburns, with about 41 percent of indoor tanners saying they had at least one sunburn during the year, compared with 34 percent of people who didn’t use tanning beds. Among 18 to 29-year-old white women, 77 percent of indoor tanners reported a sunburn compared to 62.5 percent of peers who didn’t use indoor tanning. In addition, 6.7 percent of indoor tanners reported having been burned by a tanning machine. The researchers speculate that the higher risk of sunburn among indoor tanners may result both from tan-seeking behavior in general and a misperception of the sunburn protection offered by an existing  base  tan. “It is encouraging that evidence is emerging of reduced exposure to indoor tanning,” said Michael Bracken of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  “However, as this practice incurs absolutely no benefit in the face of increased risk of a potentially lethal disease, continued efforts to further reduce exposure is important,” Bracken, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email. The drop in tanning bed usage may be related to the 10 percent excise tax implemented by the Affordable Care Act in 2010, as well as state laws restricting minors’ access to tanning beds, the study authors note.   “Historically, tanning has been persistent among young white women - and research is showing us, gay men as well - due to social norms around the appearance of tan skin. Some people feel they really look better with a tan,” said Sherry Pagoto of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “There are misconceptions still that tanning beds are safer than tanning outside, but the source of UV radiation doesn’t matter,” she told Reuters Health.  “There’s no such thing as a safe tan,” Pagoto added. “The ‘base tan’ idea is not real and not safe to do.” Guy advises wearing sunglasses, broad-spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing outdoors, as well as avoiding sunbathing and finding shade during midday hours. Pagoto also recommends self-tanning products for the same glow with no UV exposure. “If it’s hard to give up the idea of tanner skin, explore self-tanners, which have improved significantly in the past several years, so you can have a risk-free tan,” Pagoto said. “Tanning leads to wrinkling and sun spots - ask any 40-something woman what she regrets doing, and you’ll get the same response.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2s7HBrH Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, online May 15, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-tanning-usa-idUSKBN18Z278"},

Tensions had been building for days between Qatar and its powerful Gulf Arab neighbors and Mohanadi feared Saudi's closure of Qatar's only land border on Monday could lead to price hikes and food shortages in the import-dependent country.  I bought lots of vegetables, frozen chicken and milk for my children, things I knew would be the first to disappear from the shelves,  said Mohanadi, a former army lieutenant from Qatar's city of Al Khor. He said he wanted to be prepared but did not feel panic. Hours later supermarkets in Doha visited by a Reuters reporter had almost run out of dairy products as scores of people waited in checkout lines and stocked up on beans and other staples. The rift has provoked confusion and anxiety in Qatar, an energy, banking and construction hub, which is home to 2.7 million people -- most of them foreigners. Some Qataris were outraged by the state of affairs. Authorities tried to calm nerves on Wednesday, releasing a video showing a shop with shelves brimming with food and reassuring Qataris - the wealthiest people in the world per capita - that their quality of life would not be hit. But the row over Qatar's alleged support for Islamist groups has disrupted many aspects of life. Thousands of Qataris have been unable to board flights to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and cut off from relatives in those countries, in a region where cross-border marriages are common and Gulf rulers refer to each other as  brothers . Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and several other countries severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-foe Iran - charges Qatar says are baseless. Qatar Isolated In further signs of Qatar's isolation on Thursday, the United Arab Emirates' national postal group said it had suspended all services to Qatar and the UAE aviation authority said it had closed air space for traffic to and from Doha.  My mother who is originally from the UAE cannot visit her sick mother, needless to say we will not be able to see my uncles,  said Mohammed, a Qatar University professor, who gave his first name only. He said a Saudi friend of his living in Qatar had sent his child to Riyadh for a family visit before the embargo and now he does not know what to do. Qatari students in the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been told to leave before finishing exams, he said. Workers stand next to food items in a shopping mall in Doha, Qatar, June 8, 2017.Stringer The issue is presented to the West as a diplomatic spat ... the reality is far worse,  a Qatari diplomat said.  It is a blockade! Like that of Berlin. A declaration of war. A political, economic and social aggression.  Even if the dispute is settled, Qataris and other Gulf Arabs worry that the bitter spat which has seen both sides denounce each other as  enemies  and  traitors  of the Gulf has sown divisions and hostility that will linger on.  I think it is three things we are scared of: family ties being severed, possible military action and losing the spirit of the Gulf Cooperation Council,  said Mohammed, the professor, referring to the regional political and economic union set up in 1981. Slogans against and in support of Qatar in Arabic have dominated Twitter, which is hugely popular in the region, and have grown steadily more nationalistic and aggressive in tone. Slideshow (2 Images)Qatari Leader Silent The fact that Qatar's leader, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has yet to speak publicly since ties were cut, has made some Qataris uneasy. Kuwait's ruler, who is mediating in the crisis, asked him to postpone a speech to the nation earlier this week to give dialogue efforts a chance.  Of course we are all waiting for him to speak,  said Sara al-Sulaiti, a Qatari who works in public relations. Others say Sheikh Tamim's silence displays the tact U.S. President Donald Trump lacked when he posted a series of Tweets on Tuesday appearing to take sides against Qatar in the dispute.  The emir is wise not to speak,  said Faraj, a Qatari engineer working for a telecommunications company.  We know that he has a plan for us. Unlike in our neighboring countries we have deep faith in our leaders.  For low-income foreign laborers, the biggest concerns are possible food price rises and job cuts if projects are stalled because of construction materials being held up at the Saudi border. Qatar is home to more than a million migrant laborers from countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, many of whom for around 1,000 riyals ($275) a month toil on construction projects including football stadiums and a metro system being built for the 2022 World Cup.  I have never seen Qatari citizens stocking up on frozen chicken and long-life milks,  said Anup Manoj, an Indian man who works as a cleaner in Doha's City Center Mall, where many shops no longer stock milk packaged by Saudi Arabia's Almarai Co, the most affordable kind of milk in Qatar.  They have money to stock up. But when they stock up it's laborers and lower income workers who are going to suffer.

The rally by more than 100 reporters in the rain outside a court in Yangon was the first significant show of opposition to the telecommunications law, introduced in 2013, that bans the use of the telecoms network to  extort, threaten, obstruct, defame, disturb, inappropriately influence or intimidate . Despite pressure from human rights monitors and Western diplomats, the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which took power amid high hopes for democratic reform in 2016, after decades of hardline military rule, has retained the law. The journalists said they were dismayed by the recent arrests of social media users whose posts were deemed distasteful, as well as of journalists critical of the military.  At first, they were suing people over news articles and now they are suing even over a satirical article, showing how they are restricting the media,  said A Hla Lay Thuzar one of the founders of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, which organized the rally. She said that rather than staging a one-off protest, her   group wants to launch a movement to raise public awareness of  the issue and press the government to abolish the law. The journalists on trial are the chief editor and a columnist of the Voice, one of Myanmar's largest dailies. They were denied bail on the first day of their trial, meaning they may have to remain in custody.  Obtaining bail is our right so we will keep fighting for it during next court dates until we get it,  said Khing Maung Myint, who is representing the two journalists. The telecommunications law was a main piece of legislation introduced by a semi-civilian administration of former generals which navigated Myanmar's transition from full military rule to the coming to power of Suu Kyi's government, from 2011 to 2016. The protesting journalists said they would wear the arm-bands for the next 10 days to raise awareness about what they see as the threat to freedom of the press. They are also planning to gather signatures for a petition to abolish the law, to be sent to Suu Kyi's office, the army chief and parliament.

Two months on the 50-year-old widow, who had lived in the rundown camp for displaced people since Rakhine was roiled by communal violence in 2012, has already spent more than half of the money to rent a room of 8 square meters (86 sq ft). With few job prospects and high living costs, she struggles to feed her two daughters in a strange city 500 km (310 miles) from home.  What do we eat after the money runs out? We are all very worried. I can't find a job here,  said Nwe Nwe Oo. The family is dependent on her elder daughter who earns $88 a month in a tea factory. The authorities began shuttering her small camp in the town of Ramree in April, the start of a push by Aung San Suu Kyi's government to close down all such camps in Rakhine within five years, following a recommendation from a commission led by former United Nations chief Kofi Annan. Humanitarian experts back the eventual closure of the camps but criticize the way the government has begun the task, which they say sets a worrying precedent for the handling of much larger camps elsewhere in Rakhine where tens of thousands of people still live. Without more efforts to bring peace and stability to Rakhine,  by closing camps one will simply be transferring the problem to another place,  said Mark Cutts, Head of U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Myanmar. Nwe Nwe Oo had little choice in moving to Yangon. The authorities said it was not safe for the 128 Muslim residents of the camp in Ramree, a coastal town in southern Rakhine, to remain in the town, where they had lived before the violence.  We don't have enough police force to prevent conflict happening again,  said Min Aung, spokesman of the Rakhine State government.  That's why we allow them to relocate to other places as they want to.  Officially Recognized Nwe Nwe Oo's family belongs to the Kaman Muslim minority, who, unlike the more numerous Rohingya Muslims from northern Rakhine, have Myanmar citizenship and are officially recognized as an ethnic group.     The homes of Kamans in Ramree were burned in the clashes between Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists in 2012 that killed nearly 200 and displaced tens of thousands in the state.  The new government helped us move to Yangon, but what we hoped for was to return to our homeland. I don't know whether that will ever happen,  Nwe Nwe Oo told Reuters. Men watch a chinlone match inside a Rohingya refugee camp outside Kyaukpyu in Rakhine state, Myanmar May 17, 2017.Soe Zeya TunShe was among nearly 100 Kaman Muslims from the camp who since April were offered bus fares, air tickets as well as additional modest financial support if they chose to leave the Buddhist-majority area. The OCHA's Cutts said the Ramree Kamans told U.N. staff they were not allowed to go back to their original land and were given no viable options other than to leave.    In contrast to the Kaman Muslims, the government in April resettled nearly 300 ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, displaced in the same conflict, to 65 houses in the neighboring Kyauk Pyu area, local officials, residents and OCHA officials said. Each family was offered about $294 to settle in their newly-built homes with water, electricity and drainage systems. Rights groups say that if the Kaman were not allowed to return to their places of origin, there is little prospect of a workable solution for the 120,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims still living in camps in Rakhine.  Slideshow (15 Images) If the government can't facilitate the safe and voluntary return of the Kaman, a group they officially recognize as citizens, what hope is there for the Rohingya?  said Amnesty International researcher Laura Haigh. No Going Back Kaman residents said apartheid-like conditions in Ramree, where some bus drivers refuse to carry Muslims, give them little chance of finding a job or a good education for their children in the Buddhist-majority town of 97,000.    I really love my homeland, but I will face so many problems if I stay,  said 55-year-old Tin Hla, a father-of-four and one of the last remaining residents of the camp, who is planning to move to Yangon this month. Some former residents, though, remain hopeful that the closure of the camp will improve their daily lives. Back in the Yangon suburb, another recently arrived Kaman Muslim, 28-year-old Kyaw Soe Moe, anxiously awaited the outcome of a job interview with a construction material company. While life in the country's largest city could be tough, the newly-arrived man said it's an improvement compared with the days in the Ramree camp, where their movements were restricted and job prospects bleak.  At least there's freedom here,  he said.

Abu Dhabi-owned Etihad, which has thrown Air Berlin several life lines over the years, earlier on Thursday said it had pulled out of a prospective deal to combine Air Berlin's holiday flight business Niki with tour operator TUI Group's own carrier TUIfly. Bigger German rival Lufthansa, which last year agreed to lease 38 crewed planes from Air Berlin, has held talks recently with the Abu Dhabi government about taking part in salvaging the remaining Air Berlin business but said its debt was a sticking point. Air Berlin, whose losses increased to a record 782 million euros ($877 million) in 2016, is now scrambling to protect its roughly 8,000 jobs in Germany, mainly based in the two regional states of Berlin and NRW. Officials of the two states declined to comment. Etihad, which holds 29 percent of Air Berlin, last month appointed a new boss as it rethinks its strategy of expanding its network by spending billions of dollars on buying minority stakes in other airlines, including Air Berlin and heavily indebted Italian carrier Alitalia.. German newspaper Die Welt was first to report the Air Berlin loan guarantee request, saying the aim was to see whether the regional states would be ready to step in, citing people close to the negotiation. For now, Etihad continues to provide funding. Air Berlin said Etihad has granted another loan facility of 350 million euros and a letter of support for at least 18 months. Air Berlin Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann told a German newspaper on Wednesday he would have to find a partner this year to help secure jobs and the company's long-term future and a pact with Lufthansa was among the options.

Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-enemy Iran - charges Doha says are baseless.  In Tehran, Islamic militants attacked the Iranian Parliament on Wednesday, killing at least 13 in an assault that Iran's Revolutionary Guards blamed on regional rival Saudi Arabia. Around a third of the roughly 97 million barrels per day of oil that the world needs comes from the Middle East and yet as tensions have flared, the price has fallen to its lowest in a month, to below $49 a barrel. Qatar is the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas, but one of the smallest members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which on May 25 agreed with 11 of its rivals to extend an oil supply cut of 1.8 million barrels per day into 2018 to try to drain a multi-billion barrel global overhang of unused crude. Control Risks, a security consultancy covering issues ranging from advice for its clients on regional politics to resolving kidnappings, says it has increased its assessment of operational and political risk in Qatar.  Qatar stopping flow of gas ... to the UAE would be a significant escalation in the conflict and, at that point, I would start to get concerned,  Allison Wood, a consultant for Control Risks, said.  Obviously if you see Saudi troops mobilizing and heading toward to the Saudi/Qatari border that is another point of concern. Those are the two potential red flags that I'd be looking at.   Volatility, a measure of investor nervousness in the oil market LCOATMIV, has risen from January's two-year lows, but at around 30 percent, is still half what it was in January 2016, when Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran when its embassy in Tehran was stormed over Riyadh's execution of a Shi'ite Muslim cleric.  In 15 years, I've never known a time when regional tensions in the Middle East were absent in the oil price in the way that they are today,  said Investec portfolio manager Tom Nelson, who helps manage a part of the company's $114 billion in assets.  The view is really that the oil market is oversupplied and will remain oversupplied for a long time,  he said, adding that he believed global inventories would gradually start to drop over the second half of this year.  Middle East Instability The United States weighed in on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump praised the Gulf states' action against Qatar, even though the country hosts the largest U.S. air base in the region.     For me (the Qatari conflict) serves to remind us that the Middle East is not a stable place ... ultimately, there are always going to be these tensions,  Rohan Murphy, an energy analyst at asset manager Allianz Global Investors.  Everyone is analyzing the supply-side risk and not worrying about the risk of somewhere like Iran and you couple that with Libya output going down instead of up and then you could start seeing the signs in 2018 of the underinvestment of the last couple of years,  he said, referring to the resurgence of oil output in Libya after years of disruptions from violence. Even though global demand has been strong, the oil market is struggling with a third year in a row with sky-high inventories that seemingly refuse to drain, even though OPEC and non-members such as Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan have cut output. The roughly 3 billion barrels of oil in storage across the world's richest nations equate to around a month of demand and this cushion has insulated investors from disruption to supply.  Until the inventory overhang is clearly running down and much smaller than it is today, that sensitivity will remain relatively low,  said Richard Mallinson, an analyst for consultants Energy Aspects.  Geopolitics will matter but it's unlikely to be the overriding topic of market interest.

Under a bill drafted by right-wing populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, NGOs with foreign donations of at least 7.2 million forints ($26,207.55) must register with the  authorities and declare themselves as foreign-funded. The government says the aim is to ensure greater transparency. The NGOs say the bill - which is due to be passed this month - stigmatizes them, and the legislation has triggered a series of mass protests over recent weeks.  We have accepted the legal remarks of the (Council of Europe's advisory panel) Venice Commission, but we could not accept its political judgment,  Orban's chief of staff, Janos Lazar told a news conference. He said the justice minister will submit an amendment to the legislation addressing some of the Venice Commission's criticism. That will include changes to sanctions on non-complying NGOs and the extent of required public disclosure of foreign funding. The rights panel said the term  organization receiving support from abroad  in the bill appeared to be neutral. But considering Hungary's  strong political statements against associations receiving support from abroad, this label risks adversely affecting their legitimate activities,  it said.

Four buyouts, backed with loans yet to be syndicated in Europe’s leveraged loan market, are expected to include pre-placed second-lien loans, including Danish packaging group Faerch Plast; European industrial supplies distributor IPH Brammer; cleaning business Safetykleen Europe; and Hong Kong-based international schools operator Nord Anglia Education. By going directly to funds, buyout firms are guaranteeing placement on the most expensive and risky part of a capital structure, avoiding any costly risks that could arise during a syndication process. “Borrowers are happy to lock in the terms. They don’t have to take market risk with syndication and as second-lien providers can’t get enough of the paper, they are offering competitive terms,” a senior leverage finance banker said. The removal of a subordinated piece of debt from an underwrite is impacting banks that are already being squeezed on fees on the senior part of a capital structure to around 1.5%-1.75%, from 1.75%-2.25% a couple of years ago.  Second-lien fees come in anywhere between 2%-3%. Subordinated second-lien loans have become attractive to sponsors as a means of increasing overall leverage on a deal, while maintaining control over who holds the paper -- something that cannot be achieved via the public high-yield market. Second-lien loans also don’t have the restrictive call protection associated with bonds. Other pre-placed second-liens this year include deals for UK-based Element Materials Technology, Swedish dialysis clinic operator Diaverum, British holiday park operator Parkdean Resorts and Belgian aluminium systems manufacturer Corialis, among others. Funds available to take pre-placed second-lien loans include Alcentra, Apollo Capital Management, MV Credit, Ares, Park Square Capital, EQT, GSO and Partners Group. MARKET RISK Despite banks losing out on the 2%-3%underwriting fees, sponsors are having to pay out that same amount to the funds they are pre-placing the paper with, in the form of an arrangement fee. Sponsors are, however, protected from market risk if a deal goes wrong.  Typical market flex on a struggling deal could see a sponsor on the hook for an additional 150bp. “The reality is that there is no real difference in terms of overall fees. The margin may be wider on a pre-placed second-lien loan compared to an underwritten deal, but there is also no flex,” a leverage finance head said. Deep liquidity in Europe’s leveraged loan market, where demand far outweighs supply, has seen pricing compression. In some cases Single B issuers are achieving market lows of 300bp on first-lien paper and arguably sponsors will achieve market lows on second-lien paper. KKR paid 675bp over Libor with a 0% floor and 650bp over Euribor with a 0% floor for a US$20m and €20m second-lien add-on tranche for UK forensic sciences group LGC in January. Some banks are approaching sponsors to argue a case for syndicated second-liens. A syndicated deal in such a hot market could price significantly tighter than a pre-placed loan. However, many of those funds are telling sponsors they will not buy the second-lien paper if it is syndicated. “Some funds are telling sponsors they will not take second-lien unless it is pre-placed, as all-in yield on syndication is lower. They have remits to do big tickets and they want good yield and a substantial amount of paper. It is a threat but it is a legitimate one because if it goes to a wide syndication and these funds are offered a smaller ticket at a lower yield, they will probably walk away,” the leveraged finance head said. In a search for yield, there are alternative funds that may be attracted to second-lien paper that may not have otherwise been in different market conditions. “If banks go to the broader market with second-lien paper there is a base of investors out there in possession of subordinated baskets and in search for yield, so they may be willing to buy,” the leveraged finance head said. A syndicate head said: “Investors holding sponsors to ransom may be relevant around some very big tranches where you need big ticket commitments but on the smaller second-liens of around €100m you could sell €10m-€15m tickets to various funds.” Editing by Christopher Mangham","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/secondlien-loans-idUSL8N1J551M"},

Tera Group Inc accused the banks of coordinating a boycott of its seven-year-old TeraExchange platform by refusing both to send it any CDS transactions, and to clear and settle any CDS trades that customers wanted to handle there. It also said the banks used their 95 percent market share to require that trading follow a protocol known as  request for quote,  which Tera described as opaque and inefficient. Tera said this enabled banks to boost profit by keeping traders in the dark about prices, defeating a goal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, while instilling a  great fear of retaliation  against traders who defected to rival platforms.  Faced with Dealer Defendants' unyielding boycott, TeraExchange has been shut out of the CDS market,  Tera said in its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan, which the complaint said control 40 percent of the CDS market, declined to comment. Lawyers for Tera did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tera Group is based in Summit, New Jersey, while TeraExchange is based in New York. The other defendants are Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG , Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc , Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS Group AG. Tera is seeking unspecified damages, which would be tripled if a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act were found. It sued the same 12 banks in April 2016 for allegedly conspiring to block customers from trading interest rate swaps on its platform. That lawsuit was later combined with three similar lawsuits, and that litigation remains pending, court records show. Thursday's case is Tera Group Inc et al v. Citigroup Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-04302.

FILE PHOTO: Cast member Rachel Weisz arrives at the Gala screening of the film  The Lobster  in London, October 13, 2015.Stefan Wermuth/File PhotoQ: Did you have any challenging moments while filming? A: The horse I rode, I had to learn to ride side-saddle, which was a first, which is challenging in a corset and a big dress, he had been trained on  Game of Thrones  to die when you pulled his left rein very sharply which I didn't know.  FILE PHOTO: Actress Rachel Weisz arrives for the premiere of the film  Denial  in Toronto, September 11, 2016.Fred Thornhill/File PhotoSo I cantered out of shot and stopped and pulled the left rein, and he very gracefully buckled his front legs and his back legs and died on his left side, which was the side I was on...

A: The novel was written in the 1950s so it had quite twentieth century ideas, so you know women already had the vote, but (a) woman who believes in sexual freedom, financial freedom, doesn't think she should be a possession of her husband in the 1850s is really radical, so that's what makes the film have a kind of modern edge.

The 30-year-old multiple Olympic gold medalist, who has decided to retire after the world championships in London in August, will bid farewell to the fans in his island home in the 100 meters at Saturday's Racers Grand Prix. For Jamaicans he ranks as a national treasure, transcending his sport just as Brazilian Pele did soccer and Muhammad Ali boxing.  Usain Bolt continues in that great tradition of voices that amplify Jamaica,  Prime Minister Andrew Holness told Reuters in an interview at the Kingston National Stadium on Wednesday.  Great personalities like Usain Bolt ... make people want to see what else Jamaica has to offer, so he literally opens doors for Jamaica to the rest of the world.  Before Bolt, Don Quarrie was one of Jamaica's best-known track and field athletes after he won gold in the 200 meters at the 1976 Olympics.  Quarrie said Bolt's impact was as much about his spirit as about his sporting feats.  He brought so much joy to track and field, not just from his times, but from his personality, which at first people thought was a put-on, but they later realised that it was genuine and they loved it,  Quarrie told Reuters.   Everybody from every part of the world knows where Jamaica is right now (and) everyone knows who Usain Bolt is and it's not just because of his speed but because they're captivated by whom he is.      On Saturday Jamaicans will see Bolt run his last competitive race on the Caribbean island. A 'who's who' of modern track greats, including world record holders Wayde Van Niekerk and David Rudisha and double Olympic and world champion Mo Farah, will be among those participating in the meet. The shadow of Jamaica's Usain Bolt is seen on the flag as he celebrates winning the men's 100 metres final during the 15th IAAF World Championships at the National Stadium in Beijing, China August 23, 2015.Fabrizio BenschInspiring the Young  He ends his competitive career this year, but he does not end the image, and the legacy of course, that Usain will leave.  Jamaica Olympic Association president Mike Fennell told Reuters. That legacy lies in his ability to inspire youngsters to take up the sport, said Warren Blake, Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association president. Slideshow (2 Images) When he won the double sprint gold medals in Beijing 2008 and then added the sprint relay gold also in record time, it had an effect right across the spectrum in Jamaica because all the high schools reported that the number of athletes coming out to train to make their school teams for Boys and Girls Championship doubled.  Maxine Walters, who has produced all of Bolt's international commercials in Jamaica, said of the lanky sprinter:  He's an amazing treasure for Jamaica, not just as an amazingly successful sprinter and the fastest man in the world but as a human being with his contribution to his country.  Twelve years of hard work have brought Bolt the level of supremacy and excellence he has achieved, Glen Mills, his coach since 2005, told Reuters.  But all good things, one day, must come to an end and he has decided that this is it for him,  Mills said.  He has served the sport well and the sport has served him well and we'll miss him.  What he will do after retirement is a matter for conjecture but the prime minister said there was an open invitation for him to play a role in government.  The possibilities for him are endless and I’d like to say to him that my door is always open and I have a seat for him anywhere he wants to serve,  Holness added.   I would love to see him take interest in the sport itself from the leadership, governance and administrative point of view.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 245,000 for the week ended June 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The report followed data on Tuesday showing job openings at a record high in April.   There is no sign of a pickup in the rate of layoffs. Against this backdrop of high job openings, firms appear to be holding on to their workers,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Claims surged by 20,000 in the prior week, with California, Tennessee, Kansas, and Missouri accounting for the bulk of the increase. Some of that increase was related to school summer breaks in which bus drivers and cafeteria workers were left temporarily unemployed. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 118 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 240,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 2,250 to 242,000 last week. The dollar rose against the euro after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold but cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back the central bank's massive bond-buying program. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher. Skills Mismatch Low layoffs and record high job openings suggest a deceleration in job growth in May was likely because companies could not find suitable workers. The economy created 138,000 jobs in May, well below the average monthly 181,000 jobs gained over the prior 12 months. The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000.  Labor market supply constraints are expected to bite into job creation but should also help to keep a lid on jobless claims as employers focus on retaining talent, so long as the economy continues to chug along,  said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Economists believe that labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points in March.  The Fed will continue to view the labor market data as signalizing that the economy remains at or near full employment,  said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.  Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 2,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended May 27. The so-called continuing claims now have been below 2 million for eight straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack. The four-week moving average of continuing claims slipped 750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.

The previous Friday, shortly after Popular suffered another selloff on the stock market, he had sent an email to the bank's staff to tell them it was solvent and they should keep working hard to overcome the current situation.  We need to work together and believe in what we do,  Saracho wrote. JP Morgan and Lazard, which had been advising Popular since early May on finding a merger partner or raising new capital, had spent the weekend working the phones with other Spanish lenders in a bid to find a last minute solution. And the bank had requested emergency central bank liquidity that it believed meant it had a whole week to review its options and try to draw a line under a deposit flight that had wiped a quarter of its deposits. What Saracho didn't appear to measure was that the fate of Spain's sixth-biggest bank would be sealed in hours, not days or months as in previous European banking meltdowns. The swift maneuvering by Europe's bank regulators marks a sharp and brutal change in the way they deal with struggling banks, which could become a blueprint for handling other cases, especially in Italy where the rescue of troubled lenders has been under discussion for months. Previous bank rescues in the euro zone have involved protracted negotiations and government bailouts, even after new rules came in following the financial crisis, aimed at preventing taxpayer money being used in bank bailouts.  However, the abruptness of the action by the authorities could raise questions about whether regulators and the Spanish government spent enough time exploring other options potentially less painful for shareholders or bondholders. That, in turn, could now pave the way for legal claims to be filed. The ECB, the Spanish government and Popular all declined to comment. Trigger On Saturday, the Single Resolution Board (SRB), a regulatory body responsible for dealing with the euro zone's banking crises, met in Brussels to discuss the risks posed by Popular for Spain's and Europe's financial stability. Based on an independent valuation by Spanish boutique investment firm Arcano which showed Popular had a capital shortfall of up to 8 billion euros, the SRB concluded the bank would likely fail to meet its financial obligations. It ordered an immediate fire sale, setting in motion the mechanism to take over the lender.  Saracho was left by the side of the road by the European resolution body,  said one source, adding that JP Morgan's last-ditch attempt at the weekend to find a buyer was predicated on an understanding that the SRB would soon move on Popular. The SRB declined to comment. Sources familiar with SRB strategy say the initial objective was to intervene in Popular on Friday, June 9, ahead of the weekend, to give enough time for negotiations. But both the volume of deposit withdrawals on Monday and the determination of European authorities to use their new banking resolution powers would speed things up dramatically. In the early afternoon of Tuesday, Saracho picked up the phone to call Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos and let him know Popular had run out of collateral to obtain new ECB liquidity. Branches might not open on Wednesday morning.  There was a bank run,  the ECB's deputy governor Vitor Constancio said on Thursday in response to questions about why the authorities had not spent more time analyzing other options to salvage the bank. It was no longer a question of making sure the bank had enough capital to meet its long term obligations, so much as ensuring it had cash on hand to stay open.  It was not a matter of assessing the developments of solvency as such, but the liquidity issue.  Within six hours, the SRB had swooped, cancelling the investments of Popular's shareholders and junior bondholders with the stroke of a pen and selling the lender for a solitary euro to Spanish banking goliath Santander (SAN.MC).

The currency bloc has been on its best economic run since the global financial crisis nearly a decade with millions of jobs created since the ECB's stimulus effort started. But inflation is barely moving upwards and growth may be plateauing, putting the ECB into a difficult spot. Acknowledging improved prospects, the ECB dropped a pledge to cut rates if necessary and gave up a long-standing reference to risks to the economy, declaring the outlook  balanced . Yet rate setters did not even discuss winding down the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) asset purchase scheme, kept rates below zero, and pledged very substantial accommodation. The ECB also cut most of its inflation projections, even as it predicted better growth, suggesting that it has been overestimating the impact of rapid job creation on wages and ultimately prices.   We consider that risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced,  ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference in the Estonian capital of Tallinn.  He said the bank removed the language about potentially lowering interest rates because ultra-low inflation risks have gone.  Related CoverageECB policy changes came without dissent - DraghiECB's Draghi drops reference to 'downside risks' to economy (But) if these risks were to reappear, we would certainly be ready to lower rates,  he said. With Thursday's decision, the ECB's deposit rate, its key policy tool, remains at -0.4 percent. Its monthly asset purchases will continue to total 60 billion euros a month and to run until at least December. The euro EUR= hit a one-week low of $1.11995, down around 0.4 percent on the day, as Draghi spoke. September? European Central Bank President Mario Draghi arrives to the news conference following the Governing Council meeting in Tallinn, Estonia, June 8, 2017.Ints KalninsPlaying down the significance of its new guidance and the forecast cuts, Draghi said the general path of inflation has not changed and rate cuts are not impossible, giving his message a dovish tilt.  Nothing substantial has happened to inflation except the price of oil and the price of food ... underlying inflation has remained the same year to year,  he noted. The next major test will come in September, when the bank will probably decide whether to continue bond buys beyond this year or start to wind them down, known as tapering.  There is a growing risk that tapering is slower and takes longer than the market currently expects,  Cosimo Marasciulo, a bond manager at Pioneer Investments said. Slideshow (8 Images)The ECB said it now saw inflation this year at just 1.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 1.7 percent and still short of its target of close to 2 percent. That would barely rise to 1.6 percent in 2019, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7 percent and further away from its official target of at or close to two percent. Economic growth this year was seen at 1.9 percent versus an earlier 1.8 percent forecast.  That came after the EU statistics agency Eurostat earlier revised up its estimate of first quarter growth to its fastest rate in two years, saying the economy of the 19-country euro zone expanded by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.9 percent year-on-year. The ECB's nuanced stance was also motivated by the big debts overhanging governments and companies, the piles of unpaid loans weighing on banks in countries like Italy and Portugal, and political uncertainty ahead of elections in Germany and Italy.    Any announcement on its quantitative easing (QE) program is seen not coming until the autumn, when policymakers hope the economic picture will have become clearer. German politicians in particular have called for an earlier end to QE, saying it is eroding the assets of savers and discourages other eurozone countries from pursuing reforms to make their economies more efficient. However Draghi there were no visible divisions at the Governing Council's meeting.  I didn't hear any dissenting voice ... with respect to the proposals,  he said.

The Qatari stock index, which had lost 9.7 percent over three days since Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic and trade relations, bounced 3.0 percent. The mood in Doha remained nervous; Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's credit rating on Wednesday night, and the economic damage to Qatar from the rift could become serious if foreign banks pull out funds. Nevertheless, fund managers noted that many Qatari blue chips had fallen to relatively attractive valuations. Investors are also hoping that mediation efforts over the weekend will help bring a resolution for the dispute. Some of the stocks most heavily beaten down early this week on fears that Qatar's foreign trade would suffer rebounded most strongly, with Gulf Warehousing shooting up 9.1 percent.

Philip Alston, U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, made an official mission to China last August and included a plea for the release of lawyer Jiang Tianyong in his report to the U.N. Human Rights Council at a two-day debate. Chinese diplomat Jiang Yingfeng told the Geneva forum that Alston's report was  objective and fair  but also rebuked him.  The special rapporteur referenced certain human rights defenders in his report and in so doing he has overstepped his mandate and meddled with China's judicial sovereignty,  Jiang said. China's government would not tolerate any individual or group  using the banner of human rights  to cover up their activities, he added. Alston had praised China for its  extraordinary achievement  of lifting up to 700 million out of rural poverty over the past 30 years, but said that inequality is  high and is rising .  He also decried the  very rapidly shrinking space for the expression of views that differ from those of the (Communist) Party  and made a  special plea for the Government to release human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong, with whom I met in Beijing . Chinese authorities formally charged Jiang with subversion of state power on Tuesday, after holding him incommunicado for six months. Alston, an international law professor from Australia, called the charge  extremely serious  and  the equivalent of a legal sledgehammer .  Jiang defended high-profile dissidents and practitioners of Falun Gong, the banned spiritual movement, before being disbarred in 2009. He continued to speak out against government crackdowns on rights lawyers before disappearing last November. Alston said:  I of course do not agree that there is something called judicial sovereignty which would lead a Special Rapporteur or this Council not to reflect on cases that appear to violate human rights, appear to be unjust, even if they are part of the judicial process.  Activists denounced as a missed opportunity the fact that representatives of France, the European Union and the United States did not refer to Alston's criticism of China in their comments.    These are governments that claim to care deeply about human rights in China and this is a venue in which to raise those concerns,  Sophie Richardson, China director of the New York-based group Human Rights Watch, told Reuters at the debate.  They are undermining themselves, the U.N. human rights mechanisms, and independent Chinese civil society which is trying to use these institutions to solve problems,  she said. In a speech, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) called on the council's 47 member states to demand his release, saying China had intensified its  targeting  of independent civil society including Jiang Tianyong.

Saracho was left by the side of the road by the European resolution body,  said one source, adding that JP Morgan's last-ditch attempt at the weekend to find a buyer was predicated on an understanding that the SRB would soon move on Popular. The SRB declined to comment. Sources familiar with SRB strategy say the initial objective was to intervene in Popular on Friday, June 9, ahead of the weekend, to give enough time for negotiations. But both the volume of deposit withdrawals on Monday and the determination of European authorities to use their new banking resolution powers would speed things up dramatically. In the early afternoon of Tuesday, Saracho picked up the phone to call Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos and let him know Popular had run out of collateral to obtain new ECB liquidity. Branches might not open on Wednesday morning.  There was a bank run,  the ECB's deputy governor Vitor Constancio said on Thursday in response to questions about why the authorities had not spent more time analyzing other options to salvage the bank. It was no longer a question of making sure the bank had enough capital to meet its long term obligations, so much as ensuring it had cash on hand to stay open.  It was not a matter of assessing the developments of solvency as such, but the liquidity issue.  Within six hours, the SRB had swooped, cancelling the investments of Popular's shareholders and junior bondholders with the stroke of a pen and selling the lender for a solitary euro to Spanish banking goliath Santander (SAN.MC).

Claver Gatete told parliament that 17 percent of the budget will be funded by donors with the rest coming from internal revenue and borrowing, of which 362.8 billion francs will be borrowed from outside Rwanda.  The government's objective is to reduce the reliance on external donor support especially where grants are concerned. However, for the time being this support remains vital for our development.  The government expects to collect 1.20 trillion francs in revenue during the fiscal year, which runs from July to June, up from 1.081 trillion in 2016/17. The minister said 54 percent of the budget of the tiny central African nation would be used on recurrent expenditure with an increment of 131 billion francs, part of which will be used to finance August presidential elections and salaries in new government institutions. The government planned to use 937 billion francs on development projects, an increase of 44.4 percent from the fiscal year ending June, Gatete said. The cash will be used for promoting export products, agriculture and expansion of state-run airline Rwandair, completing the construction of a new airport and renovation existing airports. The money will also go to towards roads, power transmission lines and water supply, Gatete said. Rwanda's economy is expected to grow 6.2 percent in 2017 and 6.8 percent in 2018 while inflation is expected to be at 7 percent by the end of 2017, Gatete said in May. He said inflation would edge down to 6 percent in 2018. The central African nation has posted soaring growth rates in recent years mostly fuelled by business-friendly policies and strong inflows of foreign investment.

The cutbacks come as the bank's Zurich neighbour UBS , the world's largest private bank, also considers moving hundreds of staff out of London as Britain prepares to embark on divorce talks with the European Union. UBS and Credit Suisse joined big U.S. investment banks in setting up their European headquarters in London, giving them access to the European Union market. But now Brexit is forcing the Swiss and others to seek alternatives. For Credit Suisse, the job cuts, which will take its London staff to roughly 5,000, is part of a paring down of its London operations that began in 2015 as the bank restructured under Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. One Credit Suisse executive said privately that high bonuses and the cost of doing business in the British capital made it difficult for Credit Suisse to turn a profit on its London operation. Brexit, he said, reinforced the determination to act. A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the investment bank as a whole had  strong profit growth  and that the programme of company-wide job cuts was most advanced in London. The bank does not provide a breakdown for the performance of its London operations. The scale of the London cuts reflects a change in approach towards Europe's biggest financial centre. Before it embarked on its cutbacks, Credit Suisse employed more than 9,000 staff and contractors in the city.  For the Swiss banks, it was always important to be in London, not least to be close to your wealthy customers,  Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel, said.  With Brexit, London has certainly lost some significance.   For Credit Suisse, which was under pressure to cut costs anyway, as well as UBS, the timing is fortunate. Brexit is a good opportunity.  The scaling back in London coincides with a shift in focus by both UBS and Credit Suisse towards Asia, the region with the fastest-growing number of millionaires. Other European centres could also benefit. Credit Suisse, which already has operations in Poland, opened a branch in Dublin more than a year ago, while UBS could bolster its base in Frankfurt. But UBS is biding its time in London until the end of this year before making any decisions on staff moves, one senior executive said, redoubling lobbying efforts for the status quo in finance to remain after Brexit. It expects roughly 1,000 staff in City of London may have to move after Brexit. But the number could be higher. Its chief executive Sergio Ermotti said up to 30 percent of its roughly 5,400 employees in London could be affected. If Britain's EU departure is abrupt and with no trading agreement in place to cover finance, one senior UBS employee, who asked not to be named, said the Swiss bank could be forced to move the majority of its London staff. UBS declined to comment. Swiss bankers are still hoping for a smooth Brexit but frustration is growing over the lack of clarity so far. Earlier this year, Ermotti criticised the British government for failing to reassure banks.  The UK,  he said  is not really helping.  (Writing By John O'Donnell.

It was the first instalment of a packed day for markets, which includes the Senate testimony of the FBI chief fired last month by U.S. President Donald Trump, and will conclude with the result overnight of a snap election in Brexit-bound Britain. Wall Street opened broadly steady in New York after the latest drop in jobless claims, but it had been set to be more impressive before Draghi's caution. Despite data earlier in the day showing the euro zone growing at its fast clip since the ECB started printing money, the ECB head played down expectations that had been building that it could soon be scaling it back.  I want to emphasise that basically the ECB will be in the market for a long time,  Draghi said at meeting held in Estonia. Asked about possibility of reducing its asset purchases in September he added:  That was not discussed.  European banks led a sharp stocks retreat after Draghi's comment but another sharp U-turn hoisted them up more than 1 percent again. The rise came after signs emerged of another euro zone bank rescue, this time in Italy, as well as a pop in energy stocks as oil recovered from a 5 percent  tumble. Draghi's comments also briefly knocked the euro back below $1.12 while bond yields slumped in Germany, hit a multi-month low in Spain and saw the biggest drop since December in Italy.  The market's initial assessment is that the ECB is not quite as close to policy normalisation as previously thought,  said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London. The dollar was also beginning to find some traction having been in a holding pattern. The yen had landed a glancing blow overnight after stimulus withdrawal talk from a Bank of Japan policymaker, but the greenback had all but recovered as focus returned to the day's main events. Former FBI Director James Comey later began testifying to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee over his statement that Trump asked him to drop an investigation into the ties the president's former national security adviser had with Russia. Wall St markets largely shrugged off Wednesday's written testimony releases as not toxic enough to ratchet up the threat to Trump of an impeachment.  To be honest, I'm absolutely staggered about the degree to which this geopolitical environment and developments are having absolutely no effect on markets,  said Saxo Bank head of FX strategy John Hardy.  I'm old enough to remember how nervous the market used to get about this kind of stuff back in the day. I admit I don't know how to price it, but it's really staggering.  Battle for Britain With the VIX implied volatility index, the markets' so called 'fear gauge' hovering just above 10 percent, similar arguments are being made about the UK election, the race for which has tightened drastically in recent weeks London's FTSE was beginning to sag as the day wore on and after a solid start the pound had drew back to $1.2940 For all the speculation about a hung parliament or a Labour-led coalition, the central assumption was the governing Conservatives would slightly increase their majority, a result also suggested by recent, though divergent, opinion polls. Spot sterling has been firm in recent days, although the jump in overnight implied volatility readings to some 30 percent – the highest since July – showed some pricing of possible risks over the next 12-18 hours. The biggest moves of the week so far remain centred around ebbing energy prices and inflation outlooks in general. Brent crude stabilized at $48.50 a barrel in European trading, after another steep drop briefly below $48 overnight. It is now down more than 7 percent year-on-year. With inventories showing no easing of the global glut, a row between Qatar and its Arab neighbours is seen as undermining the OPEC consensus about production cuts to limit oil supply. Financially, the isolation of Qatar is taking its toll on the country’s debt and currency markets. Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday and Moody's warned on Thursday that it saw risks too if the situation continued. The riyal currency held near to an 11-year low in its pegged band and though stocks bounced more than two percent, Qatari sovereign dollar bonds extended their losses and the cost of insuring exposure to the kingdom's debt rose to the highest level since mid-November.  We expect that economic growth will slow, not just through reduced regional trade, but as corporate profitability is damaged because regional demand is cut off, investment is hampered, and investment confidence wanes,  S&P; said.

Fitch has also affirmed Dufry Finance SCA's senior notes at 'BB-'. The change of the Outlook to Stable from Negative reflects Fitch's view as regards the success of Dufry's integrated transformational acquisitions and our expectations of sustainably improving free cash flows and margins; these factors should drive de-leveraging towards 5.0x on a funds from operations (FFO)-adjusted gross basis in the medium term, a level we consider more comfortable with the rating given the cyclical demand profile in line with the economic cycle. The rating action critically relies on management's rigorous execution of operational improvement measures and its commitment to its target net debt to EBITDA of 3.0x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Accelerating Organic Growth: Fitch projects low single digit organic growth for Dufry's operations, supported by the implementation of the Business Operating Model (BOM) to stimulate sales and operating margins. The issuer's intension to explore the benefits of digitalisation, which has become indispensable in traditional retail and which has been underutilised in travel retail, as well as the active management of customer data will be beneficial to the mobilisation of incremental sales. Realisation of additional synergies of CHF20 million through streamlining of certain corporate functions and business processes would add up to 50bp to the EBITDA margin in the medium term. Supportive Macro-Economic Environment: A generally stable macro-economic environment with strong performance in the developed markets in combination with improving consumer confidence in the emerging markets along with stabilisation of the national currencies, particularly in Latin America and Russia, should provide additional impetus for growth. The lift of a travel ban for Russian tourists going to Turkey has reversed the regional performance to positive in 2H16, supporting our expectations of a strong 2017 trading performance. Recovery Uncertainty in Brazil: Given Dufry's considerable exposure to Brazil, which we estimate at around 5% of group revenues, we remain cautious on the pace of the economic recovery and restoration of consumer confidence in Brazil, due to the political uncertainties related to President Michel Temer. Fitch expects a steady, albeit slow recovery this year of 0.5%, further accelerating to 2.5% in 2018. Focus on Execution: The Stabilisation of the Outlook reflects the evidence of adequate execution skills of Dufry's management and its adherence to stated financial policies. The disciplined execution of two transformational acquisitions, with fully realised synergies, provides confidence for the timely implementation of the operational improvement measures contained in the BOM. An early redemption of the USD500 million senior notes in December 2016 signals the issuer's commitment to the leverage target of 3.0x. An inability to improve operating performance by the end-2018 as planned, coupled with stagnating deleveraging would put ratings under pressure. Leverage Still Stretched: Projected FFO-adjusted leverage of 5.9x at the end of 2017 remains an outlier for an IDR of 'BB-', and is in line with a lower non-investment grade for the retail sector. In the absence of contractual debt amortisation, deleveraging relies solely on Dufry's ability to continuously improve sales and operating margins. Through the implementation of sales and profitability strengthening initiatives outlined in the BOM, we project FFO-adjusted leverage will reduce towards 5.0x in 2020, and become more comfortable for the assigned rating. For the purposes of FFO-adjusted leverage calculation, Fitch capitalises only the Minimum Guarantee Payments under the concession contracts estimated at 5% of sales multiplied by eight times. Modified FFO Fixed-Charge Cover Ratio: In line with the change to the calculation of the FFO Fixed-Charge Cover introduced by Fitch in 2016, the agency continues to capitalise the entire amount of concession fees. The resulting ratio of 1.3x is materially below peers in the 'BB' rating category for the sector. However, we consider the ratio of 1.3x in the context of largely flexible concession fees, linked to Dufry's underlying operating performance, which does not imply a constrained financial flexibility of the issuer; on the contrary we expect greater resilience through the economic cycle as both sales and concession fees would reduce albeit not in perfect synchronization. Due to its expected stability through the cycle, the modified FFO Fixed-Charge Cover levels have no impact on the rating. Further Acquisitions Likely: Fitch considers bolt-on acquisitions to be part of the business development strategy. We have therefore included in our rating case an annual acquisition budget of CHF200 million starting in 2018, after Dufry has fully absorbed the transformational acquisitions of recent years. Larger acquisitions would be considered as event risk. DERIVATION SUMMARY Dufry's IDR of 'BB-' reflects a low investment grade business risk profile, evident in scale, the quality of the concession portfolio and strong cash flow generation, constrained by an elevated indebtedness level which is more in line with the 'B' rating category. Similarly to traditional retailers, Dufry is exposed to changes in consumer confidence, or volume risk, expressed in the number of travellers, while carrying little price risk as the company benefits from the captive and generally more affluent air travel audience. At the same time, travel retailers tend to be more cyclical and seasonal than conventional general retailers. The uniqueness of Dufry's P&L; structure is the largely flexible cost of its concessions, linked to certain operating performance parameters such as sales. Such flexibility allows the company to maintain an FFO fixed-charge cover ratio at about 1.3x, without compromising its financial flexibility. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Dufry include: - annual organic growth of 3%-4% until 2020 - EBITDA margin gradually improving towards 13% in the medium term - capex at 3.5% of sales, in line with management guidance - common dividends assumed at CHF100 million-CHF200 million a year based on the results of 2018 when we project Dufry will approach its net leverage target of 3.0x - minority dividends of 5% of EBITDA - net trade working capital rising in line with sales, leading to an average cash outflow of CHF20 million a year - bank debt maturing in July 2019 is assumed to be refinanced at maturity on the same terms - add-on acquisitions of CHF200 million a year from 2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Sustained positive organic sales growth and EBITDA margins improving towards 15%. -Pre-dividend free cash flows sustainably at high single digit levels. -FFO adjusted leverage decreasing to <4.5x, or FFO adjusted net leverage to <4.0x. -FFO fixed charge cover improving towards 1.4x. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Stagnating sales and EBITDA margins remaining below 12% as a result of an inability to realise planned business improvement measures or address operational challenges. -Execution of a sizeable predominantly debt-funded acquisition jeopardising de-leveraging. -Leverage persistently in excess of 5.5x on FFO adjusted gross basis, or FFO-adjusted net leverage staying above 5.0x. -      FFO fixed charge cover tightening towards 1.2x. LIQUIDITY Comfortable Liquidity, Low Refinancing Risk: Fitch projects comfortable organic liquidity of CHF300 million to CHF400 million per annum, leading to average non-restricted cash reserves of CHF350 million until 2020. According to management guidance, the cash drawdown under the revolving credit facility of CHF372 million at the end of 2016 will be reduced to zero during 2017. Restricted cash reserves have been kept at CHF100 million. In light of the good access to public debt and equity markets, and investors' familiarity with Dufry's business model, refinancing risk is considered low.

The Yield Book acquisition, when closed, will boost the size and capabilities of LSE's FTSE Russell indexes business, bringing the amount of assets under management benchmarked to its indexes to around $15 trillion. Trends such as the ongoing shift in investment style to passive from active and the desire by investors to get more exposure to emerging markets, particularly China, make index businesses attractive, LSE CFO David Warren said at the Sandler O’Neill Global Exchange and Brokerage Conference in New York. With nationalistic and regulatory factors making big cross-border exchange deals difficult to get done, as seen in the collapse of LSE's merger with Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE) in March, exchanges have been looking to index and data deals to help them grow.   Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said last Thursday it reached an agreement to acquire Bank of America Merrill Lynch's (BAC.N) global research index platform for an undisclosed amount. Deutsche Boerse on Wednesday said it too is on the lookout for deals in the space. As a result, a number of banks that have developed analytics and index businesses using intellectual property (IP) from their internal trading operations are looking to monetize those businesses, Warren said.     We come into it obviously seeing that the IP in terms of index creation has been undervalued, so that is really the opportunity,  he said. Exchanges increasingly see themselves as financial markets infrastructure providers with global distribution networks, rather than just trading venues, Warren said.  Index and analytics businesses provide exchanges with the intellectual property to create investment products that are in demand from global asset managers, he said.      So there is  a lot of investment in the business right now, but there is also still a lot of work we are doing to look at acquisition opportunities.

Comey is being grilled by Washington politicians over his claims that President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Comey said he had no doubt that Russia interfered with the election but was confident that no votes had been altered.  Today is about Washington and the drama surrounding Comey's testimony. But the talk about the demise of President Trump's presidency or growth agenda seems premature, short of a smoking gun,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  I expect equities to generally tend sideways today, short of any new revelations coming out of the testimony.  Earlier on Thursday, the European Central Bank signaled no further interest rate cuts as euro zone prospects improved but said subdued inflation meant it would continue to pump more stimulus into the region's economy. Investors are also keeping an eye on the outcome of the UK general election, with opinion polls showing Theresa May's Conservative Party leading between 5 and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority. At 10:35 a.m. ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.62 points, or 0.03 percent, at 21,179.31, the S&P; 500 was down 1.51 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,431.63. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.56 points, or 0.01 percent, at 6,296.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the defensive utilities index's 1.08 percent loss topping the decliners. Shares of Alibaba Group Holding were up 9.5 percent at $137.55 after the company said it expects revenue growth of 45-49 percent in the 2018 fiscal year. Yahoo, which owns a 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba also rose 7.2 percent to $54.18. Nordstrom jumped 11.4 percent to $45.09 after the department store operator said that some members of the controlling Nordstrom family have formed a group to consider taking the company private.

Sisi, who took office in 2014 after ousting the former Muslim Brotherhood administration, is facing an uphill struggle to revive the economy, control prices and create jobs. In November, Egypt abandoned its currency peg of 8.8 pounds per dollar, which led to both the pound halving in value and to inflation shooting up. It was at a year-on-year high of 30.5 percent in April. The official CAPMAS statistics agency said on Thursday this had eased, with annual urban inflation falling to 29.7 percent in May. Over the same period, core inflation eased to 30.57 percent year on year in May from 32.06 percent in April, the central bank said. The bank has been trying to keep the pound stronger and inflation lower. It raised key interest rates by 300 basis points when the peg was droppe, helping it to clinch a $12 billion International Monetary Fund programme. Last month, the central bank raised key rates by another 200 basis points, a decision aimed at dealing with inflation as well as demand-side pressures. It came after the IMF said action on those two factors was vital to keeping Egypt's economic reforms on track. Economists, businessmen and bankers, however, say inflation in Egypt -- where only 10 percent of the population have bank accounts -- is due to rising raw materials costs and a hike in rates will not produce the desired effect. So May's fall, while suggesting the huge spike may be over, is not necessarily a signal of longer-term improvement.  This slight dip doesn't mean Egypt has passed the inflationary pressure caused by November’s currency float. The Egyptian pound would have to strengthen and production would need to increase for inflation to see a real decline,  said Ehab al-Dessouki, a Cairo economist.  The slight dip also shows that last month's rise in interest rates wasn’t as effective as anticipated.  Another economist said the latest figures show inflation is stabilising, but warned of upward pressure to come.  I think we have passed the inflationary pressures driven by the float, but there are new reforms coming up that may take inflation higher,  said Hany Farahat of CI Capital. The three-year IMF loan deal is tied to sweeping economic reforms including subsidy cuts. The IMF last month backed Egypt's plan to end fuel subsidies within three years but said the timing of any price hike was up to the government.  As for petroleum subsidy cuts, they are inevitable ... then we expect inflation will revert to the upside for sure,  Farahat added. The figures coincided with boosts to foreign investment in domestic debt and an announcement that the government is pushing ahead with regulations to implement a new law designed to encourage foreign investment.

Lavdrim Muhaxheri, 28, died in the Middle East, but it was not clear in which country, they told Reuters. A video posted on the Internet in 2014 showed Muhaxheri beheading a young man in Iraq accused by IS of spying for the Iraqi government. Another showed him killing another person with a rocket-propelled grenade. In 2014 the U.S. State Department put Muhaxheri in the list of the most wanted terrorists. A police official, who declined to be named, told Reuters that he had been killed, but gave no other details.  A friend called last night to say that he was killed in an air strike,  a close family member of Muhaxheri told Reuters in his hometown of Kacanik, declining to give more details. Many people in the town queued on Thursday to express their condolences to the father of the IS fighter. As requested by the family, Muhaxheri's death was announced on loudspeakers at the town's main mosque.    He was a nice person while he was here but later, like many other youngsters, he was brainwashed,  said Behar Latifi after meeting Muhaxheri's father. Most of the 300 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo known to have left to fight with Islamic State are from the small town of Kacanik and nearby villages.  More than 50 have been killed, Kosovo officials say. About 120 people are estimated to have left to join the Sunni Islamist militants from neighboring Albania, and about 100 from Macedonia's Albanian minority. Pristina-based investigative news portal Insajderi, in an editorial, said of Muhaxheri:  Today we should celebrate his death. Go to hell, that's where you belong.  Confirming the death, an uncle of Muhaxheri asked a Reuters reporter:  Is everyone happy now?  Kosovo has not seen any militant attacks on its home turf, but at least 200 people have been detained or investigated for alleged offences related to Islamic State. Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority are nominally Muslim but follow secular lifestyles. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with the backing of the West. In 2015, it adopted a law introducing jail sentences of up to 15 years for anyone found guilty of fighting in wars abroad.

The rating agency bumped BP up one notch to A1 and said the London-based company's outlook was positive. Moody's last upgraded BP's long-term issuer rating in 1998, a spokesman said.  Our decision to upgrade BP to A1 factors in the increased clarity around the size and timing of remaining cash payments linked to the Deep Water Horizon incident, as well as expected improvements to BP's credit metrics and its strong operating performance despite high oil price volatility,  said Elena Nadtotchi, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's. The settlement of the Deepwater Horizon fines and clean up costs in 2015 brought BP's pretax bill to more than $62 billion. The company will pay the charge gradually into the 2030s. BP, like other oil companies, slashed spending and costs in the wake of a sharp drop in oil prices from mid-2014. It is aiming to be able to general cashflow at oil prices of $35-$40 a barrel by the end of the decade.  BP demonstrated strong operating performance amid high volatility in oil prices,  according to Moody's. It is set to see a sharp rise in production in the coming years as it starts up eight projects this year, including in Oman and Azerbaijan, the largest number in the company's history in a single year. The company hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade.  The positive outlook recognises that BP's strong business profile may sustain a higher rating and anticipates that the company will continue to deliver strong operating performance in 2017-19, supported by growth and improving profitability of the upstream, and rising contribution from the downstream,  Moody's said. Of 29 analysts surveyed by Reuters, 14 have 'buy' or 'strong buy' recommendations on BP, and 14 a 'hold' recommendation. BP's debt at the end of March was $28.6 billion, which represents 28 percent of the company's equity capital, also known as gearing.

The 41-year-old nurse contracted the disease in December 2014 at the height of an Ebola epidemic which swept through three countries in West Africa and killed more than 11,300 people. Cafferkey, who now works as a nurse in Scotland, returned to Sierra Leone last month, for the first time since being infected, to meet Ebola survivors and orphans - some of whom she treated - and raise funds for the British charity Street Child.  What was emotional was meeting Ebola survivors and orphans and seeing how they don't have the luxury of moving on,  Cafferkey told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.  The psychological impact is something no-one talks about but it is so clearly evident ... people are by no means over Ebola as it has clearly left an immense scar (on Sierra Leone).  Cafferkey completed a 10 km (6.2 mile) run last month as part of an annual marathon in Sierra Leone organized by Street Child to raise money for children hit hardest by Ebola.  Some 12,000 children were orphaned in Sierra Leone by the virus, 1,400 of whom need urgent support, Street Child said.  Thousands of Ebola orphans ... are desperately struggling,  Tom Dannatt, head of Street Child, said in a statement.  They may have a roof over their heads but they are last in the line for food and school - especially if they are a girl,  he added. The world's worst Ebola outbreak, which was declared over last year, killed at least 11,300 people and infected 28,600 as it swept through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea from 2013. The first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in Britain, Cafferkey suffered life-threatening complications from the deadly disease persisting in her brain, and has been readmitted to hospital several times with illness linked to the infection. She also faced disciplinary action over allegations she concealed her temperature on her return from Sierra Leone, but was cleared by a British nursing watchdog last September. Yet Cafferkey said returning to the country after what she called a tough couple of years had helped her to move on.   Before I went to Sierra Leone, I didn't know what to expect,  she said.  I'm glad I came back, it has been emotional but it has helped to give me closure.

Papa has narrowed Valeant's focus to its dermatology, eye care and gastrointestinal businesses by pruning other assets to repay its debt, which ballooned to nearly $30 billion following a furious spate of deal-making under former CEO Mike Pearson.  It's not my goal to get the debt to zero,  Papa said in an interview.  The right place for our debt is somewhere ... in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion.  In August, Valeant had pledged to cut debt by $5 billion by February next year through divestments and operational performance. Papa said on Thursday Valeant was well on pace to meet that target. Pearson's acquisition spree sent Valeant's shares from around $20 to a high of over $250 in 2015, before the stock went into a tailspin as Valeant's drug pricing strategy and ties to a specialty pharmacy came under increased political and regulatory scrutiny. Valeant's New York-listed shares were up 7.9 percent at $13.13 in morning trading on Thursday. In January, Valeant agreed to sell its Dendreon cancer treatment business and three skincare brands for $2.12 billion. That deal is expected to close in the middle of this year, Papa said. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Valeant was in talks to sell its Bausch & Lomb unit's surgical products business. Its eye-surgery assets may be valued at about $2 billion in a sale, the report said. Valeant was also exploring the sale of its Salix stomach-drug business and other assets, but talks with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T) had stalled over price disagreements, Reuters reported in November. Reports have said Salix could fetch Valeant as much as $10 billion. The deal to buy iNova — which markets prescription and over-the-counter products focused on weight and pain management, cardiology and cough and cold — is expected to close in the second half of this year. INova, bought by Valeant in 2011, will be sold to a company jointly owned by Pacific Equity Partners and Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Valeant said. Goldman Sachs & Co was Valeant's financial adviser, while Baker McKenzie provided legal counsel.

Simpa Networks, which began operations in 2011, is one of thousands of social enterprises in India tapping into the renewable energy market in a country where one-fifth of the 1.3 billion population has no access to electricity. With the majority of those without power from poor communities in countryside, the company focuses on selling solar powered products such as LED lights, phone charging points and fans on financing to rural homes and shops in northern India.  We see a tremendous opportunity in rural areas where demand for energy is growing even faster than supply,  said Simpa Network CEO Piyush Mathur in a statement.  Rooftop solar has a role to play in both off-grid and on-grid areas. In many cases it's the fastest and least expensive way to get power into the homes and businesses in rural areas.    Simpa Magic TV  provides over 100 satellite channels with content ranging from comedy and entertainment to news, movies and music, and costs 25,000 rupees ($390) - the same as a non-solar equivalent.  The system, which includes an 80 W solar panel, 20  energy efficient LED television, battery, solar charge controller, is available on a repayment plan of up to 36 months. Interest applies but the company declined to provide approximate rates. Customers make an initial payment to have the system installed then use a pay-as-you-go model for the electricity. The payments contribute to total cost and, once fully paid, the customer owns the system and the electricity is free. The service, which was launched on Wednesday, has around 350 customers so far in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.    Simpa uses its  SmartPanel  technology which enables remote monitoring and control of the rooftop solar panel. Customers prepay for the energy and the SmartPanel delivers power until the prepaid credits expire and the customer must then recharge. The company said the payment plan is effective as such technology would be unaffordable for most rural families. With no credit history, most are considered  unbankable  and would not be able to access loans easily, it said. Given solar television service is new and few know how to use and maintain it, the company said, Simpa has trained rural solar technicians who are responsible for installation, after sale services and monthly collection of payments.

Asset prices in Central European financial markets were mostly rangebound ahead of Thursday's British elections and the congressional testimony from ex-FBI director James Comey.     The crown still firmed a quarter of a percent to 26.25 against the euro by 1347 GMT, touching its strongest levels since late 2013.     The Czech central bank (CNB) could make its first interest rate rise in the second half of this year, Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl said late on Wednesday.     Another rate setter, Oldrich Dedek was quoted by the daily paper E15 as saying that he saw no reason to question the bank's staff forecast which suggests a third-quarter hike.     The bank has repeatedly said that the more the crown firms from its firmer cap at 27 against the euro, which the bank removed in April, the less needed rate tightening could be.     The crown has been slower to rise since being set free than many investors expected, leaving tens of billions of euros of positions built up before the exit still in the market.      We have our central bank story and big positions waiting to close. That is the story: when these positions will be closed,  a Prague FX dealer said.     Czech markets still price in a hike to come not earlier than the second quarter of 2018, Komercni Banka rates trader Dalimil Vyskovsky said.      I actually think (the market) is aware of the risks of much earlier rate hike, but it seems to be that people are positioned already,  he said, adding that much will depend on the crown's gains and inflation developments.     The CNB's 2-percent inflation target is lower than in Hungary or Poland. A hike would be the first in about a decade, and its tightening bias is in contrast with loose policy stances elsewhere in the region.     Poland's central bank could keep rates at record lows until the end of 2018 because inflation is expected to stabilise, its governor reiterated on Wednesday.     The zloty and the forint reversed an early weakening against the euro.     The zloty returned to the firmer side of the 4.2 line as the euro eased versus the dollar, after the European Central Bank dropped its guidance that interest rates may be cut, but reiterated that quantitative easing could be extended if needed.      ECB asset buying in the euro zone has also created additional demand for Central European financial assets.     Healthy demand led Hungary to sell 60 billion forints  ($218.17 million) worth of government bonds at two auctions on Thursday, 50 percent more than planned, and Budapest's main stock index hit a record high.     Serbia's central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 4 percent on Thursday for the 11th consecutive month, as expected. The dinar eased 0.1 percent to 122.55 against the euro.

Simpa Networks, which began operations in 2011, is one of thousands of social enterprises in India tapping into the renewable energy market in a country where one-fifth of the 1.3 billion population has no access to electricity. With the majority of those without power from poor communities in countryside, the company focuses on selling solar powered products such as LED lights, phone charging points and fans on financing to rural homes and shops in northern India.  We see a tremendous opportunity in rural areas where demand for energy is growing even faster than supply,  said Simpa Network CEO Piyush Mathur in a statement.  Rooftop solar has a role to play in both off-grid and on-grid areas. In many cases it's the fastest and least expensive way to get power into the homes and businesses in rural areas.    Simpa Magic TV  provides over 100 satellite channels with content ranging from comedy and entertainment to news, movies and music, and costs 25,000 rupees ($390) - the same as a non-solar equivalent.  The system, which includes an 80 W solar panel, 20  energy efficient LED television, battery, solar charge controller, is available on a repayment plan of up to 36 months. Interest applies but the company declined to provide approximate rates. Customers make an initial payment to have the system installed then use a pay-as-you-go model for the electricity. The payments contribute to total cost and, once fully paid, the customer owns the system and the electricity is free. The service, which was launched on Wednesday, has around 350 customers so far in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.    Simpa uses its  SmartPanel  technology which enables remote monitoring and control of the rooftop solar panel. Customers prepay for the energy and the SmartPanel delivers power until the prepaid credits expire and the customer must then recharge. The company said the payment plan is effective as such technology would be unaffordable for most rural families. With no credit history, most are considered  unbankable  and would not be able to access loans easily, it said. Given solar television service is new and few know how to use and maintain it, the company said, Simpa has trained rural solar technicians who are responsible for installation, after sale services and monthly collection of payments.

Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and several other countries severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-foe Iran - charges Qatar says are baseless.  We have been isolated because we are successful and progressive. We are a platform for peace not terrorism ... This dispute is threatening the stability of the entire region,  Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters in Doha.

While the foreign minister said Qatar had not yet been presented with a list of demands by countries which cut off ties with Doha on Monday, he insisted it be solved by peaceful means.  There cannot ever be a military solution to this problem.  Qatar will respect the LNG gas agreements it has made with the United Arab Emirates despite its cutting off relations with Doha, Sheikh Mohammed said. He said that Iran had told Doha it was ready to help with securing food supplies and that it would designate three of its ports to Qatar but that the offer had not yet been accepted.

Total will roughly double its liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio by 2020 to 15 million tonnes per year, but the company needs to look at deals that will give it footholds in new markets and capture new gas buyers, Laurent Vivier said. Morocco plans to build a project, worth up to $4.6 billion, which includes the import of up to 7 billion cubic metres of gas by 2025, the construction of a jetty, terminal, pipelines and gas-fired power plants with capacity to produce up to 2,400 megawatts of electricity. In January, Moroccan state-owned power utility ONEE picked HSBC as financial adviser for the project.  Morocco wants to launch an onshore LNG terminal along with the power (infrastructure) behind it, and it wants the same company to be involved in all of this,  Vivier told Reuters during a visit to Copenhagen.  If we said that we are not interested in power generation, we'd have to say no to these kinds of projects.  He added that Total is also interested in a similar project in South Africa, where the government plans a 50 billion rand ($3.9 billion) gas-to-power development that will require 1.6 million tonnes a year of gas imports. Total will take minority stakes in such projects, he said, noting that an average 400-megawatt combined-cycle power plant costs roughly $300 million to build.  As long as it's an integrated project and we can place our own production of gas in those projects, we are happy to look at this,  Vivier said. In 2015, Total decided to remove coal-related businesses from its portfolio and said a move to gas from coal for energy can cut carbon emissions by 50 percent, a quick win for countries aiming to meet carbon emission reduction targets.

Papa has narrowed Valeant's focus to its dermatology, eye care and gastrointestinal businesses by pruning other assets to repay its debt, which ballooned to nearly $30 billion following a furious spate of deal-making under former CEO Mike Pearson.  It's not my goal to get the debt to zero,  Papa said in an interview.  The right place for our debt is somewhere ... in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion.  In August, Valeant had pledged to cut debt by $5 billion by February next year through divestments and operational performance. Papa said on Thursday Valeant was well on pace to meet that target. Pearson's acquisition spree sent Valeant's shares from around $20 to a high of over $250 in 2015, before the stock went into a tailspin as Valeant's drug pricing strategy and ties to a specialty pharmacy came under increased political and regulatory scrutiny. Valeant's New York-listed shares were up 7.9 percent at $13.13 in morning trading on Thursday. In January, Valeant agreed to sell its Dendreon cancer treatment business and three skincare brands for $2.12 billion. That deal is expected to close in the middle of this year, Papa said. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Valeant was in talks to sell its Bausch & Lomb unit's surgical products business. Its eye-surgery assets may be valued at about $2 billion in a sale, the report said. Valeant was also exploring the sale of its Salix stomach-drug business and other assets, but talks with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (4502.T) had stalled over price disagreements, Reuters reported in November. Reports have said Salix could fetch Valeant as much as $10 billion. The deal to buy iNova — which markets prescription and over-the-counter products focused on weight and pain management, cardiology and cough and cold — is expected to close in the second half of this year. INova, bought by Valeant in 2011, will be sold to a company jointly owned by Pacific Equity Partners and Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Valeant said. Goldman Sachs & Co was Valeant's financial adviser, while Baker McKenzie provided legal counsel.

Or maybe the question should be, what's down with zinc?  London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc was trading just shy of $3,000 per ton as recently as late February. At one stage on Wednesday it hit a seven-month low of $2,427.50 and has since staged only a half-hearted recovery to $2,480.00.  All of the industrial metals have been hit by the chill coming off Beijing's attempts to cool an overheating shadow banking sector.  But zinc has been singled out for particular punishment. It is now the third worst year-to-date performer among the main LME-traded metals, besting only out-of-favor nickel and tin. And this despite what appeared to be every fund's favorite narrative of a fast-approaching supply crunch.  The funds have beaten a major retreat from the London zinc market.  If you believe the LME's Commitments of Traders Report, fund net long positioning was cut by around 883,500 tonnes between February and mid-May. There was a slight rebuild over the back end of last month but the most recent figures, covering the week to June 2, showed net length sliding again.  If you believe LME broker Marex Spectron's different take on speculative positioning, funds have turned net short on zinc.  Have they lost faith or is the recent fall-back just a strategic retreat?  Graphic on fund positioning on LME zinc:  tmsnrt.rs/2sG6VCb Graphic on zinc-lead relative value trade:  tmsnrt.rs/2r9gd7G Mission Accomplished? What has prompted the money men to reverse positioning on zinc?  There are as many strategies as there are funds but one or two key technical aspects of the recent market action are instructive.  The LME's figures show net fund length peaking on Feb. 14, one day after the benchmark three-month price had taken its second run at the $3,000 level.  This has long been a big-number target for bulls. This time last year there was bemused scepticism that someone had built up a long position on the $3,000 call option strike for June this year. Remember the price then was around $2,000.  Whoever had those options probably didn't do too badly, given zinc made its first attempt to get there in November last year with a high of $2,985.  The funds kept their faith at that stage but the second failed attempt on Feb. 13, when the bull charge ran aground at $2,980.50, seems to have persuaded many to cash in their chips and call it mission accomplished.  The fact that the price action had left a double-top on the charts would have whetted technical analysts' appetite for shorting zinc. The subsequent breach of a key uptrend line at $2,700 in early April even more so.  Compounding zinc's misfortunes has been its relationship with  sister metal  lead. At $610 per ton on Feb. 22 the zinc premium was as wide as it had been in 2007. Relative value traders, and there are many of them, have almost certainly been adding to the recent selling.  Shanghai Fizz All of which is ironic because zinc's slow-fuse bull story is starting to fizz.  True, significant tonnages of metal are still appearing on warrant in LME warehouses in New Orleans, reinforcing the sense that off-market stocks remain a key known unknown in the bull story. The last surge, totaling 22,100 tonnes, took place at the start of May.  LME stocks are still trending lower, though, last at 324,325 tonnes, down by 24 percent since the start of the year.  The real action, however, is taking place in China.  Visible stocks registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) have plummeted from almost 200,000 tonnes in March to 75,001 tonnes as of last Friday.  There seems to be a sticky front-month squeeze on the Shanghai market, the July contract trading at a consistent premium to the August contract for the last two weeks.  With several big local producers taking maintenance downtime, the arbitrage window for imports has opened.  April's imports of refined zinc at 47,500 tonnes were the strongest since March 2016.  My colleagues at Thomson Reuters GFMS suggest this metal  most likely came mainly from pre-existing stocks in Chinese bonded warehouse as the premium surged by 41 percent within the space of just two weeks . ( Base Metals Physical Trade/Arbitrage: May 2017 ) More may be on its way to replace it with physical traders anticipating further inflows in the coming months. All of which is written into the bull narrative.  China, the story goes, is going to be most acutely hit by the squeeze on raw materials, leading to stuttering domestic output of metal, leading to more imports.  So far, it would seem, so good.  Back for More?  Zinc is once again experiencing one of those disconnects between funds, fundamentals and technicals that we've seen before in this market. Fund length has been massively reduced since that second spike toward $3,000 with many taking profits before other, more nimble systems started feeding on the resulting deterioration in the charts. That process is still continuing.  However, if the current bullish news flow from the physical market keeps running at this rate, it's hard to believe there's not going to be a reaction from the money men.  Back in June 2016 those $3,000 call options sitting on June 2017 were a mark of zinc bulls' ambitions.  It's interesting, therefore, to consider the lie of the call option landscape in December this year. <0#MZNZ7+> There is market open interest all the way up to the $4,400 strike price, but the real stand-out in volume terms is the 1,800 lots (45,000 tonnes) resting at $3,500.  Not everyone, it seems, has given up on a zinc comeback.  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

Proceeds will be used to fund planned acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $31.7 billion of debt outstanding at March 31, 2017. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS HCA's 'BB' rating reflects: Industry-Leading Financial Flexibility: HCA has hospital industry-leading operating margins and generates consistent and ample discretionary FCF (operating cash flows less capex). Financial flexibility has improved significantly in recent years as a result of organic growth in the business as well as proactive management of the capital structure. Expect Stable Leverage: Fitch forecasts that HCA will produce cash flow from operations (CFO) of about $4.8 billion in 2017, and will prioritize use of cash for M&A;, organic investment in the business, and share repurchases. At 4x, HCA's leverage is below the average of the group of publicly traded hospital companies, and Fitch does not believe that there is a compelling financial incentive for HCA to use cash for debt reduction. Secular Headwinds Driving Operating Outlook: Measured by revenues, HCA is the largest operator of for-profit acute care hospitals in the country, with a broad geographic footprint. The company benefited from this during a period of several years of weak organic operating trends in the for-profit hospital industry. Although industry operating trends have improved since mid-2014, secular challenges, including a shift to lower-cost care driven by health insurer scrutiny and increasing healthcare consumerism, are a continuing headwind to organic growth. More Predictable Capital Deployment: The sponsors of a 2006 LBO previously directed HCA's financial strategy, but their ownership stake decreased steadily following a 2011 IPO. Under the direction of the LBO sponsors, HCA's ratings were constrained by shareholder-friendly capital deployment; HCA has so far had a more consistent and predictable approach to funding shareholder payouts under public ownership and an independent board of directors. Uncertain Future of the Affordable Care Act: A common aspect of the various changes to the ACA so far proposed by Republicans is that the new policies would reduce access to and affordability of health insurance for individuals who rely on either the individual health insurance market or state Medicaid programs for coverage. Any policy that rolls back insurance coverage will result in a weaker payor mix for acute care hospitals and this would pressure margins unless offset by cost-saving measures or higher reimbursement. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for HCA include: --Organic revenue growth of 4% in 2017 and 2018, driven by a 2%-3% increase in patient volumes with the remainder contributed by growth in pricing; --Operating EBITDA margin compression of about 80bps through the end of 2018, primarily as the result of negative operating leverage as patient volume growth rates slow versus the higher level seen in 2014-2015 and growth in pricing slows; --Fitch forecasts EBITDA before dividends to associates and minorities of $8.7 billion and discretionary FCF of $1.7 billion in 2017 for HCA, with capital expenditures of about $3 billion. Higher capital spending is related to growth projects that support the expectation of EBITDA growth through the forecast period; --Debt due in 2017-2019 is refinanced, resulting in gross debt/EBITDA after dividends to associates and minorities maintained near 4x through the forecast period. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'BB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) considers HCA operating with leverage (total debt/EBITDA after associate and minority dividends) around 4x and with a discretionary FCF margin of 4%-5%. A downgrade of the IDR to 'BB-' is unlikely in the near term, since these targets afford HCA with significant financial flexibility to increase acquisitions and organic capital investment while still returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. An upgrade to a 'BB+' IDR is possible if HCA maintains leverage at 3.5x or below. In addition to a commitment to operate with lower leverage, improvement in organic operating trends in the hospital industry would support a higher rating for HCA. Evidence of an improved operating trend would include sustained positive growth in organic patient volumes, improvement in the payor mix with fewer uninsured patients and correspondingly lower bad-debt expense. LIQUIDITY HCA's liquidity profile is solid. There are no significant debt maturities in 2017. Large maturities include $500 million of HCA Inc. unsecured notes in 2018, $2.1 billion of HCA Inc. secured notes in 2019 and $3.1 billion of ABL revolver borrowings maturing in 2019. Fitch believes that HCA's operating outlook and financial flexibility are amongst the best in the hospital industry, affording the company good market access to refinance upcoming maturities. At March 31, 2017, HCA's liquidity included $753 million of cash on hand, $2.1 billion of available capacity on its senior secured credit facilities and latest 12 months (LTM) discretionary FCF of about $2.2 billion. HCA's EBITDA/ interest paid is solid for the 'BB' rating category at 4.6x and the company had an ample operating cushion under its bank facility financial maintenance covenant, which requires debt net of cash maintained at or below 6.75x EBITDA. HCA's secured debt rating is rated 'BB+/RR1', one notch above the IDR, illustrating Fitch's expectation of superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The first-lien obligations, which include the bank terms loans, revolving credit facilities and the first-lien secured notes, are guaranteed by all material wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of HCA, Inc. that are  unrestricted subsidiaries  under the HCA Inc. unsecured note indenture dated Dec. 16, 1993. The HCA Inc. unsecured notes are rated 'BB/RR4', the same level as the IDR, despite the substantial amount of secured debt to which they are subordinated, with secured leverage of 2.7x at March 31, 2017. The bank agreements include a 3.75x first-lien secured leverage ratio debt incurrence test. The HCA Holdings Inc. unsecured notes are rated 'B+/RR6', two-notches below the IDR to reflect the substantial structural subordination of these obligations, which are subordinate in right of payment to all debt outstanding at the HCA Inc. level. At March 31, 2017, leverage at the HCA Inc. and HCA Holdings Inc. level was 3.9x and 4.0x, respectively. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates HCA as follows: HCA, Inc. --IDR 'BB'; --Senior secured credit facilities (cash flow and asset-backed) 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured first lien notes 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BB/RR4'. HCA Healthcare, Inc. --IDR 'BB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'B+/RR6'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The seasonally adjusted annual rate of starts declined to 194,663 in May from April's upwardly revised 213,498, the second consecutive monthly fall since a record high set in March, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said on Thursday. May's figure was a bigger decline than economists' expectations for a decrease to 205,000. Authorities are trying to clamp down on the Toronto and Vancouver markets amid fears of a possible bubble. Single detached starts in Toronto dropped by 43 percent, the first decline since September 2016.  This coincides with a noticeable increase in new home listings in the resale market, providing added choice to home buyers, causing less demand to spill over into the new home market,  the CMHC said in a statement. Single detached starts in Vancouver slipped by 13 percent. Toronto is the engine of the economy in Ontario, where the provincial government imposed a 15 percent foreign buyers tax in April. British Columbia made the same move last August in an effort to cool Vancouver's housing market. Data released this week showed Toronto's market cooled in May as sellers cashed in on high prices and buyers moved to the sidelines in the wake of the tax and other new rules aimed at dampening demand in Canada's largest city. BMO Capital Markets strategist Benjamin Reitzes said activity in Toronto could well remain subdued for the next few months as the market digested the effects of the foreign buyers' tax.  The surge in existing home supply we've seen over the past two months could also help restrain home building activity as buyers have more choices,  he said in a note to clients. Across Canada in May, single starts dropped by 7.0 percent while multiples -  typically condominiums and apartments - dropped 10 percent. The provinces' efforts are on top of moves from the federal government last year to tighten mortgage lending regulations to try to prevent Canadians from taking on too much debt. Separately, Statistics Canada said new housing prices jumped by 0.8 percent in April from March, the biggest gain in almost a year, amid keen buyer interest in Toronto and Vancouver. The price index excludes apartments and condominiums, which the government says are a particular cause for concern and which account for one-third of new housing.

The riyal hit an 11-year low of 3.6530 to the dollar late on Wednesday after Standard & Poor's cut Qatar's credit rating, citing this week's decision by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to sever diplomatic and transport ties with Doha. The dispute, over Saudi and UAE charges that Doha supports terrorism, triggered outflows of capital from Qatar which, if they persist, could eventually make it harder for authorities to maintain the riyal's peg of 3.64 to the dollar. The central bank's move to gather data on the currency market was in response to this concern, Qatari commercial bankers said.  We now consider risks to external financing lines to the whole economy, including foreign direct investment, portfolio flows and to the financial sector, to be elevated, and this could lead to pressure on Qatar's pegged monetary arrangement,  said S&P.; The sources said banks in Qatar were asked to provide daily information on their foreign exchange trading, a daily statement of withdrawals and transfers from deposits worth at least 10 million Saudi riyals ($2.7 million), and daily data on cash withdrawals and deposits. Previously, banks were generally required to provide such information monthly. The central bank also asked banks to supply on a weekly basis a breakdown of their customer deposits by maturity and type from Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt and other countries, the sources said. The central bank did not respond to requests for comment. The riyal rebounded to trade much closer to its peg in the spot market on Thursday; some traders said the central bank was supplying dollars to banks which wanted to close out their riyal positions, in order to avoid downward pressure on the currency.  There’s some stress in the Qatari riyal currency market but it’s too early to talk about pressure on the Qatari peg,  said a UAE treasury banker, who like most bankers declined to be named because of political sensitivities. S&P; estimated the government's liquid external assets were worth 170 percent of gross domestic product, a massive amount equivalent to nearly 10 years of the country's imports - a much higher degree of backing for its currency than most countries. Tension Nevertheless, there were other signs of tension in Qatari financial markets on Thursday. The riyal remained under pressure in the offshore forwards market, which banks use to hedge against future moves in the currency. The cost of buying insurance against a Qatari sovereign debt default hit a seven-month high, and the cost of borrowing three-month riyal funds in the interbank market jumped to 2.16 percent, the highest in at least several years - a sign nervous banks were holding back funds. A major source of capital outflows from Qatar so far has been the stock market, which plunged 9.7 percent over three days before partially rebounding on Thursday. Some foreign portfolio managers sold stocks and sent the proceeds home. In addition, some banks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE are closing out Qatari riyal long positions and offloading part of their riyal assets to reduce their risk. While Riyadh has told its banks it does not want them to do new business with Qatari institutions, neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE has yet clarified whether banks will be required to liquidate existing deals. Some bankers are cutting exposure now to limit the pain if they are forced into a firesale of assets. Other banks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have halted all transactions in the Qatari riyal, viewing them as too risky, although some remittances of money between the UAE and Qatar were continuing on Thursday, bankers said. A much bigger threat to the Qatari riyal than outflows from the stock market is the risk of an exodus in coming weeks and months from loans and deposits provided by foreign banks to Qatari banks. Foreign liabilities of Qatari banks increased to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015.

Poland's conservative euroskeptic ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), is staunchly Atlanticist and has been much more welcoming of the new right-wing Trump administration than many other European governments.  Feeling increasingly isolated in Europe, it has been trying for months to secure Trump's visit. Three official sources, who asked not to be further identified, said Trump agreed to visit Poland in July, with two of them saying the planned date is July 6, just a day before the G20 leaders meet for their annual summit in Hamburg.  While many details of the visit are still unclear, two sources said that Trump will most likely come to Warsaw. Earlier, Poland hoped Trump would come to the country's western city of Wroclaw where leaders from several central, eastern and southern European countries were to meet for the so-called Three Seas Initiative summit on July 6-7.   The American president is indeed very likely to come,  one of the sources said.  We are preparing to host him on July 6.   The trip would follow Trump's fractious first meeting with NATO in May, where he publicly denounced Europe's low defense and left European allies wondering where the military alliance goes next.

Reports Italian banks are considering contributing to a state rescue of the country's weakest lenders, Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, brought some comfort to investors wary of wider banking sector weakness, political uncertainty and a tightening of monetary policy in the region. Banking stocks in Italy rallied as much as 2.5 percent, reversing initial falls on worries that a subsequent intervention of the state in the troubled Veneto-based lenders could reduce the value of their investment. Momentum in bond and stock markets took hold after a deal struck among Italy's main political parties over a new electoral law collapsed, easing concerns about early elections.  BTPs rallied after the risk of a snap Italian election receded on news that Italy's big four political parties no longer agree on a new electoral law,  said AFS analyst Arne Petimezas in Amsterdam.  As a reminder, Italy needs a new electoral law before new elections can be held as the current law has been struck down by the constitutional court. A warning though: this is Italy and anything can happen.  The implications for early elections are far from clear. Analysts said a meeting of the ruling Democratic Party later on Thursday might bring more clarity. Italy's 10-year government bond yield slid 12 basis points to 2.16 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day slide since December. It outperformed other European bond yields, which were broadly lower after the European Central Bank cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme. Against this backdrop, the premium investors demand for holding Italian government bonds over top-rated German peers narrowed to 191 basis points - 12 bps tighter from seven-week highs hit on Wednesday.  Some of the political risk premium is now coming out - investors were worried about the chance of a party less friendly to the euro zone coming into power,  said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. In a note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they would assign around a 60 percent chance to an early ballot, with more clarity on timing by mid-July. Bank Plan State support for the two Veneto-based banks is not expected to have a significant impact on Italy's debt - which at over 130 percent of GDP is one of the highest in the euro zone. Analysts estimate the two banks account for just 1.5 percentage points each of overall Italian banking assets. Still, progress towards a rescue was viewed as positive, helping ease concern about a lack of progress in fixing a frail banking sector. Rome won a preliminary green light from Brussels earlier this month over its a proposed rescue of its fourth-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena.  I think it is positive as it reduces uncertainty and puts an end to this story,  said Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and chief economist at LC Macro Advisors.  What is probably negative is that other banks have been asked to assist, which clearly does not bode well for the overall sector.  The euro zone bank index was up 1 percent, while Italy's two biggest lenders, Intesa Sanpaolo UniCredit , also rose, reversing earlier weakness but still lagging gains in the broader banking sector. They were up 0.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively. Italy's blue chip FTSE MIB index was up 1 percent while Italian banks were 1.3 percent higher.

The ECB dropped a reference to further interest rate cuts, while repeating it expects rates to remain at record lows for an extended period and well beyond its asset purchase program. ECB Chief Mario Draghi said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying program. The euro, which weakened on Wednesday on reports that the ECB would cut its inflation forecasts, was down 0.36 percent to $1.1215, after dipping to a 1-week low of $1.1196.  Even though it was well telegraphed over the last 24 hours, the future expectations on inflation came in a bit lower than the market had been anticipating,  said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.  That sort of weighed on the euro.  The euro has risen against the dollar in the past five months, partly due to the greenback's weakness, but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018. Traders in the currency market will closely monitor U.S. Senate testimony by Comey, worried this could dampen already flagging momentum for President Donald Trump's agenda of rolling back regulation and overhauling the tax code. In written testimony released on Wednesday, Comey, who was abruptly fired by Trump in May, said Trump had asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  The market has been well briefed ahead of the testimony but it really depends on what he may be asked and what his answers will be,  said Popplewell. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.3 percent at 97.039. Against the yen, the greenback was up 0.48 percent to 110.32 yen. Meanwhile sterling was down 0.35 at $1.2913.

Alabbar said the board of directors was discussing distributing 100 percent of funds from the sale of up to 30 percent of the shares of the real estate development business to shareholders of Emaar Properties. The company floated Emaar Malls in 2014, valuing the business at 37.7 billion dirhams ($10.27 billion). When asked by the channel if the valuation was close to the value of Emaar Malls, Alabbar said he expected the numbers to be close.

Eurostat said the 19-country euro zone expanded by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.9 percent year-on-year. That compared with earlier estimates of 0.5 and 1.7 percent respectively. The higher figure resulted from revisions for France and Italy, with domestic demand the overall driver, particularly investment. Gross fixed capital formation was 1.3 percent higher in the quarter and up 6.0 percent year-on-year. On an annualized basis, the euro zone economy was expanding at a rate of 2.3 percent in the Jan-March period, far outstripping the 1.2 percent rate of the United States. Capital Economics said that purchasing manager surveys pointed to a potential pick-up to 0.7 percent growth in the second quarter. The first quarter growth rate was the highest since the first three months of 2015, when the ECB first began printing money to boost inflation and stimulate growth. Customers stand next to shopping trolleys as they shop in a Carrefour hypermarket in Nice, France, April 6, 2016.Eric Gaillard/File PhotoSolid economic growth but subdued inflation has left the ECB in a quandary. ECB President Mario Draghi is yet to be convinced that a recent rebound of inflation is durable because wage growth remains sluggish. The ECB left its aggressive stimulus unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying program and sub-zero interest rates, despite resistance from cash-rich Germany. However, it did close the door to further rate cuts. Eurostat said gross fixed capital formation contributed 0.3 percentage points, household consumption 0.2 points and government consumption 0.1 points to the first-quarter growth figure. The contributions of external trade and inventories was neutral.

The vast oil sands deposits in northern Alberta are home to the world's third-largest crude reserves but also carry some of the highest production costs globally. There has been an exodus of international oil companies that this year alone have sold off around $22.5 billion in oil sands assets to Canadian producers, stoking concerns the future development of the resource could stall. Speaking on the fourth day of a five-day trip to China, Carr said the government's  minds are open  with regard to Chinese investment.  We think there are opportunities and we laid out, along with experts from industry, what we believe to be opportunities for them,  Carr told reporters on a conference call.  We would welcome investment from any nation that's interested in the oil sands. The trend of capital flows over the last little while has been international investors have been looking at their opportunities and decided to spread their resources, whereas Canadian investors have stepped up.  The previous Canadian government under Conservative Stephen Harper had a policy of limiting control of the oil sands by state-owned companies, such as China's CNOOC.

The Maersk Invincible rig, which is operating at the Valhall field in the North Sea, is connected with a 500-metre long cable to the field's Valhall platform which is in turn powered by a 294-kilometre long subsea cable linked to Norway's shore.  To our knowledge, this is the first one,  said a company spokesman, citing data provided by the rig's owner, Denmark's Maersk, and other sources. Some oil and gas platforms off Norway already receive some power from land, such as Statoil's Troll A gas platform and Aker BP's Valhall. Statoil's giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield under development will also be powered from land. But this is the first drilling rig to get all its power from land, rather than from gas turbines on board the rig. Aker BP calculations show the Maersk Invincible, which will drill for oil and gas at the field, will reduce its annual carbon dioxide emissions by 15,200 tonnes and emissions of nitrogen oxide, another greenhouse gas, by 168 tonnes.  Electricity in Norway is 100 percent produced from renewables, mostly hydropower. Aker BP has received 42 million crowns ($4.95 million) from a Norwegian fund to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The spokesman declined to comment on the total cost of the project. Maersk Invincible, a rig built in 2016 and able to drill in depths of up to 12,000 meters, is expected to plug a total of 18 wells in Valhall over the coming years.

The euro        declined after the European Central Bank cut its forecasts for inflation and said that policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying programme.                               A weaker euro versus the dollar erodes the buying power of euro zone investors for gold, which is priced in the U.S. currency.     Spot gold        was down 0.9 percent at $1,275.06 an ounce at 1355 GMT. U.S. gold futures         for August delivery shed 1.2 percent to $1,277.40.     Investors were awaiting British election results and Comey's testimony, which will turn the spotlight on a clash between him and U.S. President Donald Trump.                                    Those and other uncertainties are providing support to gold, which is likely to resume its rally eventually, even if its correction lower extends in the short term, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.      It's quite natural that we see markets taper off some of the recent gains,  he said.  The sentiment on the market at the moment is that gold is a 'buy on dips'. The question is whether we'll see a dip of any size once there's more clarity following today's events.      Hansen advised buying if gold declined to key short-term support at $1,265.      UBS strategist Joni Teves agreed that a growing list of global uncertainties along with macro forces are expected to push gold higher, so any dips would be an opportunity to build or add to positions.       We think that investor allocations to gold remain small compared with other assets. An extension of gold's gains up ahead raises the risk that many would have to play catch-up,  she said in a note.      In other precious metals, palladium        climbed 1.9 percent to $849.75 an ounce. In the previous session it hit its highest in nearly three years but shed its early gains to end 2.3 percent lower.          Commerzbank technical analyst Karen Jones advised bullish investors to be wary of the palladium market.      It will shortly encounter the 16-year resistance line at $867/68 and, with a 13 count on the daily chart, we would tighten up stops (on long positions) considerably,  she said in a note.     Platinum        fell 0.9 percent to $933.24 while silver        lost 1 percent to $17.37.

The issue ratings on Ethiopia's senior unsecured foreign-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'B'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'B' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'B'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Ethiopia's rating at 'B' is weighed down by low development indicators, significant external imbalances and rapidly increasing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) debt. These weaknesses are offset by low and mostly concessional general government (GG) debt and a track record of robust economic growth. Ethiopia's structural features remain a major credit weakness, with human and economic indicators ranking among the lowest of Fitch-rated sovereigns. At USD1,500, Ethiopia's purchasing power parity gross national income is well below the 'B' median of USD7,720. The long-standing challenges raised by low governance indicators are underscored by the bout of social unrest experienced in 2016, particularly in the populous regions of Oromia and Amhara. The political situation has returned to calm in 2017. The prolongation of the State of Emergency that was proclaimed in October 2016 for the first time in two decades illustrates the persistence of significant underlying tensions, despite the relaxation of some of its provisions. A relapse in political and security conditions, which is not Fitch's baseline scenario, remains a risk over the medium term, and could hamper growth and discourage foreign investments. Ethiopia's average GDP growth in 2012-16 was 9.5%, much higher than the 'B' category median of 3.9%. GDP growth has been little impacted by two severe drought episodes in 2016-2017, reflecting an improvement in macroeconomic stability. This is attributable to a more efficient crisis management framework, higher agricultural productivity and lower dependence on agriculture due to the solid expansion in construction and to a lesser extent, services. Consequently, GDP growth slowed only moderately to 8% in FY16 (ending 7 July 2016) and has recovered to 10% in FY17, according to authorities' estimates. Inflation has also remained contained below 8%. Lifted by high public investment aiming at bridging wide infrastructure gaps and a gradual pick-up in manufacturing, growth is expected to average around 8% over the next three years, below the 11% target set in the authorities' Growth and Transformation Plan II (GTP II) but still much higher than peers. General government finances remain sound. The GG deficit increased slightly to 2.8% of GDP in FY16, below the peer group median of 4.2%. We expect it to remain below the authorities' self-imposed threshold of 3% over the medium term. At 27% of GDP in FY17, GG debt is less than half the 'B' category median of 56.4%. However, taking into account the liabilities of SOEs, public debt is estimated at 57.9% of GDP in FY17, close to the 'B' median for general government debt. As SOEs implemented much of the massive public investment programme, their debt has increased by 12 percentage points of GDP over five years, reaching 31% of GDP in FY17 according to Fitch's estimates, and generating a substantial contingent liability for the sovereign. Fitch expects the aggregate debt of the public sector including SOEs to stabilise over the next three years, due to sustained GDP growth, moderate deficits and a low debt service cost. This forecast also reflects a gradual moderation in capital expenditures, as no additional major infrastructure investments are being considered by the authorities prior to the completion of the ongoing projects. The authorities' intention to limit the additional take-up of non-concessional external loans, in line with the recommendations formulated by the IMF, should also act as a brake on debt accumulation. External metrics are a rating weakness, with persistent high current account deficits (CAD), low international reserve coverage and a currency that is 20%-40% over-valued according to IMF estimates. The CAD narrowed to 8.4% of GDP in FY16 due to higher private transfers, but it remained much higher than the 'B' category median of 5.7%. Fitch expects it to widen to more than 10% of GDP in FY17 due to steady growth in capital goods imports, higher energy prices, a normalisation of transfers and weak export performance. The value of exports has merely stagnated in FY17, despite a partial recovery in USD commodity prices, reflecting a challenging external environment and persistent impediments to cost and non-cost competitiveness. Fitch expects the CAD to narrow only moderately to 7% of GDP by FY19, remaining wide due to a persistent saving-investment imbalance generated by high expenditures on infrastructure coupled with a narrow export base. Exports are expected to pick up gradually, as the country starts to reap the benefits of past investments in export-oriented light industries and infrastructure. In particular, major industrial projects (Hawassa and Bole-Lemi II industrial parks) should reach full production over the next two years, bolstering manufacturing capacity. The Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway connection should reach full capacity over the next year, reducing trade costs. However, risks to export performance remain high as exports are still concentrated in agricultural commodities and hence susceptible to ephemeral market vagaries and weather hazards with the probability of extreme events rising due to climate change. Ethiopia has managed to attract a steady stream of FDI averaging 3% of GDP during the last five years. However, CAD has been mainly financed by debt, with public sector external liabilities including SOEs tripling between FY10 and FY16. In particular, the external debt of SOEs has increased more than ninefold. Barring a significant acceleration in exports, meeting the current investment targets of GTP II, set above 40% of GDP per year over FY18-FY20, risks undermining external sustainability by further raising net external debt. At a low level of two months of current account payments, reserves offer little protection should external liquidity dry up. The risk of forced external deleveraging is low at the current juncture, owing to the closure of the capital account and the high proportion of concessional debt in total external liabilities. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Ethiopia a score equivalent to a rating of 'BB-' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Public finances: -1 notch, to reflect the significant indebtedness of SOEs which is not reflected in the model and represents a significant contingent liability to the sovereign. - Macroeconomic performance: -1, as Fitch estimates that Ethiopia's massive public investment which is lifting growth cannot be maintained over the medium term, due to the attendant risks to external sustainability. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action, are: - Rising external vulnerability, illustrated by a persistence of a wide CAD with a failure of export growth to accelerate. - Sizable increase in government indebtedness or a materialisation of contingent liabilities from SOEs on the government's balance sheet. - Political instability, particularly if it leads to macroeconomic spillovers such as disruptions to donor inflows and/or FDI, lower growth or fiscal slippages. The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action, are: - Stronger external indicators such as stronger exports, FDI and international reserves. - Further improvement in the macro-policy environment, leading to a transition to broader-based growth, with a solid expansion in the activity of the domestic private sector. - Further structural improvements, including stronger economic development and World Bank governance indicators.

The Maersk Invincible rig, which is operating at the Valhall field in the North Sea, is connected with a 500-metre long cable to the field's Valhall platform which is in turn powered by a 294-kilometre long subsea cable linked to Norway's shore.  To our knowledge, this is the first one,  said a company spokesman, citing data provided by the rig's owner, Denmark's Maersk, and other sources. Some oil and gas platforms off Norway already receive some power from land, such as Statoil's Troll A gas platform and Aker BP's Valhall. Statoil's giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield under development will also be powered from land. But this is the first drilling rig to get all its power from land, rather than from gas turbines on board the rig. Aker BP calculations show the Maersk Invincible, which will drill for oil and gas at the field, will reduce its annual carbon dioxide emissions by 15,200 tonnes and emissions of nitrogen oxide, another greenhouse gas, by 168 tonnes.  Electricity in Norway is 100 percent produced from renewables, mostly hydropower. Aker BP has received 42 million crowns ($4.95 million) from a Norwegian fund to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The spokesman declined to comment on the total cost of the project. Maersk Invincible, a rig built in 2016 and able to drill in depths of up to 12,000 meters, is expected to plug a total of 18 wells in Valhall over the coming years.

Sirius XM is negotiating a private investment in public equity (PIPE) after talks about Sirius XM acquiring Pandora in its entirety ended unsuccessfully over price disagreements, the sources said on Wednesday. If the negotiations between Sirius XM and Pandora come to fruition, the deal would come after private equity firm KKR & Co LP agreed last month to invest $150 million in Pandora. KKR's agreement gave Pandora a 30-day-period to look for an alternative deal. This period expires on Thursday, and so Sirius XM was racing late on Wednesday to beat that deadline and clinch its own investment in Pandora, the sources said. The terms of Sirius XM's proposed PIPE investment could not be learned, and sources cautioned that the latest negotiations between Sirius XM and Pandora could still fall apart. Liberty Media may also object to any deal, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Pandora declined to comment, while Sirius XM and Liberty Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Any partnership between Sirius XM and Pandora would be a boon to both companies, given that they target a common audience. Pandora is seeking to become more popular with drivers, many of whom subscribe to Sirius XM, while Sirius XM is looking to expand its internet and mobile presence.  A PIPE deal involves the sale of a company's shares in a private offering, as opposed to a public secondary offering. Pandora shares ended trading on Wednesday at $8.48, giving the company a market capitalization of around $2 billion.  Pandora's stock is down 30 percent in the last 12 months, as the company faces stiff competition from services such as Sweden's Spotify, Apple Inc's Apple Music, Alphabet Inc's Google Play Music and Amazon.com Inc's Music Unlimited, which dominate the on-demand music service market. KKR's $150 million investment gives it preferred Pandora stock that can be converted into common stock, cash, or a combination, at a conversion price of $13.50 per share. Pandora had been urged to explore a sale by Corvex Management LP, an activist hedge fund run by Keith Meister, a protégé of activist investor Carl Icahn. Corvex owned 8.6 percent of Pandora as of the end of March.  Reporting by Liana B.

S&P; cut its long-term rating of Qatar by one notch to AA- from AA and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there was a significant chance of a further downgrade. The rating agency said Qatar's economy would suffer from the decision on Monday of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha. They accused it of supporting terrorism, a charge that Qatar denies.  We expect that economic growth will slow, not just through reduced regional trade, but as corporate profitability is damaged because regional demand is cut off, investment is hampered, and investment confidence wanes,  S&P; said. Another major rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, assesses Qatar at Aa3, which is equal to S&P;'s new rating. Fitch Ratings puts Qatar at AA. The U.S. dollar was bid as high as 3.6526 riyals in the spot market on Wednesday, its highest level since July 2005, according to Thomson Reuters data. The riyal is pegged at 3.64 to the dollar by the central bank, which only allows small fluctuations around this level. In the offshore forwards market, which banks use to hedge against the risk of future moves in the spot rate, the riyal dropped as far as a 550-point premium against the dollar, its lowest level since December 2015, when tumbling oil and gas prices were raising doubts about the future of Gulf economies. A Saudi man shows Saudi riyal banknotes at a money exchange shop, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, January 20, 2016.Faisal Al Nasser/File PhotoThe low in the forwards market only implied the riyal would depreciate about 1.5 percent in the next 12 months. But it showed there were expectations of substantial outflows of money from Qatar in coming months. Qatar's stock index has tumbled 9.7 percent over the past three days, with high trading volumes suggesting some Gulf and international investors were bailing out of the market and sending their money home. Before this week's crisis, Gulf and international investors held only about 9 percent of Qatar's stock market, which had a capitalization of about $150 billion, bourse data showed. Even if all that foreign money flowed out, which is unlikely, it would probably not be enough to exert overwhelming pressure on the riyal to depreciate. Qatar remains one of the wealthiest countries per capita in the world, with an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund, and its liquefied natural gas exports are raking in a trade surplus of about $2.7 billion every month. These exports are expected to continue despite the sanctions. A Qatari central bank official told Reuters on Tuesday that the country had huge foreign reserves that it could use to support its currency if needed. Nevertheless, as S&P; noted, Qatar's banking system has in recent years become more dependent on loans and deposits from Gulf and international banks, and it could face a major outflow if that money is withdrawn because of diplomatic tensions. The foreign liabilities of Qatari banks ballooned to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015, central bank data shows.

In his second intervention in the row in as many days, Trump urged action against terrorism in a call with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, a White House statement said.  The President offered to help the parties resolve their differences, including through a meeting at the White House if necessary,  it said. Trump, in a later call with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, called for unity among Gulf Arabs  but never at the expense of eliminating funding for radical extremism or defeating terrorism,  the White House said. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday over long-standing allegations that Doha is courting Iran, which they deem the region's biggest external threat, and supporting Islamist groups, seen as the biggest internal danger.  The four countries also cut transport links to tiny gas-rich Qatar, disrupting food and other supplies and deepening uncertainty about the future of trade and investment ties. In a sign of economic damage from the dispute, Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday as the country's riyal currency fell to an 11-year low amid signs that portfolio investment funds were flowing out because of the rift. S&P; cut its long-term rating of Qatar by one notch to AA- from AA and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there was a significant chance of a further downgrade. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Reuters there would be more economic curbs on Qatar if necessary and said Doha needed to make ironclad commitments to change what critics say is a policy on funding Islamist militants. He later told France 24 television that any further steps could take the form of  a sort of embargo on Qatar . Regional Tensions  Reiterating comments by Gulf officials, Gargash told Reuters  there was no plan to seek a change in Qatar's leadership, only a change in its policies.

Iran blamed arch-foe Saudi Arabia for the attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State militant group. Riyadh denied any involvement.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Gulf states could resolve a row with Qatar among themselves without outside help.  We have not asked for mediation, we believe this issue can be dealt with among the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council,  he told a news conference with his German counterpart during a visit to Berlin that was broadcast on Saudi state television. Jubeir declined to confirm a list of 10 demands published by Al Jazeera, which included shutting down the Doha-based news channel, but added that Qatar knew what it needed to do to restore normal relations. Meanwhile Kuwait's ruler Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah continued a regional effort to mediate the crisis, shuttling from the UAE en route to Qatar on Wednesday evening, a Kuwaiti diplomat told Reuters. Passengers wait to have their luggage checked at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, June 7, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonBut efforts to defuse the worst crisis among Gulf Arabs for two decades showed no immediate progress. The UAE threatened anyone publishing expressions of sympathy toward Doha with up to 15 years in prison and barring entry to Qataris. Turkish Support Qatar has backed Islamist movements but vehemently denies supporting terrorism. It drew some support on Wednesday when   Turkey's parliament approved a draft bill allowing its troops to be deployed to a military base in Qatar. Turkish exporters have also pledged to provide food and water to Qatar if needed.  Trump's defense secretary, James Mattis, spoke to his Qatari counterpart to express commitment to the Gulf region's security. Qatar hosts 8,000 U.S. military personnel at al Udeid, the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East and a launchpad for U.S.-led strikes on Islamic State jihadists. The sudden isolation has spurred Qatar to hold talks with Turkey, Iran and others to secure food and water supplies, said a Qatari official. He said there were enough grain supplies for four weeks and Qatar also had large strategic food reserves. Slideshow (15 Images)Abu Dhabi port authorities in the UAE have eased curbs on non-Qatari oil tankers going to and from Qatar, according to industry sources and shipping circulars seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages are threatening to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG). UAE-based newspaper Gulf News and pan-Arab channel Al-Arabiya reported the crackdown on expressions of sympathy with Qatar.       Strict and firm action will be taken against anyone who shows sympathy or any form of bias toward Qatar, or against anyone who objects to the position of the United Arab Emirates, whether it be through the means of social media, or any type of written, visual or verbal form,  Gulf News quoted UAE Attorney-General Hamad Saif al-Shamsi as saying. On top of a possible jail term, offenders could also be hit with a fine of at least 500,000 dirhams ($136,000), the newspaper said, citing a statement to Arabic-language media. Slogans against and in support of Qatar have dominated Twitter in Arabic. Newspapers and television channels in the region have also been engaged in a war of words. Complexity UAE airlines Etihad and Emirates said all travellers holding Qatari passports were currently prohibited from traveling to or transiting through the emirates. They announced details of the restrictions after Australian carrier and Emirates partner Qantas Airways said it would not fly Qataris to Dubai because of the bans. Foreigners residing in Qatar in possession of a Qatari residence visa would also not be eligible for visas on arrival in the UAE, an Etihad spokesman said in an email.  Gargash, the UAE minister, told Reuters in an interview it would be very complex to disentangle the  very diverse  business ties between Qatar and its neighbors but suggested this might be necessary.  You cannot rule out further measures. We hope that cooler heads will prevail, that wiser heads will prevail and we will not get to that.   Tensions are still high and mediation efforts by fellow Gulf Cooperation Council state Kuwait have yet to lead to a concrete solution, so investors will likely remain on edge,  said one Dubai-based trader.

Following a banner 2016 driven by expectations that a key federal tax credit would expire at the end of that year, the utility-scale market is expected to drop to 8 gigawatts this year from more than 10 GW last year, according to a report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. The utility market, which accounts for about half of all solar systems, is expected to resume growth in 2019 as utilities seek to procure projects before the 30 percent federal tax credit for solar projects begins to step down in 2020. Prices on solar systems dropped further during the first quarter, falling below $1 per watt for the first time, the report said. Residential solar is expected to rise 2 percent for the year, well below the 19 percent growth it logged last year. California is experiencing a major decline in adoption of home installations that contributed to a 17 percent first-quarter drop in the nationwide market. The state accounted for 35 percent of the total U.S. market during the quarter, its lowest share since GTM began tracking the market in 2010.

The market for non-residential solar, which includes commercial and community solar installations, rose 30 percent in the first quarter thanks in part to a robust community solar market in Minnesota and growth in New York. GTM would revise its forecasts downward, it warned, if a petition by bankrupt solar manufacturer Suniva to implement a 78-cents-per-watt floor on solar module pricing is approved by the U.S. International Trade Commission. U.S. module prices were around 40 cents a watt in the first quarter. Suniva filed a rare Section 201 petition with the ITC last month, seeking new duties on imported solar products to combat a global oversupply of panels that has depressed prices. If successful, the petition would put solar system costs at 2015 levels, according to GTM.

The ECB was expected to take a more cautious stance as the inflation rebound has yet to show a convincing upward trend.  The bias is towards higher rates globally over a long-term period and whether the central banks raise rates today or six months from now, I don't think it's going to change things much,  said Mike Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. Comey will be grilled by Washington politicians over his claims that Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Comey's written testimony on Thursday did not spring a surprise, easing concerns that any new revelation could have dampened already flagging momentum for U.S. President Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  Comey might move the markets in the short term but I don't think it's going to affect the intrinsic values of what many large U.S. businesses are worth,  said Mattioli.  While today's events may seem newsworthy in the short-term, I don't think it's going to move the needle for global economies.

But for the country's steelmakers the $50 billion construction project presents a valuable sales opportunity.  Russian steel producers have suffered over the last two years as global steel prices plumbed 11-year lows and a prolonged economic downturn derailed construction and infrastructure projects, which account for 80 percent of domestic demand. For market leader NLMK (NLMK.MM) and competitors such as Severstal (CHMF.MM), the Moscow government's plan to build 20 million square meters of residential space over the next 15 years is now a chance to win new product sales in a weak market. Reuters calculations, based on estimated requirements of around 85 kilograms of steel per square meter of residential space provided by producers, analysts and traders, indicate the scheme will require between 1.5-2 million tonnes of crude steel. Russian steel demand totaled 40 million tonnes in 2016 and is seen increasing by up to 3.5 percent this year after three years of decline. Whilst comparatively small, the additional volumes in Moscow will provide an important boost to the recovering market, traders said.   Of course, the demand will help the market. But mostly in the long term,  said one trader who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.  In general figures, the Moscow renovation will return demand to pre-crisis levels.  The Moscow city government has said it plans to spend around 3 trillion rubles ($53 billion) on the resettlement program, which is intended to move people from aging Soviet-era buildings into modern apartments. But thousands of Muscovites have protested against the plans, with some living in buildings scheduled for demolition saying they do not want to move unless they have guarantees about where they will be resettled.      Moscow city government said it could not comment on the project's steel requirements or the prospects of individual companies as final plans were not yet confirmed and contracts would be awarded via a competitive tender process.    FILE PHOTO: An employee watches hot steel billets at the NLMK Kaluga steel mill in Vorsino outside Kaluga, Russia, July 21, 2016.Maxim Shemetov/File PhotoBars and Beams Kirill Chuyko, head of metals and mining research at BCS Investment Bank, said the new homes would create demand for so-called  long steel products , the reinforcing bars (rebar) and beams predominately used in building construction.   The best-positioned companies to take these orders, that's going to be NLMK and Severstal for sure.  he said.  NLMK is closest to Moscow and Severstal is also not that far away.  Slideshow (2 Images)Competitor MMK (MAGN.MM) also produces large amounts of long products but its plant site is in Magnitogorsk, an ex-Soviet industrial center 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) east of Moscow, means it will struggle to meet the orders, Chuyko said. In contrast, NLMK operates a mill specializing in steel products for the construction industry in the city of Kaluga, just 150 km (93 miles) south-west of the Russian capital.  To take part in all this, you need warehouses and logistics, which only NLMK has in Moscow,  the trader said. A company spokeswoman said the NLMK's plant in Kaluga was the leading producer of rebar in the area and could reroute supplies currently going to other regions if demand in Moscow increased on the back of the government's construction plans.  Severstal said its mills in Cherepovets and Balakovo, 390 km (242 miles) and 760 km (472 miles) from Moscow respectively, and its wide range of products would allow it to compete for the volumes.  Severstal has the strongest positions to become one of the major suppliers for the residential homes renovation program in Moscow,  the company told Reuters.

Once the energy and food prices are excluded, the ECB now sees inflation at 1.4 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019. This compares with the central bank's March projections of 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. For 2017, the ECB confirmed its previous core inflation forecast of 1.1 percent. Earlier on Thursday, the ECB had also lowered its headline inflation outlook to reflect a drop in oil prices, leaving it well below its target of almost 2 percent through 2019. The mixed outlook is likely to strengthen the case made by the ECB's more dovish rate-setters, who argue that price pressures in the euro zone are still too weak for the central bank to start preparing to unwind its stimulus.

No French man went past the fourth round at the French Open this year, with the country's top-ranked player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga going out in the first round to unheralded Argentine Renzo Olivo.  What the French men lacked to go further, it's grit,  Giudicelli told French radio RMC.   When a coach says that the player can spend eight hours on court when the temperature is 45 degrees Celsius and that he gets cramps in the fourth set, there's a problem,  said Giudicelli, referring to Lucas Pouille who lost against Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-2 3-6 5-7 6-2 6-1 in the third round.  Enough talking. We need to work according to the norms of modern tennis. It means having physical abilities very early and also working on the mental.  No French man has won a grand slam title since Yannick Noah lifted the French Open in 1983, something the so-called golden generation should have achieved, according to seven-time grand slam champion Mats Wilander.  It is disappointing, for sure,  Wilander, who is at Roland Garros commentating for Europsport, told Reuters last week.   If you look at those guys, (Jo-Wilfried) Tsonga, (Richard) Gasquet, (Gael) Monfils... look at their rankings... for no-one to get to the quarter-finals is really quite disappointing. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - 30/5/17 France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in action during his first round match against Argentina's Renzo Olivo Reuters / Christian Hartmann I think they have underperformed, really. And then who is coming next? Lucas Pouille, okay... but right now this kind of golden generation has not got much more time. This group is not going to be around forever.  You would have expected them to have maybe won a grand slam by now.  Slideshow (2 Images)The women have, however, fared better in Paris this year. Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia were both defeated in the quarter-finals -- the first time France had two women in the last eight since 1994.  If the women have succeeded, it's not by chance. They took another path because we discussed, we questioned some things,  said Giudicelli. Mary Pierce, the last French player to win the French Open in 2000, said the men should not be judged too harshly.  I don't really agree with what he said,  Pierce told Reuters, referring to Giudicelli's comments.  We have a lot of great French men tennis players but unfortunately they didn't do so well this year.  Tsonga lost early, but maybe with the new baby perhaps he's not had the chance to train as much as he wanted. They will be back next year. But we should focus on the positives and celebrate the achievements of Kristina and Caroline.

The government owns a 29.8 percent stake while Air France KLM has a 26.73 percent stake in the airline, which slumped into the red five years ago following a downturn in tourism after a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The airline has failed to record a pretax profit since then and the losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took on to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. The government has previously said it planned to convert its loans into equity but did not give an amount. The figure of $243 million was contained in a government paper submitted to parliament on Wednesday seeking approval for the overall deal. Kenya Airways warned in a statement on Thursday there was a risk of  significant  dilution of existing shareholders as it offers new equity in the restructuring exercise. The airline has said the financial restructuring will help dig it out of its negative equity position and get a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments. The restructuring is expected to reduce the airline's debt to about $1.2 billion from above $2 billion, the government said in its submission to parliament. Parliament's term ends next week ahead of an August election the deal will need to be approved quickly. The government is also seeking to guarantee $750 million worth of the company's current debt with international and local lenders as part of the restructuring. Some local creditors will convert some of their debt into equity too, a source at the airline said, without providing a figure of the amount. The restructuring is conditional on all creditors and shareholders agreeing to it, the government said in the document submitted to parliament.  There is a business case for a restructured Kenya Airways,  the government said, citing a study by an unidentified third party contracted to look into the issue. Kenya has spent billions of shillings upgrading the country's main airports and views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investment from abroad. Kenya Airways flies 12,000 passengers a day on its fleet of Boeing and Embraer planes. It cut its pretax loss in the year to the end of March and reported a modest operating profit as it carried a record number of passengers despite a smaller fleet.

The Bank of Canada will release its review of developments in the financial system at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT), followed by a news conference with Poloz at 11:15 a.m. EDT. Investors will weigh Poloz's assessment of the housing and mortgage markets in light of recent troubles at non-bank lender Home Capital.     New housing prices in Canada jumped 0.8 percent in April from March, the biggest gain in almost a year, Statistics Canada said. The data will undoubtedly fuel worries about a potential housing bubble in Vancouver and Toronto, where prices rose the most in 28 years.                  The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major currencies after the European Central Bank cut its forecasts for inflation, weighing on the euro.                  Gains for the greenback came ahead of testimony by former U.S. FBI Director James Comey to a Senate committee. Prepared testimony released on Wednesday was seen as containing few surprises.          Results of a parliamentary election in Britain are also due.     The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell to one-month lows after an unexpected surge in U.S. inventories and the return of more Nigerian crude aggravated investor concerns about an already oversupplied market.     U.S. crude        prices were down 0.77 percent to $45.37 a barrel.     At 9:25 a.m. EDT (1325 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3491 to the greenback, or 74.12 U.S. cents, up 0.1 percent.     The currency traded in a narrow range of C$1.3486 to C$1.3522.     In other domestic data, seasonally adjusted housing starts fell to 194,663 units in May from a revised 213,498 in April.     Canadian government bond prices were little changed across the yield curve, with the two-year            price flat to yield 0.715 percent and the 10-year             falling 1 Canadian cent to yield 1.41 percent.     On Tuesday, the 10-year yield hit its lowest intraday in nearly seven months at 1.373 percent.

The struggling commodities trader is trying to extend a separate US$2bn loan and find an investor to recapitalise the business and avoid a restructuring or bankruptcy after reporting a surprise quarterly loss of US$129.3m for January-March and saying that it will not be profitable for two years.  I’m fairly bearish on the whole thing, there are rumours that the company will file for Chapter 11 in the next couple of weeks,  a secondary loan trader said. Noble’s market value has shrunk to just over US$300m from US$6bn in February 2015, when it was hit by a brutal downturn in commodities prices. Its share price collapsed and credit ratings downgrades, management upheavals, asset writedowns, asset sales and a fundraising ensued. The secondary price of the US$1.1bn loan, which was put in place in May 2015, has been volatile this year. The credit was trading at around 75% of face value at the beginning of the year, rose to around 90 at the end of March, but has fallen heavily in the last month, two loan traders said.  There were a few trades at around 49 or 50, but the quotes are now lower in the 40s. It has fallen 45 points in the last month,  the secondary loan trader said. Some banks are now unable to sell as the price has dropped too low to get approval for a sale, a distressed loan trader said.  The company’s bonds have also collapsed to distressed levels. Noble and its lenders have appointed legal counsel as the company struggles to maintain access to the US$2bn loan while time runs out to find an investor. Noble Group has appointed financial restructuring adviser Moelis and law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which typically specialise in complex and aggressive debt restructuring situations, as well as Morgan Stanley.  Noble has appointed the most active and aggressive restructuring advisers. When they were mandated, the secondary loan price dropped. The view from the market was that if they were hiring those guys, things must be pretty bad,  the secondary loan trader said. Restructuring adviser Alvarez & Marshal and law firm Clifford Chance have been hired to advise Noble’s US lenders and Clifford Chance is acting for lenders in HK, Reuters reported. Pitches for the European lenders took place on Wednesday, with Deloitte, PwC and FTI all vying for the mandate, according to one restructuring adviser. Noble Group was not immediately available to comment. (Additional reporting by Sandrine Bradley; Editing by Christopher Mangham)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/noble-loan-idUSL8N1J53U0"},

Mason, who was born on the Caribbean island and won Olympic silver in the high jump for Britain in 2008, died in a motorcycle accident on April 20 and an emotional Bolt served as a pallbearer at his funeral in Kingston last month. There is likely to be plenty of feeling on display when Bolt steps onto the track at the city's National Stadium on Saturday for his last race on home soil - the 100 metres at the Racers Grand Prix - before his retirement later this year.  I know it's going to be a lot of emotions on the day because it's my last time,  the 30-year-old multiple Olympic and world champion told Reuters in a recent interview while working out at the gym.  I know the fans are going to miss it and I will miss it also because I know the energy is going to be good in the stadium so I'm looking forward to it.  I'm just trying to work and get into shape ... just trying to get fit and ready for the meet.  Bolt's place in the pantheon of track and field has attracted a stellar field to the National Stadium, where, a month shy of 15 years ago, he first signaled his talent by winning world junior gold in the 200 metres. As every sports fan knows, Bolt has risen to an unprecedented dominance of sprinting in the intervening decade and a half with eight Olympic titles and another 11 gold medals in the world championships.         Hard Work The Bolt phenomenon has always been as much about hard work as raw talent and charisma, however, and he admits the impact of Mason's death cut into preparations for his final season.   It was rough for me, you know. At the start it really took us by surprise and it kind of set me back a bit training-wise, because mentally I wasn't ready to even train for two weeks or two and a half weeks,  he said.  I had to take off and just try to collect myself. So I'm just actually working hard now to try and get back to where I was, but I'm confident in myself and in my coach that we can get it done because we have done it for years and years.  This year is no different, so it was tough, and I have to focus on what I need to do and I know my friend would want me to go out there and do my best as always and to be strong and to be focused on what needs to be done.   As the reigning world 100m and 200m champion from Beijing  two years ago, Bolt will be able to skip the June 22-25 Jamaican trials for the Aug. 5-13 world championships in London, where he will bring down the curtain on his career. For Bolt, after his experience at the 2012 Olympics in the British capital, the decision on where to hang up his spikes for good was a simple one.   There is no other place to do the last one because, as you saw, the Olympics in London was just out of this world,  he said.  The support and the energy in the stadium was just magnificent and I know it will be the same ...   The energy that's going to be there is just going to be brilliant and it's definitely going to be emotional for me because it's my last one and so many Jamaican fans will be there. But it is just to go out in all the glory I can.  Editing by Gene Cherry/Nick Mulvenney/Gareth Jones","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-bolt-idUSKBN18Z1UC"},

The number of CMC's active clients rose 5 percent to 60,082 in the year to end of March and Chief Executive Peter Cruddas said they had shown  complete ambivalence  to regulatory issues.  Clients just want to trade.... what clients are telling us in they like trading, they understand the risks, they don't need leverage imposed upon them,  Cruddas told Reuters on Thursday. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in December it had found evidence of poor conduct across the market over the past six years and that people using the most popular product - known as a contract for difference - lost 2,200 pounds a year on average. It wants to cap the level of exposure that clients take on and impose other curbs. Shares in CMC and rivals IG Group and Plus500 fell heavily after the FCA intervention. CMC Chairman Simon Waugh said results for the year had been  somewhat overshadowed  by regulatory proposals. CMC, which listed on the London stock market last year, posted lower annual profit in the year to March 31 as reduced levels of volatility resulted in fewer trading opportunities for its clients. However, a pick up in activity around the U.S presidential elections in November and a strong end to the year helped it to beat expectations. Annual pretax profit fell 9 percent to 48.5 million pounds, ahead of consensus estimates of 45.5 million pounds.  We had a good finish to the month of March and so we've had a good beat on the income,  Grant Foley, chief operating and financial officer, told Reuters. CMC shares rose as much as 7.4 percent to 137.25 pence on Thursday. They remain well below the 240 pence price at which they were floated in February 2016. Cruddas, one of the City of London's most prominent Brexit supporters in last year's referendum, played down the impact of Britain's departure from the bloc.  When Britain exits the European Union, we don't see this as a major issue for us. We have a very strong German office, Spanish office, France office, we can easily hub out of one of those,  Cruddas said.

Those concerns, which have been stoked by an improving global economic backdrop, were somewhat allayed after BOJ and ECB officials downplayed such a move in the foreseeable future. BOJ Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata said earlier Thursday it would be tough for the central bank to release the scenarios on how it would withdraw its stimulus in the future. ECB President ECB Mario Draghi said policy normalization was not discussed at the central bank's latest meeting earlier Thursday, where it lowered its inflation forecast. On the other hand, ECB bumped up its growth estimates for Europe and removed a reference in its policy statement on further interest rate cuts. In the United States, the government reported a drop in first-time filings for jobless benefits last week, suggesting a further tightening in the domestic labor market despite a recent slowdown in hiring. Federal funds futures implied traders priced in about a 96 percent probability that the Federal Reserve would raise key short-term rates by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent at a policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday FFM7 FFN7, little changed from Wednesday's close, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. However, rate futures suggested traders were far more confident on a rate hike after next week as they speculated on when Fed policymakers would announce their plan to reduce the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Fed funds futures implied traders saw about a one-in-four chance of a rate increase to 1.25-1.50 percent at the Fed's September policy meeting and slightly above a 50 percent of a rate of such a move at its December meeting FFU7 FFZ&, CME's FedWatch showed.

It was not a matter of assessing the developments of solvency as such, but the liquidity issue,  Constancio told a press conference following the ECB's regular policy meeting.  Our role as ECB was just the declaration that the bank for liquidity reasons was failing or likely to fail,  he said. The ECB, the euro zone's top banking supervisor, stepped in to avert a collapse of Banco Popular, orchestrating a last-minute rescue on Wednesday by bigger local rival Santander (SAN.MC). A final decision to sell Popular was made early on Wednesday by the Single Resolution Board (SRB), the agency set up by the EU to wind down stricken banks. Constancio said that, legally, the ECB's competence in the Popular rescue was limited to declaring that the bank was  failing or likely to fail for liquidity reasons .  The matter after the declaration went to the Resolution Mechanism, to their board, to take the decisions about resolution,  he said.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A northern Nigerian state's governor on Wednesday ordered the arrest of activists for demanding the eviction of eastern Igbo people, amid rising tensions between ethnic groups that hark back to the country's Biafra civil war. Secessionist feeling has simmered in Nigeria's east since the Biafra separatist rebellion, a mainly Christian Igbo movement, tipped the country into a civil war from 1967 to 1970 that killed an estimated 1 million people. Since 2015, those sentiments have heightened, spurred by a lack of economic development and fears of Islamic encroachment, often blamed on the government of Muslim President Muhammadu Buhari. That has in turn sparked ill will toward secessionists, especially from northern Muslims.   All Igbos currently residing in any part of northern Nigeria are hereby served notice to relocate within three months and all northerners residing in the East are advised likewise,  a spokesman for a movement called the Northern Youth Groups said on Tuesday in the northern city of Kaduna.  He called for  sustained, coordinated campaigns  to remove Igbo people from the region. The Northern Youth Groups coalition is made up of  organizations who claim to promote the interests of the region. The widespread slaughter 51 years ago of Igbos living in Nigeria's north helped spur the Biafran secession from 1967-70, which led to war against Nigeria's central government and a famine in which millions died. Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai on Tuesday ordered the arrest of the signatories to the Northern Youth Group statement, condemning their  inciting  and  hate speech.  The Kaduna government  assures every resident of our state that their constitutional and human rights to live peacefully and own property wherever they choose is sacrosanct,  a spokesman for El-Rufai said in a statement. Nigeria has in recent years seen a rise in other ethno-religious conflicts, particularly deadly clashes between Muslim herders and Christian farmers, partly over land use, in the region known as the Middle Belt.

Two of the men had been marched a short way into the field, where one was apparently forced to kneel before being shot from behind. Prostrated beside him, the other man wore faded jeans. In his back pocket was an ID card: Qusay Mohammad, age 31.     The place they were found is in territory held by government forces around 20 km from the front line in Mosul, where Iraqi troops are fighting to dislodge Islamic State militants from the last pocket of territory they control. According to Human Rights Watch, which examined Reuters photographs from the scene, the evidence strongly suggests that the men were killed by forces affiliated with the Iraqi state, who are rounding up thousands of suspects as they capture territory from Islamic State fighters.  It is hard to come to any conclusion other than that they were in the custody of government forces when executed,  said Belkis Wille, Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch, judging by where the bodies were found and the fact they were blindfolded and bound. With the information on the ID in Qusay's pocket, Reuters was able to determine that he is on a government database of 90,000 men wanted across Iraq, including suspected Islamic State members. A senior officer in the National Security Service checked the list at Reuters request and found his name. All adult men emerging from territory held by the militants are screened against the database, and anyone on it is liable to be arrested. The ID also led Reuters to the village where Qusay spent most of his life, in the Shirqat district, around 50 kilometers south of the place he would die. The youngest of five brothers, Qusay dropped out of school and married his cousin Beida sometime after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the village became notorious as a stronghold for insurgents. Qusay stayed out of trouble, earning a living as a plasterer until Islamic State overran the area three years ago, according to his wife and eldest brother, Khalid. The fighters were welcomed by many in the village, including Qusay's uncles and cousins, who helped them impose their uncompromising rule. Qusay did not initially join the militants. But around four months after they took over Khalid heard his brother had enrolled in an Islamic State training course to earn money as a member of the group. He quit before completing it.  It was material need (that drove him), not revenge or religion,  Khalid told Reuters, adding that the other three brothers also fell in with the militants at some point but he himself had kept away. Qusay's wife, now 26 years old, denies he had any link with Islamic State. She says Qusay did his best to provide for their five young children by selling ice or fuel which he bought from filling stations and re-sold for a small margin.  Two of her own brothers were killed by the militants, she said. So how could her husband have joined them?    The bound hands of the body of a man are pictured in a field in south of Mosul, Iraq May 15, 2017. Picture taken May 15, 2017.Danish Siddiqui We All Cried but He Had to Go  As Iraqi forces began closing in on the village last summer, Qusay and three of his brothers joined hundreds of Islamic State members and their families retreating north towards Mosul, the biggest city in Islamic State's hands. Khalid, the only brother who stayed behind, said the others had left fearing Iraqi forces and government-backed militia would kill them because of their links to the militants, whether or not they actually supported the fighters.  Beida remained in the village with the children. Her husband told her  'Stay here and I will come back to you. I don't want you and the children to suffer with me,'  she recalled.  We all cried but he had to go.  He returned once in September to visit them during Eid al-Adha, the biggest holiday in the Muslim calendar.  We ate together and enjoyed ourselves... but he left the same day and we were sad again,  Beida said. They never saw him again. Soon after, Iraqi forces recaptured their village, which meant a frontline now separated Qusay from his family. In October, government troops launched their assault on Mosul, a fierce urban battle which has continued ever since.    Beida kept in touch with Qusay by phone until a local Sunni militia banished her and the children to a camp for relatives of Islamic State militants, which Human Rights Watch has described as an  open-air prison . Mobile phones are banned there for security reasons, so she lost contact with Qusay. But she heard that he and his three brothers tried to escape Mosul last month among thousands of civilians fleeing the government advance on Islamic State.     Who captured him is difficult to verify. A range of different forces -- from official police and military units to dozens of government-backed militias -- are involved in the war against Islamic State in Iraq. Any of them could have caught Qusay, or passed him on to others. A member of a local government-backed militia at a checkpoint along the road where the bodies were found said the men had been brought by  security forces  around three days earlier, but did not identify which. At some point, whoever was holding Qusay brought him and the others to where they were shot. A strip of cloth had been tied over his eyes. His hands were knotted behind his back with string. When Reuters reached the scene, maggots and wild dogs were feasting on the 15 bodies and the 40 degree heat had accelerated their decay. One wore a Barcelona football shirt. Some vehicles slowed down to look. Others sped past to avoid the sight. A hot breeze blew across the field. Last week, Beida and her children were finally allowed to leave the camp where they had been held for five months. In their absence, their home had been destroyed by a local militia, so she moved in with relatives in another nearby village. Reuters brought the news of her husband's fate.  We have nowhere to go,  she said, stroking the hair of one of her three sons asleep on the floor beside her.  How are we to blame?

The reasons that triggered that decision were related to the liquidity problems. There was a bank run. It was not a matter of assessing the developments of solvency as such, but the liquidity issue,  Constancio told a press conference following the ECB's regular policy meeting.  Our role as ECB was just the declaration that the bank for liquidity reasons was failing or likely to fail,  he said. The ECB, the euro zone's top banking supervisor, stepped in to avert a collapse of Banco Popular, orchestrating a last-minute rescue on Wednesday by bigger local rival Santander (SAN.MC). A final decision to sell Popular was made early on Wednesday by the Single Resolution Board (SRB), the agency set up by the EU to wind down stricken banks. Constancio said that, legally, the ECB's competence in the Popular rescue was limited to declaring that the bank was  failing or likely to fail for liquidity reasons .  The matter after the declaration went to the Resolution Mechanism, to their board, to take the decisions about resolution,  he said.  So after the declaration of 'failing or likely to fail', we had no interference with the subsequent decisions. They belonged completely to the SRB.

The move follows criticism by activists who said it could fan hatred and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. The contest had originally required participants to submit video clips for one of three categories: sexual and reproductive health, cybersex and  gender identity disorder.  Its guidelines added that the videos must include elements showing the  consequences  of being LGBT, as well as how to  prevent, control and ways to seek help  for them. Malaysian deputy director-general of health Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said in a statement that the offending category had been replaced with  gender and sexuality.  The decision was made following a meeting between ministry officials with the Malaysian AIDS Council, experts, and representatives of  key population groups,  Lokman said.  This meeting successfully cleared the misunderstandings and collectively improvements were made to the competition guideline,  he said. Lokman had earlier defended the contest categories, saying the topics were chosen as statistics showed an increase in sexual and reproductive health problems among teens, including higher rates of sexual activity and a rise in HIV transmission. On Wednesday, he said the purpose of the contest was  not to single out or to discriminate  against the LGBT community, but to explore views among teens and identify gaps in health services. Transgender activist Nisha Ayub, who had raised concerns over the video contest, welcomed the ministry's rethink.  We have to create a safe space for discussions and raise awareness. I hope this kind of engagement with officials will continue at other government agencies,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Activists say intolerance of LGBT people has spiked in recent years in Malaysia, a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian country that is majority Muslim. In March, the Walt Disney film  Beauty and the Beast  was briefly barred from screening in Malaysia, after the company refused to remove  a gay moment  from the film at the request of Malaysian authorities.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/malaysia-lgbt-idUSL1N1J50NK"},

Other mines in the area, owned by Antofagasta , BHP Billiton, and Poland's KGHM , also reported disruptions.

The commission's choice needs to be endorsed by the wider parliament in a vote on a later date. If approved, Santoso would begin his five-year term in July. Santoso, who has been president commissioner of state-controlled Bank Mandiri since 2015, was previously a career central banker. His last position with Bank Indonesia was as the head of its New York branch before he moved to the International Monetary Fund to become the executive director of the Southeast Asia voting group. The current head of the Financial Services Authority (OJK) is Muliaman Hadad, who has been leading the agency since it was formed in 2012. Indonesia's finance industry is estimated to be worth $1.2 trillion. The country has Southeast Asia's largest economy. During his fit and proper test on Monday, Santoso said he would direct the OJK's policies to promote economic growth and equality by using technology.

Zambia At 0700 GMT on Thursday, commercial banks quoted the kwacha at 9.2500 per dollar, marginally stronger than 9.3000 a week ago.  The local unit is expected to remain buoyant as the supply of the green currency continues to improve on the market,  the Zambian branch of South Africa's First National Bank said. Ghana Ghana's cedi could remain under pressure next week as weekly dollar sales by the central bank proves to be insufficient to meet a surge in offshore demand, traders said. The unit was trading at 4.4200 per dollar by mid-morning on Thursday, compared with 4.3275 a week ago.  The cedi could come under pressure if there's no substantial support from the central bank within the week as businesses would prefer to buy and hold to guard against further depreciation of the cedi,  analyst Joseph Biggles Amponsah of Accra-based Dortis Research said. Nigeria The Nigerian naira is seen trading within the prevailing band in coming days at both the official interbank window and black market after the central bank regular intervention policy impacted positively on dollar liquidity in the market. The local currency was quoted at 368 per dollar on the black market on Thursday, against 382/dollar last week, while it trading around 305.60 to the dollar on official interbank window.  Speculators have been successfully chased out of the market with the gradual convergence in rate and improved dollar liquidity in the market,  said Aminu Gwadabe, president of the Association of Bureau de Change operators. Kenya The Kenyan shilling is seen trading in a narrow range with hard currency inflows from charities and export earnings matching oil importer demand, traders said. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.25/45 per dollar, the same as last Wednesday's close. Markets were closed on Thursday for a Kenyan public holiday.  We're likely to see some cagey movement ... some support from charities,  said a trader from a commercial bank. Tanzania The Tanzanian shilling is expected to hold steady in the coming days as market players await the outcome of the debate on the 2017/18 fiscal year budget proposals in parliament. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,235/2,245 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 2,238/2,243 a week ago. Uganda The Ugandan shilling is seen trading rangebound as investors try to figure out the implications of key announcements like the government's planned borrowing in the next fiscal year budget, traders said. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,585/3,595, stronger than last Thursday's close of 3,590/3,600.

The lower inflation outlook suggested that the ECB will likely keep its stimulus program for now even though growth projections for the region were revised higher. The ECB now expects inflation of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.3 percent in 2018, compared with its forecasts of 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively in March. That is still well below its target of just under 2 percent. Further pushing yields lower was a remark by ECB President Mario Draghi, who said reducing the central bank's stimulus plan for the region was not discussed at the meeting.

Ireland's economy has grown faster than any other in the European Union for the past three years, but the centre-right ruling Fine Gael party was punished in an election last year by voters who felt they were not feeling the benefits. The country has been hit by a string of strikes by public sector workers in the past two years after relative industrial peace during the country's 2010-2013 bailout. The deal will restore 90 percent of public sector workers to the pay rates they enjoyed before cuts imposed during the country's financial crisis, and see benefits increased by between 6 and 7 percent over the period. The deal, which must be approved by union members, will  put pension provision on a more sustainable footing and secure industrial peace,  Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said in a statement. It will cost 887 million euros ($995.13 million) over the three years, he said. The 178 million euros of additional expenditure in 2018 will use up a significant amount of the estimated 500-550 million euros of resources the finance minister has said will be available for expenditure increases and tax cuts, although it will likely take up a much smaller percentage in 2019 and 2020.

Salman Abedi's brother Hashem also said he had bought equipment for the attack in Britain, though he did not know where it would be carried out, Ahmed Bin Salem, a spokesman for Tripoli's Special Deterrence Force (Rada), told Reuters. Rada is a counter-terrorism force aligned with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. It detained Salman Abedi's father, Ramadan, and his younger brother, Hashem, in the days after the attack, and has been questioning them and other members of the family.   Hashem said that he and Salman got the ideology of Daesh (Islamic State) in Manchester in 2015 from the internet and some friends in the U.K.,  said Bin Salem.  He added that they used to watch videos and had sympathy for children in Syria and wanted to do something for Daesh to help.  Salman and Hashem flew to Libya on April 18, Bin Salem said. Salman traveled back to Manchester about a week before the attack, after telling his parents he was going on pilgrimage to Mecca.  Hashem said that he bought all the necessary things for Salman for the attack from the U.K and added that Salman was planning to carry out an attack but he did not know where,  Bin Salem said.  He said Salman Abedi also phoned Tripoli on May 15 before carrying out the attack to  say goodbye to his family before the attack . Plea for Forgiveness  Salman phoned Hashem's phone on the day of the attack to talk with his family. The mother had refused to talk with him because they were angry with him as he lied,  Bin Salem said.  Hashem knew about the attack and convinced his mother to talk to him … he said 'please, please mum, talk to him'. (The mother) said during the investigation that he asked for forgiveness from her and she could not understand why.   It was not possible to access the Abedis or verify under what conditions they had been questioned and whether they were offered any legal representation. British consular officials have been granted access by Rada.   The suicide bombing killed 22 children and adults attending a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande. A total of 21 people have been arrested so far in the investigation into the attack. Twelve were released without charge and nine remain in custody. Rada had previously said that Hashem had been plotting an attack in Tripoli, though Bin Salem said he could not give details for security reasons. He said Hashem had told investigators he had spent time in Germany working as a driver between December last year and his return to Tripoli in April. The mother told Rada that Salman was  an introvert, an anti-social person , and that video games had had a bad influence on both Salman and Hashem when they were young, according to Bin Salem. She said Ramadan Abedi, who moved to Britain during the rule of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and returned to Libya during the country's 2011 revolution, had taken both sons to the frontline for one day that year. Bin Salem said the father did not currently face any charges, but Rada were seeking more information on him, including possible links to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), a militant Islamist organization formed by Libyans who traveled to Afghanistan in the 1980s.  Ramadan Abedi told Reuters last month just before his arrest that he praised the LIFG but did not belong to the group.

The currency bloc's economy has been on its best run since the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago but the ECB was expected to take a more cautious stance as the inflation rebound has yet to show a convincing upward trend.  The bias is towards higher rates globally over a long-term period and whether the central banks raise rates today or six months from now, I don't think it's going to change things much,  said Mike Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. Comey will be grilled by Washington politicians later over his claims that Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Comey's written testimony on Thursday did not spring a surprise, easing concerns that any new revelation could have dampened already flagging momentum for U.S. President Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  Comey might move the markets in the short term but I don't think it's going to affect the intrinsic values of what many large U.S. businesses are worth,  said Mattioli.  While today's events may seem newsworthy in the short-term, I don't think it's going to be needle moving for global economies.

Arvind Subramanian, the finance ministry's chief economic adviser, suggested Indian could lead a coalition of countries with open economies to promote free trade.   We, in India, now have a much bigger growing stake in ensuring that the world markets remain open, that we continue to see globalization,  Subramanian told a conference on the  world's 20 biggest economies (G20).  A coalition of middle-income countries led by India or at least where India is taking charge, would be something we should seriously explore.  The proposal comes as frustration with persistently low growth, stagnant wages and diminishing job security has sparked opposition in Europe and the United States to free movement of capital, goods and services, which critics blame for eroding incomes and worsening inequality. Those worries prompted U.S. President Donald Trump last week to pull the United States out of the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change. Across the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected  untrammelled free markets  and plans to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands. Free trade and investment in the 1990s and 2000s triggered an unprecedented boom in the global economy, leading to rapid increases in per capita income and reductions in poverty. India, for example, saw average annual gross domestic product growth of 8.2 percent between 2003-2011, buoyed by 20-25 percent annual growth in exports. A slump in export markets since then has brought average growth down below 7 percent. Asia's third-largest economy needs to expand by at least 8 percent a year for the next decade to create jobs for its burgeoning workforce.  But to realize its growth ambitions, India estimates goods and services exports would have to rise 15 percent a year. Subramanian said India would have to demonstrate a commitment to open markets and do more to liberalize trade and investment without worrying about the costs.  We are now an important player ... we cannot say the burden of keeping it open rests exclusively with others,  he said.  Wielding power and influence entails responsibility.

The attackers raided Iran's parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum on Wednesday morning, in a rare strike at the heart of the Islamic Republic. Authorities said the death count had risen to 17 and scores were wounded.   Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards have also said regional rival Saudi Arabia was involved, fuelling tensions between Sunni Muslim power Riyadh and Shi'ite power Tehran as they vie for influence in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia dismissed the accusation. Iran's intelligence ministry said on Thursday five of attackers who died in the assault had been identified as Iranians who had joined the hardline Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State on their main battlegrounds in Iraq and Syria.  They earlier left Iran and were involved in the crimes of the terrorist group in Raqqa and Mosul,  the ministry said, referring to Islamic State's effective capital in Syria and a city it captured in Iraq.  Last year, they returned to Iran ... to carry out terrorist attacks in the holy cities of Iran,  the ministry added in a statement on state news agency IRNA. The attacks were the first claimed by Islamic State inside tightly controlled Iran, one of the powers leading the fight against the militants in Iraq and Syria. Two Sunni militant groups, Jaish al-Adl and Jundallah, have been also waging an insurgency in Iran, mostly in remote areas, for almost a decade. Arrests Iran's intelligence ministry said earlier on Thursday it had arrested more suspects linked to the attacks, on top of six Iranians, including one woman, detained on Wednesday. The semi-official Tasnim news agency said on of the wounded people had died in hospital, bringing the death toll to 17. Two of the victims were women, it added, citing official figures. Security camera footage aired on state TV showed people running and seeking cover as the gunmen strode through parliament's halls, firing their weapons and hitting at least one person.  Iranians, contacted by Reuters, said there was a heavy police presence, particularly in the capital's busy squares.  It feels safe to see police everywhere. Also there are plainclothes officers in shopping centers,  said Mohammadali Rastgou, a shopkeeper in northern Tehran's Tajrish square. State TV also showed pictures of ammunition, rifles and binoculars laid out next to an Islamic State flag, all, it said, taken from the attackers.   We have seen worse than this. Iranians will not be intimidated by such attacks. Our country is the safest place in the region,  a middle-age man told state TV. Other members of the public accused Saudi Arabia and Iran's long-time foe, the United States, of backing the attacks. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was praying for the victims, but added that  states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.  Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed what he called the  repugnant White House statement .  Iranian people reject such U.S. claims of friendship,  he added on Twitter.

The 41-year-old nurse contracted the disease in December 2014 at the height of an Ebola epidemic which swept through three countries in West Africa and killed more than 11,300 people. Cafferkey, who now works as a nurse in Scotland, returned to Sierra Leone last month, for the first time since being infected, to meet Ebola survivors and orphans - some of whom she treated - and raise funds for the British charity Street Child.  What was emotional was meeting Ebola survivors and orphans and seeing how they don't have the luxury of moving on,  Cafferkey told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.  The psychological impact is something no-one talks about but it is so clearly evident ... people are by no means over Ebola as it has clearly left an immense scar (on Sierra Leone).  Cafferkey completed a 10 km (6.2 mile) run last month as part of an annual marathon in Sierra Leone organized by Street Child to raise money for children hit hardest by Ebola.  Some 12,000 children were orphaned in Sierra Leone by the virus, 1,400 of whom need urgent support, Street Child said.  Thousands of Ebola orphans ... are desperately struggling,  Tom Dannatt, head of Street Child, said in a statement.  They may have a roof over their heads but they are last in the line for food and school - especially if they are a girl,  he added. The world's worst Ebola outbreak, which was declared over last year, killed at least 11,300 people and infected 28,600 as it swept through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea from 2013. The first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in Britain, Cafferkey suffered life-threatening complications from the deadly disease persisting in her brain, and has been readmitted to hospital several times with illness linked to the infection. She also faced disciplinary action over allegations she concealed her temperature on her return from Sierra Leone, but was cleared by a British nursing watchdog last September. Yet Cafferkey said returning to the country after what she called a tough couple of years had helped her to move on.   Before I went to Sierra Leone, I didn't know what to expect,  she said.  I'm glad I came back, it has been emotional but it has helped to give me closure.

Millstone is one of several nuclear plants in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest that could close before their licenses expire, industry analysts say. They have said weak power prices make it uneconomical to operate the reactors without some form of state support.  We were disappointed that the House chose inaction. We will continue assessing our investments in Connecticut while advocating for needed action,  Dominion spokesman Chet Wade said in a statement. On Wednesday morning, Connecticut's Senate passed a bill that could allow the state to buy power from the Millstone plant. However, that evening the House withdrew the measure hours before the legislative session ended. Connecticut is one of several states that have explored ways to boost their nuclear plants' revenues to keep them in service to preserve benefits they provide, including carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and energy diversification. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing before their licenses expire as cheap and abundant shale gas has cut power prices over the past several years. Other generators with mostly gas-fired plants, like NRG Energy Inc, Dynegy Inc and Calpine Corp, are challenging those New York and Illinois rules in federal court. Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey are considering adopting similar rules to protect their reactors.

The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000,  the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,  said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years.  Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and  fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make , he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes.   I have no idea how we're going to do that,  Sinnett said.  But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms.  Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the  Miracle on the Hudson,  Sinnett said.  If it can't, then we can't go there.  A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing.   This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'  he said, referring to rival Airbus.  It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?

Tensions had been building for days between Qatar and its powerful Gulf Arab neighbors and Mohanadi feared Saudi's closure of Qatar's only land border on Monday could lead to price hikes and food shortages in the import-dependent country.  I bought lots of vegetables, frozen chicken and milk for my children, things I knew would be the first to disappear from the shelves,  said Mohanadi, a former army lieutenant from Qatar's city of Al Khor. He said he wanted to be prepared but did not feel panic. Hours later supermarkets in Doha visited by a Reuters reporter had almost run out of dairy products as scores of people waited in checkout lines and stocked up on beans and other staples. The rift has provoked confusion and anxiety in Qatar, an energy, banking and construction hub, which is home to 2.7 million people -- most of them foreigners. Some Qataris were outraged by the state of affairs. Authorities tried to calm nerves on Wednesday, releasing a video showing a shop with shelves brimming with food and reassuring Qataris - the wealthiest people in the world per capita - that their quality of life would not be hit. But the row over Qatar's alleged support for Islamist groups has disrupted many aspects of life. Thousands of Qataris have been unable to board flights to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and cut off from relatives in those countries, in a region where cross-border marriages are common and Gulf rulers refer to each other as  brothers . Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and several other countries severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-foe Iran - charges Qatar says are baseless. Qatar Isolated In further signs of Qatar's isolation on Thursday, the United Arab Emirates' national postal group said it had suspended all services to Qatar and the UAE aviation authority said it had closed air space for traffic to and from Doha.  My mother who is originally from the UAE cannot visit her sick mother, needless to say we will not be able to see my uncles,  said Mohammed, a Qatar University professor, who gave his first name only. He said a Saudi friend of his living in Qatar had sent his child to Riyadh for a family visit before the embargo and now he does not know what to do. Qatari students in the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been told to leave before finishing exams, he said. Workers stand next to food items in a shopping mall in Doha, Qatar, June 8, 2017.Stringer The issue is presented to the West as a diplomatic spat ... the reality is far worse,  a Qatari diplomat said.  It is a blockade! Like that of Berlin. A declaration of war. A political, economic and social aggression.  Even if the dispute is settled, Qataris and other Gulf Arabs worry that the bitter spat which has seen both sides denounce each other as  enemies  and  traitors  of the Gulf has sown divisions and hostility that will linger on.  I think it is three things we are scared of: family ties being severed, possible military action and losing the spirit of the Gulf Cooperation Council,  said Mohammed, the professor, referring to the regional political and economic union set up in 1981. Slogans against and in support of Qatar in Arabic have dominated Twitter, which is hugely popular in the region, and have grown steadily more nationalistic and aggressive in tone. Slideshow (2 Images)Qatari Leader Silent The fact that Qatar's leader, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has yet to speak publicly since ties were cut, has made some Qataris uneasy. Kuwait's ruler, who is mediating in the crisis, asked him to postpone a speech to the nation earlier this week to give dialogue efforts a chance.  Of course we are all waiting for him to speak,  said Sara al-Sulaiti, a Qatari who works in public relations. Others say Sheikh Tamim's silence displays the tact U.S. President Donald Trump lacked when he posted a series of Tweets on Tuesday appearing to take sides against Qatar in the dispute.  The emir is wise not to speak,  said Faraj, a Qatari engineer working for a telecommunications company.  We know that he has a plan for us. Unlike in our neighboring countries we have deep faith in our leaders.  For low-income foreign laborers, the biggest concerns are possible food price rises and job cuts if projects are stalled because of construction materials being held up at the Saudi border. Qatar is home to more than a million migrant laborers from countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, many of whom for around 1,000 riyals ($275) a month toil on construction projects including football stadiums and a metro system being built for the 2022 World Cup.  I have never seen Qatari citizens stocking up on frozen chicken and long-life milks,  said Anup Manoj, an Indian man who works as a cleaner in Doha's City Center Mall, where many shops no longer stock milk packaged by Saudi Arabia's Almarai Co, the most affordable kind of milk in Qatar.  They have money to stock up. But when they stock up it's laborers and lower income workers who are going to suffer.

Dozens of complex robots are replacing humans for such mundane tasks as drilling and riveting, and Boeing is reordering some of its assembly steps to speed up the process. The savings, part of a long-term cost-cutting drive at the world's biggest plane maker that also includes substantial staff reductions, comes as Boeing has spent heavily to develop new aircraft models. It poured $1 billion into erecting a 27-acre factory to make carbon composite wings for its forthcoming 777X widebody jet. It scaled the factory to produce 100 planes a year. But with only 306 firm orders for the 777X on its books, and the production rate falling, Boeing is challenging workers to find more efficient ways to do the work so it can avoid purchasing some of the planned machinery.  Frankly, we would like to not to have to buy all of the equipment that we are currently sized for,  said Eric Lindblad, vice president of the 777X program, during a recent factory tour.  It's just saving money on capital.  Behind him, only two of six bays built to hold carbon fiber placement machines had been outfitted with all equipment. Boeing also has set up a temporary low-rate assembly line for initial production (LRIP) of the 777X so it can test processes before hitting the acceleration pedal.  Reducing Risk of Lemons Jason Clark (4th L), Vice President of Boeing 777 and 777X Operations, points to a model during a media tour of the 777 Wing Horizontal Build Line at Boeing's production facility in Everett, Washington, U.S. June 1, 2017.Jason RedmondThe  LRIP  strategy comes in part from painful lessons on the 787 line, where early aircraft that came out of the factory needed heavy reworking.  This time,  we are actually testing the primary elements of that new production capability  on the 777, a plane Boeing already knows how to make, said Jason Clark, vice president of 777 and 777X operations.  Final assembly of the 777X begins next year, with testing in 2019 and first delivery in 2020. Lindblad said it might be delivered a quarter early, if customers want, but not in 2019. Slideshow (9 Images)On the 787 line, where wings, fuselage and other major pieces are shipped from suppliers and simply assembled at Boeing, the savings options are fewer.  But teams are still taking out costs. They have slashed production time by more than two-thirds in four years through such changes as organizing kits so mechanics have all parts on hand and putting interiors into planes earlier on the assembly line, said Bob Manelski, director of 787 business operations.  Boeing builds the 787 in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. That allows it to try out new techniques on one line at a time. A year ago, it started noting a  champion time  for fastest production and analyzing how that was done.  The savings are crucial to paying back about $27 billion in deferred 787 production costs racked up by the first few hundred 787s.  Boeing's goal is to build the largest 787 version, the 787-10, in the same amount of time as the two smaller versions - and for the same cost as the 787-9. It has no choice but to continue getting lean, Manelski said.  We have to price the airplane more and more aggressively every time we got to the market.

China has touted what it formally calls the Belt and Road initiative as a new way to boost global development since President Xi Jinping unveiled the plan in 2013, aiming to expand links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond. At a summit last month, Xi pledged $124 billion for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing's professed selfless desire to spread prosperity. Ambassador Michael Clauss told the Foreign Correspondents' Club that Germany saw a lot of merit in the scheme, but he felt many were largely ignoring it, especially in Europe and the United States, which surprised him.  It's being underestimated a little bit. People should wake up,  Clauss said, adding that one concern was that China was still promoting it as a very China-centric scheme.  What we would like to see is it be done at a more equal footing. So far it's not yet been possible to have equal footing discussion between the European Union and China on that aspect,  he said.  It's very much centered on Beijing, on China.   European firms want to take part, but are being made to feel unwelcome or face undesirable conditions, added Clauss, who has been ambassador in Beijing since 2013.  We know that in some cases companies have been asked to transfer their technology in return for being able to participate in some of the projects, which didn't meet with a lot of enthusiasm.  The new Silk Road is being promoted as part of China's efforts to bolster its global leadership ambitions as U.S. President Donald Trump promotes  America First  and questions existing global free trade deals, including pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Clauss said the new U.S. administration was still formulating its China policy, and in Beijing, where the new U.S. ambassador is yet to arrive and the acting top diplomat has just resigned, there was little cooperation at present between Germany and the United States on China.  Even with its problems, the new Silk Road should be supported, Clauss added, however.   Despite these shortcomings, we feel that especially since TPP and others have been given up, there's no better game in town.

Twenty-one adults and eight children were among the bodies found in the Andaman Sea near the coastal town of Launglon by navy and civilian ships, the military said on its official page on social media site Facebook.  I only want to cry, I have nothing,  said a shaky-voiced Yuzana, 19, whose parents and younger brother were on the aircraft when it went missing on Wednesday. The weekly flight, from several coastal towns to Myanmar's largest city of Yangon, had been carrying the three to a planned reunion after a two-year-long separation.  My father said he bought a mobile phone for me. My mom bought a bag for my school,  Yuzana, who uses one name, told Reuters by telephone. Scores of rescue workers in the fishing village of Sanlan, about 600 km (372 miles) from Yangon, braved stormy weather to carry ashore the dead, wrapped in plastic, from a military ship. Many bodies had fragmented into several pieces and no victim wearing a life jacket has yet been recovered, said Hla Thein, one of those directly involved in the rescue.   More than a dozen relatives of those on board the aircraft gathered at a crisis center in an army base in the southern coastal town of Myeik, some weeping, pictures released by the military showed. Nine navy ships, five military planes and two helicopters, will keep up the search for survivors for a second day, assisted by civilian boats, the military said. The Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane lost contact 29 minutes after takeoff while flying at 18,000 feet (5,485 meters) over the Andaman Sea, about 43 miles (70 km) west of the town of Dawei, the military said. An aircraft wheel, two life jackets and some bags with clothes - believed to be from the missing plane - were found earlier.  Some patches of oil were spotted some 16 nautical miles (18 miles) from Dawei, the military said.  The cause of the incident has yet to be confirmed. Military soldiers carry dead bodies from a crashed military plane outside Launglon township, Myanmar June 8 , 2017.Soe Zeya TunBut survivors are  very unlikely  more than 24 hours after the plane lost contact, despite warm sea temperatures in the area, said Charitha Pattiaratchi, a coastal oceanography expert at the University of Western Australia.  Myanmar authorities might soon change their focus from rescue to salvage, aiming to collect debris and investigate the cause of the accident, he added.   Aircraft Accidents The plane was carrying 122 passengers, 108 of these made up of soldiers and their family members, besides 14 crew. Among the 108 were 15 children, 58 adults and 35 soldiers. Slideshow (7 Images)The military said the plane was operated by  seasoned pilot  Lieutenant Colonel Nyein Chan with 3,162 flying hours, two co-pilots and a flight engineer.  All military personnel on board are low- to mid-ranking officers, a passenger list released by the military shows.  It is the rainy season in Myanmar but a civil aviation official said the weather had been  normal  with good visibility when the plane took off.  The aircraft, bought in March 2016, had a total of 809 flying hours. It was carrying 2.4 tons of supplies, the military said. Nicknamed the  air camel  in Chinese, the multi-purpose aircraft was approved for production in 1980 and is still being produced by Shaanxi Aircraft Corporation, a unit of state-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China. The four-spoke turboprop is used in developing countries, including China and Sudan. If all 122 on board were killed, the incident could be the deadliest involving the Chinese model, said Chen Xiao, an editor at Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine.  Aircraft accidents, involving both civilian and military planes, are not uncommon in Myanmar.  A military helicopter crashed last June in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel on board. Five military were killed in February last year when an air force aircraft crashed in the capital, Naypyitaw, media reported.  Whether it's military or commercial aviation, it requires a major overhaul in terms of infrastructure, fleet, training, technology and equipment,  said Shukor Yusof, an aviation expert and founder of Malaysia-based consultancy Endau Analytics.

The case has been closely watched by the financial industry and corporate governance activists as it is likely to redefine the limits on what can be written in research reports on public companies, potentially curtailing the activities of research firms in the financial center. The Hong Kong court ruled in favor of a March 2016 ruling by the Securities and Futures Appeal Tribunal (SFAT) that partly upheld regulatory action imposed on the Hong Kong unit of Moody's Investors Service in relation to the publication of the so-called  red flags  report. The SFAT had determined that Moody's breached the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) code of conduct through the publication of the July 2011 report that raised corporate governance concerns over 49 Chinese companies, contributing to a fall in their Hong Kong share prices. “Moody's is disappointed by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal's decision. Moody's did not engage in misleading conduct and disagrees that the Securities and Futures Commission should be able to regulate the content of research publications,  Donough Foley, Senior Vice President, Government & Public Affairs, Moody's Investors Service, said in the statement.  Moody's is reviewing the Court's opinion and is considering its options.  The SFC had said that Moody's failed to ensure the accuracy of the report and that the report painted a misleading picture of the companies. It was the first time the SFC had taken action against a credit-rating firm since it started regulating rating activities in June 2011.     A key argument Moody's made in its defense was that the report did not constitute a credit rating and was therefore not subject to the SFC's jurisdiction, but the SFAT did not accept this.  The Moody's case has fueled concerns that governments in the region are increasingly trying to muffle negative research, with the Indonesian Finance Ministry in November penalizing JP Morgan following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia. The court's finding also comes amid renewed focus on negative research in Hong Kong, following a flurry of short-sell reports on companies in the city.   A representative of the SFC could not provide immediate comment.

Vancouver-based Eldorado is developing a gold mine project in northern Greece but differences have persisted for years with Greek authorities over testing methods applied to comply with environment regulations. Greece says it wants to make sure that Eldorado's Greek unit Hellas Gold, which is developing the project, respects its contractual obligations.  The aim is to safeguard public interest by developing the region's mineral resources in line with the existing environmental terms and standards,  the ministry said in a statement. A ministry official told Reuters last week that the three-member arbitration panel would include a government-selected judge, an Eldorado-selected judge and a third selected by the president of Greece's Supreme Court.

Islamic State, which controls some territory in neighboring Afghanistan, has struggled to establish a presence in Pakistan but it has claimed several major attacks, including one on the deputy chairman of the Senate last month in Baluchistan in which 25 people were killed. The military said the raid near the town of Mastung, 50 km (30 miles) south of the provincial capital, Quetta, targeted militants from the banned Lashkar-e-Jangvi Al Alami (LeJ-AL) group, which has carried out attacks with Islamic State.  (LeJ-AL) was reportedly making efforts for communication with ISIS and intended to facilitate establishment of ISIS foothold,  the military's media wing said in a statement. The military also said the suicide bomber who last month killed 25 people in the attack on the deputy chairman of the Senate had been based in the cave hideout.  Islamic State claimed that attack.  The suicide bomber ... was also sent by this group from same hideout,  the military said. The military said the operation to clear the militants' hideout started on June 1 and finished two days later.  Terrorists who were hiding in caves offered stiff resistance,  the military said, adding that five members of the security forces had been wounded. Troops destroyed a bomb-making facility in the cave and recovered a cache of arms and explosives, including six rocket launchers, it said. A spokesman for the LeJ-AL said last month his group had split with Islamic State due to  policy changes . The spokesman, Ali Bin Sufyan, did not elaborate on the differences but condemned the May 12 bomb attack on the convoy of Senator Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, which happened near Mastung. Separatist guerrillas in Baluchistan are also fighting the central government over what they see as the unfair exploitation of their province's significant gas and mineral deposits.

Polish authorities said last week they had found the remains of two other people in Kaczynski's coffin while examining the exhumed coffins of victims from the plane crash, which occurred near the western Russian city of Smolensk. The caskets of 11 further victims also contained body parts of others, prosecutors said after examining 24 coffins from the crash.  Such accusations are absolutely unfounded,  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a news briefing. Back in 2010, Moscow was under pressure from Warsaw to  hand over the remains as soon as possible , Zakharova said.   The de-facto identification of the remains was conducted by forensic experts expeditiously on April 11-12 (2010). Besides, the identification of the bodies was done directly by Polish representatives and relatives of the dead.  The April 2010 crash - the worst such disaster for Poland since World War Two - has left Polish society deeply divided over the cause despite the previous government's conclusion from its own investigation that pilot error had been to blame. Poland's current government under the Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by Lech Kaczynski's twin brother Jaroslaw, took direct control of the prosecutor's office and moved to re-examine the Smolensk crash after taking power in late 2015, saying the previous investigation was not conducted properly.  Some officials of the ruling right-wing party have blamed the tragedy on an explosion aboard, without providing evidence. Polish Deputy Prosecutor General Marek Pasionek told reporters last week that in 12 of 24 coffins reopened since last year, bodies had been swapped in two, one contained half the body of another person, while nine other caskets held scattered remains of other victims. Zakharova said that when identification was impossible, the remains were handed over to Poland with numbers assigned to them.  It is also no less important that the bodies were put in the coffins in the presence of the Polish side,  she said.  Russia cannot bear responsibility for what was happening to these remains on their return to Poland. This is already a matter for the Polish side to deal with.  The Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) reaffirmed on Thursday that the disaster had been caused by human error. The crew was landing  despite lacking visual contact with orienting points on the ground below a safe altitude of 100 meters , RIA news agency cited Alexei Morozov, the head of MAK's technical commission that investigated the crash, as saying. MAK, which comprises 12 ex-Soviet nations, is charged with upholding safety and conducting independent air accident investigations in their common airspace.

The ECB dropped a reference to further interest rate cuts, while repeating it expects rates to remain at record lows for an extended period and well beyond its asset purchase programme. The euro dropped to $1.12165 from $1.1241 following the statement.  They have omitted the guidance that interest rates might be cut, but they have kept all their other easing measures in place and the comment that quantitative easing could be extended if needed,  Sonja Marten, senior FX strategist at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said.  Maybe the market was looking for a more hawkish signal.  The euro has risen 10 percent against the dollar in the past five months, partly due to the greenback's weakness, but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018. But reports on Wednesday that the ECB would cut its inflation forecasts have dampened expectations of the bank's language veering towards a pullback of its stimulus programme, also known as quantitative easing (QE), later this year. Sterling traded at $1.2942, coming off a peak of $1.2978 in morning European trade, its highest level since May 25. A final opinion poll published on Thursday as Britons vote in a national election showed Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives widening their lead to 8 percentage points from 5 points, suggesting her gamble to call the vote to strengthen her position in Brexit negotiations will pay off.  Confirmation (of investors' expectations of a Tory win) may support the pound against the euro and the dollar but it does feel like some positives might be already baked into the price,  said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole in London.  That also means that any potential disappointment, i.e. a Tory majority being eroded as a result of the snap election or a hung parliament could be pretty damaging for the pound.  The dollar recovered some of its losses against the safe-haven yen, up 0.3 percent to 110.11 yen per dollar . The index that measures its broader strength was up 0.2 percent at 96.931. Investors will closely monitor U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey later on Thursday, worried this could dampen already flagging momentum for President Trump's agenda of rolling back regulation and overhauling the tax code. In written testimony released on Wednesday, Comey - who was abruptly fired by Trump in May - said that the president asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

The monthly increase was the biggest since the 0.8 percent advance recorded in May 2016. Compared to April 2016, new house prices leapt by 3.9 percent, the highest year-on-year since the 4.1 percent seen in May 2008. The data will undoubtedly fuel worries about a potential housing bubble in Vancouver and Toronto, where prices grew by the most in 28 years. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz last month said hefty Toronto home prices increases were not sustainable. Prices in Toronto, which accounts for 25.49 percent of the Canadian market, surged by 2.1 percent, the highest month-on-month advance since the 2.8 percent recorded in March 1989. Builders cited a shortage of developed land as one reason. Vancouver prices climbed by 1.2 percent, their second consecutive advance. Vancouver is the largest city in the Pacific province of British Columbia, where the government imposed a 15 percent property transfer tax on foreign real estate buyers last August. The price index excludes apartments and condominiums, which the government says are a particular cause for concern and which account for one-third of new housing.

Transatlantic routes are among the industry's most popular and profitable, and budget carriers are trying to grab a slice of that business by boosting capacity on them by 68 percent this summer, according to data from air travel intelligence company OAG. A looming fare war has gained fresh momentum from lightweight new planes with fresh, appealing interiors that help to keep costs down. Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) and Icelandic rival Wow have grabbed headlines with fares as low as $69 and $55 this summer, although Wow's flights involve a stop in Reykjavik. Legacy carriers are not idly standing by, and executives at the International Air Transport Association meeting in Cancun, Mexico, said in interviews they were confident their plans to offer low-cost long-haul flights would succeed.  Disrupters such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and AirAsia X (AIRX.KL) have shaken up the airline market and forced scheduled operators to rethink their transatlantic strategies,  Euromonitor travel project manager Nadejda Popova said. Lufthansa's (LHAG.DE) Eurowings budget carrier is in its second year of long-haul flying, while Air France (AIRF.PA) is planning to launch a lower-cost long haul brand this fall in a project dubbed Boost.  It confirms our decision that others are following,  Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said, adding that the German carrier would not have invested in Eurowings without the potential for profit. International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), the holding company for British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, launched low-cost long-haul brand Level on Thursday with surprisingly strong ticket sales. IAG CEO Willie Walsh said at the launch that Level would fly five planes next summer and expand to other European cities. Level's hub is in Barcelona, where Norwegian will also launch U.S. flights this summer with two A330s. British Airways is putting more seats on its 777 planes, moving to 10 abreast in economy.   BA's seat cost will be lower than Norwegian's by this time next year,  Malaysia Airlines CEO Peter Bellew predicted.  U.S. carriers, stung by previous efforts to set up low-cost units in the 1990s, have introduced new, no-frills fare classes that let passengers pay for extras while booking online.

Aviation consultant John Strickland said he questioned how widely low-cost long-haul can be profitable, especially on some less popular destinations. He pointed out that even Michael O'Leary, CEO of the highly profitable European low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYA.I), has held back because he said he could not get planes at the right price.   On the North Atlantic you have volume markets where it can work. Asia can work, but the extent to which the model can be delivered at levels of sustainable profitability is far from clear,  Strickland said. The wing of an AirAsia plane travelling from Sri Lanka to Malaysia, October 1, 2015.Olivia HarrisAir France-KLM CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said low-cost carriers would have a hard time on transatlantic routes unless they also offer an attractive business travel service.  It's not just about the seats. It's whether you have the right frequencies, the air miles, the connections with other destinations,  Janaillac said. In September 1977, Freddie Laker challenged legacy carriers by offering cut-price Skytrain flights between London's Gatwick Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. But it went bust in 1982 after established rivals cut fares and forced it out of the market. Norwegian is pressing on anyway, shifting away from short-haul routes to focus on long-haul. It is deploying narrow body 737 Max planes on transatlantic routes and has converted some Airbus orders to larger A321neo planes that can fly longer routes. In homage to Laker and in a pointed signal to established rivals, his portrait will adorn the tail fin of Norwegian's new 737 Max planes taking off this summer on transatlantic routes.  It is also in talks with Ryanair over the Irish carrier feeding its own short-haul customers to Norwegian's long-haul flights, which would help fill planes. Younger travellers especially find the new budget carriers appealing. Qubilah Huddleston, a 26-year-old graduate student from Baltimore, Maryland, in January flew Norwegian Air roundtrip from Boston to London for about $300.

Much has been made of the ‘Triple Threat Thursday’ but beyond the commentary on the outside risks from those events, it was hard to see any real trepidation in prices. London's FTSE barely budged as UK voters headed to the polls. Euro zone stocks rose as much as 0.6 percent as signs emerged of another bank rescue, this time in Italy, and data showed the bloc growing at its fastest since the ECB started printing money. The central bank's latest meeting concluded with it reiterating that stimulus will remain unchanged until the end of the year, though it also tweaked its stance slightly to remove a reference to sub-zero rates potentially going lower. Signs that a snap election in Italy was now looking less likely accelerated the rally in its stocks and bonds . Energy shares climbed too as oil recovered from a 5 percent drop the previous day. After a solid start the pound and the euro both flagged. Sterling dipped 30 ticks to $1.2940 while the euro hit a day's low of $1.1220 on the ECB's comments, though that was just off a seven-month high. The dollar was beginning to find some traction have spent most of the morning in a holding pattern. The yen had landed a glancing blow overnight after stimulus withdrawal talk from a Bank of Japan policymaker, but the greenback had all but recovered as focus returned to the day's main events. Former FBI Director James Comey will be grilled by Washington politicians later over his statement that President Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Although it keeps pressure on Trump, Wall St markets largely shrugged it off after Wednesday's written testimony as not toxic enough to ratchet up the threat of an impeachment.  To be honest, I'm absolutely staggered about the degree to which this geopolitical environment and developments are having absolutely no effect on markets,  said Saxo Bank head of FX strategy John Hardy.  I'm old enough to remember how nervous the market used to get about this kind of stuff back in the day. I admit I don't know how to price it, but it's really staggering.  With the VIX implied volatility index, the markets' so called 'fear gauge' hovering just above 10 percent, similar arguments are being made about the UK election and Mario Draghi's ECB news conference at 1230 GMT. Battle for Britain For the ECB, soundings on downgraded inflation forecasts and background trepidation about banking sector stability make it highly unlikely it will conduct any major tightening of policy before the end of the year. By tweaking its policy statement and dropping the easing bias on interest rates, it was a nod at the recent improvement in the euro zone economy. But by leaving the rest of it largely unchanged, it showed it is playing things safe. As for the UK, for all the scenarios of a hung parliament or Labour-led coalition, the central assumption is for a slightly increased majority for the ruling Conservatives and averaging the very diverse opinion poll projections points to the same. Spot sterling has been firm in recent days, although the jump in overnight implied volatility readings to some 30 percent – its highest since July – at least shows some pricing of possible risks over the next 24 hours. The biggest moves of the week so far remain centered around ebbing energy prices and inflation outlooks in general. Brent crude stabilized at $48.50 a barrel in European trading, after another steep drop briefly below $48 overnight. It is now down more than 7 percent year-on-year. With inventories showing no easing of the global glut, an ongoing row between Qatar and its Arab neighbours is seen as undermining the OPEC consensus about production cuts to limit oil supply. Financially, the isolation of Qatar is taking its toll on the country’s debt and currency markets. Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday and Moody's warned on Thursday that it saw risks too if the situation continued. The riyal currency held near to an 11-year low in its pegged band and though stocks bounced more than two percent, Qatari sovereign dollar bonds extended their losses and the cost of insuring exposure to the kingdom's debt rose to the highest level since mid-November.  We expect that economic growth will slow, not just through reduced regional trade, but as corporate profitability is damaged because regional demand is cut off, investment is hampered, and investment confidence wanes,  S&P; said.

The widely expected change in the wording reflects an acceleration of the bloc's economic recovery in recent months and is likely to be taken as a sign that the ECB is preparing for an eventual withdrawal of its aggressive stimulus measures.

A day after the European Commission offered 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) a year in support of Franco-German plans for greater EU defense cooperation, all 28 EU governments agreed for the command center in Brussels to run training missions in Somalia, the Central African Republic and Mali. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement the decision was  a very important operational decision to strengthen European defense . Britain, still a member of the European Union until it leaves in 2019, resisted the creation of the command center because London has long feared what it sees as the creation of an EU army that would weaken national sovereignty. But less than two weeks before Britain is set to start its EU exit negotiations, London agreed to the so-called Military Planning and Conduct Capability on the basis it was not called a military headquarters.  Britain also insisted on legal language in the final EU documents that London felt limited the scope of the command center. The European Union denies any plans for an EU army of soldiers wearing the same uniforms.  France and Germany say Europe needs better coordination and pooling of resources after spending cuts that have left depleted national forces too reliant on the United States at a time of rising threats from Islamist militants and Russia. France, Italy and Germany, which strongly back the command center, say that while it only has 25 staff and three missions, it should eventually be allowed to develop into a bigger headquarters to better coordinate European missions. The European Union has 15 military missions abroad, which are run out of separate headquarters. The bloc has said it is not seeking to rival NATO's headquarters in Mons, Belgium.

So high are the stakes and so competitive is the exam that some students resort to cheating.  Over the years, students have used wireless cheating devices disguised as erasers, belts and watches. Some also use tiny earpieces to communicate with accomplices helping them outside the exam room. The innovations have forced authorities to step up their game in response. Exam centers this year have deployed metal detectors, facial and fingerprint recognition technology, cellphone-signal blockers, wireless detectors and even drones in their fight to root out cheating, media reported. Even before the exam kicked off in earnest on Tuesday, security officers had arrested 52 people nationwide. Cheaters and their accomplices face up to seven years in jail.  Robot AI-MATHS is pictured as it sits for math papers of China's national college entrance exam known as  gaokao , in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China June 7, 2017.An YuanUniversities in Shandong province have banned students from taking leave on Tuesday and Wednesday, to prevent any of them from posing as real exam takers, the official Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday.  Cheating is more common for papers that include multiple choice questions such as mathematics and English. Slideshow (6 Images)Some papers, however, such as essay-writing, confound the cheats. Essay-writing is an important section of the Chinese paper, and topics vary from province to province.  In Beijing, students this year had to write about either their vision of China in 2049, the centennial of the foundation of the People's Republic of China, or about relationships.  Students in nine provinces were told to introduce China to foreigners using key words like  Belt and Road initiative ,  bike-sharing ,  high-speed railway  or  mobile payment , in a test of their knowledge of economic trends.  The province of Jiangsu, notorious for tough exams, wanted students to expound on vehicles, while neighboring Zhejiang province demanded 800-word essays on books.

As we face the departure of the largest EU financial center, we committed to stepping up our efforts to further strengthen and integrate the EU capital markets,  European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Thursday. Europe's capital markets union (CMU) was launched in September 2015 to improve the way stock and bond markets support growth, and offer companies alternatives to bank loans. The aim is to put the  building blocks  in place by 2019, but as this now coincides with Britain leaving the EU, the bloc needs to also reduce its dependence on London. Related CoverageFactbox: Europe reboots capital markets union ahead of Brexit Quick wins  such as reviving securitization or asset-backed debt, and making it easier for companies to list - two of the 20 measures passed from an original list of 33, have already taken longer than expected to win parliamentary approval. And in its  mid-term  review of the CMU for an EU of 27 countries, the Commission listed nine more  priority actions , including direct supervisory powers for the EU's securities watchdog and helping banks to offload bad loans. However, Jyrki Katainen, European Commission Vice President for jobs, growth and investment, said it could take up to a decade to see results from the CMU initiatives.  It's a question of whether this potential is used or not,  Katainen told a news conference. Markus Ferber, vice chairman of the European Parliament's economic affairs committee, called the review a  document of failure  that listed what has still not been accomplished.  In light of Brexit, effective and efficient European capital markets are more important than ever. Instead of devising new updates of their working plans every few years, now would be a good time for the Commission to actually make some progress,  Ferber said. Peter Green, a financial lawyer at Morrison & Foerster, said it was questionable whether the reboot was enough to create an effective rival market to London. A big test will be how much progress Brussels can make in helping banks to offload bad loans, a problem that led this week to European authorities intervening to avoid a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC. Bad loans can restrict banks' ability to lend, but shedding them is hampered by high transaction costs. The EU executive will soon launch a consultation on action in areas such as loan servicing by third parties, and the transfer of loans, including to non-bank entities.

The rating agency bumped BP up one notch to A1 and said the London-based company's outlook was positive.  Our decision to upgrade BP to A1 factors in the increased clarity around the size and timing of remaining cash payments linked to the Deep Water Horizon incident, as well as expected improvements to BP's credit metrics and its strong operating performance despite high oil price volatility,  said Elena Nadtotchi, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's. The settlement of the Deepwater Horizon fines and clean up costs in 2015 brought BP's pretax bill to more than $62 billion. The company will pay the charge gradually into the 2030s. BP, like other oil companies, slashed spending and costs in the wake of a sharp drop in oil prices from mid-2014. It is aiming to be able to general cashflow at oil prices of $35-$40 a barrel by the end of the decade.  BP demonstrated strong operating performance amid high volatility in oil prices,  according to Moody's. It is set to see a sharp rise in production in the coming years as it starts up eight projects this year, including in Oman and Azerbaijan, the largest number in the company's history in a single year. The company hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade.  The positive outlook recognises that BP's strong business profile may sustain a higher rating and anticipates that the company will continue to deliver strong operating performance in 2017-19, supported by growth and improving profitability of the upstream, and rising contribution from the downstream,  Moody's said.

Such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings, some of the analysts said. Any such step would face a steep hurdle, however, as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans. According to written testimony posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him during a one-on-one Feb. 14 conversation that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a  good guy  and hoped that Comey could see his  way clear  to letting go a probe into ties between Flynn and Russia. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States.  Comey's account, released ahead of his appearance before the committee on Thursday, could show that Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina School of Law.   The express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting,” and could heighten speculation that the  president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the Russia investigation,” Gerhardt said. Comey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, was leading an FBI investigation of Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Moscow and Trump have both denied any collusion. Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about whether Comey's testimony would support an obstruction case. But he said in a statement that Trump felt  vindicated  by Comey's confirmation he was not under investigation in any Russia probe.     Question of Intent To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation.  While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment.  Bruce Green, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult to show Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation. He said Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn's character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president. Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and well-known defense lawyer, added that Trump's comments to Comey were  ambiguous statements  and  not even close to obstruction of justice.   Other legal experts said, however, that details surrounding the Feb. 14 conversation could indicate that Trump intended to interfere with the Flynn probe.   According to Comey, Trump told his close advisers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, to leave the room so he could speak to Comey privately. “Asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of constitutional law at Savannah Law School. Wright said there were other damaging details in Comey's testimony, including that Comey did not document his conversations with former President Barack Obama but  felt compelled  to do so after his first conversation with Trump. Comey’s testimony does “maximum damage” to Trump, Wright said. Gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to Trump, saying: “Some people who weren’t concerned before should be concerned now.

Comey is scheduled to testify at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Thursday as part of the committee's investigation into U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia tried to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion by President Donald Trump's campaign. Russia has denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion.  The committee posted Comey's opening statement on its website on Wednesday:  Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with President-Elect and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee. January 6 Briefing  I first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.  The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.  The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI’s counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI’s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct.  It is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. The Bureau’s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves 'turning' the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities.  Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will 'open an investigation' on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted.  In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trump’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.  I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone) – once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months – three in person and six on the phone. January 27 Dinner  The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and  invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others.  It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.  The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to.  He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away.  My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI’s traditionally independent status in the executive branch.  I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not 'reliable' in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody’s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.  A few moments later, the President said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.  At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because 'problems' come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.  Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, 'I need loyalty.' I replied, 'You will always get honesty from me.' He paused and then said, 'That’s what I want, honest loyalty.' I paused, and then said, 'You will get that from me.' As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase 'honest loyalty' differently, but I decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further. The term – honest loyalty – had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.  During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.  As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI. February 14 Oval Office Meeting  On February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs.  The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me.  When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn.' Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn't done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.  The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information – a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed.  The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, 'He is a good guy and has been through a lot.' He repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.' (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would 'let this go.'  The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President.  I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn’s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency.  The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the President’s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General’s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members – or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them – aware of the President’s request.  Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President's concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened – him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind – was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBI’s potential investigation of General Flynn. March 30 Phone Call  On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as 'a cloud' that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud.' I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.  Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week – at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that.  He repeatedly told me, 'We need to get that fact out.' (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)  The President went on to say that if there were some 'satellite' associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn’t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren’t investigating him.  In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn’t brought up 'the McCabe thing' because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money. Although I didn’t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.  He finished by stressing 'the cloud' that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn’t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.  Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later. April 11 Phone Call  On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I 'get out' that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that 'the cloud' was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.  He said he would do that and added, 'Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.' I did not reply or ask him what he meant by 'that thing.' I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.  That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.   Compiled by Washington newsroom; editing by Grant McCool","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-comey-text-idUSKBN18Y2X8"},

In written testimony released the day before he appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said Trump told him at a meeting in the White House in February:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.  The testimony puts more pressure on Trump, a Republican, whose presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that Moscow helped him win last year's election. Some legal experts said Comey’s testimony could strengthen any impeachment case built on obstruction of justice, but U.S. markets shrugged off the news from the testimony for lack of any major disclosures. To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation. While a sitting president is very unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Comey said he had told Trump on three occasions he was not being investigated, confirming an earlier account from the president. Trump, who spent part of Wednesday in Ohio talking about the need to fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure, ignored reporters’ shouted questions about Comey. On returning to the Oval Office, Trump went into a meeting with top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. Later, his outside counsel released a statement saying Trump felt  completely and totally vindicated  by Comey's account.  The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,  Marc Kasowitz, Trump's attorney, said in a statement.

Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion. Trump abruptly fired Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe, on May 9. Comey painted a vivid picture for senators of awkward encounters with Trump in seven pages of testimony. Comey described a private dinner in the Green Room of the White House on Jan. 26, where Trump asked him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director, telling him:  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.   I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence,  Comey said in his testimony, explaining he became concerned that Trump was trying to create  some sort of patronage relationship.  On Feb. 14, after an Oval Office briefing on counterterrorism, Trump asked Comey to stay behind, dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who lingered, and waving off Priebus, who peeked through the door. FILE PHOTO -  FBI Director James Comey waits to testify to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on  Russia's intelligence activities  on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 10, 2017.Joshua Roberts/File Photo When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn,'  Comey said in his testimony. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States. The FBI has been investigating Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey quoted Trump as telling him:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  On March 30, Trump phoned Comey and asked what  we could do to lift the cloud  of the FBI's Russia investigation.  He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia,  said Comey, who had briefed Trump on  salacious material  that had arisen in a counter-intelligence investigation. Slideshow (11 Images)Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Trump, said in a statement that the uncorroborated dossier of compromising material that Russian operatives allegedly collected on Trump has been  debunked.    Comey’s statement released today needs to be carefully scrutinized as his testimony claims the president was concerned about the dossier,  said Cohen. Cohen, along with Flynn, has been subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a Russia probe. Legal Fallout? Some legal experts said Comey’s written statement could be used to show that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. “It shows the president was doing everything he could to shut down the Flynn investigation,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of criminal law at Savannah Law School.  Bruce Green, a professor of law at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult, however, to show that Trump intended to obstruct justice. Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn's character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function effectively as president, Green said. Democrats jumped on the testimony, expressing concern that Trump had inappropriately meddled with the probe.  It's certainly very possible that this is evidence, in combination with other actions by the president, that could amount to obstruction. It's certainly an effort to interfere in the investigation,  the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, told CNN. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about Trump's request for loyalty from Comey, said it was  very, very critical  that FBI directors remain  independent.  But Republican Senator Richard Burr, who heads the Senate intelligence panel, said he did not take issue with Trump's request.  I don't think it's wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody in an administration,  Burr said.

Scott was arrested in Britain on Monday following an extradition request by the U.S. Department of Justice, the document filed with the court by acting U.S. Attorney Bridget M. Rohde said. Scott, HSBC's former head of cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was charged in July last year along with Mark Johnson, a British citizen who was HSBC's global head of foreign exchange cash trading and who was arrested in New York.  Our client strongly denies the allegations. Given there are ongoing proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,  Anne Davies, a lawyer at Gunnercooke who is representing Scott, said. HSBC said Scott had left the firm in 2014.  We are unable to comment further on personnel issues or matters which are the subject of ongoing legal proceedings,  a spokeswoman for the bank said in an emailed statement. Scott and Johnson are believed to be the first people to face U.S. criminal charges arising from an investigation of foreign-exchange rigging at banks. The inquiry led to four banks pleading guilty to conspiring to manipulate currency prices in the United States. HSBC was not among those banks, but in 2014 agreed to pay $618 million to resolve related probes by U.S. and British regulators. Johnson, a British citizen who at the time of his arrest in 2016 was HSBC's global head of foreign exchange cash trading, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of wire fraud and conspiracy last August. Prosecutors said Johnson and Scott in 2011 misused information provided by a client that hired HSBC to convert $3.5 billion to British pounds in connection with a planned sale of the client's foreign subsidiaries. They then used their insider knowledge to trade ahead of the transaction, causing a spike in the price of the currency that hurt HSBC's client, prosecutors said. London police could not immediately confirm Scott's arrest. Bloomberg News earlier reported Scott's arrest.

Founded in 2007, Rocket has helped create a buzzing tech scene in Berlin by launching dozens of businesses from fashion e-commerce to food delivery, but has seen its stock halve since it listed in 2014 as valuations fell for its loss-making start-ups and plans for flotations stalled. Rocket shares were down 2.5 percent at 20.45 euros by 1020 GMT, albeit a far less dramatic fall than when Kinnevik sold half of its 13 percent stake in February and committed to a 90-day lock up for the rest, which it sold on Thursday.  It is rather positive for Rocket as the share overhang is now eliminated and the rumors about an alleged dispute between the two should not burden the share price anymore,  said Warburg analyst Lucas Boventer, who rates Rocket a  Buy . Kinnevik said proceeds from the placement of around 10.9 million shares at 20 euros each to institutional investors would amount to 217 million euros ($244 million), bringing aggregate proceeds from the entire shareholding to 426 million. Rocket shares have rallied in recent weeks on hopes that online food takeaway firm Delivery Hero and meal kit company HelloFresh could float soon, as well as news that Emaar Malls has bought into its Middle East fashion site. However, Neil Campling, head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said Kinnevik's timing was surprising given that Delivery Hero had just confirmed a plan to list. He warned that the increased free float could encourage more short sellers.  We find the timing of all this somewhat odd. But then the relationship between Kinnevik and Rocket does appear to have become increasingly strained,  Campling said.  Co-Investors and Competitors Last year, Kinnevik forced Rocket to slash valuations for two of the ecommerce sites they jointly hold - Global Fashion Group and Home 24 - as part of new funding rounds, although both sides have denied reports of conflict. Rocket Internet and Kinnevik executives say the parting of the ways is due to the fact the two have increasingly become competitors as Rocket has shifted focus from only launching its own businesses to investing in start-ups founded by others.  Rocket has become more like Kinnevik, which invests in similar companies,  Kinnevik spokeswoman Torun Litzen said on Thursday, adding that the timing was good for the sale and the move is in line with Kinnevik's strategy to trim its holdings. Rocket finance chief Peter Kimpel said the relationship with Kinnevik remained close as they are still co-investors in companies such as Global Fashion Group. He added that the increase in the free float is positive for Rocket's possible inclusion in the German mid-cap index. Kinnevik was one of Rocket's first investors and, until the sale, was its biggest shareholder after the Samwer brothers who founded it. Rocket's next biggest shareholders are United Internet and British investor Baillie Gifford.

Dozens of crates of weapons and ammunition were seized from a house in the second-biggest city, Bouake, owned by Soro ally Souleymane Kamarate Kone - known locally as 'Soul to Soul' - by mutinous soldiers during a four-day revolt over bonus payments. The mutineers had been running out of ammunition and the arms cache helped shift momentum in their favor, forcing the government to capitulate to their demands.     The discovery of the weapons at the home of Kone - Soro's director of protocol - has provoked public speculation of links between the speaker and the mutiny.  The government's request for U.N. assistance is the latest indication that Ivorian authorities are carrying out a serious investigation into the affair.  Kone along with two senior military officers serving as aides to Soro have already been questioned by gendarmes and a prosecutor. Soro - a main contender to take over from President Alassane Ouattara, who cannot run for re-election in 2020 - has declined to speak publicly about the weapons.  The dossier is with the prosecutor. The government felt there was a need for expertise and it made a request,  Communications Minister Bruno Kone said, confirming the participation of U.N. personnel in the investigation. He declined to give further details. A spokeswoman with Ivory Coast's U.N. peacekeeping mission, which is in the process of winding down after more than a decade, said she was not aware of U.N involvement in the investigation.   The image of Ivory Coast - the world's top cocoa grower and Africa's fastest growing economy - as a post-war success story has suffered a blow this year amid a wave of mutinies that have exposed the government's tenuous control over the military. Soro headed the New Forces rebellion that occupied northern Ivory Coast from 2002 to 2011 and helped Ouattara to power during a civil war sparked by his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to accept defeat in a 2010 run-off election.  Soro's presumed aspirations to the presidency have provoked strong opposition from others in the ruling coalition. Last month's mutineers were former New Forces rebels who had been integrated into the army. The military is now seeking to recuperate the weapons, which included assault rifles, machineguns and rocket-propelled grenades along with ammunition.

Founded in 2007, Rocket has helped create a buzzing tech scene in Berlin by launching dozens of businesses from fashion e-commerce to food delivery, but has seen its stock halve since it listed in 2014 as valuations fell for its loss-making start-ups and plans for flotations stalled. Rocket shares were down 2.5 percent at 20.45 euros by 1020 GMT, albeit a far less dramatic fall than when Kinnevik sold half of its 13 percent stake in February and committed to a 90-day lock up for the rest, which it sold on Thursday.  It is rather positive for Rocket as the share overhang is now eliminated and the rumors about an alleged dispute between the two should not burden the share price anymore,  said Warburg analyst Lucas Boventer, who rates Rocket a  Buy . Kinnevik said proceeds from the placement of around 10.9 million shares at 20 euros each to institutional investors would amount to 217 million euros ($244 million), bringing aggregate proceeds from the entire shareholding to 426 million. Rocket shares have rallied in recent weeks on hopes that online food takeaway firm Delivery Hero and meal kit company HelloFresh could float soon, as well as news that Emaar Malls has bought into its Middle East fashion site. However, Neil Campling, head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said Kinnevik's timing was surprising given that Delivery Hero had just confirmed a plan to list. He warned that the increased free float could encourage more short sellers.  We find the timing of all this somewhat odd. But then the relationship between Kinnevik and Rocket does appear to have become increasingly strained,  Campling said.  Co-Investors and Competitors Last year, Kinnevik forced Rocket to slash valuations for two of the ecommerce sites they jointly hold - Global Fashion Group and Home 24 - as part of new funding rounds, although both sides have denied reports of conflict. Rocket Internet and Kinnevik executives say the parting of the ways is due to the fact the two have increasingly become competitors as Rocket has shifted focus from only launching its own businesses to investing in start-ups founded by others.  Rocket has become more like Kinnevik, which invests in similar companies,  Kinnevik spokeswoman Torun Litzen said on Thursday, adding that the timing was good for the sale and the move is in line with Kinnevik's strategy to trim its holdings. Rocket finance chief Peter Kimpel said the relationship with Kinnevik remained close as they are still co-investors in companies such as Global Fashion Group. He added that the increase in the free float is positive for Rocket's possible inclusion in the German mid-cap index. Kinnevik was one of Rocket's first investors and, until the sale, was its biggest shareholder after the Samwer brothers who founded it. Rocket's next biggest shareholders are United Internet and British investor Baillie Gifford.

Starting on June 9, all financial advisers providing guidance on retirement accounts must adhere to the new U.S. Department of Labor rule requiring that they act in your best interest rather than their own.  The controversial rule survived a bruising seven-year battle against entrenched interests in the financial services industry, which were seeking to protect excess fees that cost retirement savers $17 billion a year - a full percentage point in annual returns, according to U.S. government estimates during the Obama administration. Most recently, the rule survived a 60-day delay by the new administration under President Donald Trump, which has considered repealing or revising it. The Trump administration may yet try to weaken or undo parts of the so-called fiduciary standard, and several important parts of the rule are due for completion in January. These include details on adviser exemptions and disclosures that must be made to consumers. For now, the rule has teeth. It permits consumers to sue advisers if they do not think they have met their fiduciary obligations. What will the rule mean for retirement savers, and how can you take advantage of its protections? The following are some key issues to consider: What Has Changed? The fiduciary rule imposes requirements on advisers who were previously not required to act in clients' best interest.  If you are surprised to learn that all advisers were not already required to do this, you are not alone. A survey released in April by Financial Engines, which advises workplace savers, found that 53 percent of Americans mistakenly thought that all financial advisers already adhered to a best interest standard. Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) are already fiduciaries; now broker-dealers and insurance company representatives will have to act in your best interest whenever tax-advantaged retirement accounts are involved. Previously, they were governed by a far weaker  suitability  standard that allowed them to sell higher-cost products that might otherwise fit your investment goals. Do a Check-Up If you already work with an adviser, expect to receive a contract spelling out that the relationship is now governed by the new rule and specifying that advice will be in your best interest, costs will be no more than reasonable and that no misleading statements are permitted. The rule is limited to tax-advantaged retirement accounts - such as IRAs and 401(k) accounts - including rollovers from workplace plans to IRAs. But do not stop there. Insist that any adviser you work with accepts fiduciary responsibility. An easy way to separate wheat from chaff is by asking an adviser to sign the Committee's fiduciary oath, a legally enforceable contract that commits advisers to put your interests first. (To download the fiduciary oath, click: here) Scott Puritz, managing director of Rebalance IRA, a low-fee fiduciary advisory firm that manages retirement investments, recommends requiring any prospective adviser to provide a detailed accounting of all expenses applied to your retirement accounts, including adviser, fund, marketing and distribution and transaction costs. Also request a detailed accounting of any one-time expenses, such as front-end loads on mutual funds plus exit or surrender penalties. You also want full disclosure of any conflicts of interest that an adviser may have that could impact her advice to you. Be Informed Finally, ask for a copy of the firm's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form ADV Part 2, which requires brokers to disclose the types of services provided, fee schedules, disciplinary information and any conflicts of interest. It is also important to conduct a thorough background check on anyone you intend to hire, advises Kate McBride, former chair of The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, a group of industry practitioners and experts. Do a search of FINRA's Brokercheck database (brokercheck.finra.org/), and a Google search for news on the adviser’s firm.  Be on the lookout for firms that have paid big fines in the past five years for wrongdoing or over-charging,  McBride says.  If there are more than a handful of cases, think carefully about whether you want to use that firm.  The Pittsburgh-based Centre for Fiduciary Excellence maintains a database of roughly 200 vetted fiduciary advisory firms around the United States that have subjected themselves to extensive audits of their investment practices and client files. (To access the free database, click here: here)  People will spend more time looking for a contractor to fix their sinks than they do hiring an adviser,  McBride adds.  You have to do your homework.

Eurostat said the 19-country euro zone expanded by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.9 percent year-on-year. That compared with earlier estimates of 0.5 and 1.7 percent respectively. The higher figure resulted from revisions for France and Italy, with domestic demand the overall driver, particularly investment. Gross fixed capital formation was 1.3 percent higher in the quarter and up 6.0 percent year-on-year. On an annualized basis, the euro zone economy was expanding at a rate of 2.3 percent in the Jan-March period, far outstripping the 1.2 percent rate of the United States. Capital Economics said that purchasing manager surveys pointed to a potential pick-up to 0.7 percent growth in the second quarter. The first quarter growth rate was the highest since the first three months of 2015, when the ECB first began printing money to boost inflation and stimulate growth.

However, it did close the door to further rate cuts.

Starting on June 9, all financial advisers providing guidance on retirement accounts must adhere to the new U.S. Department of Labor rule requiring that they act in your best interest rather than their own.  The controversial rule survived a bruising seven-year battle against entrenched interests in the financial services industry, which were seeking to protect excess fees that cost retirement savers $17 billion a year - a full percentage point in annual returns, according to U.S. government estimates during the Obama administration. Most recently, the rule survived a 60-day delay by the new administration under President Donald Trump, which has considered repealing or revising it. The Trump administration may yet try to weaken or undo parts of the so-called fiduciary standard, and several important parts of the rule are due for completion in January. These include details on adviser exemptions and disclosures that must be made to consumers. For now, the rule has teeth. It permits consumers to sue advisers if they do not think they have met their fiduciary obligations. What will the rule mean for retirement savers, and how can you take advantage of its protections? The following are some key issues to consider: What Has Changed? The fiduciary rule imposes requirements on advisers who were previously not required to act in clients' best interest.  If you are surprised to learn that all advisers were not already required to do this, you are not alone. A survey released in April by Financial Engines, which advises workplace savers, found that 53 percent of Americans mistakenly thought that all financial advisers already adhered to a best interest standard. Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) are already fiduciaries; now broker-dealers and insurance company representatives will have to act in your best interest whenever tax-advantaged retirement accounts are involved. Previously, they were governed by a far weaker  suitability  standard that allowed them to sell higher-cost products that might otherwise fit your investment goals. Do a Check-Up If you already work with an adviser, expect to receive a contract spelling out that the relationship is now governed by the new rule and specifying that advice will be in your best interest, costs will be no more than reasonable and that no misleading statements are permitted. The rule is limited to tax-advantaged retirement accounts - such as IRAs and 401(k) accounts - including rollovers from workplace plans to IRAs. But do not stop there. Insist that any adviser you work with accepts fiduciary responsibility. An easy way to separate wheat from chaff is by asking an adviser to sign the Committee's fiduciary oath, a legally enforceable contract that commits advisers to put your interests first. (To download the fiduciary oath, click: here) Scott Puritz, managing director of Rebalance IRA, a low-fee fiduciary advisory firm that manages retirement investments, recommends requiring any prospective adviser to provide a detailed accounting of all expenses applied to your retirement accounts, including adviser, fund, marketing and distribution and transaction costs. Also request a detailed accounting of any one-time expenses, such as front-end loads on mutual funds plus exit or surrender penalties. You also want full disclosure of any conflicts of interest that an adviser may have that could impact her advice to you. Be Informed Finally, ask for a copy of the firm's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form ADV Part 2, which requires brokers to disclose the types of services provided, fee schedules, disciplinary information and any conflicts of interest. It is also important to conduct a thorough background check on anyone you intend to hire, advises Kate McBride, former chair of The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, a group of industry practitioners and experts. Do a search of FINRA's Brokercheck database (brokercheck.finra.org/), and a Google search for news on the adviser’s firm.  Be on the lookout for firms that have paid big fines in the past five years for wrongdoing or over-charging,  McBride says.  If there are more than a handful of cases, think carefully about whether you want to use that firm.  The Pittsburgh-based Centre for Fiduciary Excellence maintains a database of roughly 200 vetted fiduciary advisory firms around the United States that have subjected themselves to extensive audits of their investment practices and client files. (To access the free database, click here: here)  People will spend more time looking for a contractor to fix their sinks than they do hiring an adviser,  McBride adds.  You have to do your homework.

Papa,Leonard Rosen,Martin Lipton,Stephen Gillers,Steven Rosenblum,USA,LAWYERS/MandA (PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Every Tuesday, partners and associates at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz gather for a communal lunch in the dining room of the law firm's Manhattan offices. Food ordered from top New York restaurants is served, but the real attraction is Martin Lipton, one of the firm's co-founders and corporate America's most famous consigliere. The father of the 'poison pill' – a key defense strategy used against hostile takeovers – Lipton has helped build the firm into the most lucrative legal outfit in the world, a go-to shop for companies seeking to seal complex deals or repel suitors and activist investors. The weekly lunch is just one of the ways the 85-year-old stays in touch with new associates and reinforces the firm's close-knit culture, where young law graduates are often paired with senior partners to work on big deals. Partners say a flat structure and relatively small size - Wachtell's lawyer headcount of about 260 is roughly half of its closest rival Cravath, Swaine & Moore – is key to the firm's success. The firm's concentrated business model contrasts with the strategy of many law firms to become one-stop shops for deals, from navigating niche regulatory processes to sorting through labyrinthine tax affairs. Lipton is confident that his strategy of concentrating on high-stakes corporate situations will persist, according to interviews with several senior partners at the firm. This is because corporate America continues to turn to Wachtell as its top legal gun for hire.  Wachtell's business model is to be the firm you go to when you are not willing to take any risk at all,  said Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor.  They know that in the big M&A; cases, legal fees, no matter how big they are, are insignificant to the value of concluding the deal.  When French drug giant Sanofi SA threatened U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc with a $9.3 billion hostile bid last year, for example, Medivation called Wachtell despite having an existing external legal adviser, Cooley. Cooley helped Medivation to go public in 2004 and is best known for advising on initial public offerings and defending against patent and class action lawsuits. Cooley and Medivation declined to comment. Most Lucrative With some U.S. companies domiciled overseas, Wachtell's partners often have to adapt their techniques to different jurisdictions. Rather than opening offices internationally as some of their rivals have done, Wachtell's lawyers fly out to advise, staying weeks in some cases to see a case through, and turn to other law firms to assist them. Wachtell did consider opening a London office in recent years, but decided against it, partner at the firm said. The feeling among the firm's senior partners was that expansion would dilute its culture, which is based around forming ad hoc teams to deal with situations, all from the one office in Manhattan. Keeping itself small has helped Wachtell become the most lucrative law firm in the world, with the average partner making a profit last year of $5.8 million, according to trade publication American Lawyer. The top 100 law firms averaged profit per partner of $1.66 million. Capping the workforce also means that partners do not have an army of associates to foist work onto.  We work harder on average than other places, the work is very partner-heavy. It's the type of work where vast experience is critical,  said Daniel Neff, co-chairman of Wachtell's executive committee. No one is more experienced than Lipton, referred to as Marty by clients and colleagues. He continues to work on high-profile cases including, most recently, advising General Motors Co's board of directors on its defense against activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital, as well metal parts maker Arconic Inc on its settlement with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. Besides Lipton, two of the other three founding partners, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, have died. However, like Lipton, founding partner Herbert Wachtell remains active at 84 practicing law, focusing on corporate litigation, which is the firm's other major area of strength. M&a; Royalty Lipton has built a bench of seasoned deal lawyers who now account for the majority of the business that comes through the door. They include Neff and Edward Herlihy, who formally lead the firm as co-managing partners, as well as Andrew Brownstein, David Katz, Steven Rosenblum, Adam Emmerich and Andrew Nussbaum, among others. When Perrigo Co Plc turned to Wachtell in 2015 to defend against a $35 billion offer from Mylan NV, it was a 45-year-old partner, Igor Kirman, that the Irish-domiciled generic drug maker chose to lead its defense in three continents. Perrigo subsequently defeated what was the largest hostile bid ever rejected by a company's shareholders.  It was a given for me that by turning to Wachtell we would get excellent legal advice. But Igor also took very complex issues and simplified them so Perrigo's board could understand,  said Joseph Papa, Perrigo's former CEO who now leads Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Lipton remains influential, fielding calls and studying cases every day from his 31st-floor office, which is filled with memorabilia from major deals stretching back to the 1970s.  Lipton is royalty in the M&A; bar. There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved,  said Gillers.  The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment.  (Additional reporting by Liana B.

The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) is looking into several officials at FGV, following the suspension of the firm's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and two other executives earlier this week. An FGV source said MACC investigators visited various offices in the building, including the legal, finance, procurement and supplier departments, but was not able to provide details on which company officials were interviewed.

The investigators could seize laptops and computers as well, he said, declining to give details on what was discussed with Zakaria.  The FGV crisis unfolded on Tuesday when a letter was leaked from Zakaria to Chairman Mohd Isa Abdul Samad in which he refused to step down as instructed by the chairman. FGV's board then suspended Zakaria and three others. The CEO has denied wrongdoing and called on MACC to conduct its own investigation into FGV, but did not provide any details.

He added that FGV was continuing its own investigation into transactions at a subsidiary that led to the suspensions of the FGV executives.

Turmoil at FGV -- whose biggest shareholder is the state-owned Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) -- could hurt Najib, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. FGV's shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states. Felda  settlers , or land owners, are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the parliament. They own shares in FGV, which raised over $3 billion in one of the world's biggest listings of 2012. The shares have dropped 70 percent since that stock market launch, hurting settlers. They have also complained about delayed payments from Felda, which buys the palm fruit the settlers produce in their land. FGV's shares fell 0.6 percent on Thursday to 1.65 ringgit per share, valuing the company at 5.91 billion ringgit ($1.39 billion).

Media reports that Sessions offered to resign recently surfaced earlier this week. They added to pressure on Trump as former FBI Director James Comey, who was abruptly fired last month, prepared to testify in Congress on Thursday about his interactions with the president. Trump did not accept Sessions' resignation offer and is now being advised to keep his attorney general in place, at least for the time being, two sources said. Political and legal advisers inside the White House have told Trump over the past month that firing Sessions would create another political fire storm and make it more difficult to fill key jobs inside his administration, the sources said on the condition of anonymity.  That's the advice he's been given. But he might not listen to that advice,  one of the sources said. A senior White House official confirmed aides have been urging Trump to keep Sessions but said it was because  he's the best man for the job.  A spokeswoman at the Justice Department declined to comment. Trump has repeatedly shrugged off advice from close aides. Earlier this week, he said the Justice Department led by Sessions was wrong to submit a  watered down, politically correct  version of his proposed travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries to the Supreme Court.  The outburst weakened government lawyers' defense that the travel ban, which has been blocked by federal courts, was not intended as a ban on Muslims. Sessions offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over his decision to recuse himself from a federal investigation into ties between Trump's associates and Russian officials when Russia was allegedly meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to media reports. A former senator, Sessions was one of the first senior Republican lawmakers to endorse Trump as a presidential candidate and played an important role in the campaign. He recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after he failed to disclose a meeting he had with Russia's ambassador in Washington. Trump and Sessions were together at the White House on May 17, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein surprised them both by appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to head the Russia investigation. After learning the news, Trump lashed out at Sessions, blaming him for recusing himself from the Russia probe and leaving the ability to appoint an outside investigator in Rosenstein's hands, the sources said. Trump also complained that Sessions had not warned him about Rosenstein's decision. The Justice Department said Sessions played no part in the decision.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-sessions-idUSL1N1J500E"},

The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) is looking into several officials at FGV, following the suspension of the firm's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and two other executives earlier this week. An FGV source said MACC investigators visited various offices in the building, including the legal, finance, procurement and supplier departments, but was not able to provide details on which company officials were interviewed.  The investigators declined to comment on their way out of the building. An MACC spokesman had said earlier on Thursday that the agency was at FGV's offices in Kuala Lumpur  to collect supporting documents  following a meeting with FGV Chief Executive Zakaria Arshad on Wednesday. The investigators could seize laptops and computers as well, he said, declining to give details on what was discussed with Zakaria.  The FGV crisis unfolded on Tuesday when a letter was leaked from Zakaria to Chairman Mohd Isa Abdul Samad in which he refused to step down as instructed by the chairman. FGV's board then suspended Zakaria and three others. The CEO has denied wrongdoing and called on MACC to conduct its own investigation into FGV, but did not provide any details.

He added that FGV was continuing its own investigation into transactions at a subsidiary that led to the suspensions of the FGV executives. The FGV board has said a deal with Dubai-based palm oil buyer Safitex was at the heart of the company's internal investigation and Safitex owes an FGV unit about $11.7 million as of 2016. Isa was a former chief minister of Negeri Sembilan state and a former vice-president of Malaysia's ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation.

Turmoil at FGV -- whose biggest shareholder is the state-owned Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) -- could hurt Najib, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. FGV's shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states. Felda  settlers , or land owners, are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the parliament. They own shares in FGV, which raised over $3 billion in one of the world's biggest listings of 2012. The shares have dropped 70 percent since that stock market launch, hurting settlers. They have also complained about delayed payments from Felda, which buys the palm fruit the settlers produce in their land. FGV's shares fell 0.6 percent on Thursday to 1.65 ringgit per share, valuing the company at 5.91 billion ringgit ($1.39 billion).

Sources told Reuters the choice has narrowed to one bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd and U.S. tech fund Silver Lake and another from Toshiba chip partner Western Digital Corp and Japanese government-related investors. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the world's second-largest producer of NAND chips, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. The laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate will hold a board meeting on June 15 to decide on the preferred bidder, two sources said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant in Yokkaichi, western Japan, has complicated the sale effort with a legal challenge, accusing Toshiba of a serious breach of contract over the joint venture. It argues that the unit cannot be sold without its consent and has demanded exclusive negotiating rights. But in a letter seen by Reuters, Toshiba struck back, again asking Western Digital to stop challenging the plans.  Toshiba encourages Western Digital to redirect the considerable efforts that it has put into disrupting Toshiba's sale process into more productive channels.  Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Western Digital confirmed in a statement that it had received Toshiba's letter but added that any move by Toshiba to sell the unit without its consent  clearly violate the transfer restrictions in the joint venture agreements.  Western Digital said it was  best positioned to assist Toshiba in addressing its challenges and advancing its legacy of technological innovation in Japan.  The Broadcom-Silver Lake bid is seen as attractive because of its higher price of 2.2 trillion yen ($20 billion), sources have said. Western Digital by comparison has an offer of less than 2 trillion yen and could also face antitrust hurdles because the firm is the third-largest maker of NAND flash-memory chips.  Naturally, for the Toshiba corporate side, Broadcom is the best choice,  one source said. Toshiba shares rose as much as 6 percent on Thursday on the news that the company was closing in on a buyer. The stock has lost some 36 percent since late December when the company flagged huge losses at its U.S. nuclear power operations. Other bidders include U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc, and Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd with its Japanese unit Sharp Corp .

Such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings, some of the analysts said. Any such step would face a steep hurdle, however, as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.     According to written testimony posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him during a one-on-one Feb. 14 conversation that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a  good guy  and hoped that Comey could see his  way clear  to letting go a probe into ties between Flynn and Russia.                  Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States.      Comey's account, released ahead of his appearance before the committee on Thursday, could show that Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina School of Law.       The express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting,” and could heighten speculation that the  president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the Russia investigation,” Gerhardt said.     Comey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, was leading an FBI investigation of Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Moscow and Trump have both denied any collusion.     Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about whether Comey's testimony would support an obstruction case. But he said in a statement that Trump felt  vindicated  by Comey's confirmation he was not under investigation in any Russia probe.              QUESTION OF INTENT     To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation.      While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment.      Bruce Green, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult to show Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation. He said Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn's character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president.     Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and well-known defense lawyer, added that Trump's comments to Comey were  ambiguous statements  and  not even close to obstruction of justice.       Other legal experts said, however, that details surrounding the Feb. 14 conversation could indicate that Trump intended to interfere with the Flynn probe.       According to Comey, Trump told his close advisers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, to leave the room so he could speak to Comey privately.     “Asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of constitutional law at Savannah Law School.     Wright said there were other damaging details in Comey's testimony, including that Comey did not document his conversations with former President Barack Obama but  felt compelled  to do so after his first conversation with Trump.     Comey’s testimony does “maximum damage” to Trump, Wright said.     Gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to Trump, saying: “Some people who weren’t concerned before should be concerned now.

In May last year, Chinese authorities seized a tanker and detained several people as part of a probe into suspected tax evasion on imported oil. A Gunvor senior executive based out of Singapore was one of the people detained, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. Yin Dikun, managing director of Gunvor Singapore, was charged with smuggling 1.3 million tonnes of fuel and evading nearly 378 million yuan ($55.7 million) of taxes, prosecutors in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong province, said in the document dated June 2 and seen by Reuters. Gunvor confirmed in an email an employee had been charged by Chinese authorities in a customs dispute between China and the Philippines. It did not identify the person, but said it continues to do business in China.  Gunvor itself has not been charged,  it said.  The company views this situation as a purely political matter.  It said it was not liable to pay duties because it was not the importer of record into China.  Given that Gunvor is not the importer, legally the charges don't make sense,  the company said. The prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment. Yin Dikun has been held by Guangzhou police since May 2016. An official warrant of arrest was issued in June of last year. Charging an employee of a foreign company is the latest sign that Beijing is broadening its efforts to crack down on tax evasion in the world's top oil importer. Recently the central government has also tightened scrutiny over tax matters of independent refiners, known as teapots. The charges against Yin centre on Gunvor's sales of light cycle oil (LCO) from the Philippines to Chinese buyers over a two-year period. Gunvor had supplied (LCO) on a delivered basis to Chinese importers and provided certificates indicating the LCO fuel was produced in the Philippines, according to the legal document. The prosecutors said in the document the LCO, a refinery by-product for diesel blending, had not originated from the Philippines. They did not say from where they thought the LCO had originated instead. Under a free-trade agreement between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), goods that are manufactured in ASEAN countries are exempt from import tariffs. The Philippines is an ASEAN member.  Knowing that the LCO fuel it supplies are not manufactured in the Philippines, Gunvor Singapore nonetheless provided its Chinese customers ASEAN certificates for them to clear the customs,  the document said. Investigations by Chinese police found Gunvor Singapore was suspected of supplying 36 shipments of LCO under these arrangements between 2014 and 2016, it said. Gunvor said in its email to Reuters that Philippines customs have confirmed the documentation was issued in full compliance with rules and regulations. Gunvor said it maintains rigorous corporate compliance protocols and has taken a  conservative approach to the Chinese market in general, given the known business risks it poses . $1 = 6.7928 Chinese yuan Reporting by Chen Aizhu in BEIJING and Dmitry Zhdannikov in LONDON; Editing by Tom Hogue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-gunvor-oil-probe-idUSL3N1J42X5"},

The rally by more than 100 reporters in the rain outside a court in Yangon was the first significant show of opposition to the telecommunications law, introduced in 2013, that bans the use of the telecoms network to  extort, threaten, obstruct, defame, disturb, inappropriately influence or intimidate . Despite pressure from human rights monitors and Western diplomats, the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which took power amid high hopes for democratic reform in 2016, after decades of hardline military rule, has retained the law. The journalists said they were dismayed by the recent arrests of social media users whose posts were deemed distasteful, as well as of journalists critical of the military.  At first, they were suing people over news articles and now they are suing even over a satirical article, showing how they are restricting the media,  said A Hla Lay Thuzar one of the founders of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, which organized the rally. She said that rather than staging a one-off protest, her   group wants to launch a movement to raise public awareness of  the issue and press the government to abolish the law. The journalists on trial are the chief editor and a columnist of the Voice, one of Myanmar's largest dailies.

Obtaining bail is our right so we will keep fighting for it during next court dates until we get it,  said Khing Maung Myint, who is representing the two journalists. The telecommunications law was a main piece of legislation introduced by a semi-civilian administration of former generals which navigated Myanmar's transition from full military rule to the coming to power of Suu Kyi's government, from 2011 to 2016. The protesting journalists said they would wear the arm-bands for the next 10 days to raise awareness about what they see as the threat to freedom of the press. They are also planning to gather signatures for a petition to abolish the law, to be sent to Suu Kyi's office, the army chief and parliament.

The maker of Remy Martin cognac and Cointreau liqueur, said its strategy of selling higher-priced spirits to boost profit margins was delivering faster-than-expected results, and the company raised its medium-term profitability forecasts. Remy Cointreau has been focusing on selling spirits priced at $50 a bottle or more, as part of a strategy that has benefited from a rebound in Chinese demand.  The business is back in China, especially in the high-qualities,  Chief Executive Valerie Chapoulaud Floquet told a news conference. Remy's strategy differs from that of rival Pernod Ricard , which has launched less expensive brands in China. For its current financial year, which started on April 1, the group will boost spending on advertising and promotion to develop its Cointreau brand in a number of countries, including Russia, China, the United States, France, Britain, and Australia.  We are very confident on Cointreau. We need to invest. We need to polish the diamond,  she said. Record-High Remy's operating profit for the year ended March 31 rose to 226.1 million euros ($254.50 million), representing growth of 13.8 percent. This was above the company-compiled consensus of analysts' forecasts for a profit of 211.5 million euros, and above a prediction for growth of 10.6 percent.  The high-end nature of Remy’s portfolio means the group benefits from rebounding spirits consumption in China and trading-up trends in global spirits  Liberum analysts said. They said Remy's valuation looked quite stretched versus its spirits rivals and are keeping their  sell  recommendation. By 1016 GMT, Remy shares were up 1.88 percent at 99 euros, after touching a record high of 103.45 euros earlier in the day. Its earnings were boosted by robust sales in the United States and in China of higher-priced spirits such as Louis XIII cognac, which sells for $3,000 a bottle, and Remy Martin cognac. Chapoulaud-Floquet said business at its Beijing store dedicated to Louis XIII cognac was  very solid  ten months after its opening. Overall, the group was looking at price increases for Louis XIII and Remy Martin cognacs globally, she said.  At $3,000, when compared with other luxury goods, it's a good deal,  Chapoulaud-Floquet said of Louis XIII. Remy Cointreau, Pernod and British drinks group Diageo have all faced pressure on sales in China following a crackdown on luxury gift-giving and personal spending by Chinese civil servants. Remy shifted its focus to the United States, which is now its top market for cognac, but demand in Greater China has come back, with sales up in double-digit terms for 2016/17. In June 2015, Remy Cointreau had said its strategy to sell higher-priced spirits would drive its current operating margin to 18-20 percent of sales by 2020. Having reached a margin of 20.7 percent of sales in financial year 2016/17, Remy Cointreau said it now expected a margin of between 21.5 percent and 22.5 percent by 2019/20. It reiterated a target that high-end spirits would make 60-65 percent of its sales by 2020 from 51 percent now.

Economiesuisse said it expected the Swiss economy to grow by 1.7 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 as the country puts behind it the  Frankenschock  which hurt exporters ranging from watchmakers to cheesemakers. Switzerland's export-reliant economy was pushed into a tailspin in January 2015 when the Swiss National Bank suddenly ended its cap on the franc versus the euro, sending the Swiss currency soaring and making Swiss products more expensive in their main export market. Data on Thursday showed a brightening picture, with unemployment falling to a non-seasonally adjusted 3.1 percent in May from 3.3 percent in the previous month. Consumer prices meanwhile rose 0.5 percent in May from a year earlier, consolidating recent gains and ending a period of deflation during 2016.  There is still some way to overcoming the franc shock, but the largest part of it is now done,  said Rudolf Minsch, chief economist at Economiesuisse.  About three quarters of the business is now complete.  His forecasts were more positive than those of the Swiss government, which expects growth of 1.6 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2018, as well as other groups like the KOF economic research institute in Zurich. Minsch said there was now a broad recovery across many export sectors, which had previously been propped up by buoyant pharmaceutical and chemical shipments.  The main difference we are seeing between this year and last year is the improvement is broad-based, and is happening in the machinery sector, but also the watch industry and textiles are doing better,  said Minsch. The improvement was driven by better conditions in Switzerland's main markets in Europe, as well as inflation in other countries which reduced the effect of the franc's surge. Companies had also reacted rapidly by increasing productivity and lowering costs to retain their competitiveness, he said. Still, the franc remained overvalued and the Swiss National Bank will have to maintain its expansive monetary policy until the European Central Bank starts increasing its own interest rates, Minsch said. The ECB gives its latest monetary policy assessment on Thursday, while the SNB is due to give an update next week.  The SNB is like a prisoner of the ECB,  said Minsch.  It cannot move until the ECB does.  Reporting by John Revill; Editing by Tom Heneghan","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/swiss-economy-idUSL8N1J52Y7"},

IPIC owns energy assets across the world, including Spanish firm Cepsa and Canadian petrochemical maker NOVA Chemicals, and a majority stake in Austrian plastics company Borealis. It reported on Thursday a net profit attributable to equity holders of $446 million in 2016. In 2015 it had fallen into the red with a net loss of $2.6 billion. Revenues for 2016 fell to $33.8 billion, from $35.8 billion in 2015 due to lower oil prices. Despite lower revenues, IPIC made a profit thanks to lower feedstock costs, higher petrochemicals industry margins and lower impairments across the group, it said. Impairments fell sharply to $180 million in 2016 compared to $4.8 billion in the previous year, its financial statement showed. The firm's total assets stood at $55 billion at the end of 2016, slightly lower than $57 billion in 2015, and its net debt decreased to $19.7 billion in 2016 from $22.2 billion in 2015.

Africa's most developed economy fell into recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, piling pressure on scandal-plagued President Jacob Zuma, whose leadership has been challenged within the ruling African National Congress. Markets partly priced in an interest rate cut after the rand and inflation remained largely stable despite S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch downgrading South Africa's credit rating to  junk  in April. But MPC member Brian Kahn said the central bank needed to act cautiously because further downgrades caused by political uncertainty may have a more severe impact on markets.  We would not want to reduce rates and then be forced into a premature reversal of policy,  Kahn told a banking conference, adding the bank was likely to cut its growth forecast in July. Moody's is expected to announce its ratings decision this week. If all three agencies cut their rating of local currency debt to  junk  it could knock one percent off economic growth and send inflation up by 0.6 percent, Kahn said. Fitch said on Thursday it sees South Africa missing the revenue and deficit forecasts set out in a February budget and that infighting within the ANC remained a key risk to its sovereign credit rating.  Politics have weakened business confidence substantially and this will continue for some time,  Fitch director Jan Friederich said. Backroom rifts within the ANC have been thrust into the open this week after more than 100,000 emails leaked to local media allegedly showed improper dealings in lucrative government contracts by business friends of Zuma. Political instability is expected to continue up to and beyond an ANC conference in December when a successor to Zuma as party leader will be chosen, Fitch's Friederich said. Zuma can remain head of state until a 2019 election but the ANC's secretary general Gwede Mantashe told Reuters on Wednesday that he could be removed next year. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba told parliament on Thursday he was focused on growing the economy and aims to trim the budget deficit to 3.3 percent from 3.8 percent in three years. Growth in South Africa's key mining sector slowed sharply in April while manufacturing contracted much more than expected, data showed on Thursday.

The rapid spread of the disease through 19 of Yemen's 23 governorates highlighted a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen after two years of civil war that has disabled most health care facilities, according to the U.N. humanitarian office.  To date, 101,820 suspected cholera cases and 789 deaths have been reported in 19 governorates,  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters.  The WHO has warned that the number of cases could hit 300,000, but the daily number of new ones declined slightly in the week to June 5 to 3,432, compared with 3,651 in the previous seven-day period.  Yemen is in the grip of a severe cholera epidemic of an unprecedented scale,  the U.N. humanitarian office said in a report published on Wednesday.  Malnourished children and women, people living with other chronic health conditions and households that do not have enough to eat are now at greater risk of death as they face the 'triple threat' of conflict, famine and cholera,  it said.  The war has left 19 million of its 28 million people needing humanitarian aid and many of them on the verge of famine. The cholera outbreak is the second wave of an epidemic that began in October, spread until December and then dwindled but was never brought fully under control.  Aid charity Oxfam called for a  cholera ceasefire  to allow health workers to halt the spread of the disease, adding that the published numbers were probably an underestimate. “Yemen is on the edge of an abyss. Lives hang in the balance,  Oxfam's Yemen Country Director Sajjad Mohammed Sajid said in a statement.  Cholera is simple to treat and prevent but while the fighting continues the task is made doubly difficult.  Cholera is caused by ingesting bacteria from water or food contaminated with faeces. It usually manifests itself with sudden acute diarrhea and can kill within hours, although three-quarters of infected people show no symptoms. The short incubation period means outbreaks can spread quickly, especially in places without safe water or sanitation.  Health and sanitation workers have not been paid for over eight months, only 30 per cent of required medical supplies are being imported into the country, garbage collection in the cities is irregular, and more than eight million people lack access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation,  the U.N. report added.

A deal next week on unblocking new loans for Greece is seen as crucial to prevent Athens from defaulting on debts due in July.  Representatives of euro zone states are meeting on Thursday in Slovenia to try to overcome a months-long stalemate over the Greek program, before finance ministers hold a regular meeting in Luxembourg on June 15.  It's time to move with the next disbursement,  Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels, stressing that Greece had already met its fiscal and reform obligations for the funds to be disbursed.  Dombrovskis said delays in unblocking loans to Greece, part of its 86-billion-euro ($96.6 billion) bailout program, have already hit confidence in the Greek economy. The disbursement of new loans has been linked to the International Monetary Fund's participation in the aid program. This has not been agreed yet due to differences between the IMF and some euro zone lenders on debt relief measures for Greece and its long-term financial stability.  Dombrovskis said debt relief measures were being discussed, but insisted the priority was to disburse new loans to Greece.

A Syrian man who sought asylum in Slovenia and an Afghan family who did the same in Austria have asked the European Court of Justice to rule on the decision of authorities that they should be returned to Croatia, their point of entry into the EU. EU law, known as the Dublin Regulation, typically says the country an asylum seeker first enters the bloc is responsible for handling their application. However, the court was asked whether that rule still applied under the exceptional circumstances of 2015, when more than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Asia arrived, prompting a number of EU countries to close their borders and to argue over how the refugees should be handled. The Advocate General, whose advice is usually followed by Europe's top court, said the unprecedented inflow of migrants and the lack of clear guidance in the Dublin Regulation on how to handle such a situation could leave EU border states - such as Croatia or Greece - unable to cope.  In the Advocate General's view, the regulation was simply not designed to cover such exceptional circumstances,  the court said in a statement. The recommendation is likely to have implications for other asylum seekers, many of whom only lodged their requests when they reached their final destination, often Germany or Sweden rather than southern nations such as Greece where they first entered the EU.

GPEA expects the deal to allow its agents to tap customers going online to search for houses, helping its existing network of members in the Guild of Property Professionals and the Fine & Country organisation.  As consumer behaviours have changed... there is a move towards people searching for their space and services in a different way,  said Jon Cooke, executive director of The Guild and Fine & Country who will be CEO of the combined firm.  Where the customer wants to have a tech-enabled offering, online, do-it-yourself at a fixed fee, then we believe we will be able to offer that to them under the easyProperty brand,  he told Reuters. The deal is expected to complete by the end of this month. E-Prop Services Plc, as the combined firm will be known, is just one of many firms clamouring for dominance in the online market, whose growing popularity has forced shop-based incumbents such as Countrywide to invest to catch up. Cooke said by leveraging GPEA's network of 5,000 property professionals he hoped to consolidate E-Prop's position as number two online behind Purplebricks, the Neil Woodfood-backed online firm.  There are quite a few other players doing this at the moment with the online space and we believe there'll be two main players, a bit like there are in the portal market with Rightmove and Zoopla,  Cooke said.  The combination of a consumer-facing brand.... and a footprint of well-trained compliant property independent estate agents across the UK will mean that we're able to be that second player pretty quickly,  he added. The deal would see GPEA as well as hedge fund Toscafund, which has part-funded the deal, become majority investors, while the investors of easyProperty, which was co-founded by businessman Stelios Haji-Ioannou, would hold the rest. He declined to specific what each party's stake would be. $1 = 0.7728 pounds Reporting by Esha Vaish in Bengaluru; Editing by Keith Weir","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/easyproperty-ma-idUSL3N1J539R"},

With their margins squeezed by the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy, regional banks have stepped up investment on assets vulnerable to interest-rate risk, such as foreign bonds. Under the rule, from the fiscal year ending in March 2019, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) will consult with regional banks whose estimated losses on bond holdings exceed 20 percent of their capital to decide how to ease the situation, the sources said. Details of the new regulation, which will enable the FSA to issue a business improvement order to the concerned financial institutions, are set to be unveiled soon to solicit opinions, the sources added. FSA officials were not immediately available for comment.   Earlier on Thursday, the Nikkei business daily said the step  aimed to prevent regional banks from relying too much on revenues from bond investment and nudge them to boost lending.

Leaders in the northeastern Spanish region will set a date for the vote, a spokesman for regional head Carles Puigdemont said, bringing to a head years of court battles and political clashes with the central government over the independence movement. The vote has been flagged for after the summer. Previous secessionist challenges in Catalonia, after the  long-running independence drive began to gather more popular support during an economic crisis, were blocked by Spain's conservative government, which appealed to the Constitutional Court. Pro-independence campaigners staged a symbolic ballot on splitting from Spain, organized by volunteers rather than government officials to get around court restrictions, in 2014, months after Scots voted to stay in the United Kingdom.  About 2 million people voted in favor of seceding in Catalonia in that non-binding ballot, though turnaround was relatively low in a populous and wealthy region that makes up around a fifth of Spain's economic output.  More legal wranglings are now likely to follow this referendum announcement, which could culminate in regional elections in Catalonia if plans to hold the vote are quashed, a central government source said.  Under Article 155 of Spain's constitution, Madrid has the power to intervene directly in the running of Catalonia's regional government, forcing it to drop the vote and obey the law. This could involve sending in the police or suspending the regional government's ruling authority in the industrial region, which has its own language and capital city Barcelona. This is widely seen as a last resort move, however.  Catalans, like Spain's other 16 autonomous regions, already have power over health and education spending. The region says the central government takes much more than it gives back under Spain's complicated system of budget transfers. This feeling contributed to a surge of pro-independence fervor during Spain's worst years of recession at the beginning of this decade.  The pro-independence movement has lost support since Spain returned to economic growth. The last poll showed that 44.3 percent backed a split from Spain, while 48.5 percent want to continue with the status quo. However, a majority of Catalans do want to hold a referendum on the question of independence, polls show.

Communist Vietnam has slowly been pushing its state-owned enterprises to privatise to boost performance. The process has gained momentum since a new government took office last year. The firm, which has registered capital of 4.5 trillion dong ($198.34 million), plans to sell a 30 percent stake to strategic partners and 18.82 percent to the public in the IPO, a statement on the government website said. The government by the end of 2019 will lower its stake to 51 percent and will reduce it to below 50 percent the following year. The IPO prices will be decided by the construction minister who will also set the criterion for choosing strategic partners. Song Da Corp is the main contractor for most hydro power projects in Vietnam and has also built major infrastructure including tunnels, highways and factories.

With their margins squeezed by the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy, regional banks have stepped up investment on assets vulnerable to interest-rate risk, such as foreign bonds. Under the rule, from the fiscal year ending in March 2019, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) will consult with regional banks whose estimated losses on bond holdings exceed 20 percent of their capital to decide how to ease the situation, the sources said. Details of the new regulation, which will enable the FSA to issue a business improvement order to the concerned financial institutions, are set to be unveiled soon to solicit opinions, the sources added. FSA officials were not immediately available for comment.   Earlier on Thursday, the Nikkei business daily said the step  aimed to prevent regional banks from relying too much on revenues from bond investment and nudge them to boost lending. The new regulation will target Japan's 95 banks that do not have overseas operations, including Aozora Bank (8304.T), Shinsei Bank (8303.T) and Resona bank (8308.T), the paper said.

A deal next week on unblocking new loans for Greece is seen as crucial to prevent Athens from defaulting on debts due in July. Representatives of euro zone states are meeting on Thursday in Slovenia to try to overcome a months-long stalemate over the Greek programme, before finance ministers hold a regular meeting in Luxembourg on June 15.  It's time to move with the next disbursement,  Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels, stressing that Greece had already met its fiscal and reform obligations for the funds to be disbursed. Dombrovskis said delays in unblocking loans to Greece, part of its 86-billion-euro ($96.6 billion) bailout programme, have already hit confidence in the Greek economy. The disbursement of new loans has been linked to the International Monetary Fund's participation in the aid programme. This has not been agreed yet due to differences between the IMF and some euro zone lenders on debt relief measures for Greece and its long-term financial stability. Dombrovskis said debt relief measures were being discussed, but insisted the priority was to disburse new loans to Greece.

A prolonged or deepening rift between Qatar and its GCC neighbors would potentially have a more marked financial effect and increase funding costs for the sovereign and other Qatari entities,  Moody's told clients. It currently rates Qatar at Aa3 with a stable outlook, or seven notches above junk.   An escalation could include restrictions on capital flows, which would be negative for Qatari banks' liquidity and funding,  Moody's said, adding that total external debt was 150 percent of gross domestic product.  Eight mostly Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates this week severed diplomatic relations with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member Qatar while also suspending air, land and sea transport and imposing travel bans. Rival ratings agency S&P; Global cut its rating on Qatar on Wednesday to AA- and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there was a significant chance of a further downgrade.

The Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), the foreign-currency senior unsecured rating and the rating on the USD250 million senior unsecured notes due in 2024 have been affirmed at 'BB-'. The notes are issued by Pakuwon Prima Pte Ltd and guaranteed by Pakuwon and some of its subsidiaries. The Outlook revision reflects Fitch's expectations that the scale and asset granularity of Indonesia-based Pakuwon's investment property (IP) portfolio will improve to levels commensurate with a higher rating over the next one to two years as the company continues to ramp up its portfolio. Fitch expects Pakuwon to continue to manage its development property business conservatively, and also views its development property risk as manageable, so long as the company maintains positive cash flow from operations (CFO). KEY RATING DRIVERS Solid Investment Property Portfolio: Pakuwon's ratings reflect its strong IP portfolio, which is driven mainly by its mall operations and generated around 75% of its total recurring revenue in 2016. Pakuwon's malls have around 94% occupancy rates, weighted by net leasable area, and have lease expiry profiles of around five years on average. Fitch expects Pakuwon's recurring EBITDA/net interest coverage ratio to remain above 2.5x, and recurring EBITDA to comfortably cover loan amortisation and dividend payment in 2017-2019. Pakuwon operates mainly superblocks that consist of a retail mall, office towers, a hotel and often high-quality residential developments. This significantly increases the value and appeal of each individual property within the superblock. However, given the interlinked-nature of the assets, Fitch measures Pakuwon's asset concentration on a superblock basis, rather than on an individual-asset basis. Nevertheless, the company's solid track record in developing high quality IPs, reflected in its sustained strong occupancy and robust recurring EBITDA growth, has led Fitch to relax the asset-concentration threshold required for a higher rating to 70% from 60%. Furthermore, Fitch also adjusts the measure for Pakuwon's interest coverage by using net interest, as we expect the company to maintain a healthy cash balance and therefore generate healthy interest income to partly offset its interest costs. Improving Property Demand: Fitch expects Pakuwon to book property presales of around IDR2.5 trillion in 2017, supported by improving macro-economic fundamentals and more positive sentiment domestically on the back of a reasonably successful tax amnesty program. Nevertheless, there may be short-term risks to demand, especially on higher-end properties, as the recent introduction of the financial transparency regulation, which gives the tax and financial authorities access to the banking information of Indonesian citizens, may lead consumers to defer spending on big-ticket items. Pakuwon's 1Q17 presales rose 10% yoy to IDR654 billion, about 28% of Fitch's 2017 forecast. Conservatively Managed Development Risk: Fitch views that Pakuwon's smaller development property scale relative to its peers is compensated by its ability to generate positive CFO on a sustained basis. Fitch believes this is because the company mostly funds its development property business through customer advances, and its strategy is to use recurring EBITDA to cover interest payments, loan amortisation and dividends. Pakuwon's focus on developing brownfield projects, whereby its current development pipeline is mostly situated in and around its existing projects, also helps the company to de-risk its development cash flows and reduce working capital needs. Conservative Financial Policy and Leverage: Pakuwon has maintained a conservative financial profile and has a track record of low leverage over the last four to five years. In 2013-2016, Pakuwon has managed to keep its leverage (adjusted net debt/adjusted inventory ratio) below the negative trigger of 35% and maintained its net debt/EBITDA ratio at around 1x. Fitch forecasts Pakuwon's leverage to remain around 24% in 2017 (2016: 26%) and to decline to 11% by 2019 in line with our expectation that property demand is likely to improve. Manageable US Dollar Exposure: Pakuwon uses call-spread options to hedge the foreign currency risk on its US dollar notes, covering Indonesian rupiah depreciation between 13,500-16,500 per US dollar across the full notional principal of its bonds. Even without the benefits of the hedge, Fitch estimates that if the rupiah depreciates further to 15,000 per dollar, Pakuwon's recurring EBITDA net interest cover will still remain above 2x. DERIVATION SUMMARY Pakuwon's rating compares strongly against other 'BB-' property developers, such as PT Bumi Serpong Damai Tbk (BSD; BB-/Stable), PT Agung Podomoro Land Tbk (APLN; BB-/Stable) and Lai Fung Holdings Limited (LF; BB-/Stable). Relative to BSD, Fitch believes that Pakuwon's smaller development property portfolio and higher IP asset  concentration is counterbalanced by its strong CFO generation, larger investment property scale, higher recurring EBITDA net interest cover, and the stronger quality of its IP assets. We expect Pakuwon's IP concentration to drop materially by 2019 and its leverage to remain lower than BSD's. Pakuwon and APLN have similar development property scales. Although Pakuwon's development properties are more geographically concentrated than APLN's, the risks are mitigated by Pakuwon's strong CFO generation. Pakuwon also has a larger investment property scale, stronger recurring EBITDA net interest cover, and better asset quality than APLN. Compared to LF, Pakuwon's recurring EBITDA and property development scale are considerably larger, with recurring EBITDA net interest cover ratio well above LF's. Pakuwon's larger and growing recurring EBITDA scale, improving asset granularity, strong CFO generation, and low leverage justifies the Positive Outlook on its rating, even after accounting for the higher country-risk inherent in Indonesia compared to China. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Presales of around IDR2.5 trillion in 2017 and around IDR3 trillion in 2018. - Recurring EBITDA margin of above 50% in 2017 and 2018. - Construction capex of around IDR1.7 trillion-1.8 trillion in 2017 and 2018 - Land acquisition capex of IDR250 billion in 2017 and IDR200 billion in 2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to an Upgrade - Sustained generation of positive CFO - Growth in Pakuwon's investment property portfolio such that its recurring EBITDA improves to above USD120 million (2017F: USD107 million) - Recurring EBITDA/net interest expense sustained above 3x (2017F: 2.5x) - Improving asset granularity, as indicated by its three largest superblock assets generating less than 70% of recurring revenue (2017F: 77%) The Outlook may be revised back to Stable if the company fails to meet the positive rating triggers. LIQUIDITY As of December 2016, Pakuwon had cash balances of IDR2.4 trillion and committed unused facilities of around IDR1.5 trillion, which are adequate to cover short-term debt maturities of IDR770 billion, construction capex of IDR1.7 trillion and discretionary land acquisition capex of IDR250 billion in 2017. In early 2017, Pakuwon also issued a USD250 million bond, which was used to refinance its USD200 million bond. This issuance has extended the maturity profile of the company's debt, and allows for more flexibility in managing cash flows.

Fitch has also deducted minority interests from the calculation of leverage to reflect the minorities' stake.

Residential property developers, which include firms such as PIK (PIKK.MM), LSR (LSRG.MM) and Etalon (ETLNGq.L), have been hit hard by Russia's economic downturn, with some struggling to sell apartments they have built and burdened with debt. Sales fell by as much as 30 percent in 2015 and although the market started to recover last year, Moscow's resettlement plan, which aims to move almost a tenth of its population out of ageing low-rise apartment buildings known as  khrushchyovki , had been seen as a potential lifeline. In previous smaller city programs, real estate companies were able to sell some of the flats in a block in exchange for building it and had hoped this approach would be used again.  There will be no developers... Those who have construction facilities can take part in a tender and in the event of victory will get an order as contractors,  Marat Khusnullin said of the plan to move people into new homes. Acting as contractors will deliver margins several times lower for property firms than if they were developers. Deputy Mayor of Moscow Marat Khusnullin poses for a picture during an interview in Moscow, Russia, May 17, 2017. Picture taken May 17, 2017.Maxim ShemetovPavel Bryzgalov, director for strategic development at Lider, one of Moscow's biggest real estate companies, said his firm was interested in acting as a contractor but would want to be able to act as co-developer too.   Its important for the development companies to have the option to offer part of the flats for the sale,  Bryzgalov said. Plan Sparks Protests  Khusnullin said 15.1 million square meters - or some 350,000 flats - would be demolished and replaced with 20 million square meters of new residential space under the 15 year program.  Thousands of Muscovites protested against the scheme on May 14, with some living in buildings scheduled for demolition saying they do not want to move unless they have guarantees about where they will be resettled. Moscow has said it will spend 300 billion rubles ($5.33 billion) from its own budget during the first three years. The estimated cost of the whole project is around 3 trillion rubles which should also come from the city's funds, Khusnullin said.   He did not comment directly on whether Moscow would need to raise debt, but asked if Moscow would seek help from the federal budget said:  So far, the city budget allows us to implement such a program.  Some developers had hoped they could sell unsold apartments to the city as part of the resettlement scheme, but Khusnullin said Moscow does not plan to buy any, as the city can offer only around a half of what developers would ask for them.  We don't have the cash to buy at such a price,  he said.

A prolonged or deepening rift between Qatar and its GCC neighbors would potentially have a more marked financial effect and increase funding costs for the sovereign and other Qatari entities,  Moody's told clients. It currently rates Qatar at Aa3 with a stable outlook, or seven notches above junk.   An escalation could include restrictions on capital flows, which would be negative for Qatari banks' liquidity and funding,  Moody's said, adding that total external debt was 150 percent of gross domestic product.  Eight mostly Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates this week severed diplomatic relations with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member Qatar while also suspending air, land and sea transport and imposing travel bans. Rival ratings agency S&P; Global cut its rating on Qatar on Wednesday to AA- and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there was a significant chance of a further downgrade.

The bonds' Recovery Rating is 'RR5'. The size of the issue is likely to be in the range of USD85 million. The final rating is subject to the receipt of the final documentation conforming to information already received by Fitch. The notes qualify as Basel III-complaint Tier 2 instruments and contain contractual loss absorption features, which will be triggered at the point of non-viability of the bank. According to the draft terms, the notes are subject to permanent partial or full write-down upon the occurrence of a non-viability event (NVE). There are no equity conversion provisions in the terms. An NVE is defined as occurring when the bank has incurred losses and has become, or is likely to become, non-viable as determined by the local regulator, the Banking and Regulatory Supervision Authority (BRSA). The bank will be deemed non-viable when it reaches the point at which either the BRSA determines that its operating licence is to be revoked and the bank liquidated, or the rights of Sekerbank's shareholders (except to dividends), and the management and supervision of the bank, should be transferred to the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund on the condition that losses are deducted from the capital of existing shareholders. The notes have an expected 10-year maturity and a call option after five years. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated one notch below Sekerbank's Viability Rating (VR) of 'b+' in accordance with Fitch's  Global Bank Rating Criteria . The notching includes zero notches for incremental non-performance risk relative to the VR and one notch for loss severity. Fitch has applied zero notches for incremental non-performance risk, as the agency believes that write-down of the notes will only occur once the point of non-viability is reached and there is no coupon flexibility prior to non-viability. The one notch for loss severity reflects Fitch's view of below-average recovery prospects for the notes in case of an NVE. Fitch has applied one notch, rather than two, for loss severity, as partial, and not solely full, write-down of the notes is possible. In Fitch's view, there is some uncertainty as to the extent of losses the notes would face in case of an NVE, given that this would be dependent on the size of the operating losses incurred by the bank and any measures taken by the authorities to help restore the bank's viability. RATING SENSITIVITIES As the notes are notched down from Sekerbank's VR, their rating is sensitive to a change in this rating. The notes' rating is also sensitive to a change in notching due to a revision in Fitch's assessment of the probability of the notes' non-performance risk relative to the risk captured in Sekerbank's VR, or in its assessment of loss severity in case of non-performance. Sekerbank's ratings are listed below: Long-Term Foreign Currency (FC) and Local Currency (LC) IDRs 'B+'; Outlook Stable Short-term FC and LC IDRs 'B' Viability Rating 'b+' Support Rating '5' Support Rating Floor 'No Floor' National Long-term Rating 'A/(tur)'; Outlook Negative Basel III-compliant Tier 2 notes: 'B(EXP)'; Recovery Rating 'RR5' Contact: Primary Analyst Lindsey Liddell Director +44 20 3530 1008 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Ahmet Kilinc Associate Director +44 20 3530 1272 Committee Chairperson James Watson Managing Director +48 22 338 62 92 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

At the same time Fitch has withdrawn the bank's ratings for commercial reasons. Fitch will no long provide rating and analytical coverage of Pivdennyi. KEY RATING DRIVERS Pivdennyi's IDRs are driven by the bank's standalone credit profile, as expressed by the 'ccc' VR. The VR factors in the bank's weak asset quality, limited additional loss absorption capacity and modest core profitability that make the bank's credit profile highly vulnerable to further recognition of asset impairment. Individually impaired loans (including 7% of loans more than 90 days overdue) remained significant, at 25% of gross loans at end-2016, only moderately (52%) covered by impairment reserves, as the bank relies on loan collateral. Additional downside risks to asset quality stem from high borrower concentrations and FX lending (64% of net loans), mostly to weakly-hedged borrowers. We do not expect material improvements in asset quality metrics in the near term as Ukraine's economic recovery is only moderate and operating conditions remain challenging both for banks and businesses. Pivdennyi's regulatory capital buffer (regulatory total capital ratio of 10% at end-3Q16) provides low loss absorption capacity, while the bank is yet to complete its medium-term recapitalisation programme, as agreed with the National Bank of Ukraine in 2015. We expect pressure on the bank's capital to remain significant in light of large unreserved impaired loans (estimated at 75% of Fitch Core Capital at end-2016) and modest core pre-impairment profits (net of non-core revenues) equal to 1.7% of average gross loans in 2016. Pivdennyi's deposit funding remained generally stable in 2016-1Q17, in line with sector trends, while reliance on wholesale markets is limited. The bank's liquidity management, in particular in FX, is highly dependent on access to FX liquidity through the bank's Latvian subsidiary and certain non-resident companies (together comprising about 30% of Pivdennyi's liabilities at end-1Q17). Should access to this funding become constrained, the bank's FX liquidity position would likely weaken significantly. RATING SENSITIVITIES Not applicable.

At the same time the agency has upgraded RSA Insurance Group plc's Long-Term IDR to 'A-' from 'BBB+'.  The Outlooks on the IFS rating and IDRs are Stable. The subordinated debt and capital securities guaranteed by RSA (GBP46.97 million 2039, GBP400 million 2045, and GBP27.96 million perpetual) have been affirmed at 'BBB'. Restricted Tier 1 notes issued by RSA Insurance Group plc (SEK2,500 million, DKK650 million) have been upgraded to 'BB+' from 'BB'. Fitch previously applied a difference of one notch between operating and holding company IDRs as more than 30% of RSA's earnings and capital were sourced from countries that are expected to ring-fence regulatory capital resources in a stressed scenario (even if a group solvency approach is applied locally). However, as RSA has now completed its disposals and restructuring programme, the proportion of earnings and capital associated with  ring-fence  regulatory environments is less than 30% and we expect this to remain stable as RSA is focusing its strategy on the core markets - the UK and Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada. Therefore we have now compressed the notching between the operating company and holding company IDRs to reflect our expectation of lower probability of default at the holding company. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of RSA reflects its strengthened capital position, improving underwriting performance and a leading position in its core markets, along with a low-risk investment portfolio. Offsetting factors are RSA's low debt servicing ability driven by weak operating performance due to ongoing restructuring costs since 2013. At end-2016, RSA's risk-adjusted capitalisation was 'Very Strong', as measured by Fitch's Prism Factor Based Model (FBM). At end-2016 RSA remained at the upper end of its target Solvency II coverage range of 130%-160% with a coverage of 158% (end-2015: 143%). RSA strengthened its capital position by replacing GBP200 million of subordinated debt with SEK2,500 million and DKK650 million restricted Tier 1 (RT1) contingent convertible notes issued in March 2017. This action is positive for RSA's Fitch-calculated financial leverage ratio and capital adequacy. RSA reported a group underwriting profit of GBP380 million in 2016 (2015: GBP220 million) and a combined ratio of 94% (2015: 97%). This was underpinned by strong performance of the three core segments: the UK, Scandinavia and Canada. The robust underwriting results were supported by a number of initiatives RSA implemented recently, including optimising pricing and claims processes, investing in new IT infrastructure and focusing on underwriting discipline and cost control. RSA's debt servicing ability is low for the ratings, with a Fitch-calculated fixed-charge coverage ratio of 2x due to ongoing restructuring costs. RSA's operating performance improved in 2016, although these improvements were offset by restructuring and debt buy-back costs. Net income fell to GBP27 million (2015: GBP235 million) equivalent to 1% return on equity (ROE). As RSA has now completed its three-year restructuring programme, Fitch expects its overall performance and fixed-charge coverage to improve in 2017. Fitch believes that RSA's ability to achieve and maintain a leading position in the group's core markets is a positive rating factor, as it offers greater flexibility and influence over the premium rating environment in these territories. The group has leading positions in its main markets - it is the third-largest non-life insurer in the UK, with the fifth- and sixth-largest market positions in Scandinavia and Canada, respectively. RSA continues to adhere to a conservative investment strategy, with a focus on high quality fixed income instruments. Fitch believes RSA has a high-quality investment portfolio, which does not expose the insurer's capital to significant risks. The portfolio is focused on fixed-income instruments and cash with limited exposure to equities. RATING SENSITIVITIES Failure to maintain a Fitch-calculated combined ratio lower than 100% (2016: 95%) could lead to a downgrade. The ratings could also be downgraded if the net income ROE remains below 6% on a sustained basis (2016: 1%). Continued improvement in operating performance as evidenced by a net income ROE greater than 10%, combined with a Prism FBM score of 'Very Strong', could lead to an upgrade.

Yields - which move inversely to prices - nudged off multi-week lows as a meeting of the bloc's monetary guardians shifted the focus away from geopolitical events that have seen investors stock up on safe-haven bonds in recent days. While cautious tightening from the ECB had long been earmarked in investors' diaries, a discussion by a BOJ policymaker about future plans to scale back its bond-buying scheme took some by surprise as Japan is still toiling with stubbornly low inflation.  The reason we are a bit under pressure today is because from a number of angles being long (bonds) doesn't look that compelling anymore,  RBC's global macro strategist Peter Schaffrik said.  Whether that extends into a more prolonged sell-off, we'll have to see.  German 10-year government bond yields, the bloc's benchmark, edged up 3 basis points to 0.28 percent, moving away from a six-week low of 0.245 percent hit Wednesday. Most other euro zone equivalents were 1-3 bps higher on the day. Earlier, short-dated Japanese bond yields hit their highest level since February. While the ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.59 trillion) bond-buying programme and sub-zero interest rates, sources told Reuters it will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement. RBC also expects subtle changes to its forward guidance to remove a reference to possible further cuts to interest rates. But any announcement on its quantitative easing (QE) programme is likely to be put off until the autumn, when policymakers hope the economic picture will have become clearer. Aside from the focus on monetary policy, analysts said there was broad relief across financial markets after former FBI director James Comey's testimony on the bureau's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election revealed little in the way of new details. Investors have viewed this saga as a distraction for President Donald Trump, on whom they are pinning hopes to reflate the world's biggest economy with ambitious spending plans. U.S. 10-year bond yields rose 2 bps on Thursday to a six-day high of 2.2 percent Italian government bonds bucked the broader trend, finding demand after a report that Italian banks are considering assisting in a rescue of troubled lenders Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca.

Santana homered for the third time in six contests and improved to 10-for-29 with eight runs scored this month following Wednesday's 6-3 victory. Like Santana, Jesus Aguilar has recorded back-to-back multi-hit performances and is hitting .328 over his last 23 games for National League Central-leading Milwaukee. While the Brewers have won three of four overall to move within one game of .500 at home, the Giants have dropped four of their last five and fell to 11-23 on the road heading into the finale of their seven-game trek. Buster Posey launched a two-run homer on Wednesday to improve to 14-for-34 with seven RBIs and five runs scored during his nine-game hitting streak. Brandon Belt has recorded four hits in the series and scored a run in five of his last six contests. TV: 2:10 p.m. ET, MLB Network, NBCSN Bay Arena (San Francisco) PITCHING MATCHUP: Giants RH Johnny Cueto (5-5, 4.38 ERA) vs. Brewers RH Paolo Espino (0-0, 4.50) Cueto fell to 1-4 in his last six outings on Saturday despite allowing three runs and striking out nine in six innings of a 5-3 setback to Philadelphia. The 31-year-old Dominican has worked at least six frames in each of his last eight starts, although a lack of run support and his penchant for surrendering home runs haven't helped his cause. Facing Milwaukee likely brings a smile to the face of Cueto, who has won eight in a row against the Brewers and owns an 11-3 record with a 1.02 WHIP in his career while limiting the club to a .228 batting average. Espino was summoned to start Thursday's tilt in lieu of the injured Matt Garza, who was placed on the disabled list as he continues to deal with lingering effects from a chest contusion sustained during a collision with Aguilar. The 30-year-old Espino has performed admirably with a 3.44 ERA in nine starts at Colorado Springs and weathered the storm over four rainy innings against the Chicago Cubs in his major-league debut on May 19. Espino allowed three runs and five hits while striking out three and not walking a batter against the Cubs. Walk-Offs 1. San Francisco INF Eduardo Nunez is 6-for-13 with four runs scored in the series and 15-for-39 during his nine-game hitting streak. 2. Milwaukee CF Keon Broxton is hitless in his last four contests and is 4-for-43 in his last 13. 3.

Breivik was seeking to overturn a March decision by a Norwegian appeals court that ruled that his near-isolation in a three-room cell respected human rights.  The anti-Muslim far-right extremist killed 77 people in Norway's worst peacetime atrocity in July 2011. He killed eight with a bomb in Oslo and then gunned down 69, many of them teenagers, at a youth meeting of the then-ruling Labour Party. His appeal had raised dismay, and some laughter, among Norwegians taken aback by Breivik's complaints of cold coffee and microwaved meals he said were  worse than waterboarding .   The Supreme Court's appeal commission has unanimously decided on June 8, 2017 to not further consider Anders Behring Breivik's appeal in the case Breivik has brought against the state,  the court said in a statement.  No part of Breivik's appeal has the possibility of winning in front of the Supreme Court,  it added.  Neither does the case raise questions about the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights that have not already been clarified extensively by the European Court of Human Rights.  Breivik has been told of the Supreme Court's decision, Mona Danielsen, one of his lawyers, told Reuters. She declined to say how he reacted.  Survivors and relatives of the victims welcomed the decision.   I am very happy. This is very good news and shows that our justice system is working,  said Lisbeth Kristine Roeyneland, whose daughter Synne, 18, was shot dead in Breivik's rampage. She leads the main support group for survivors and victims' relatives.   This ensures that we are not going to see the terrorist for many, many years,  she told Reuters.  Good,  said Eskil Pedersen, a survivor of the shooting, on Twitter, linking to the Supreme Court's decision. Oeystein Storrvik, another Breivik lawyer, said he would appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  We will take this case to Strasbourg as soon as possible,  he told Reuters.  When we took up the case, we knew that it would be possible we would not be successful in the Norwegian justice system.

Trump promised tax cuts during his election campaign last year and has reiterated those promises in recent months leading some wealthy Americans and businesses to shift accounting for income into the future, betting that lower tax rates will arrive, perhaps in 2018, wealth managers told Reuters.  Everyone wants to talk about deferring income,  said Mark Copeland, senior partner at Signature Estate & Investment Advisors LLC in Newport Beach, California. The U.S. stock market has also rallied since Trump's election victory in November, partly on hopes for lower corporate tax rates. “We are starting to prepare clients for potentially lower taxes in 2018,  said Julia Carlson, chief executive and at Financial Freedom Wealth Management Group LLC in Oregon. Trump promised to cut taxes as far back as September 2015 in a four-page plan and reiterated those promises in a two-page  Contract with the American Voter  before last November's election and again in a one-page document in April, but Republicans in Congress remain divided on tax reform. The delay to tax payments could help to explain why tax receipts this fiscal year are coming in more slowly than projected, said tax experts and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), an arm of Congress.  Taxpayers may have shifted more income than projected ... to later years, expecting legislation to reduce tax rates to be enacted this year,  the CBO said in a monthly report on Wednesday. The weaker tax revenues this year have forced the U.S. Treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit and that is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts said. The U.S. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion and the limit can only be increased by a vote of Congress. The need to raise the debt limit usually creates partisan debate in Washington. Conservative Republicans like to use the debt limit issue as leverage to demand cuts in spending but Democrats and moderate Republicans usually oppose such ultimatums on the grounds that the borrowings are used to fund spending approved previously by Congress. This year, with Trump's legislative agenda stalled and Congress preoccupied by Trump's firing of former FBI director James Comey, the House Republicans known as the House Freedom Caucus along with outside conservative groups are again demanding spending cuts for support to raise the debt limit. In 2011 the failure to raise the debt limit in a timely way and the possibility that the U.S. government might default on its obligations led to the U.S. losing its prized triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor's. Since mid-March the U.S. Treasury has been using emergency funding powers to postpone hitting the debt limit and those measures had been expected to last until about October, but lower tax receipts so far this year may mean the debt limit will be hit sooner-than-expected. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress last month to raise the debt ceiling before lawmakers break for a long August summer recess, a call echoed last week by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Hudson's Bay, which operates its namesake chain in Canada, bought Saks in 2013 for $2.4 billion. It also owns Lord & Taylor in the United States, leading German department store chain Kaufhof, and has plans to open the first international Hudson's Bay stores in the Netherlands. The retailer, which reports first quarter results on Thursday, announced plans last September for the largest Saks store in Canada, a 200,000 square-foot (18,580 sq meter) flagship in Montreal. At the time, the company said the building, which already houses a Hudson's Bay store, would undergo an  extensive  multimillion-dollar renovation. With North American department stores reporting dismal sales, shuttering outlets, and cutting costs, squeezed by online competitors like Amazon.com Inc, several retail industry consultants said a re-evaluation or delay of the project would come as no surprise. City spokeswoman Anik de Repentigny told Reuters Montreal has not received a permit application for the property, which includes refacing a portion of the exterior, according to an artist's rendering released last September. In a statement, Hudson's Bay spokeswoman Tiffany Bourre reiterated the company's intention to bring Saks Fifth Avenue to Montreal, but declined to comment on specifics including whether the project was delayed, or when it will apply for a permit. Any potential delay could mean missing the crucial holiday shopping season, industry consultants said.  The importance of being open for the holiday period cannot be underestimated,  said Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet said.  If we're thinking fall of 2018, we're 15 months out ... Certainly we would expect delays - it would be a question of how long,  said Sally Seston, a principal at Retail Category Consultants, adding that department stores across the spectrum are struggling. Saks has two full-line stores in Canada, both in Toronto, and a Calgary location set to open in January 2018. One retail consultant familiar with Hudson's Bay stores but not involved with the Montreal project, said the lack of a permit application was a  tell-tale  sign.  If you look at the physical premise, I can't imagine they would meet their deadline,  said the consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid poisoning relations with the company. It took some 19 months, from the time when permits were issued, before the 170,000 square foot Saks store in downtown Toronto opened in February 2016, behind its fall 2015 schedule. Montreal spokeswoman de Repentigny said factors including project complexity would determine how long it takes to issue a permit, noting that more than 90 percent of permits for the downtown borough were issued in under 120 days last year. Hudson's Bay spokeswoman Bourre said the company was still working through the details. Several industry consultants also question why the high-end retailer would open its largest store in Montreal, a market known for fashion, but smaller and less affluent than Toronto. Hudson's Bay does not break down sales by country, but the Saks luxury chain, which had a total of 41 locations as of Jan. 28, reported an overall drop in same-store sales in four of the last five quarters, including a 4.8 percent fall in the first quarter of 2017.  There is this concern they really aren't doing the numbers that they had thought they were going to do,  said Maureen Atkinson, senior partner with global retail advisor, J.C. Williams Group, of the Toronto locations.

The company said on Thursday that it will use the funding on research and development initiatives aimed at enhancing its technology. Addepar has developed software that helps wealth managers view information on their clients' assets that might be spread out across various accounts.   Ultra-wealthy clients typically hold their assets in family trusts, limited partnerships or in alternative and illiquid investments spread across several banks and accounts. This means financial advisors will often gather and compile information into one spreadsheet through a protracted process rather than meeting with clients.  Wealth managers, especially the ones serving larger and more complex clients, often times have challenges in giving each client an accurate view of everything they own,  said Eric Poirier, chief executive of Addepar, in an interview. The company's platform allows wealth management firms, with client's permission, to gather information from various accounts in one place, Poirer said. Addepar is among the growing group of young technology companies that are seeking to help established financial institutions improve their technology across a wide range of functions, including anti-money laundering checks to client-interface software.  While the firm has so far focused on wealth management firms, Poirier said it had received inquiries from other buy-side companies such as pension funds.  Poirier said the firm has been growing rapidly, with its clients managing more than $650 billion through its platform, up from $300 billion 18 months ago. In January Morgan Stanley (MS.N)  said it was rolling out Addepar's platform to 20 of its top financial advisory teams.

Price swings for corn, soybeans and wheat futures following the release of the government's biggest agriculture reports, which provide a window into global demand as well as production, have fallen sharply this year. The depressed volatility on what have typically been the most active trading days of the month is weighing on the bottom line of even the biggest traders such as Bunge Ltd and Archer Daniels Midland Co. The massive grain handlers, who use the futures market both to hedge their physical purchases as well as trade it for profits, have cited slow market action as one of the reasons for weakening profitability at their operations.  If you are only moving ... 5 cents off of those reports, you cannot expect to buy or sell the market and try and make 7 cents,  said Tom Burnham, trade strategist at INTL FCStone.  In general, traders prefer more volatility and more surprises.  The price swings that come after the government's monthly supply and demand reports, acreage estimates and quarterly stocks views are down 26.88 percent from 2016, according to an analysis of Reuters data. The daily moves on report days in 2017 are 45.83 percent below the average of the previous 10 years. In 2017, corn, soybean and wheat futures have averaged just a 1.17 percent price move on major report days. That compares with an average move of 2.16 percent on report days during the previous 10 years. In 2016, the average move was 1.60 percent. USDA will release its next supply and demand report on Friday at 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT). Supplies Insulate Market Bumper crops around the world have muted the impact of the monthly reports from the government, which used to frequently spark limit moves within minutes of their release time.  The surprises are not big enough to move the markets a long way,  said Randy Fortenbery, professor and chair of small grains economics at Washington State University.  The bigger the stocks are, the bigger surprise it takes to move the market in one direction or another.  In the past, post-report rallies provided an opportunity for farmers to lock in prices that would guarantee they booked a profit for crops they had yet to seed or grains that they had been holding in storage. So far this year, U.S. farmers who have been keeping massive crops in storage bins have seen the biggest rally following a report top out at 7-1/2 cents for corn and 25 cents for soybeans. The daily limits are 25 cents and 70 cents, respectively. The small moves have been keeping some traders away from the futures market altogether. On the day the USDA released its May supply and demand report, which gives the government's first estimate of new-crop usage and production, the volume for the most-active soybean contract was only 29.8 percent above the average for the whole month of May. A year earlier, soybean volume on the day of the May report was 90.9 percent above the May average. For wheat, volume for the most-active contract was 15.0 percent above the monthly average, compared with 26.9 percent higher in 2016. Corn volume was 45.0 percent higher than the May average, comparable to 46.5 percent in 2016.

A small number of brokers and their managers have been fired as a result, the bank said. ABN became aware of the problem in 2016 and reported it to Dutch regulators, who agreed the bank should launch an internal investigation reviewing all its mortgage case files since 2013.  Every copied signature is one too many and remains impermissible,  said Frans van der Horst, head of ABN Amro's retail bank, who oversaw the investigation.  But, given the complexity we created for our people, I understand the dilemma we put our advisers in. As an organization, we are also to blame.  Signatures were copied when final terms of a mortgage loan deviated from the initial proposal, requiring customers to sign again under the bank's own compliance rules. The incident is an embarrassment for the bank, which is especially sensitive over its public image after its 2008 bailout by the Dutch government. After shedding thousands of jobs, it was reprivatised in 2015, promoting itself as a reliable, ethical bank focused on serving Dutch customers. Pressed for details on dismissals, a bank spokesman said several mortgage advisors and several more managers were dismissed.

As a long-term initiative, we are reaching out to business prospects in developing wholesale business in the U.S.,  Cheng said in an earnings statement, adding the company will continue to optimise its retail network. To tap the demand of Chinese customers overseas, China's largest jeweller by market value launched three point of sales (PoS) in Korea, Malaysia and the U.S. in the previous fiscal year that ended in March. Net profit came in at HK$3.06 billion ($392.5 million) for the year ended in March, from HK$2.94 billion profit a year ago, snapping two consecutive years of decline. That matched HK$3.1 billion forecast by SmartEstimate. Revenue for the 12-month period slipped 9.4 percent to HK$51.25 billion from HK$56.59 billion in the same period last year as lower purchases by mainland tourists continued to affect the sales volume. Same-store sales of its jewellery business in mainland China fell 5.2 percent for the year, while that in Hong Kong and Macau plunged 12.4 percent. Chow Tai Fook plans to launch 70-100 PoS in China this fiscal year, but may close five non-efficient stores in Hong Kong due to high rentals and feeble sales. As of end-March, company's retail strength expanded to 2,381 PoS, including China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, compared with 2,319 in the year-ago period. Analysts are holding positive views on the city's retail segment, aided by signs of improvement in the operating environment. Last week, Hong Kong posted a second month of growth in its retail sales, rising 0.1 percent in value terms in April. Of which sales of jewellery and watches edged up 0.5 percent in value terms in the month. Hong Kong's tourist arrivals in April rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier, according to Hong Kong Tourism Board. However, some retailers remain conservative. Cartier owner Richemont had said in May that it was too early to say the worst was over in the Hong Kong market that has collapsed over the last 2-3 years. Last month, British luxury brand Burberry reported 21 percent drop in full-year underlying pretax profit, hit by weak demand in cities, including Hong Kong.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.  “Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that's a trend that's not going to change,   By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).  Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.   People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,  said REC's O'Neil.  It's transformational.     Some European funds are among those looking at the region.   The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,  said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.   In Asia, you'd expect double-digit returns. That's hard to achieve in Europe,  he said.  Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.  Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.  The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.  At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.         There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.  A signage at an REC solar panel manufacturing plant in Singapore May 5, 2017. Picture taken May 5, 2017.Edgar SuStoring solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.  Venture Capital  Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.  GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.   There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you'll have no issue organizing funding,  said Roland Quast, GA Power's managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.  Slideshow (14 Images)He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.  Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.  KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.   Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,  Somani said.  Killer Argument  At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore's biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.   We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,  REC's O'Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.  Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O'Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects  Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.   In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.  The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany's SolarWorld, once Europe's biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.  To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.   Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,  said O'Neil.

Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems installed 365 turbines at Lake Turkana in the hot desert north of the east African country in March, completing construction in less than a year and two months ahead of schedule.  The project, which the government says will produce around 300 megawatts (MW) of power, is located in one of Africa's windiest places. Costing 70 billion Kenyan shillings ($678 million), it is the country's largest single private investment and closely watched by investors looking for opportunities in African renewable energy.   The wind farm had planned to begin producing power this month, but construction of the transmission line to the power grid, being built by state-run Kenya Transmission Company (KETRACO), has been delayed.  The challenge is now to get the wind farms connected to the grid and that is indeed a project which is not with us,  head of Vestas' Central European and sub-Saharan business Nils de Baar told Reuters in an interview at the Africa Energy Forum in Copenhagen.  The expectation is that it will happen in early 2018,  he said, adding that the project is Vestas' largest-ever in terms of the number of wind turbines being installed. The 428 km powerline from Loiyangalani in northern Kenya to Suswa in the centre of the country was due to be completed by October last year, but demands for compensation from landowners along the route and other issues have delayed it. Once in operation, the Turkana Lake wind farm is expected to provide 15 percent of Kenya's total electricity needs.

Crude oil reserves were discovered in the east African country's Albertine rift basin near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. A series of setbacks, however, including a lack of infrastructure and wrangling over taxes and development strategy for the fields, have repeatedly delayed the start of production. Tony Kavuma, chief mechanical engineer at the Ministry of Works and Transport, told Reuters that Uganda had already held preliminary talks with UK Export Finance, the UK government's export credit agency, and Standard Chartered Bank for a loan of 310-325 million euros. He said the Ministry of Finance and the two financing organisations were negotiating the final terms of the loan agreement and signing was expected by the end of June.  We want to have this airport operational by June 2019. It's a very tight schedule...we need it (the airport) like yesterday,  Kavuma said. The facility will be Uganda's second international airport after Entebbe, which is located on the shores of Lake Victoria, south of the Ugandan capital Kampala. It will serve chiefly to transport equipment and goods for the oil industry. Last month Uganda and Tanzania signed a framework agreement for a proposed $3.55 billion crude export pipeline, clearing the way for a project crucial if Uganda is to meet its oil production commencement target of 2020. Uganda is also planning to construct a refinery near the oil fields to help process domestically some of its crude reserves, which are estimated at 6.5 billion barrels. Of that, 1.4 billion to 1.7 billion barrels are considered recoverable. Both the refinery and the airport are to be located in a 29 sq km (11 sq mile) area in the rift basin, near the oilfields. Kavuma said the airport was deemed necessary after potential investors in the refinery and other oil-related projects voiced concern that Uganda's narrow and weak roads would complicate the transportation of heavy loads and equipment. The loans would be used to finance the first phase of the airport and the government would borrow another 215-280 million euros to finance a second phase, he said.

The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which owns the copyright for the LBMA Silver Price, will discuss the two bids on June 15, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. It is due to announce a replacement for current operators CME Group and Thomson Reuters this summer.  Sources close to the matter say the race is too close to call between ICE, which operates the LBMA Gold Price benchmark, and the LME, which runs the process for platinum and palladium.   I can confirm to you absolutely, it's ICE and the LME,  one source with direct knowledge of the matter said.  It was open to anyone who wanted to pitch,  another source said.  (Now) it is those two.  The LBMA said in March that CME and Thomson Reuters were stepping down from the role less than three years into a five-year contract, citing a review prompted by upcoming European benchmarking regulation.  The existing silver price benchmark has suffered big swings away from the underlying spot price since its inception, in part due to the seven participating banks' unwillingness to adjust buy or sell orders once the auction has begun for fear of accusations of manipulation.  ICE's solution is for a cleared model similar to the existing gold benchmark, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. As this negates counterparty risk, that would theoretically allow a higher number of participants and greater liquidity.  Close Call Though ICE was tipped as the early favorite, concern over an uptick in volatility in the gold benchmark after it introduced clearing to the auction process last month has caused some market participants to question that view.  If this had been done six months ago it wouldn't have even been a two-horse race. It would have been (ICE) romping home to victory,  one source close to the process said.  FILE PHOTO: A machine spins a silver chain at the Krastsvetmet non-ferrous metals plant in the Krasnoyarsk, Russia, December 14, 2016.Ilya Naymushin/File Photo But given that the clearing has upset some people with the way it's happened ... people are less convinced about ICE than they were.  The LME proposal is for a classic auction system similar to the one in place for its platinum and palladium benchmarks, two sources said. The exchange would encourage banks to take part more freely by assuming more regulatory risk itself. The silver benchmark could be a loss leader for the operator, two sources close to the process said, earning far less in revenues than it costs to operate.  Nobody makes money out of running the benchmarks,  said one. Rather, the appeal of taking on the administration of a benchmark lies in the profile it offers within the precious metals market. ICE charges an annual usage fee for the LBMA Gold Price of between $5,000 and $20,000, depending on the type of institution. It charges $25 a month per user to view the price immediately after it is set.  The LME charges a fee of $15 per auction to view platinum and palladium benchmark prices, and a usage fee of $1,000 a year. The LME said in May it had pitched to provide the silver benchmark. In response to questions on its bid, it said in a statement to Reuters that it was  keen to build on (its) positive engagement with the precious metals market .  ICE declined to comment on whether it was bidding. The LBMA also had no comment on the bidding process.  The global silver benchmark is used to price contracts between producers, refiners, jewelers and fabricators.  It was the first precious metals benchmark to be overhauled in the wake of the Libor scandal in the currency market that boosted regulatory scrutiny of financial benchmarks, after Deutsche Bank, one of three institutions involved in the telephone auction that set the price, pulled out in 2014. Along with gold, it became a regulated benchmark under the aegis of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority in 2015, despite being a much smaller and less liquid market than others with regulated benchmarks, such as oil and foreign exchange.

The Port Authority circular was issued late on Wednesday and seen by Reuters on Thursday. It states:  Denial of entry into any of the Petroleum Ports, for all vessels arriving from, or destined to Qatar, regardless of its flag.  That was followed by a notice from the UAE's state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) on Thursday with the same language also seen by Reuters. The ban on all vessels carrying the Qatari flag and vessels owned or operated by Qatar remains in place and those ships will not be allowed into its petroleum ports, the port authority circulars said. The Abu Dhabi port authorities had eased the restrictions just a day earlier. The ban would potentially disrupt the common industry practice of co-loading oil cargoes from different countries onto a tanker to lower the costs of shipping. Preventing the co-loading of Qatari and other Middle East grades could add to refiners' transport costs and create logistical jams.  ADNOC has officially confirmed that we cannot co-load to and from (Qatar). So we need to find new vessels, then find co-loadings around the region,  said a source from an Asian refiner. Qatar is among the smallest of the Middle Eastern oil producers and refiners will load crude from there alongside bigger suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, and the UAE.  Re-tightening the restrictions on ships to and from Qatar will exacerbate the logistical issues that started on June 5 when Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Yemen severed ties with Qatar for allegedly funding terrorism.  This is the only thing that really matters - Qatar doesn't have that many vessels and most of their exports are co-loaded with other crudes,  the second shipbroker said. Despite the official ban, industry sources in both the Middle East and Asia indicated that the co-loading of Abu Dhabi crude along with Qatari oil may continue on a case-by-case basis. Customers under long-term contracts with ADNOC for crude may be given exemptions to the ban at ports including Das Island and Fujairah as long as the co-loaded cargo is not only from Qatar since ADNOC does want to upset those customers, said a Middle East-based industry source. Traders and refiners may explore alternatives like chartering smaller tankers or consider ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in the region to deal with the ban.  It's gotten to the point where we just want this to be over... we are scrambling again,  said a second Singapore-based shipbroker, adding that STS transfers could occur at designated areas offshore Oman.

The court's decision gives the regulator, the Communications Authority of Kenya, a freer hand to oversee the sector at a time of intense debate over whether or not the country's biggest operator, Safaricom, has too much market power. The government changed sections of the law in December 2015, requiring the Communications Authority to consult Kenya's Competition Authority, and the communications minister, before punishing any operator for abuse of dominance. The government argued at the time that it wanted to enhance decision-making on dominance issues by bringing in another body with expertise on competition matters. The Communications Authority said however that the move undermined its independence and would discourage investment in the sector because it restricted its ability to manage competition. In a ruling issued this week and seen by Reuters on Thursday, the high court said the changes had a major impact and could therefore not be allowed to stand. It was ruling on a case brought by a private citizen challenging the amendments. The Communications Authority did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Joe Mucheru, the minister for information and communication, said the government would operate within the original law as ordered by the court.  We will follow the law. We don't have a problem following the law,  he told Reuters, adding they were already working with the regulator and operators to boost competition in the sector. He cited a move requiring operators to interconnect their mobile financial services systems, allowing users on various networks to move money seamlessly, which is expected to start next month. Smaller operators in Kenya's telecom sector have long alleged unfair competition, saying Safaricom is too dominant. Safaricom rejects the accusations. The Communications Authority commissioned a study on competition in the sector, whose leaked draft earlier this year showed Safaricom could be broken up due to its size and dominance of the mobile financial services market with its M-Pesa platform. The regulator has since clarified it did not intend to break up any firm but it would explore other options to level the playing field. Safaricom is Kenya's biggest firm by market capitalisation and dwarfs the two other operators in the mobile market: the local subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel and Telkom, which the French telecoms company Orange sold last year to London-based Helios Investment Partners.

Wednesday's overnight rescue of Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC by Banco Santander (SAN.MC) has increased pressure on Italy, which has been trying to win European Union approval for its planned bailout of the two regional banks for months. Rome has so far failed to find investors ready to put in the 1.2 billion euros ($1.35 billion) in private capital that EU authorities are demanding to authorize the plan. The  resolution  of Banco Popular could strengthen the case for winding down the two Veneto banks, an EU official said on Wednesday. Italian banks would have to shell out 11 billion euros to protect depositors at Veneto Banca and Popolare di Vicenza if the two banks were wound down, one source said on Thursday. Related CoverageWind-down of Veneto banks would cost other lenders 11 billion euros: sourcesUnder Italian law, deposits up to 100,000 euros each are guaranteed by a depositors' protection fund which is financed by healthy lenders and would have to be replenished if the two Veneto-based banks were shut down.  The source said Italy's healthier banks and the government were looking at a plan under which each lender would contribute to provide the 1.2 billion euros required based on the size of their deposits.  Some leading banks were already agreeable, but only if others signed up. A second source said Rome was putting pressure on heavyweights Intesa SanPaolo (ISP.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) to take part so that other banks would follow their example. UniCredit CEO Jean Pierre Mustier has held talks with the Rome government and European authorities, the first source said. The two Veneto-based banks, weighed down by bad debts and mounting losses over the past three years, need a total of 6.4 billion euros in capital. One possible vehicle for private investment would be an existing bank rescue fund. Unlike Spain or Ireland, Italy did not tap EU funds to repair its banks during the financial crisis and is now seeking to prop up its weakest lenders under strict new rules that aim to shield taxpayers by forcing losses on investors. Rome won a preliminary green light from Brussels this month over its a proposed rescue of its fourth-largest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). But drumming up support for the Veneto banks has proved a challenge as Italian banks already spent 3.4 billion euros last year to save them from bankruptcy.  Further loan losses and deposit flight have drained the two lenders of capital, forcing healthier rivals, which own them through state-sponsored bailout fund Atlante, to write down the value of their investment.

Further loan losses and deposit flight have drained the two lenders of capital, forcing healthier rivals, which own them through state-sponsored bailout fund Atlante, to write down the value of their investment.

Swedish regulators have imposed some of the toughest capital requirements in Europe, citing the risk posed to financial stability by the size of the country's banks. Sweden's banks hold assets worth around four times the Swedish gross domestic product.  When it comes to the banking sector specifically we have a responsibility to ensure financial stability and protect tax payers,  Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters.  It is up to Nordea to decide where they are going to have their HQ.  The so-called resolution fee that banks pay to the bailout fund will rise next year to 0.125 of debt minus guaranteed deposits from the current 0.09 percent. But it will drop back in 2019 and will be eliminated in 2025, when the fund is expected to reach its target level. The government had originally planned to raise the fee to 0.125 percent indefinitely. Nordea said that would have raised its fee to around 6 billion crowns ($690 million) in 2019 from 500 million in 2016. Analysts expected Nordea to move its headquarters to either Finland or Denmark to avoid the cost. Andersson said the government still aimed to introduce a new bank tax before 2019. It would apply to all banks doing business in Sweden, even if their headquarters were located elsewhere. Nordea spokesman Petter Brunnberg said the bank would study the new plans.  It is a question for the board to determine where our headquarters will be and they will make a decision when they feel comfortable with it,  he said. Andreas Hakansson, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the new fees alone were unlikely to prompt Nordea to move its HQ.  But it is one thing after another,  he said.  There is uncertainty and that creates an unstable platform ... and that could be reason enough for Nordea to move.  The government has said banks are undertaxed, pointing to net profits of more than 80 billion crowns last year and exemptions from VAT on banking services. But banks say their return on equity - at around 12 percent - is lower than the average Swedish company's and that they are subject to tough capital requirements. Banks in Sweden are around twice as profitable as the average in Europe. The government had planned a payroll tax on financial services firms but dropped that after widespread criticism. Instead, it decided on the plan to raise resolution fees, which are paid to a reserve to be used for recapitalising or winding up troubled banks. Banks currently pay around 7 billion a year to the resolution fund. $1 = 8.6852 Swedish crowns Reporting by Simon Johnson and Niklas Pollard; additional reporting by Johan Sennero; Editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-banks-resolution-idUSL8N1J50XN"},

People from the reclusive and impoverished North have occasionally defected to the rich, democratic South by fishing boat, crossing the disputed maritime border between the two sides. But most defections are via China. South Korea's navy and coastguard rescued four people from two vessels on Friday and Saturday, and the four were then questioned by South Korean authorities, who offered to send them home, South Korea's Unification Ministry said. The two who told authorities they wanted to defect to South Korea were a man in his 50s and his son in his 20s, an official from the ministry, which handles relations with North Korea, said by telephone.  We will provide education for them to settle in South Korea, for a certain period of time, as is usual for North Korean defectors,  the official said. The official, who declined to be identified, said he did not know if the two had originally planned to defect or decided to only after being rescued. The Yonhap news agency said the father appeared to have planned to defect. The other two would be sent home, as they had requested, the ministry official said. In the past, when North Koreans rescued from South Korean waters have chosen to stay in the South, North Korea has accused South Korea of holding them against their will. There has been no comment from North Korea, or reports in its state media, about the latest cases. North and South Korea remain in a technical state of war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Tension on the peninsula has been particularly high over the past year because of the North's work on its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea fired several anti-ship missiles off its east coast on Thursday, drawing condemnation from South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

It bought the euros in an auction at an average rate of 7.4266 kuna per euro. The kuna was quoted at 7.4150 at 1015 GMT, easing from a 7.3980 level before the intervention.

Agrokor, a highly indebted Croatian food company currently undergoing a restructuring process, is negotiating a liquidity loan seen at around 400 million euros. Analysts say the kuna is also vulnerable to seasonal appreciation pressures as the summer tourist season kicks off and the country is also seeing an inflow of euros in European Union development funds. The central bank keeps the kuna in a managed float regime against the euro, occasionally intervening to counter firming or easing pressures or sudden strong rate movements.

The leasing industry, which accounts for 42 percent of the global aircraft fleet, has so far been aided by lower interest rates and generous bank lending. But growing uncertainties such as geopolitical instability in the Middle East, a firmer dollar and changes to accounting standards for financial leasing could curb growth and weed out the smaller players, they added.  This is a highly specialized, international, funding and technologically intensive business. I believe we will see many withdraw, or be forced by business problems to quit,  said Wang Fuhou, president of Minsheng Commercial Aviation's aircraft leasing department, referring to the Chinese market.  We don't need this many (Chinese) aircraft leasing firms,  Wang told the China Airfinance Conference in Shanghai.  Hani Kuzbari, managing director of aircraft leasing and financing platform Novus Aviation Capital, agreed.  There is pressure from China which is resulting in severe pressure on leasing factors and returns ... All-time high liquidity and all-time low returns,  he said.  On the industry cycle we're very much around the peak, or post the peak.  The nearly $225-billion global aircraft leasing sector was once the preserve of Western players, but Chinese firms such as the subsidiaries of Bank of China, HNA Group, Bank of Communications (BOCOM) and China Minsheng Banking Corp have muscled their way into deals at home and abroad. Many Chinese local governments, including Tibet and Xiamen, as well as insurers have also launched leasing firms, helped by government measures to support the sector. In 2007, Chinese lessors owned just 22 jets out of China's 430-strong leased fleet, according to ICBC Financial Leasing. By January 2017, these lessors owned 583 planes out of the country's 1,235 fleet, it said.      Irena Badelska, head of business development at Dublin-based aircraft leasing company Amedeo, estimated there were 54 Chinese leasing firms trying to build expertise in the aviation space. This is driving fierce competition for clients and qualified staff, said Li Ru, senior vice president of BOCOM Leasing.

China imported 37.2 million tonnes or 8.76 million barrels per day of crude oil last month, up 15 percent from a year earlier and nearly 8 percent from April, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. Imports compared with average shipments to the United States in May of 8.12 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations based on EIA weekly data. The robust May shipments reflected steady demand from private refiners, Li Yan, a crude oil analyst with Zibo Longzhong Information Group said.   China's  May crude imports were mainly driven by purchases from some Shandong-based independent refineries that had sent China's crude imports to record high in March. In the first five months, we are seeing a steady pace of buying from these 'teapot' refineries which reported good profit margins,  Li said. For the year to end-May, crude imports rose more than 13 percent from a year earlier to 176.3 million tonnes or 8.52 million bpd, the customs data showed. However, private refiners are expected to tighten their intake for at least the next two months, analysts and traders said, ambushed by a rising local fuel glut. Imports by the world's second-biggest oil consumer had slipped from a peak of 9.2 million bpd in March to 8.4 million bpd in April. China's exports of refined products rose 6 percent in May to 4.03 million tonnes as state refiners sold more abraod in a bid to counter a domestic oversupply.

The leasing industry, which accounts for 42 percent of the global aircraft fleet, has so far been aided by lower interest rates and generous bank lending. But growing uncertainties such as geopolitical instability in the Middle East, a firmer dollar and changes to accounting standards for financial leasing could curb growth and weed out the smaller players, they added.  This is a highly specialized, international, funding and technologically intensive business. I believe we will see many withdraw, or be forced by business problems to quit,  said Wang Fuhou, president of Minsheng Commercial Aviation's aircraft leasing department, referring to the Chinese market.  We don't need this many (Chinese) aircraft leasing firms,  Wang told the China Airfinance Conference in Shanghai.  Hani Kuzbari, managing director of aircraft leasing and financing platform Novus Aviation Capital, agreed.  There is pressure from China which is resulting in severe pressure on leasing factors and returns ... All-time high liquidity and all-time low returns,  he said.  On the industry cycle we're very much around the peak, or post the peak.  The nearly $225-billion global aircraft leasing sector was once the preserve of Western players, but Chinese firms such as the subsidiaries of Bank of China, HNA Group, Bank of Communications (BOCOM) and China Minsheng Banking Corp have muscled their way into deals at home and abroad. Many Chinese local governments, including Tibet and Xiamen, as well as insurers have also launched leasing firms, helped by government measures to support the sector. In 2007, Chinese lessors owned just 22 jets out of China's 430-strong leased fleet, according to ICBC Financial Leasing. By January 2017, these lessors owned 583 planes out of the country's 1,235 fleet, it said.      Irena Badelska, head of business development at Dublin-based aircraft leasing company Amedeo, estimated there were 54 Chinese leasing firms trying to build expertise in the aviation space. This is driving fierce competition for clients and qualified staff, said Li Ru, senior vice president of BOCOM Leasing.  Profit margins are shrinking every year, rents are falling but our plane-buying costs are still growing annually.

E.ON has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to look at a potential sale of its remaining Uniper stake, sources have said. E.ON has said it aimed to sell the stake as early as 2018. If the stake goes to a single buyer, it would trigger a takeover offer for all of Uniper under German takeover laws.

Chinese mainland stocks hit six-month highs, up almost 1 percent after stronger-than-anticipated China exports and import data for May suggested the economy is holding up well, while central bank reserves also rose. There are also expectations that index provider MSCI will decide to include mainland A shares in its benchmark on June 20. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index climbed to another 23-month closing high while MSCI's emerging equity index was virtually flat. Qatar, however, remained in the spotlight after its Gulf neighbours, led by Saudi Arabia, this week said they were severing ties with the country as well as imposing trade and travel bans. That prompted S&P; Global to cut Qatar's rating by a notch to AA- with a negative outlook. Doha stocks rebounded 2.3 percent after falling almost 10 percent in recent days, and are on track for their biggest weekly loss since March 2011. There is also some pressure on the riyal's dollar peg, and tighter liquidity has pushed up domestic deposit rates sharply . One-year riyal forwards are trading at 3.667 per dollar, well below the spot 3.64 rate. Analysts at ING said consequences could be severe for Qatar, especially if it found itself unable to hold the currency peg, though it sees this outcome as highly unlikely and does not expect contagion across other Gulf currency pegs.  Typically pressure on GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) pegs has proved temporary, with local authorities happy to tell speculators they will lose,  ING analysts said in a note to clients.  However, prior speculative attacks have typically been macro-led – e.g. during periods of low oil prices.  The fact that the current pressure is political and triggered by fellow GCC members is alarming. Given that we are not looking for the Qatari peg to break, we do not see a major speculative attack on the GCC as a whole.  Qatar's Eurobond maturing 2026 fell 0.7 cent, according to Tradeweb data, while the 2027 bond from the Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company dropped 1.5 cents and five-year credit default swaps (CDS) rose 3 basis points (bps) to 92 bps, a seven-month high.

The change comes after a series of  lone wolf  Islamist-inspired attacks, the most serious of which raised questions about the traditional police strategy of  contain and negotiate  in hostage situations. Under the proposal, which is likely to be adopted in the state's parliament given the support for it, lethal force can be used immediately if an incident is declared  terrorist related  by the state's most senior police officer, Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. Currently, police have to wait until a suspect demonstrates an imminent threat to others. Authorities said that law curtailed their ability to end a 2014 siege in Sydney's Lindt Cafe in which three people including the hostage-taker were killed. Mick Fuller, commissioner of state police, said the change was needed to correct a  gray area . Australian police stand at the site of a siege at the Buckingham Serviced Apartments in Melbourne, Australia, June 6, 2017.   AAP/Julian Smith/via REUTERS When you get in a situation like with Lindt and you have a sniper who is sitting 300 meters away looking through a scope, at the moment, they have to determine in their own minds whether they have the legal ability to use lethal force,   Fuller told reporters.  If it is uncertain, it is understandable an officer will hesitate.  Police waited more than 16 hours before storming the Lindt Cafe, and then only after the attacker had killed a hostage. Police killed the attacker but a second hostage was also killed by ricocheting fragments of a bullet fired by police. A coroner said last month police had failed to respond quickly enough. Fuller said last month police would be more a terror-related hostage situation. The cafe siege, which began on Dec. 15, 2014, was Australia's most deadly violence inspired by Islamic State militants.

Comey will be grilled by Washington politicians later in the day over his claims that President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.     China's exports rose 8.7 percent in May from a year earlier, while imports expanded 14.8 percent, both beating expectations, but analysts expect the world's second-largest economy to lose momentum over the course of the year due to policy tightening.      Southeast Asian markets may not react to the Chinese data now as they wait for the results of the key global events, said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.     The data will, however, bolster the yuan as well as other regional currencies in the near term, he added.

She recently became the first woman to cross the English Channel solo on the flimsy stand-up craft, to draw attention to the  global plastic crisis .   From fishing lines to flip flops, there are more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic floating in the world's oceans, according to a 2014 study published in a Public Library of Science journal.  Plastic degrades over time into tiny particles known as microplastics which can be ingested by marine life, together with plastic microbeads used in toiletries and other household products, harming the food chain and environment.    When you hear... about microplastics and microbeads, there's still a lot of confusion around what that means, and how we've contributed to that,  Carr told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.    Every four miles along the trip from England to northern France, she collected water samples for microplastics analysis by Plymouth University.     Carr has also launched #PlasticPatrol campaigns, combining free paddle-board lessons with clean-up operations of waterways, canals and harbours across Britain, to encourage local communities to get onboard.    She is now developing a phone app and a crowd-sourced map to encourage the public to photograph plastic pollution to identify trends and hot spots.  It's about putting the power into the hands of the people,  she said.   Plastic debris has been found littering the oceans from the North to the South Poles and around remote Pacific islands.  But only 1 percent is thought to be floating on the sea surface - the remaining 99 percent is scattered along coast lines, buried deep in sea-beds or hidden in the guts of marine creatures, said Erik van Sebille, oceanographer and associate professor at Utrecht University. Marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight, according to a factsheet from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity working to end waste in the economy.  (Plastic) is shockingly widespread - it literally is almost everywhere in the ocean, it's omnipresent,  said van Sebille,  who studies how ocean currents move plastic around.       Keep It in the Economy Internationally, significant efforts are being made to remove plastic from the world's water bodies. One example is  The Ocean Cleanup , a Dutch foundation formed after a speech by a concerned Dutch teenager went viral online. It aims to clear over half of the  Great Pacific Garbage Patch , an area between Hawaii and California where ocean currents have concentrated plastic debris. Meanwhile, customers must pay for plastic shopping bags in some countries like Britain and Ireland, while France has banned them outright, adding disposable plastic cups and plates from 2020.  Kenya is also bringing in a complete ban on household and commercial plastic packaging after a successful grassroots social media campaign. With an estimated $80 billion to $120 billion of plastic packaging material lost to the economy each year, there is a financial incentive for business to reuse plastic. Unilever, the food and personal goods giant that owns brands such as Dove and Lipton, has developed new technology to recycle plastic sachets, which normally end up in landfill or as litter, and channel them back into the supply chain. It will open a plant later this year in Indonesia to test the viability of the technology. Forty percent of plastic produced globally is destined for single-use packaging, according to Stephanie Wright, an environmental scientist at King's College London.  It's a material that lasts forever, but we're using it as a one-off,  she said.   Last month, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Prince of Wales' International Sustainability Unit launched a $2-million prize to come up with new ways to design packaging to help keep plastics out of the ocean. World record-breaking sailor Ellen MacArthur told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that today's approach to plastic is unsustainable.      It's built to keep a chicken fresh or to keep shampoo in a container, and be cheap to sell, but there's no process for that material to be recovered and to create (a) restorative, regenerative and ultimately resilient model,  she said. Here to Stay MacArthur's interest in the issue came from having to make the most of limited resources at sea.   When you sail around the world on a boat... you take with you what you need for your survival, and you manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food,  she said.   You know what finite is when you're 2,500 miles away from the nearest town and there is no more,  she added. Scientist Wright warned that the problem of plastic pollution could be around for a long time.   Even if we stop putting litter into the sea tomorrow... all the plastic that's still there is going to continue to break down,  she said.  We have to anticipate it might get worse in the future.     This year's World Oceans Day, marked on Thursday, has a focus on tackling plastic pollution and preventing marine litter.   Van Sebille argues that, at this stage, preventative measures to stem the flow of plastics would be more effective than trying to clean up the mess. Plastic production has seen  an exponential increase  since the 1950s, he said.  On current trends, in the next five years we'll be producing more plastic than all the twentieth century,  he said.  There's an enormous amount of plastic coming our way.  Cities could take the lead in an urbanizing world, as they are widely responsible for waste management, he suggested.  He also advocated fixing the holes in the current recycling process where a third of plastic packaging ends up being lost or wasted during collection and processing.      The oceans belong to us all,  he said.  This is really a worldwide problem that we, as global humanity, need to tackle . Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Megan Rowling.

Higher values for all food goods except sugar lifted prices on international markets 10 percent above the same month last year, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.   Rising shipping costs and larger import volumes are due to push the cost of importing food globally to more than $1.3 trillion in 2017, FAO said. This would be a 10.6 percent rise over 2016's import bill, despite broad stability in markets buoyed by ample supplies of wheat and maize and higher production of oilseed products.  Poor countries that rely on imports to cover their food needs, and part of sub-Saharan Africa are on course for an even faster rise in their import costs as they buy in more meat, sugar, dairy and oilseed products.   All food categories except fish are due to add to rising import bills, as robust growth in aquaculture in many developing countries increasingly manages to meet domestic demand.  FAO's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.6 points in May, up 2.2 percent from April. FAO trimmed its forecast for global cereals output in the 2017-18 season to 2.594 billion tonnes, down 0.5 percent year-on-year. Global wheat production is expected to decline 2.2 percent after a record harvest last year.

Construction could be completed by 2020, or four years before the Malampaya natural gas field is depleted, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said in a presentation to an industry forum this week. The Philippines' energy demand will triple by 2040, with electricity requirements anticipated to grow four times from 2015, Cusi said during the forum. The Philippines needs to step up power generation capacity by 7,000 megawatts over the next five years to support a fast-growing economy and wants foreign investors to help. Chinese and Japanese companies are among the foreign investors who want to help build energy infrastructure, including liquefied natural gas facilities, Cusi told Reuters in February. The LNG project, which includes a 200-megawatt power plant, is among the investment opportunities up for grabs in the country's long-term energy plan, which seeks to add power capacity of 43,765 MW by 2040, Cusi said.  Hopefully, with Dutertenomics attracting the adequate level of private investments, we can reach our targeted additional power capacity by 2040,  he said. Cusi was referring to the economic agenda of President Rodrigo Duterte, which envisages massive spending to build new infrastructure and modernize existing facilities. Several firms have expressed interest in building LNG facilities in the Philippines, including Manila Electric Company, formerly in talks with Osaka Gas Co Ltd for a joint venture. Energy authorities said the talks halted because both decided to separately reassess the power supply situation. In April Philippine power producer First Gen Corp said it was willing to work with the government to build a $1-billion LNG terminal to sustain its gas-fired power plants currently running on Malampaya gas. The operator of Malampaya, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, has also been looking to set up a floating regasification facility to sell LNG in the Philippines. Australia-listed Energy World Corp Ltd has been building an LNG hub in eastern Quezon province that includes a floating storage regasification unit and power plants.

The move comes after repeated complaints from some European airlines, notably Air France KLM and Lufthansa , about Gulf carriers receiving illegal government subsidies, charges Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad all deny. The proposal, which needs to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states before becoming law, would allow governments and airlines to submit complaints about discriminatory practices to the European Commission. Should the Commission find that the practices of a third country or airline are causing injury, or threat of injury, to European airlines it will be able to impose financial duties or suspend services and rights of the overseas airline.  We want to ensure that Europe remains a leader in international aviation, well connected to fast-growing markets, with efficient European skies,  EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement. The proposal does not envisage the suspension of traffic rights, however, and will not interfere with bilateral air services agreements between countries. Several EU member states had been staunchly opposed to the new rules on the grounds they could harm bilateral deals and reduce connectivity in Europe. Many also saw it as a protectionist move to shield uncompetitive European carriers, something the Commission denies.  In aviation there is never going to be a level playing field,  an EU official said.  We're not here to protect those airlines if they have not put in place a good business model.  The Commission also published guidelines clarifying the application of EU ownership and control rules that limit non-EU investors' stakes in European airlines to 49 percent. Investments by foreign airlines in recent years, such as Etihad's 29 percent stake in Air Berlin, have triggered suspicions that the control is actually being exercised by non-EU investors.

The capital markets union (CMU) initiative was launched in September 2015 to improve the way stock and bond markets raise money for growth, and offer European companies an alternative to bank loans. The aim was to put in place the CMU's  building blocks  by 2019 - the year when Britain leaves the EU, creating a need to reduce the EU's dependence on London's huge financial resources. It had already taken more time than expected to get parliamentary approval for what were meant to be  quick wins , such as reviving securitisation or asset-backed debt, and making it easier for companies to list - two of the 20 measures passed from an original list of 33. The European Commission set out a further nine  priority actions  on Thursday in its  mid-term  review of the CMU. They include more powers for the EU's securities watchdog, helping banks to offload bad loans, making it easier to sell mutual funds across Europe, and assessing the case for an EU passport for financial technology or fintech firms.  As we face the departure of the largest EU financial centre, we are committed to stepping up our efforts to further strengthen and integrate the EU capital markets,  European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.  This review makes clear the scale of the challenge and we count on the support of the European Parliament and Member States to rise to it.  A big test will be how much progress Brussels can make in helping banks to offload bad loans, a problem that led this week to European authorities intervening to avoid a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular. Bad loans can restrict many banks' ability to lend, but shedding them is hampered by high transaction costs.  The Commission services will shortly launch a public consultation on potential EU action to foster these secondary markets,  the EU executive said. Reporting by Huw Jones.

She recently became the first woman to cross the English Channel solo on the flimsy stand-up craft, to draw attention to the  global plastic crisis .   From fishing lines to flip flops, there are more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic floating in the world's oceans, according to a 2014 study published in a Public Library of Science journal.  Plastic degrades over time into tiny particles known as microplastics which can be ingested by marine life, together with plastic microbeads used in toiletries and other household products, harming the food chain and environment.    When you hear... about microplastics and microbeads, there's still a lot of confusion around what that means, and how we've contributed to that,  Carr told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.    Every four miles along the trip from England to northern France, she collected water samples for microplastics analysis by Plymouth University.     Carr has also launched #PlasticPatrol campaigns, combining free paddle-board lessons with clean-up operations of waterways, canals and harbours across Britain, to encourage local communities to get onboard.    She is now developing a phone app and a crowd-sourced map to encourage the public to photograph plastic pollution to identify trends and hot spots.  It's about putting the power into the hands of the people,  she said.   Plastic debris has been found littering the oceans from the North to the South Poles and around remote Pacific islands.  But only 1 percent is thought to be floating on the sea surface - the remaining 99 percent is scattered along coast lines, buried deep in sea-beds or hidden in the guts of marine creatures, said Erik van Sebille, oceanographer and associate professor at Utrecht University. Marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight, according to a factsheet from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity working to end waste in the economy.  (Plastic) is shockingly widespread - it literally is almost everywhere in the ocean, it's omnipresent,  said van Sebille,  who studies how ocean currents move plastic around.       Keep It in the Economy Internationally, significant efforts are being made to remove plastic from the world's water bodies. One example is  The Ocean Cleanup , a Dutch foundation formed after a speech by a concerned Dutch teenager went viral online. It aims to clear over half of the  Great Pacific Garbage Patch , an area between Hawaii and California where ocean currents have concentrated plastic debris. Meanwhile, customers must pay for plastic shopping bags in some countries like Britain and Ireland, while France has banned them outright, adding disposable plastic cups and plates from 2020.  Kenya is also bringing in a complete ban on household and commercial plastic packaging after a successful grassroots social media campaign. With an estimated $80 billion to $120 billion of plastic packaging material lost to the economy each year, there is a financial incentive for business to reuse plastic. Unilever, the food and personal goods giant that owns brands such as Dove and Lipton, has developed new technology to recycle plastic sachets, which normally end up in landfill or as litter, and channel them back into the supply chain. It will open a plant later this year in Indonesia to test the viability of the technology. Forty percent of plastic produced globally is destined for single-use packaging, according to Stephanie Wright, an environmental scientist at King's College London.  It's a material that lasts forever, but we're using it as a one-off,  she said.   Last month, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Prince of Wales' International Sustainability Unit launched a $2-million prize to come up with new ways to design packaging to help keep plastics out of the ocean. World record-breaking sailor Ellen MacArthur told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that today's approach to plastic is unsustainable.      It's built to keep a chicken fresh or to keep shampoo in a container, and be cheap to sell, but there's no process for that material to be recovered and to create (a) restorative, regenerative and ultimately resilient model,  she said. Here to Stay MacArthur's interest in the issue came from having to make the most of limited resources at sea.   When you sail around the world on a boat... you take with you what you need for your survival, and you manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food,  she said.   You know what finite is when you're 2,500 miles away from the nearest town and there is no more,  she added. Scientist Wright warned that the problem of plastic pollution could be around for a long time.   Even if we stop putting litter into the sea tomorrow... all the plastic that's still there is going to continue to break down,  she said.  We have to anticipate it might get worse in the future.     This year's World Oceans Day, marked on Thursday, has a focus on tackling plastic pollution and preventing marine litter.   Van Sebille argues that, at this stage, preventative measures to stem the flow of plastics would be more effective than trying to clean up the mess. Plastic production has seen  an exponential increase  since the 1950s, he said.  On current trends, in the next five years we'll be producing more plastic than all the twentieth century,  he said.  There's an enormous amount of plastic coming our way.  Cities could take the lead in an urbanizing world, as they are widely responsible for waste management, he suggested.  He also advocated fixing the holes in the current recycling process where a third of plastic packaging ends up being lost or wasted during collection and processing.      The oceans belong to us all,  he said.  This is really a worldwide problem that we, as global humanity, need to tackle . Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Megan Rowling.

Syed, 37, is serving a life sentence for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend and high school classmate, Hae Min Lee. A Baltimore judge ordered a new trial in June 2016 after the popular podcast cast doubt on evidence in the case. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh appealed the ruling. Oral arguments will be heard in Annapolis at the Court of Special Appeals, the state's second-highest tribunal. No decision will be issued on Thursday. Syed, who remains in prison, will not attend. The prosecutors' appeal argues that the Baltimore judge, Martin Welch, wrongly allowed new arguments over the reliability of cellphone location evidence that linked Syed to Lee's death. Prosecutors also contest Welch's decision to vacate Syed's conviction because of poor legal representation. Prosecutors say Syed's lawyer, the late Cristina Gutierrez, had thoroughly challenged the cellphone evidence and that Syed had already waived his claim that she was ineffective.  With or without corroborative cellphone data, the overwhelming evidence shows the jury's verdict was fair, reliable and correct,  prosecutors said in their appeal. Syed's lawyers say Gutierrez had declining skills when she defended him, in what was her last trial, and did not investigate a potential alibi witness. She agreed to be disbarred by the Court of Appeals in 2001 because of failing health, and died in 2004.  The proper remedy is a new trial,  the inmate's legal team said in a court filing. The  Serial  podcast on Syed's case was released by public radio station WBEZ in Chicago and has been downloaded millions of times. The podcast raised questions about testimony from an acquaintance of Syed, who claimed Syed told him he planned to kill Lee and needed his help after the murder, and about phone calls that linked Syed to the crime. The appeals court will issue a written opinion at a later date, the court said in a statement. The ruling could then be appealed to the Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court.

Thailand makes public few details of the finances for its monarchy, whose assets, estimated at more than $40 billion, rank  it among the world's richest. Since taking the throne in December, King Maha Vajiralongkorn has set about restructuring the palace and in April, parliament agreed to transfer to him control of royal agencies managed by the prime minister and defense ministry. A draft of the annual budget allocated 4.19 billion baht ($123 million) to the monarchy for  security fundamentals , but gave no explanation of what this comprises. The figure compares to 4.89 billion baht for the fiscal year from October 2016 to September 2017, a decrease of more than 14 percent. Last year, the figure was given under national security as being for  upholding and preserving the monarchy . It was not made clear whether funding on any of the other budget lines would directly or indirectly benefit the palace. By comparison, Britain’s Royal Household said its sovereign grant for the year to March 2016 was around 40 million pounds ($52 million), though that does not cover costs such as security. The new Thai figures were revealed in a 2.9-trillion-baht draft budget submitted to parliament by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. It had already been approved by the cabinet.  Thailand's new King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun is seen on his way out from the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Thailand, December 2, 2016.Jorge SilvaThe king inherited the throne last year following the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose reign spanned seven decades. His major staffing changes include appointments this week of 10 civil servants to new posts, as well as a fourteenth member to the Privy Council advisory body. The new addition is an armed forces officer, like most of the panel, as is the king. The wealth of the Thai crown is rarely discussed in Thailand, where strict royal insult laws make criticism of the monarchy a crime. But two recent studies value the crown's assets and corporate holdings at more than $40 billion. The monarchy's household and finances are managed by the Bureau of the Royal Household and the secretive Crown Property Bureau, a quasi-government agency. On its website, the Crown Property Bureau says it manages properties that  do not belong to the monarch in his or her private capacity, but to the monarchy as an institution . Income generated from the Crown Property is used  firstly for expenditures for the upkeep of the royal family, and thereafter, at the monarch’s discretion.  The monarch's personal assets are managed separately. Preserving the monarchy and maintaining the military’s role as its protector has been a key theme for Prayuth’s administration, which seized power from an elected government in 2014 in the name of ending months of political unrest.

In a few more days it could be over,  armed forces Chief of Staff General Eduaro Año told ANC television on the 17th day of a siege by hundreds of militants who have sworn allegiance to the ultra-radical Islamic State group. The battle for Marawi City has raised concern that Islamic State, on a back foot in Syria and Iraq, is building a regional base on the Philippine island of Mindanao that could pose a threat to neighboring Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore too. Officials have said that, among the several hundred militants who seized the town on May 23, there were about 40 foreigners from Indonesia and Malaysia but also fighters from India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Chechnya. The seizure of the town suggested to many that pro-Islamic State factions wanted to establish it as a Southeast Asian  wilayat  – or governorate - for Islamic State, a fear reinforced by video footage the military found last week showing the fighters plotting to seal the town off completely. Major General Carlito Galvez, head of military command in the region, said government troops had entered three neighborhoods from which the militants had pulled back after two weeks of defense that relied heavily on snipers.  We saw food, IEDs, mobility assets. Considering we have paralyzed logistics capability, we are looking at the possibility that the end will be near,  he told a news conference in Marawi, referring to improvised explosive devices, or bombs. With their ability to fight  degraded , some of the militants have fled, military spokesman Restituto Padilla said in a radio interview, adding that nine had surrendered and were providing  good intelligence . Peace Corridors Philippines Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana (C), National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon and Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza inspect more than a hundred high-powered firearms and ammunition seized from various hideouts of Islamist militants during their visit at the military camp in Marawi city, Philippines June 8, 2017.Neil Jerome MoralesThe government has said several times that it is close to retaking the town from the Maute group. A relatively new rebel faction, it joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its  emir  of Southeast Asia.    But the fighters prepared for a long siege, stockpiling arms and food in tunnels, basements, mosques and madrasas, or Islamic religious schools, military officials say.  The Philippines is largely Christian, but Marawi City is overwhelmingly Muslim. Slideshow (6 Images)The military said 138 militants had been killed, and the death tolls for security personnel and civilians stood at 39 and 20, respectively. Galvez said the military believed that  more or less 100  civilians were still being held hostage by the militants. Earlier this week, officials put at several hundred the number of people being held as human shields or trapped in their homes. Catholic priest Father Teresito  Chito  Soganub and about a dozen of his parishioners were abducted on the first day of the siege when militants burst into the town's cathedral and then  set it on fire. Task force head Brigadier General Rolly Bautista told reporters that, according to information passed back through emissaries, the priest was still alive. The government has been setting up  peace corridors  to allow civilians from the lakeside town to move away from the battle and to deliver food and medicines.  Government-appointed negotiator Irene Santiago said that a religious leader who had been acting as an emissary to seek a corridor for civilians held hostage had taken ill and the authorities were waiting for him to get better.

President Emmanuel Macron has the chance to rectify these problems. The question is whether he has the desire. The ex-banker wants to use some of the Republic’s shareholdings to finance a 10 billion euro fund for industry and innovation. That should be no problem: the sprawling portfolio was worth nearly 10 times as much at the end of 2015, and comprised stakes in 1,750 companies in sectors as diverse as transportation, energy, services, finance, defence, telecoms, automobiles, and the media. Macron could, however, usefully go a lot further. There are many potential conflicts of interest between what suits the state as a political player, its interest as a shareholder, and the long-term public good. Consider its 83 percent stake in utility EDF. A move to reduce energy tariffs, or extract large dividends, might be politically popular but could hurt the company’s profitability and capacity to invest. Or take a pre-election bid to save jobs at Alstom, which prompted the government in October to order high-speed trains that state rail operator SNCF may never be able to run on suitably fast tracks. In other cases, governments may not have intervened quickly or effectively enough. France’s Court of Auditors in January criticised the state for exercising insufficient oversight over nuclear power engineering group Areva, whose market capitalisation fell by nine-tenths between 2006 and 2016, and for failing to address governance problems in a timely way. The temptation to allow problems to fester or meddle for political reasons is greater when unemployment is at 9.6 percent and voices from both the political far-right and far-left advocate a bigger role for the state. Companies in which the state had a stake employed nearly 2.4 million people, or one in six workers outside the public sector, at the end of 2015. There may, however, be a price to pay. The APE, an agency housed in the Finance Ministry, manages four-fifths of the government’s portfolio in euro terms, and the value of the listed shares it holds fell by 54 percent in like-for-like terms in the decade up to the end of 2016, according to the Court of Auditors. That was more than four times the drop in France’s CAC 40 stock index. Volatile energy and raw materials prices were a factor, and the portfolio has outperformed the national blue-chip index so far this year. But the public auditor reckons past governments share a part of the responsibility. Selling stakes in companies and sectors that aren’t strategic would help reduce the scope of sectors in which such potential conflicts of interest might arise. So would giving the APE agency more autonomy and new guidelines that distinguish more clearly between sectors and companies in which the state has a clear political interest, such as the nuclear sector, and those where its interest is more commercial and akin to those of any other investor. A new president and the impending election of a new parliament offer the opportunity to make such changes. But it’s unclear whether Macron has the inclination. The former Rothschild banker may be keen on reforming the labour market, but French business leaders doubt he will adopt a far more laissez-faire attitude to managing the French state’s portfolio. His track record certainly supports this view. In 2015, during Macron’s tenure as economy minister, the French government spent 1.2 billion euros to raise its stake in French carmaker Renault to maintain the double voting rights of long-term investors, including itself. Little warning was given to either Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn or the board.  If Macron’s instincts haven’t changed, his view on what is in France’s strategic interests is likely to involve keeping cutting-edge technology and know-how tethered to the French soil rather than falling into overseas, and particularly non-European, hands. This, rather than a hard and fast definition of the sectors that are vital to France’s national interests may determine how the state’s portfolio is managed. Macron is a banker by background, but a politician at heart.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Much has been made of the ‘Triple Threat Thursday’ but beyond the commentary on the outside risks from those events it was hard to see any real trepidation in prices.

Italy's bonds cheered the banking sector talk and the pound and the euro were at $1.2972 and $1.1259 respectively, the former near a two-week high and the latter just off a seven-month high. The dollar was also in a holding pattern. The yen had landed a glancing blow overnight after stimulus withdrawal talk from a Bank of Japan policymaker, but the greenback had all but recovered as focus returned to the day's main events.

Although it keeps pressure on Trump, Wall St markets largely shrugged it off after Wednesday's written testimony as not toxic enough to ratchet up the threat of an impeachment.  To be honest I'm absolutely staggered about the degree to which this geopolitical environment and developments are having absolutely no effect on markets,  said Saxo Bank head of FX strategy John Hardy.  I'm old enough to remember how nervous the market used to get about this kind of stuff back in the day. I admit I don't know how to price it, but it's really staggering.  With the VIX implied volatility index, the markets' so called 'fear gauge' hovering just above 10 percent, similar arguments are being made about the UK election and the ECB policy meeting later. For all the scenarios of a hung-parliament or Labour-led coalition, the central assumption is for a slightly increased majority for the ruling Conservatives and averaging the very diverse opinion poll projections points to the same. Spot sterling has been firm in recent days, although the jump in overnight implied volatility readings to some 30 percent – its highest since July – at least shows some pricing of possible risks over the next 24 hours. As for the ECB, soundings on downgraded inflation forecasts and background trepidation about banking sector stability make it highly unlikely it will signal any major tightening of policy ahead later.  We expect the ECB to tweak its forward guidance by dropping the easing bias on interest rates, while leaving the rest of its guidance largely unchanged, including the easing bias on asset purchases,  UniCredit said in a note. Oil Spill The biggest moves of the week so far remain centred around ebbing energy prices and inflation outlooks in general. Brent crude stabilized at $48.50 a barrel in European trading, after another steep drop briefly below $48 overnight. It is now down more than 7 percent year-on-year. With inventories showing no easing of the global glut, an ongoing row between Qatar and its Arab neighbours is seen as undermining the OPEC consensus about production cuts to limit oil supply. Financially, the isolation of Qatar is taking its toll on the country’s debt and currency markets. Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday and Moody's warned on Thursday that it saw risks too if the situation continued. The riyal currency fell to an 11-year low and Qatari sovereign dollar bonds also extended losses of recent days. The cost of insuring exposure to the kingdom's debt rose to the highest level since mid-November.  We expect that economic growth will slow, not just through reduced regional trade, but as corporate profitability is damaged because regional demand is cut off, investment is hampered, and investment confidence wanes,  S&P; said.

Thailand makes public few details of the finances for its monarchy, whose assets, estimated at more than $40 billion, rank  it among the world's richest. Since taking the throne in December, King Maha Vajiralongkorn has set about restructuring the palace and in April, parliament agreed to transfer to him control of royal agencies managed by the prime minister and defense ministry. A draft of the annual budget allocated 4.19 billion baht ($123 million) to the monarchy for  security fundamentals , but gave no explanation of what this comprises. The figure compares to 4.89 billion baht for the fiscal year from October 2016 to September 2017, a decrease of more than 14 percent. Last year, the figure was given under national security as being for  upholding and preserving the monarchy . It was not made clear whether funding on any of the other budget lines would directly or indirectly benefit the palace. By comparison, Britain’s Royal Household said its sovereign grant for the year to March 2016 was around 40 million pounds ($52 million), though that does not cover costs such as security. The new Thai figures were revealed in a 2.9-trillion-baht draft budget submitted to parliament by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. It had already been approved by the cabinet.  Thailand's new King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun is seen on his way out from the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Thailand, December 2, 2016.Jorge SilvaThe king inherited the throne last year following the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose reign spanned seven decades. His major staffing changes include appointments this week of 10 civil servants to new posts, as well as a fourteenth member to the Privy Council advisory body. The new addition is an armed forces officer, like most of the panel, as is the king. The wealth of the Thai crown is rarely discussed in Thailand, where strict royal insult laws make criticism of the monarchy a crime. But two recent studies value the crown's assets and corporate holdings at more than $40 billion. The monarchy's household and finances are managed by the Bureau of the Royal Household and the secretive Crown Property Bureau, a quasi-government agency. On its website, the Crown Property Bureau says it manages properties that  do not belong to the monarch in his or her private capacity, but to the monarchy as an institution . Income generated from the Crown Property is used  firstly for expenditures for the upkeep of the royal family, and thereafter, at the monarch’s discretion.  The monarch's personal assets are managed separately. Preserving the monarchy and maintaining the military’s role as its protector has been a key theme for Prayuth’s administration, which seized power from an elected government in 2014 in the name of ending months of political unrest.

In a string of meetings, Canadian officials have pressed Mexico to fix the problem, which hamstrings mining companies' ability to invest in operations and is particularly difficult for smaller, cash-strapped miners and explorers, people familiar with the matter said. Vancouver-based Goldcorp declined to comment on its outstanding refund, which represents 142 percent of its 2016 net profit and 6 percent of its full-year revenue.     Goldcorp, the world's No. 3 gold miner by market value, is owed the largest amount, according to documents seen by Reuters, followed by Torex Gold Resources, a small, Toronto-based miner which began commercial production at its Mexico mine last year and is waiting on a refund of some $66.5 million.  It's damaging the ability to reinvest the dollars in assets that actually pay real tax,  said Torex chief executive Fred Stanford, who is working with Mexican authorities to resolve Torex's 2015 submissions, but declined to comment on the refund amount. While several companies said that refund delays began to grow longer two or three years ago, exact amounts of withheld refunds have not been previously reported. Osvaldo Santin, head of Mexico's Tax Administration Service, acknowledged the problem in an interview last month with Reuters, saying the agency had seen a spike in value-added tax, or VAT, refund requests.      Given this atypical phenomenon, we are carrying out more in-depth assessments,  he said. Working with the miners, the agency is aiming for a quick resolution to prevent it becoming an operations problem, Santin added. Investment Appetite Sours Mining companies' appetite for investing in Mexico has soured in the face of the withheld rebates as well as ongoing security threats and high royalties, said Rob McEwen, CEO of McEwen Mining.  You take a number of these factors and when a miner doesn't have control over them, it increases the risk,  he said.    Toronto-based McEwen, which saw its Mexican mine robbed at gunpoint of 7,000 ounces of gold in 2015, said it had a $6.2 million refund outstanding as of March 31.     Nearly 70 percent of foreign-owned mining companies operating in Mexico are based in Canada, according to Global Affairs Canada, the country's combined foreign and trade ministry. The value of Canadian mining assets in Mexico totaled C$19.4 billion ($14.4 billion) in 2015, second only to U.S. assets worth an estimated C$24.8 billion. The tax row comes as foreign direct investment (FDI) in Latin America's second-largest economy has cooled while U.S. President Donald Trump pressures American business to grow at home. FDI in Mexico slumped 26 percent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago to $7.9 billion. 'Can't Add a 16-Percent Cost' Unlike sales tax, which only applies to a final purchase, Mexico's 16-percent VAT is levied every time value is added during the production of goods or when they are sold. Mining companies, which export much of their production and spend heavily on machinery and equipment, typically generate large VAT returns. Mexico's VAT refunds officially take 40 days to be processed, and by law, can take months if there is an audit. In practice, however, the process can take much longer, particularly if litigation is involved. Endeavour Silver Corp is owed $15.6 million - including $6 million to $7 million from purchases with seven suppliers under audit - money that Chief Financial Officer Dan Dickson said is being withheld to coax Endeavour to pressure the suppliers into paying more income tax.  It's not my job to make sure they are paying their income tax,  he said.  We can't add a 16-percent cost to our company. That makes our mines unprofitable.  Sources and documents also show Alamos Gold is owed about $26 million and Agnico Eagle Mines nearly $18 million. The Toronto-based companies were not immediately available for comment.     Frustrated miners complained to Canada's Minister of Natural Resources, Jim Carr, during a trade mission earlier this year. Carr raised the matter with Mexico's Secretary of the Economy, who committed to look into the matter, two sources said.     The extended wait times for VAT refunds are forcing the hand of some small miners, said one executive, who asked not to be named.      I've heard, more recently, of an increase in intermediary third parties actually buying VAT receivables (at a discount), so companies can get the cash up front,  he said.  Miners are just increasingly desperate to get their refunds.

It also said it was investigating reports that 50-80 people had died in an air strike on the Zanjili district of Mosul on May 31. It did not say who carried out the strike. The killing of fleeing civilians by Islamic State militants occurred in the al-Shifa neighborhood on May 26, June 1 and June 3, it said.   Credible reports indicate that more than 231 civilians attempting to flee western Mosul have been killed since 26 May, including at least 204 over three days last week alone,  the U.N. human rights office said in a statement.  Shooting children as they try to run to safety with their families – there are no words of condemnation strong enough for such despicable acts,  the statement quoted U.N.

Last week Iraqi police said at least seven civilians had been killed by Islamic State mortar shells in the Zanjili area of western Mosul.

The U.N. statement said the deaths in Zanjili were reportedly caused by one of several recent air strikes that had inflicted civilian casualties and it was seeking further information about those attacks, without elaborating.    The murder of civilians, as well as the intentional directing of an attack against civilians who are not directly taking part in hostilities, are war crimes,  it said.

The Taiwan government is helping the company find the ideal location for an advanced technology 3-nanometer chip plant, it added.  We do not exclude locations in other countries, but a Taiwan location will be our first consideration,  acting spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun told reporters on the sidelines of a shareholders' meeting. The plan comes at a time when other tech heavyweights, like Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which goes by the trade name of Foxconn, and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, look to deepen investment in their U.S. businesses. This follows Donald Trump's presidential win last year, built on a campaign promise to boost American manufacturing and jobs. TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said in January he would not rule out a U.S. plant but added that such a move would involve sacrifices for both the company and consumers, pointing to the benefits of being able to shift engineers across the firm's Taiwan factories. TSMC, a major supplier to Apple Inc, has also flagged plans for the development of 5-nanometer chip plant. A Taiwan location for that factory is under environmental review, Sun said. The contract chipmaker's plans for new plants come in the wake of record sales and profits last year and an upbeat outlook for 2017 as the shift to mobile computing creates robust global demand for its products.  This year should also be a pretty good year. Our stock price is very, very good and healthy,  Chang told shareholders on Thursday. The stock closed up 0.7 percent at a record high to value the firm at T$5.52 trillion ($184 billion), boosted by Chang's comments and as shareholders approved a cash dividend of T$7 for 2016, up from T$6 a year earlier. Its shares have climbed steadily over the past seven years and this year it surpassed Intel Corp in market value. Chang played down TSMC's decision to pull out of the race for Toshiba Corp's highly prized chip business, saying after 6-7 weeks of intense deliberation earlier this year, the company decided the acquisition didn't fit with its strategy.

The Taiwan government is helping the company find the ideal location for an advanced technology 3-nanometer chip plant, it added.  We do not exclude locations in other countries, but a Taiwan location will be our first consideration,  acting spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun told reporters on the sidelines of a shareholders' meeting. The plan comes at a time when other tech heavyweights, like Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which goes by the trade name of Foxconn, and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, look to deepen investment in their U.S. businesses. This follows Donald Trump's presidential win last year, built on a campaign promise to boost American manufacturing and jobs. TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said in January he would not rule out a U.S. plant but added that such a move would involve sacrifices for both the company and consumers, pointing to the benefits of being able to shift engineers across the firm's Taiwan factories. TSMC, a major supplier to Apple Inc, has also flagged plans for the development of 5-nanometer chip plant. A Taiwan location for that factory is under environmental review, Sun said. The contract chipmaker's plans for new plants come in the wake of record sales and profits last year and an upbeat outlook for 2017 as the shift to mobile computing creates robust global demand for its products.  This year should also be a pretty good year. Our stock price is very, very good and healthy,  Chang told shareholders on Thursday. The stock closed up 0.7 percent at a record high to value the firm at T$5.52 trillion ($184 billion), boosted by Chang's comments and as shareholders approved a cash dividend of T$7 for 2016, up from T$6 a year earlier. Its shares have climbed steadily over the past seven years and this year it surpassed Intel Corp in market value. Chang played down TSMC's decision to pull out of the race for Toshiba Corp's highly prized chip business, saying after 6-7 weeks of intense deliberation earlier this year, the company decided the acquisition didn't fit with its strategy.  This kind of opportunity will be there in the future,  he told shareholders. Toshiba aims to name the buyer for its $18 bln chips business next week, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Construction could be completed by 2020, or four years before the Malampaya natural gas field is depleted, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said in a presentation to an industry forum this week. The Philippines' energy demand will triple by 2040, with electricity requirements anticipated to grow four times from 2015, Cusi said during the forum. The Philippines needs to step up power generation capacity by 7,000 megawatts over the next five years to support a fast-growing economy and wants foreign investors to help. Chinese and Japanese companies are among the foreign investors who want to help build energy infrastructure, including liquefied natural gas facilities, Cusi told Reuters in February. The LNG project, which includes a 200-megawatt power plant, is among the investment opportunities up for grabs in the country's long-term energy plan, which seeks to add power capacity of 43,765 MW by 2040, Cusi said.  Hopefully, with Dutertenomics attracting the adequate level of private investments, we can reach our targeted additional power capacity by 2040,  he said. Cusi was referring to the economic agenda of President Rodrigo Duterte, which envisages massive spending to build new infrastructure and modernize existing facilities. Several firms have expressed interest in building LNG facilities in the Philippines, including Manila Electric Company, formerly in talks with Osaka Gas Co Ltd for a joint venture. Energy authorities said the talks halted because both decided to separately reassess the power supply situation. In April Philippine power producer First Gen Corp said it was willing to work with the government to build a $1-billion LNG terminal to sustain its gas-fired power plants currently running on Malampaya gas. The operator of Malampaya, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, has also been looking to set up a floating regasification facility to sell LNG in the Philippines. Australia-listed Energy World Corp Ltd has been building an LNG hub in eastern Quezon province that includes a floating storage regasification unit and power plants.

Trading was timid on the major FTSE 100 benchmark, which was up 0.1 percent by 0900 GMT ahead of results from Britain's parliamentary elections and a rate decision by the European Central Bank. Polls indicated Prime Minister Theresa May's gamble on securing a bigger Conservative majority would be rewarded with a win, though the surprise 2016 vote to quit the European Union meant investors were considering all scenarios. Mid-caps have outperformed the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 so far this year but the blue-chips have gained back some ground in recent weeks as tightening polls prompted greater caution on domestic stocks.  Some investors, possibly the market makers, have been told to get their books fairly straight rather than having long positions in stocks that could take a caning,  said Paul Mumford, manager of the Cavendish opportunities fund.  If you were to get a coalition, or Labour win, or a very small, difficult-to-work Conservative result, then the market would take it quite badly in the short term, the pound would drop and this would provide a boost to the exporters,  he added.  So the FTSE 100 has performed relatively well because people want to have an overseas hedge.  Inversely, a bigger majority for the Conservatives could prompt institutions to pick up some bargains among mid-caps, Mumford said. U.S. bank Citi advised investors to hedge political risk through the  UK 8 , a list of blue-chip stocks least exposed to domestic sales, while avoiding the  Anti UK 8  stocks with the greatest dependence on the British economy. Traders in the City of London prepared for a long night, with banks and brokers pulling in extra staff to cover for potential volatility as results trickle in. While macroeconomic events were front and centre of investors' minds, some company moves stood out. Centrica and SSE were among the top blue-chip gainers. Their share prices have dipped in recent weeks as the election approached, with investors concerned about manifesto promises to cap energy prices or nationalise the companies.  The prospect of nationalisation from a Labour government has caused investors to cool on the utilities sector,  said Kathleen Brooks, market analyst at City Index, in a note. Among mid-caps, Berendsen jumped 9 percent, the most actively traded stock as investors cheered a merger with Elis after the French laundry firm sweetened its offer for the company. Elis' latest offer valued Berendsen at 2.2 billion pounds, or 1,250p a share, a 45 percent premium to its closing price before the initial takeover offer last month. Petrofac shares jumped 6 percent, among top European gainers, after the oil services firm sealed a 10-year deal with Petroleum Development Oman. Petrofac was set for its best day in just under a year, but still wallowed near the eight-year lows hit when Moody's cut the firm's debt rating to junk a week ago.

Some also use tiny earpieces to communicate with accomplices helping them outside the exam room. The innovations have forced authorities to step up their game in response. Exam centers this year have deployed metal detectors, facial and fingerprint recognition technology, cellphone-signal blockers, wireless detectors and even drones in their fight to root out cheating, media reported. Even before the exam kicked off in earnest on Tuesday, security officers had arrested 52 people nationwide. Cheaters and their accomplices face up to seven years in jail.

The southern African nation has had to rely on domestic taxes and borrowings to fund its national budget since international institutions stopped lending to President Robert Mugabe's government, which owes more than $7 billion in arrears. The treasury said in a January-March report that the government's domestic borrowings stood at $4.034 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 40.2 percent from the prior year. Mugabe's government has struggled to pay its workers due to a financial squeeze and earlier this year said it would borrow $180 million locally to pay outstanding bonuses for 2016 after civil servants threatened to go on strike. The budget deficit stood at $230 million during the first quarter after the government spent $1.1 billion against revenue of $869 million. More than 60 percent of the revenue was used to pay state wages. The treasury however said it expected economic growth of 3.7 percent this year, over double its previous forecast of 1.7 percent, on the back of improved performances in agriculture and mining. Output of the staple maize is forecast at 2.1 million tonnes this year, from 511,000 tonnes in 2016, when Zimbabwe was hit by a devastating drought that left more than 4 million people in need of food aid. Earnings from mining, the biggest foreign currency earner, are forecast to reach $3 billion this year due to higher commodity prices, the treasury said.

Mechel borrowed heavily before Russia's economic crisis hit in 2014 and was facing what would have been the country's biggest corporate collapse after struggling with debt repayments as demand for its products weakened and coal and steel prices fell. But the company, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, struck a debt-restructuring deal with creditors last year and posted a net profit of 13.9 billion roubles ($244 million) for the first quarter of 2017, helped by higher coking coal prices. Mechel said in a statement on Thursday its board had recommended dividend payments of 10.28 roubles per preferred share for 2016, when it made a net profit of 7.1 billion roubles. The company has paid preferred shareholders a minimum payment of 5 kopeks per a share since 2011 and has yet to resume full dividend payments to ordinary shareholders. Mechel's preferred shares on the Moscow Exchange jumped 7 percent after the announcement. Chief Executive Oleg Korzhov said last month that management had asked creditors for permission to make the dividend payments, currently set at 20 percent of net profit.

Beijing and Washington agreed to 100 days of trade talks after U.S. President Donald Trump met his counterpart Xi Jinping in April, aimed at cutting last year's $347 billion U.S. trade in goods deficit with the world's second largest economy. But critics within U.S. industry have said that outcomes of the talks so far have yielded only superficial remedies and failed to address more pressing issues of Chinese market access restrictions and industrial policies. Social and economic stability is seen as a top priority for China's ruling elite ahead of a 5-yearly party congress this fall. Diplomats suggest that turmoil in relations with the United States would be an unwanted distraction for Xi ahead of a tricky leadership transition within the party. William Zarit, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the Chinese leadership wants to go into the congress  without any major difficulties in the trade area with the U.S..   So, I'm actually hoping that this can be a positive for coming up with some measures that will address the fairness and reciprocal treatment issues,  Zarit said in a meeting with reporters. Using that leverage ahead of the congress was  part of the conversation  with U.S. officials and lawmakers when the chamber made a lobbying trip to Washington in early May. But Zarit added that it was not a long-term solution and that the Trump administration needed to be more strategic in trade relations with China.  During the May trip, the chamber met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro, and dozens of lawmakers, including Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and pressed them to ensure U.S.-China trade relations were based on  reciprocal treatment . The U.S. business community in China, which had long lobbied Washington against aggressive policies on China out of fear of retribution, has in recent months advocated for more forceful measures to get China to open its market wider. China says foreign companies receive equal treatment under Chinese laws a policies, but many sectors of China's economy are either off limits or severely restricted to foreign investors.

Higher values for all food goods except sugar lifted prices on international markets 10 percent above the same month last year, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.   Rising shipping costs and larger import volumes are due to push the cost of importing food globally to more than $1.3 trillion in 2017, FAO said. This would be a 10.6 percent rise over 2016's import bill, despite broad stability in markets buoyed by ample supplies of wheat and maize and higher production of oilseed products.  Poor countries that rely on imports to cover their food needs, and part of sub-Saharan Africa are on course for an even faster rise in their import costs as they buy in more meat, sugar, dairy and oilseed products.   All food categories except fish are due to add to rising import bills, as robust growth in aquaculture in many developing countries increasingly manages to meet domestic demand.  FAO's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.6 points in May, up 2.2 percent from April. FAO trimmed its forecast for global cereals output in the 2017-18 season to 2.594 billion tonnes, down 0.5 percent year-on-year. Global wheat production is expected to decline 2.2 percent after a record harvest last year.

Britain's vote last June to leave the EU has sparked fierce competition among financial centers elsewhere in the bloc, including Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg, to attract banks and other financial companies. Currently, EU rules allow a fund manager in London to sell and manage funds across the bloc, but it is unclear whether that will continue to the same extent after Brexit as the shape of future UK-EU trading relations has yet to be hammered out. Overall, asset managers in London may have to move between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs to various cities on the continent, Jean-Louis Laurens, International Ambassador for French Asset Management Association (AFG) told Reuters in an interview in London.     Paris has stepped up its attempts to win business from financial firms currently based in Britain since the election of Emmanuel Macron as French president last month. Macron has vowed to overhaul the labor market and simplify the French tax and pension systems.   I have never seen so much alignment in the government to make France attractive as a financial center,  said Laurens, who also worked at Rothschild at the same time as former investment banker Macron.    The number one issue is labor laws, but that will be addressed by the new government.  The French regulator for the funds industry, AMF (Autorite des marches financiers) had a call with 53 senior executives from U.S. and UK asset managers on May 12 to discuss the process of setting up entities and ways to help, said Laurens.   There is a realization from the UK and U.S. firms that the Brexit negotiations will be so constrained that they might not have access to the single market. This means that companies will need to devise a plan,   he said. The AMF is also offering fund firms a fast track approval process of two weeks for regulatory licenses, said Laurens, which compares with two months in countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg which are also vying for asset managers, he said.  Britain's markets watchdog said on May 31 it had asked asset managers and investment firms to spell out how Brexit would affect their ability to continue serving EU customers and whether they needed to move to the bloc. So far though, there is little sign of a rush to Paris among the first fund managers to set out their Brexit plans.  Legal & General (LGEN.L) has said it would move some of its investment management operations to Ireland, while fund manager M&G; (PRU.L) is to set up a management company in Luxembourg.

Data from IHS Markit showed five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for Qatar widened out 3 basis points (bps) from Wednesday's close to 92 bps, a seven-month high. S&P; Global cut its rating by one notch to AA- from AA and put it on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there is a significant chance of a further downgrade. The move came after several Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic relations with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member Qatar while also suspending air, land and sea transport and imposing travel bans. Five year CDS for Saudi Arabia also rose 3 bps from Wednesday's close to 100 bps, the highest since end-March.

Asset prices in Central European financial markets were mostly rangebound.     Investors held their breath ahead of Thursday's British elections, the European Central Bank's meeting and the congressional testimony from ex-FBI director James Comey.     Market impacts are unpredictable if Britain's Tories lose power, the ECB softens its policy stance or if the testimony raises risks to U.S. president Donald Trump's rule, analysts said.     The crown still firmed 0.1 percent to 26.285 against the euro, touching its strongest levels since late 2013.     The Czech central bank (CNB) could make its first interest rate rise in the second half of this year, Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl said late on Wednesday.     Another rate setter, Oldrich Dedek was quoted by the daily paper E15 said as saying that he saw no reason to question the bank's staff forecast which suggests a third-quarter hike.     The bank has repeatedly said that the more the crown firms from its firmer cap at 27 against the euro, which the bank removed in April, the less needed rate tightening could be.     Czech markets still price in a hike to come not earlier than the second quarter of 2018, Komercni Banka rates trader Dalimil Vyskovsky said.      I actually think (the market) is aware of the risks of much earlier rate hike, but it seems to be that people are positioned already,  he said, adding that much will depend on the crown's gains and inflation developments.     The CNB's 2-percent inflation target is lower than in Hungary or Poland. A hike would be the first in about a decade, and its tightening bias is in contrast with loose policy stance elsewhere in the region.     Poland's central bank could keep rates at record lows until the end of 2018 because inflation is expected to stabilise, its governor reiterated on Wednesday.     The zloty eased 0.2 percent past the 4.2 line against the euro, its weakest levels in almost three weeks.     The forint eased a shade after May annual inflation came in slightly higher than expected, at 2.1 percent. This, however, will not change the central bank's dovish stance, analysts said. Healthy demand is expected at Thursday's bond auction, traders added.     The dinar was steady ahead of a meeting by the Serbian central bank where its is expected to keep the region's highest benchmark rate at 4 percent on hold.

Eurostat said the 19-country euro zone expanded by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 1.9 percent year-on-year.     That compared with earlier estimates of 0.5 and 1.7 percent respectively.     On an annualised basis, the euro zone economy was expanding at a rate of 2.3 percent in the Jan-March period, far outstripping the 1.2 percent rate of the United States.     Solid economy growth but subdued inflation has left the ECB in a quandary. ECB President Mario Draghi is yet to be convinced that a recent rebound of inflation is durable because wage growth remains sluggish.     The ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying programme and sub-zero interest rates, despite resistance from cash-rich Germany.                  However, the robust growth could lead the ECB to remove a reference to  downside risks  in its statement.     Eurostat said household consumption contributed 0.2 percentage points and gross fixed capital formation 0.3 points and government consumption 0.1 points to the first-quarter growth figure.

The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000,  the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,  said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years.  Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and  fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make , he said. Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don't yet know how to certify such planes.   I have no idea how we're going to do that,  Sinnett said.  But we're studying it right now and we're developing those algorithms.  Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the  Miracle on the Hudson,  Sinnett said.  If it can't, then we can't go there.  A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing.   This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies - not by ours or our competitors'  he said, referring to rival Airbus.  It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?

Dozens of complex robots are replacing humans for such mundane tasks as drilling and riveting, and Boeing is reordering some of its assembly steps to speed up the process. The savings, part of a long-term cost-cutting drive at the world's biggest plane maker that also includes substantial staff reductions, comes as Boeing has spent heavily to develop new aircraft models. It poured $1 billion into erecting a 27-acre factory to make carbon composite wings for its forthcoming 777X widebody jet. It scaled the factory to produce 100 planes a year. But with only 306 firm orders for the 777X on its books, and the production rate falling, Boeing is challenging workers to find more efficient ways to do the work so it can avoid purchasing some of the planned machinery.  Frankly, we would like to not to have to buy all of the equipment that we are currently sized for,  said Eric Lindblad, vice president of the 777X program, during a recent factory tour.  It's just saving money on capital.  Behind him, only two of six bays built to hold carbon fiber placement machines had been outfitted with all equipment. Boeing also has set up a temporary low-rate assembly line for initial production (LRIP) of the 777X so it can test processes before hitting the acceleration pedal.  Reducing Risk of Lemons Jason Clark (4th L), Vice President of Boeing 777 and 777X Operations, points to a model during a media tour of the 777 Wing Horizontal Build Line at Boeing's production facility in Everett, Washington, U.S. June 1, 2017.Jason RedmondThe  LRIP  strategy comes in part from painful lessons on the 787 line, where early aircraft that came out of the factory needed heavy reworking.  This time,  we are actually testing the primary elements of that new production capability  on the 777, a plane Boeing already knows how to make, said Jason Clark, vice president of 777 and 777X operations.  Final assembly of the 777X begins next year, with testing in 2019 and first delivery in 2020. Lindblad said it might be delivered a quarter early, if customers want, but not in 2019. Slideshow (9 Images)On the 787 line, where wings, fuselage and other major pieces are shipped from suppliers and simply assembled at Boeing, the savings options are fewer.  But teams are still taking out costs. They have slashed production time by more than two-thirds in four years through such changes as organizing kits so mechanics have all parts on hand and putting interiors into planes earlier on the assembly line, said Bob Manelski, director of 787 business operations.  Boeing builds the 787 in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. That allows it to try out new techniques on one line at a time.

The savings are crucial to paying back about $27 billion in deferred 787 production costs racked up by the first few hundred 787s.  Boeing's goal is to build the largest 787 version, the 787-10, in the same amount of time as the two smaller versions - and for the same cost as the 787-9. It has no choice but to continue getting lean, Manelski said.  We have to price the airplane more and more aggressively every time we got to the market.

The vote will decide whether May or her Labour Party rival Jeremy Corbyn takes control of Britain's exit from the European Union - a two-year negotiation which will plot a new course for the $2.6 trillion economy. The prime minister called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, to win more time to deal with the impact of the divorce and to strengthen her grip on the Conservative Party. While she is still expected to win, with a lead of between one percentage point and 12 points in polls released over recent days, financial markets are now digesting a bigger range of outcomes than they previously had considered. Landslide May Victory Sterling rallied in April when May called the vote as investors bet her then-large poll lead would translate into a big majority, reducing uncertainty over whether she would have the mandate required to negotiate on Britain's behalf and then drive the deal through parliament. The snap election pushes back the date of the next planned national election from 2020 - just after Britain is due to have quit the EU - to 2022, giving May more time to put the exit deal in place and potentially reducing political risk over how the deal is implemented. Some also take the view that a big majority would allow her to make compromises with Brussels, in contrast to a hardline approach to date that has prioritised issues like immigration and trade over access to Europe's lucrative single market. That all helped push sterling to an eight-month high of $1.3048 on May 18, since when it has weakened. U.S. bank Citi said a majority of more than 100 seats would lower the risk of a chaotic EU exit, but also reduce the chance that Britain could remain a member of the EU single market.  Ultimately, with a big majority for the Conservatives confirming a 'hard-but-smooth' Brexit base case, we think that abating uncertainty risks could see GBP/USD head towards 1.34 in the near term,  Citi strategists said in a note last month. May Wins With Enhanced Majority The Conservatives' lead fell sharply after May announced plans to make elderly voters pay more towards their old-age care, while Corbyn has gained ground thanks to popular policies such as renationalisation and higher taxes for the rich. Whilst still broadly predicting May will improve on the 12-seat victory her predecessor David Cameron won in 2015, the narrowing polls suggest a majority that might fall well short of a 100-seat or more landslide. Bank analysts say that would not undermine the central scenarios which have helped the pound in the past month but might struggle to drive it much higher.  We think our base case (a 70-seat Conservative majority) will result in sterling rallying back to the $1.30-1.3150 range,  analysts from Canada's Bank of Montreal said in a note to clients.  Foremost, this would be the result of market relief that the most bearish result (a Labour victory) didn’t come to pass.  May Wins but No Overall Gains: 12-Seat Majority or Less If May does not handsomely beat the 12-seat majority Cameron won in 2015, her electoral gamble will have failed, her ability to drive Brexit reform through parliament will be diminished and she will go into talks later this month looking weaker. The converse view is that with less room for manoeuvre domestically, she will be able to reject compromises proposed by Brussels and drive a harder bargain, knowing that EU negotiators will not want May to execute her threat of leaving without a deal. For investors the over-riding factor is likely to be greater uncertainty about whether there will be a deal on Brexit and what it will look like. Citi said anything less than a 40-seat majority could increase political risks and uncertainty for the Brexit process, pushing sterling lower.  May’s potential dependence on minorities such as hard Brexiteers or hard Remainers would raise the risk of 'chaotic Brexit', but also the chance of a much softer Brexit than she currently aims for,  analysts from the U.S. bank said. The near- to medium-term reaction would likely be a fall in sterling to $1.20, but with the potential for it to rise as high as $1.50 if the political situation evolved in a way that forced May to soften her demands on Brexit, they added. Hung Parliament: No Clear Winner If neither main party wins a clear majority, markets will have to deal with considerable uncertainty over who will form the next government and what compromises the eventual prime minister will have to make to get the support of other parties. In 2010, when the Liberal Democrats held the balance of power, markets reacted to the uncertainty by selling sterling. This time round the choice is likely to be even less clear, with the Liberal Democrats greatly reduced in number and the pro-EU Scottish National Party likely to have more influence. The Conservatives' positioning on Brexit and, to a lesser extent other domestic issues like austerity, makes it unlikely that it could find a willing coalition partner, making a Labour-led government the most likely outcome from a hung parliament. JP Morgan said that despite the uncertainty, that outcome could generate a rise for sterling.  A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite a negative for sterling,  analyst Paul Meggyesi said in a note distributed to media on Tuesday and sent to clients at the end of last week.  But in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties ... might actually be GBP positive.  Corbyn Victory A clear win for Corbyn, whose less than two-year-old leadership has been marked by poor ratings, divisions among his party and a failed coup attempt, would force many investors to redraw their assumptions on both Brexit and the fiscal outlook. History shows that sterling tends to weaken on big moves towards Labour in the polls and analysts and London-based traders say they would be braced for an immediate dive in the pound if Corbyn won. Longer term, however, analysts from a number of banks highlight the potential for both more borrowing to fund economic stimulus and the increased likelihood that Corbyn will negotiate a closer trading relationship with the EU than May would have done.  At first GBP may suffer as a result from the UK shifting to the left-leaning side of politics and investors’ expectations of larger deficit financing,  analysts from Japan's Nomura said in a note.  But because of the higher real yields we would expect and hopes of a soft Brexit - or indeed no Brexit at all - this should eventually provide support to the currency.

The IAAF, the governing body for athletics, said that Clothier would be in charge of the unit's  core activities  which included  testing; intelligence and investigations; compliance; case management and education.  Clothier previously established a similar unit to monitor doping, match-fixing and other integrity issues in Australian rules soccer, which he then led for eight years.   I am excited by the opportunity I have been given to lead the athletics integrity unit in rebuilding athlete and fan confidence in how we manage threats to the sport,  said Clothier in an IAAF statement. The AIU is a plank in the sweeping reforms introduced by IAAF president Sebastian Coe after a series of scandals, including a corruption probe by French authorities into high-ranking officials such as his predecessor Lamine Diack. A doping scandal involving Russian athletes, which saw the country's track and field team banned from last year's Rio Olympics, has also cast a long and enduring shadow over the sport.  New Zealander David Howman was named as the AIU's chairperson in April.  (Clothier's) track record of establishing and driving forward the Australian Football League Integrity Unit from scratch eight years ago speaks for itself,  he said.

Gazprom and Naftogaz have been locked in a bitter legal dispute since 2014, a byproduct of worsening relations between Kiev and Moscow since Ukraine's pro-European uprising and Russia's annexation of Crimea. Gazprom Deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev said this week the Russian company was ready for talks with Ukraine on gas transit to Europe beyond 2019, when the current contract expires. He did not say where any talks should be held.  The Russian Federation is an unacceptable location for negotiations between Naftogaz of Ukraine and Gazprom,  Naftogaz said in a statement.  Naftogaz remains open for discussions with Gazprom in Brussels or other city of the European Union,  it said. The two companies lodged multi-billion-dollar claims against each other with a Stockholm arbitration court, which resolves commercial agreement disputes.   In two separate cases Kiev has demanded a higher tariff for the transit fee it charges Russia to transit to Europe and to cancel the requirement  take or pay  for the gas supply deal signed in 2009. Last week, Naftogaz said the court had ruled in its favor regarding the  take or pay  clause, although Gazprom said the ruling was an interim stage in the court process and the decision was positive for Gazprom  on balance.  Since 2014, Ukraine has been weaning itself off reliance on Russian energy supplies and has not bought gas directly from Russia since November 2015, relying instead on purchases from European Union member states and its own supply. But Ukraine remains a major route for Russian gas supplies to Europe, pumping 82.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in 2016, 23 percent more than a year earlier.

Polling has started in the UK national elections, while the European Central Bank (ECB) may discuss dropping additional stimulus pledges at a meeting later and former United States Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey will testify before the U.S. Congress about his interactions with President Donald Trump later in the day.      Unless there is a major surprise today and the Labor Party gets up over the Conservatives, I doubt there will be much reaction to gold price from the UK election. The market has already priced this,  said Cameron Alexander, an analyst with Thomson Reuters-owned metals consultancy GFMS.      A more bullish forecast (from ECB meeting) is likely to lead to a movement away from gold to higher-yielding asset, although any move will be modest.       Spot gold        was nearly flat at $1,285.91 per ounce, as of 0809 GMT.          U.S. gold futures         for August delivery dipped 0.4 percent to $1,288.20 an ounce.        A lot of things are happening at the same time... There may be some kind of impact that may push up the volatility rather than the direction of price moves,  said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.      The yellow metal fell from a near seven-month high on Wednesday after Comey's written testimony to the U.S. Senate contained few surprises.                  A final flurry of opinion polls gave British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party a lead between 5 and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority - but not win the landslide foreseen when she called the election seven weeks ago.                               With the (UK poll) results coming out during the Asian session on Friday morning, the downside for gold is likely to be limited as we run into the weekend,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.     Meanwhile, the ECB is likely to keep its easy monetary policy during its meeting as inflation remains below its target despite stronger economic growth in the euro zone.                              In other precious metals, palladium        gained as much as 0.7 percent to $840.10 an ounce. In the previous session, it hit the highest in near three years, but shed its early gains to end 2.3 percent lower.          Platinum climbed 0.6 percent to $947.80 per ounce, and silver        rose 0.5 percent to $17.63.

Weak capitalisation levels will remain a key credit weakness for the 11 banks, the ratings agency said, adding that they had limited ability to raise external capital. Moody's said it estimated that the 11 banks - including State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank - will need external equity capital of 700 billion rupees to 950 billion rupees, over a two-year period ending March 2019, to fully meet Basel III capital rules.  Moody's believes that capital infusions from the government remain the only viable source of external equity capital, because of the public sector banks' low capital market valuations, which would likely continue to deny them the option of raising fresh equity from the capital markets,  the agency said. It said it expected impaired loans to increase during the horizon of this outlook, but at a slower pace versus the past two years. Provisioning costs will stay  broadly in line  with the levels during the last fiscal year to March, Moody's said.

The move follows criticism by activists who said it could fan hatred and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. The contest had originally required participants to submit video clips for one of three categories: sexual and reproductive health, cybersex and  gender identity disorder .  Its guidelines added that the videos must include elements showing the  consequences  of being LGBT, as well as how to  prevent, control and ways to seek help  for them. Malaysian deputy director-general of health Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said in a statement that the offending category had been replaced with  gender and sexuality . The decision was made following a meeting between ministry officials with the Malaysian AIDS Council, experts, and representatives of  key population groups , Lokman said.  This meeting successfully cleared the misunderstandings and collectively improvements were made to the competition guideline,  he said. Lokman had earlier defended the contest categories, saying the topics were chosen as statistics showed an increase in sexual and reproductive health problems among teens, including higher rates of sexual activity and a rise in HIV transmission. On Wednesday, he said the purpose of the contest was  not to single out or to discriminate  against the LGBT community, but to explore views among teens and identify gaps in health services.  Transgender activist Nisha Ayub, who had raised concerns over the video contest, welcomed the ministry's rethink.   We have to create a safe space for discussions and raise awareness. I hope this kind of engagement with officials will continue at other government agencies,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Activists say intolerance of LGBT people has spiked in recent years in Malaysia, a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian country that is majority Muslim.

Food ordered from top New York restaurants is served, but the real attraction is Martin Lipton, one of the firm's co-founders and corporate America's most famous consigliere. The father of the 'poison pill' – a key defense strategy used against hostile takeovers – Lipton has helped build the firm into the most lucrative legal outfit in the world, a go-to shop for companies seeking to seal complex deals or repel suitors and activist investors. The weekly lunch is just one of the ways the 85-year-old stays in touch with new associates and reinforces the firm's close-knit culture, where young law graduates are often paired with senior partners to work on big deals. Partners say a flat structure and relatively small size - Wachtell's lawyer headcount of about 260 is roughly half of its closest rival Cravath, Swaine & Moore – is key to the firm's success.   The firm's concentrated business model contrasts with the strategy of many law firms to become one-stop shops for deals, from navigating niche regulatory processes to sorting through labyrinthine tax affairs. Lipton is confident that his strategy of concentrating on high-stakes corporate situations will persist, according to interviews with several senior partners at the firm. This is because corporate America continues to turn to Wachtell as its top legal gun for hire.      Wachtell's business model is to be the firm you go to when you are not willing to take any risk at all,  said Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor.  They know that in the big M&A; cases, legal fees, no matter how big they are, are insignificant to the value of concluding the deal.   When French drug giant Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) threatened U.S.cancer drug company Medivation Inc with a $9.3 billion hostile bid last year, for example, Medivation called Wachtell despite having an existing external legal adviser, Cooley.    Cooley helped Medivation to go public in 2004 and is best known for advising on initial public offerings and defending against patent and class action lawsuits. Cooley and Medivation declined to comment. Most Lucrative  With some U.S. companies domiciled overseas, Wachtell's partners often have to adapt their techniques to different jurisdictions.     Rather than opening offices internationally as some of their rivals have done, Wachtell's lawyers fly out to advise, staying weeks in some cases to see a case through, and turn to other law firms to assist them.     The logo for the Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm is seen at their office in New York, U.S., June 7, 2017.Shannon StapletonWachtell did consider opening a London office in recent years, but decided against it, partner at the firm said. The feeling among the firm's senior partners was that expansion would dilute its culture, which is based around forming ad hoc teams to deal with situations, all from the one office in Manhattan.     Keeping itself small has helped Wachtell become the most lucrative law firm in the world, with the average partner making a profit last year of $5.8 million, according to trade publication American Lawyer. The top 100 law firms averaged profit per partner of $1.66 million. Capping the workforce also means that partners do not have an army of associates to foist work onto.       We work harder on average than other places, the work is very partner-heavy. It's the type of work where vast experience is critical,  said Daniel Neff, co-chairman of Wachtell's executive committee.     No one is more experienced than Lipton, referred to as Marty by clients and colleagues. He continues to work on high-profile cases including, most recently, advising General Motors Co's (GM.N) board of directors on its defense against activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital, as well metal parts maker Arconic Inc (ARNC.N) on its settlement with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.  Besides Lipton, two of the other three founding partners, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, have died. However, like Lipton, founding partner Herbert Wachtell remains active at 84 practicing law, focusing on corporate litigation, which is the firm's other major area of strength. M&a; Royalty Lipton has built a bench of seasoned deal lawyers who now account for the majority of the business that comes through the door. They include Neff and Edward Herlihy, who formally lead the firm as co-managing partners, as well as Andrew Brownstein, David Katz, Steven Rosenblum, Adam Emmerich and Andrew Nussbaum, among others.  When Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) turned to Wachtell in 2015 to defend against a $35 billion offer from Mylan NV (MYL.O), it was a 45-year-old partner, Igor Kirman, that the Irish-domiciled generic drug maker chose to lead its defense in three continents. Perrigo subsequently defeated what was the largest hostile bid ever rejected by a company's shareholders.  It was a given for me that by turning to Wachtell we would get excellent legal advice. But Igor also took very complex issues and simplified them so Perrigo's board could understand,  said Joseph Papa, Perrigo's former CEO who now leads Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). Lipton remains influential, fielding calls and studying cases every day from his 31st-floor office, which is filled with memorabilia from major deals stretching back to the 1970s.      Lipton is royalty in the M&A; bar. There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved,  said Gillers.   The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment.

Morocco's central bank granted its first licences to Islamic banks last week. Our discussions with Fitch-rated banks indicate that the ability to offer Islamic banking products could expand their deposit bases by 5% to 10%. The ability to grow the deposit base is positive for Morocco's economic development because deposits represent about 70% of banking sector funding. We expect growth of participation banks will be high initially, as was the case following the introduction of Islamic banking in Turkey and Indonesia. The ability to access Islamic products will ensure that customers have access to a more comprehensive range of services. Customers who have avoided transacting with conventional banks for sharia-related reasons can now move into the formal banking sector. However, banking penetration is already high in Morocco, with 70% of adults holding a bank account, suggesting that most Moroccans have not shied away from the banking sector on faith grounds. Participation banking is therefore unlikely to take a significant market share from the well-established conventional banks. The growth of participation banks will be affected by several factors, including the spread of awareness of Islamic finance, the extent to which the government stimulates expansion, population growth rates and regulatory developments. Positively, the central bank has established a central sharia board of Islamic scholars to oversee the sector, which should help to provide a cohesive framework under which the banks can operate. Greater clarity on essential aspects, such as how participation banks will manage their liquidity in a sharia-compliant manner and how financing contracts will be drawn up, would help to stimulate the sector. However, delays in establishing a clear framework could hinder the development of participation banks, forcing up funding costs and resulting in insufficient depth in product offerings. Growth rates in the Moroccan banking sector have been volatile in recent years, reflecting unsteady economic trends. Deposit growth (nearly 7% in 2016) has outstripped loan growth (3.9%) in recent years, but credit demand is set to accelerate in line with an improved economic outlook in 2017. This could force banks to compete more aggressively for deposits, putting pressure on margins at the conventional banks. The ability to offer participation banking services could broaden the pool of potential depositors in the country, mitigating the competitive pressure. Only existing conventional banks have applied for participation banking licences and we are not aware of any independent Islamic banks making requests to operate in Morocco. Banks owned by domestic shareholders, such as Attijariwafa Bank, BMCE Bank, Groupe Banque Centrale Populaire and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier, have opted to establish separate participation banking subsidiaries, while subsidiaries controlled by French parents, such as Societe Generale Marocaine de Banques (controlled by Societe Generale), Banque Marocaine pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (BNP Paribas) and Credit du Maroc (Credit Agricole), have chosen to provide services through special Islamic banking 'windows'.

The decision was made following a meeting between ministry officials with the Malaysian AIDS Council, experts, and representatives of  key population groups , Lokman said.  This meeting successfully cleared the misunderstandings and collectively improvements were made to the competition guideline,  he said. Lokman had earlier defended the contest categories, saying the topics were chosen as statistics showed an increase in sexual and reproductive health problems among teens, including higher rates of sexual activity and a rise in HIV transmission. On Wednesday, he said the purpose of the contest was  not to single out or to discriminate  against the LGBT community, but to explore views among teens and identify gaps in health services.  Transgender activist Nisha Ayub, who had raised concerns over the video contest, welcomed the ministry's rethink.   We have to create a safe space for discussions and raise awareness. I hope this kind of engagement with officials will continue at other government agencies,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Activists say intolerance of LGBT people has spiked in recent years in Malaysia, a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian country that is majority Muslim. In March, the Walt Disney film  Beauty and the Beast  was briefly barred from screening in Malaysia, after the company refused to remove  a gay moment  from the film at the request of Malaysian authorities.

The air force destroyed positions and armored vehicles  in the western Raqqa countryside, about 70 km (44 miles) from the city, state-run news agency SANA said.  U.S.-backed militias have separately been pushing into the edges of Raqqa city in the first days of their attack to seize Islamic State's base of operations in Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, launched an assault this week to take the northern city. The SDF has been closing in for months with the help of air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition.  Islamic State militants have made enemies of all sides in the six-year Syrian conflict, losing territory to several separate military campaigns over the past year.  The Syrian army has made gains against Islamic State in the east of Aleppo province, bringing them to the provincial border with Raqqa which is largely under SDF control. The Russian-backed Syrian army and allied militias then crossed into Raqqa province this week from neighboring Aleppo. The strikes on Thursday targeted areas near the provincial border, along a highway linking Raqqa to Aleppo and close to the Tabqa area the SDF captured from Islamic State in May. The Syrian government described the Kurdish-led war against Islamic State as  legitimate  last month. Damascus also said its military priorities were Islamic State-held Deir al-Zor and the Badia region at the border with Jordan and Iraq, suggesting it does not intend to challenge the Raqqa campaign underway.

The euro has risen 10 percent against the dollar in the past five months, partly due to the greenback's weakness but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018. But reports on Wednesday that the ECB would cut its inflation forecasts have dampened expectations of the bank's language veering towards a pullback of its stimulus programme, also known as quantitative easing (QE), later this year. The ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.59 trillion) bond-buying programme. Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole said that a downward revision to the ECB's core inflation path could dash hopes of a QE taper announcement as soon as September, adding he expected the ECB to deliver a relatively dovish message compared with expectations.  On the whole, a return of the ECB’s cautious rhetoric on the euro, plus a revision of the inflation projections and the dovish language that Draghi will likely use even when he's conveying a fairly constructive assessment of the improving euro zone outlook could weigh on the single currency,  he said. By 0806 GMT, the euro was up less than 0.1 percent at $1.1259. Sterling traded at $1.2969, staying near a peak of $1.2978 hit in morning European trade, its highest level since May 25. Opinion polls on Wednesday showed that Prime Minister Theresa May is on course to increase her majority in parliament in Thursday's election, suggesting her gamble to call the vote to strengthen her position in Brexit negotiations will pay off.  Markets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory,  said Jasslyn Yeo, market strategist in Singapore for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. If the Conservative Party gains a decisive majority of more than 50 seats, that would probably be seen as a positive outcome for sterling, Yeo said.  However, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors,  she added. Investors will closely monitor U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey later on Thursday, worried his testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for President Trump's agenda of rolling back regulation and overhauling the tax code. In written testimony released on Wednesday, Comey - who was abruptly fired by Trump in May - said that the president asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 109.72 yen, edging back in the direction of Wednesday's low of 109.115 yen, its lowest level in about seven weeks. Traders said the yen edged higher after Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources, that the Bank of Japan was re-calibrating its communications to acknowledge that it is thinking about how to handle a future exit from monetary stimulus.

Gazprom and Naftogaz have been locked in a bitter legal dispute since 2014, a byproduct of worsening relations between Kiev and Moscow since Ukraine's pro-European uprising and Russia's annexation of Crimea. Gazprom Deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev said this week the Russian company was ready for talks with Ukraine on gas transit to Europe beyond 2019, when the current contract expires. He did not say where any talks should be held.  The Russian Federation is an unacceptable location for negotiations between Naftogaz of Ukraine and Gazprom,  Naftogaz said in a statement.  Naftogaz remains open for discussions with Gazprom in Brussels or other city of the European Union,  it said. The two companies lodged multi-billion-dollar claims against each other with a Stockholm arbitration court, which resolves commercial agreement disputes.   In two separate cases Kiev has demanded a higher tariff for the transit fee it charges Russia to transit to Europe and to cancel the requirement  take or pay  for the gas supply deal signed in 2009. Last week, Naftogaz said the court had ruled in its favor regarding the  take or pay  clause, although Gazprom said the ruling was an interim stage in the court process and the decision was positive for Gazprom  on balance.  Since 2014, Ukraine has been weaning itself off reliance on Russian energy supplies and has not bought gas directly from Russia since November 2015, relying instead on purchases from European Union member states and its own supply. But Ukraine remains a major route for Russian gas supplies to Europe, pumping 82.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in 2016, 23 percent more than a year earlier.

Yields - which move inversely to prices - nudged off multi-week lows as a meeting of the bloc's monetary guardians shifted the focus away from geopolitical events that have seen investors stock up on safe-haven bonds in recent days. While some cautious tightening from the ECB had long been a fixture in the diary, a discussion by a BOJ policymaker about withdrawing monetary stimulus took some investors by surprise as it is still seen toiling with stubbornly low inflation.  The reason we are a bit under pressure today is because from a number of angles being long (bonds) doesn't look that compelling anymore,  RBC's global macro strategist Peter Schaffrik said.  Whether that extends into a more prolonged sell-off, we'll have to see.  German 10-year government bond yields, the bloc's benchmark, edged up 3 basis points to 0.28 percent, moving away from a six-week low of 0.245 percent hit Wednesday. Most other euro zone equivalents were 2-3 bps higher on the day. While the ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.59 trillion) bond-buying programme and sub-zero interest rates, sources told Reuters it will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement. RBC is also expecting subtle changes to its forward guidance to remove a reference to possible further cuts to interest rates. But any announcement on its quantitative easing (QE) programme is likely to be put off until the autumn, when policymakers hope the economic picture will have become clearer. Aside from the focus on monetary policy, analysts said there was broad relief across financial markets after former FBI director James Comey's testimony on the bureau's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election revealed little in the way of new details. Investors have viewed this saga as a distraction for President Donald Trump who they are pinning hopes on to reflate the world's biggest economy with ambitious spending plans. Italian government bonds bucked the broader trend, finding demand after a report that Italian banks are considering assisting in a rescue of troubled lenders Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca.

The report by Australia's chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is expected to help drive a political compromise between providing cheap, reliable energy and pushing to protect the environment. The Finkel Review was commissioned last October after tornadoes knocked down transmission lines in South Australia, triggering a state-wide blackout that left homes without power for up to eight hours and hobbled industry for as much as two weeks. The outage was a wake-up call for politicians whose bickering over emissions targets and carbon prices since 2007 left the power industry in the lurch and killed major investment in generation, except rooftop solar and wind power. The review is widely expected to recommend the introduction of a  technology-neutral  low emissions target (LET), with support for such a system gathering momentum over the last week among both the conservative government and opposition Labor leaders, who had previously preferred other approaches. The office handling the review declined to discuss its contents.  We are acutely aware that there is an energy crisis in this country which needs a constructive, mature approach, particularly from the two major parties in the Parliament,  Labor shadow minister for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, told Reuters in emailed comments. Storm clouds can be seen behind chimneys at the Bayswater coal-powered thermal power station located near the central New South Wales town of Muswellbrook, Australia, March 14, 2017.David Gray We want to see the detail of the LET and we want to consider it carefully,  he said. Labor has long preferred an emissions intensity scheme which would set limits on how much carbon a power generator could emit and give tradable credits to those that produce less than the limit.  FILE PHOTO - Sheep graze in front of wind turbines that are part of the Infigen Energy's Capital Windfarm located on the hills surrounding Lake George, near the Australian capital city of Canberra, Australia, July 17, 2015.David Gray/File photoHowever, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has ruled out an emissions intensity scheme to appease the right wing of his party, which is worried about the demise of the coal industry. A low emissions target would set limits on carbon emissions per megawatt hour of power generated.  What is needed is policy that will achieve bipartisan support and be technology neutral,  Australian Energy Council Chief Executive Matthew Warren said in emailed comments.  Without it we will not see enough certainty to encourage the billions of dollars of investment that will be required to meet emissions reduction goals while maintaining reliable supply.  Turnbull has announced plans to expand hydropower to support the grid, while trying to shore up gas supplies for generation and remains committed to cutting carbon emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 to meet the Paris climate accord.

Victims and activists have long campaigned for changes to the 1907 law, as society's attitudes toward rape victims are still chilly and many stay silent from shame or fear of criticism. Less than 5 percent of women who were forced to have sexual intercourse consulted police, according to government data for 2014, and only about one-third spoke to anyone, including friends.  This is a chance to change the penal code after 100 years: a once in a century opportunity,  said an online petition by more than 30,000 people. The current law was introduced before women could vote and its main intent was to protect  family honor and pedigree , the petition added.  Enactment of the proposed changes requires approval of parliament's upper chamber. Time is running short in the current parliamentary session, due to end on June 18, though media reports suggest it could be extended. The bill's passage has been caught up in wrangling over a separate anti-conspiracy bill that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition is trying to push through.  The proposed revisions would broaden the definition of rape, now limited to vaginal penetration by a penis, to a more inclusive  forced sexual intercourse  that includes forced anal and oral sex, thereby also recognizing males as possible victims. Victims would no longer be required to press charges themselves in order for the offender to be prosecuted, and the minimum sentence would be raised to five years imprisonment from three.  The revised law would also drop a requirement that sexual abuse by parents or guardians against minors under the age of 18 should involve  violence or intimidation  to be considered a crime. Four civil groups campaigning for legal changes presented a petition to the justice minister on Wednesday urging that the condition be removed for all victims, since a lack of physical resistance should not be taken to indicate that the sex was consensual, especially in cases of power harassment.  These revisions are necessary, although they are only partial and come too late,  Keiko Ota, a lawyer campaigning on the issue, told Reuters.  But the ruling parties have taken the revisions hostage in order to pass the anti-conspiracy act.   reporting by Linda Sieg; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-rape-idUSKBN18Z0V5"},

The company said on Thursday that moves to slow its expansion had already provided some benefits and that it would cut capacity in the second half to leave it broadly flat for the year to March 2018. Performance in the current financial year to June 5 had shown a 4.6 increase in passenger revenue per seat, Flybe said, adding that it had sold 45 percent of its capacity versus 44 percent at the same point last year.  Forward booking trends point to unit revenue improvements that we view as encouraging,  Liberum wrote in a client note, adding that headwinds for the company were starting to  moderate . It has a  Buy  recommendation on the stock. Shares in Flybe, which connects British regional airports to London and other European cities, rose 4.5 percent to 34.61 pence by 0803 GMT. They are down by around a fifth so far this year. The company reported an adjusted pretax loss of 6.7 million pounds ($8.7 million) for the year to March 31, against a 5.5 million pound profit the previous year. Flybe said that IT costs were lower than expected at 4.8 million pounds, having warned in March that it expected a charge of between 5 million pounds and 10 million pounds related to a systems upgrade. It has been contending with industry-wide challenges where larger European airlines have driven down fares by adding more seats to boost their market share in a period of lower oil prices. Flybe's own difficulties had been compounded by its large exposure to the UK, where demand has experienced some turbulence after the vote to leave the European Union, and due to its own rapid capacity growth due to legacy commitments for additional aircraft.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards blamed regional Sunni rival Saudi Arabia, a UAE ally. Riyadh denied involvement. The UAE state news agency WAM said President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan had condemned  the horrific crime .  His Highness Sheikh Khalifa expressed his sincere condolences to the Iranian people and the families of the victims, wishing the injured a speedy recovery,  the message to President Hassan Rouhani said, according to WAM. Tensions have been rising between conservative U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states, including the UAE, and non-Arab Iran over accusations that Tehran is meddling in the affairs of its Arab neighbors, a charge the Islamic Republic denies. Riyadh and Tehran vie for predominance in the Gulf and influence in the wider Islamic world. The attacks in Tehran came days after Riyadh and other Sunni Muslim powers cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing Tehran and militant groups.

The launches, the latest in a fast-paced series of missile tests by North Korea defying world pressure to rein in its weapons program, come less than a week after the United Nations Security Council passed fresh sanctions on the reclusive state. (Graphic - Nuclear North Korea tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF ) South Korea on Wednesday said it will hold off on installing remaining components of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that has angered North Korea's main ally, China, amid early signs of easing tensions between the two countries. U.S. President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed the Korean situation, including THAAD, at the White House on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing. North Korea missile launches showed that THAAD was  important to, not only to protect U.S. forces, to protect our alliance and to ... help to further strengthen the region,  Nauert said.  We are aware, certainly, of the situation and the suspension of additional launchers,  she said.  We would continue to say that THAAD was an alliance decision at the time, and we continue to work closely with (South Korea) throughout their process.  Nauert called the latest North Korean missile launches  provocative.   The missiles were launched Thursday morning from the North Korean coastal city of Wonsan and flew about 200 km (124 miles), South Korea's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the mainland United States.     Compared to the different types of ballistic missiles Pyongyang has recently tested, the missiles launched on Thursday are considered to be more defensive in nature, designed to defend against threats such as enemy warships. North Korea unveiled a number of new weapons at a massive military parade on April 15 to mark the birth anniversary of the state's founding leader and has since tested some of them.      What appeared to be a new type of land-to-ship missile equipped with four launching canisters was unveiled at the parade,  said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.  I think this might be what was used today.  Thaad Defense Delayed Thursday's launch is the fourth missile test by North Korea since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10 pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang. He says  sanctions and pressure alone have failed to resolve the growing North Korean threat. A South Korean soldier walks past a TV broadcast of a news report on North Korea firing what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast, at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, June 8, 2017.Kim Hong-JiNorth Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016 in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. Moon had also promised to review the deployment of the THAAD system in South Korea, a decision that was made by the government of his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye. On Wednesday, Moon's office said installation of four additional launchers would be halted until an assessment of the system's impact on the environment was completed. Two launchers of the full six-launcher THAAD battery, as well as the system's far-reaching radar that China worries could upset the regional security balance, have already been installed at a deployment site in the southeastern city of Seongju. The elements will stay in place, South Korea said. The introduction of the THAAD system has sparked protests in South Korea and a backlash in China against South Korean business interests. FILE PHOTO: A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014.Denis Balibouse/File PhotoThe Global Times, published by China's official People's Daily, said in an editorial that no matter the outcome of the environmental study, South Korea's announcement could reduce friction.  Obviously, the pressure China puts on South Korea has taken effect. Seoul's will has been shaken,  the paper said.  However, attitude is not everything. Without solving the problem of THAAD, the pain it has brought to bilateral relations will not disappear, and South Korea must swallow some of the bitter results.  China should work with Russia on counter-measures to THAAD, the Global Times added. Asked about the latest missile test, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called for all parties to exercise restraint.  The UN Security Council resolution has clear rules on (North Korea's) use of ballistic missiles technologies,  she said.  All sides should work together to de-escalate tensions and take active steps to stabilize the region.    Trump has been pressing China to rein in North Korea, warning that all options, including a pre-emptive military strike, are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development. Seoul, Tokyo and Washington were analyzing the launches for further information, officials said. Japan's navy and air force conducted military drills with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan last week, following similar joint U.S.-South Korea exercises.          North Korea likely wanted to show off its ability to precisely target a large warship, in relation to the joint military drills involving U.S. aircraft carriers,  Roh Jae-cheon, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman, told a media briefing.  By testing different types of missiles, North Korea also appears to be aiming to secure the upper hand in relations with South Korea and the United States.

Emaar was up 0.8 percent on Thursday morning and other property-related shares also gained, with builder Drake & Scull up 4.8 percent.

It leaped 10.9 percent on Wednesday after saying it had received $40 million from the Egyptian government towards its outstanding receivables. Saudi Arabia's index, however, fell 0.6 percent in the first 45 minutes of trade as most petrochemicals fell after Brent oil futures tumbled 4 percent overnight. Saudi Basic Industries was down 0.9 percent. Some Saudi shares have been rising on expectations that they will attract foreign money if MSCI launches a review on June 20 of whether to upgrade Riyadh to emerging market status. They were relatively resilient on Thursday; dairy producer Almarai was up 1.4 percent.

Previously, banks were generally required to provide such information monthly, they said. The Qatari central bank also asked banks to supply on a weekly basis a breakdown of their customer deposits by maturity and type from Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Egypt and other countries, the sources said.

The report by Australia's chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is expected to help drive a political compromise between providing cheap, reliable energy and pushing to protect the environment. The Finkel Review was commissioned last October after tornadoes knocked down transmission lines in South Australia, triggering a state-wide blackout that left homes without power for up to eight hours and hobbled industry for as much as two weeks. The outage was a wake-up call for politicians whose bickering over emissions targets and carbon prices since 2007 left the power industry in the lurch and killed major investment in generation, except rooftop solar and wind power. The review is widely expected to recommend the introduction of a  technology-neutral  low emissions target (LET), with support for such a system gathering momentum over the last week among both the conservative government and opposition Labor leaders, who had previously preferred other approaches. The office handling the review declined to discuss its contents.  We are acutely aware that there is an energy crisis in this country which needs a constructive, mature approach, particularly from the two major parties in the Parliament,  Labor shadow minister for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, told Reuters in emailed comments. Storm clouds can be seen behind chimneys at the Bayswater coal-powered thermal power station located near the central New South Wales town of Muswellbrook, Australia, March 14, 2017.David Gray We want to see the detail of the LET and we want to consider it carefully,  he said. Labor has long preferred an emissions intensity scheme which would set limits on how much carbon a power generator could emit and give tradable credits to those that produce less than the limit.  FILE PHOTO - Sheep graze in front of wind turbines that are part of the Infigen Energy's Capital Windfarm located on the hills surrounding Lake George, near the Australian capital city of Canberra, Australia, July 17, 2015.David Gray/File photoHowever, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has ruled out an emissions intensity scheme to appease the right wing of his party, which is worried about the demise of the coal industry. A low emissions target would set limits on carbon emissions per megawatt hour of power generated.  What is needed is policy that will achieve bipartisan support and be technology neutral,  Australian Energy Council Chief Executive Matthew Warren said in emailed comments.  Without it we will not see enough certainty to encourage the billions of dollars of investment that will be required to meet emissions reduction goals while maintaining reliable supply.  Turnbull has announced plans to expand hydropower to support the grid, while trying to shore up gas supplies for generation and remains committed to cutting carbon emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 to meet the Paris climate accord.

Lee and other former Samsung Group executives gave bribes to Choi Soon-sil, Park's long-time confidante, and in return, received political favors and government support for the 2015 merger, which prosecutors say transferred control of the key company to Lee from hospitalized patriarch Lee Kun-hee at the expense of other shareholders.     Jay Y. Lee, held in detention and undergoing trial on charges such as bribery and embezzlement, has denied all charges.  Choi and Park, also in detention and undergoing trials on charges such as abuse of power and extortion, have also denied all charges.

Fitch's stress test found the banks' risky exposure from the OSV sector will be shielded by healthy earning buffers and adequate loan-loss reserve coverage of 103%-118% at end-March 2017. As such, we see limited capital impairment risk, even with a large increase in non-performing loans (NPL). Singapore banks' SGD57 billion combined oil and gas exposure represented 60% of their combined core equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital at end-March 2017. There is reasonable diversification across the broader oil and gas industry within this portfolio and a more moderate SGD17 billion, or 18% of combined CET1 capital, is to the OSV sector. Our stressed scenario analysis shows that banks' 2016 earnings could fall by as much as 60% if the NPL ratios of their OSV portfolios rose to 70%, from around 20% currently, and collateral value halved. The analysis excludes the impact on the banks' other businesses. Fitch used conservative assumptions for the stress test, depicting a failure of almost all OSV companies other than state-owned and government-linked shipyards. Singapore banks saw moderating NPL formation after the 2Q16 peak, but risks remain if stress is prolonged. However, we believe the risks are mitigated by easing economic headwinds and oil-price stabilisation. Fitch expects the credit metrics of rated south-east Asian oil and gas companies to improve slightly in 2017, supported by improved crude oil prices to USD50-55 per barrel. Fitch revised its outlook on the region's oil and gas sector to stable for 2017, from negative in 2016.

In January, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said he would not rule out the development of a U.S. plant but that such a move would involve sacrifices for both the company and consumers, pointing to the logistical benefits of being able to shift engineers across the firm's Taiwan factories.  We do not exclude locations in other countries, but a Taiwan location will be our first consideration,  acting spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun told reporters on the sidelines of a shareholders' meeting on Thursday. She said the Taiwan government was helping the company find the ideal location for the 3-nanometer chip plant. TSMC, a major supplier to Apple Inc, has also flagged plans for the development of 5-nanometer chip plant. A Taiwan location for that factory is under review, Sun said. The company's deliberations about its production base come even as other tech heavyweights, like Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which goes by the trade name of Foxconn, and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, look to deepen investment in their U.S. businesses. This follows Donald Trump's presidential win last year, built on a campaign promise to boost American manufacturing and protect local jobs. Chang also downplayed TSMC's decision to pull out of the race for Toshiba Corp's highly-prized chip business.  This kind of opportunity will be there in the future,  Chang said in response to shareholders' questions. Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and J.R.

He is reading “The Invisible Gorilla”, which is about two subjects he is fascinated with – behavioural economics and cognitive psychology.  Written by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, the book focuses on the human mind’s penchant for selective attention. For Rajput, who has previously found himself in the middle of controversies and allegations of anger issues, the premise of the book hits home. “You only see things you want to see. When you have bought a bag or car, you see that car a lot more on the road. If you expect me to be arrogant, you will see things in me that will make you believe I am arrogant,” he told Reuters.  The 31-year-old actor started his career acting in daily soaps. He moved to films in 2013 with Abhishek Kapoor’s “Kai Po Che!” He won accolades last year for his portrayal of Indian cricketer M S Dhoni in the biopic titled “MS Dhoni – The Untold Story”. But Rajput says while the film earned lots of praise and love, it also altered people’s perceptions of him. “There is a natural tendency to think that someone who has come from TV, never had so much success and now has got a 100-crore (One billion rupees) film, it should all go into his head. Suddenly if I am quiet and confident, they think, ‘Oh, that is how it is.’” “It is confirmation bias. I was doing exactly the same things even before and nobody judged me like that.” At the trailer launch of his latest film, “Raabta”, Rajput was asked what he thought of a Pakistani court’s decision to order the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian citizen convicted of spying by Pakistan. Rajput said he didn’t want to comment on the issue and got into an argument with a reporter, who insisted that he answer the question. “I am smart, I know the popular opinion. I can very well go with it and you won’t be able to touch me but I was honest enough to say I don’t know enough about this issue to comment.  No one likes to be misunderstood,” he said. Troubles with the media aside, Rajput says he is focussing on his career, especially on roles which challenge him. “Even if the script is not predictable, but the character is, I won’t do the film. In “Raabta”, the theme is reincarnation, which I don’t believe in. But the story hooked me and I wanted to see if I could pull off two characters at the same time,” he said. Rajput is also doing “Chanda Mama Door Ke” a film about India’s first mission to the moon, and “Drive”, an action film that is envisaged as the first of a franchise.  “I don’t come from a rich family. I dropped out of college and came to Mumbai to act. I lived in a small flat with eight guys, worked from morning till night and still had the best time of my life. There is no fear of losing my fame and money,” he said of his tendency to take on unconventional roles. For those who think he’s becoming too big for his own boots, Rajput has a clear message: “I still remember the day in October 2006 when I decided to come to Mumbai. In my head, I was already a superstar. I still feel that way. And it is not negotiable. Not debatable. No popular opinion can change that feeling.”","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/interview-sushantsinghrajput-raabta-idUSKBN18Z0R2"},

But California has promised to step up cooperation, announcing on Tuesday it would work with China's science ministry to develop and commercialize know-how on carbon capture and storage and other clean energy technologies. The new institute was unveiled at an event in Tsinghua with California governor Jerry Brown, who has been in Beijing this week to discuss deepening cooperation with China on climate and clean technology, after branding Trump's withdrawal from Paris as  insane .

Toushin fund operators sold 269.2 billion yen ($2.46 billion)of cash stocks last month, data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange showed on Thursday. That was the biggest monthly net selling since September 2014 and the second-highest on record since data began in the current format since 2003, according to Daiwa Securities. It is not atypical to see selling from toushin when Japanese share prices hit highs. Many Japanese investors, unconvinced of the strength of the country's economic recovery, are eager to sell into rallies and book profits. But money managers are also smarting from paralysis triggered in April after Nobuchika Mori, the commissioner of the Financial Services Agency, blasted the Japanese asset management industry for neglecting the true interest of their customers, industry sources said. Mori's criticism was wide-ranging, from funds' high fees and low investment returns to the industry habit of encouraging retail investors to switch funds often, a practice that helps the financial industry rake in more commissions to the little benefit of investors. Mori's tirade prompted many asset managers and financial institutions to refrain from aggressive sales of toushins since April. As a result, new fund inflows into toushin dwindled, while retail investors pulled out money out of Japan stock funds to lock in gains after a market rally, leading to large net sales of Japanese stocks by toushin operators.  Individual investors are cautious on the whole. The asset management industry is also shrinking back because of the criticism on the industry,  said Alex Sato, President and CEO of Invesco Asset Management Japan.  It's hard to sell toushin in the middle of a major business model changes. Unless we see a robust rally in Japanese stocks, it will be hard to expect a strong toushin sales this year,  he added. Japan's Nikkei average hit 1-1/2-year highs in May and it has extended gains so far in June, breaking above the psychologically important 20,000 mark.  Investors seem to have locked in profits,  said Masahiro Suzuki, senior quantitative analyst at Daiwa Securities.  It's quite common for toushin investors after rallies.  Mori also railed at a type of funds that pay dividends to investors every month regardless of funds' performance. While they have been popular among investors, especially pensioners, financial experts agree the products make little economic sense because investors cannot reap the benefits of higher compound returns. Many asset managers were forced to cut their dividend payout ratios lately, partly in response to falling returns, but also following the public reprimand from the FSA. Yasumasa Nishi, president and CEO of Asset Management One, said many asset managers, including his, are reducing monthly dividends on those products, resulting in sharp falls in their sales.  This is tough for sales staff but we are being hit by the wave of normalisation of payouts and this process has to continue,  he said.

Lamb's three-run homer in the third inning put Arizona ahead for good, and Zack Greinke earned his eighth win in the Diamondbacks' 7-4 victory over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday at Chase Field. Brandon Drury's two-run homer capped Arizona's five-run third inning that proved sufficient for the victory.  Goldy (Paul Goldschmidt) said it in the dugout during the second or third inning: 'Just keep having quality (at-bats),'  Lamb said.  We hit a lot of balls hard, and we weren't getting anything from it. It's kind of one of those games where ... it's kind of slow moving. Those are the tough ones. You've got to stay with it, and we had that big inning with five runs.  Lamb has 53 RBIs, two more than Colorado's Mark Reynolds. The Arizona third baseman has driven in seven runs the last two games. The D-backs (36-25) are a major-league-best 23-8 at home, and they won for the fifth time in eight games. Greinke (8-3) scattered seven hits in five innings while moving into a tie for the National League lead in victories. He yielded three runs, struck out eight and walked one. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at DiamondbacksSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch I don't think it was Zack's best day,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  He just wasn't commanding the ball as he has been. But in true Zack form, he grinded out the five innings and got a win.  Fernando Rodney pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 15th save. San Diego's Yangervis Solarte had two hits, including his fifth homer. Jose Pirela finished with three hits, and Franchy Cordero had two. The Padres (23-37) have lost four in a row after a five-game winning streak.  Yangervis Solarte had good swings,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  If you are going to have to put up a touchdown to win, you are probably not going to win a lot of baseball games.  Solarte homered as the second batter of the game for a 1-0 lead off Greinke. In the third, Solarte flipped an RBI single into left field after right fielder David Peralta misplayed Cordero's fly ball into a triple. Solarte is a .339 career hitter at Chase Field, and he is 11-for-27 (.407) there this season. Greinke is tied with former Los Angeles Dodgers teammate Clayton Kershaw and Colorado's Antonio Senzatela for the NL lead in victories. He is third with 100 strikeouts, behind Washington's Max Scherzer and Kershaw.  Command was still all right, but my stuff just wasn't as sharp, I don't think,  said Greinke, who threw 102 pitches.  Flat stuff got a little flatter in last two innings.  Padres starter Luis Perdomo (0-3) walked four in the first three innings but did not give up a hit until Lamb hit a 1-0 slider into the right-field seats for a 3-2 lead. Lamb has 15 homers.  It was a pitch in the middle,  Perdomo said.  I made mistake there, hung it, and I paid the price.  Perdomo gave up five hits, five runs and four walks in four innings. He struck out one. Cordero singled home a run to make it 5-3 in the fifth inning. Chris Owings hit a sacrifice fly to cap Arizona's two-run seventh inning for a 7-3 lead before Pirela singled home a run in the eighth.  We're very opportunistic,  Lovullo said.  One of the traits of this team that I enjoy seeing is that they smell a little blood and they get an opening and they pound through that.  We can hit home runs with the best of them, and that's the high side of things. But we can keep tacking on and building on innings and creating moments for us to score runs.  NOTES: Arizona RHP Taijuan Walker (blister) threw a 64-pitch simulated game at the Diamondbacks' training facility Wednesday. The blister was covered, and the Diamondbacks have not projected when Walker could return to the rotation. ... RF Hunter Renfroe has 13 homers, the second most by a Padres rookie before the All-Star break. 1B Nate Colbert had 14 in 1969. ... Arizona C Chris Herrmann (hand) did not play Wednesday after being removed from the Tuesday game in the fifth inning, but manager Torey Lovullo said the injury was not serious.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-padres-diamondbacks-writethru-idUSMTZED687SAUZY"},

Chinese markets were also supported by signs of improved liquidity in the financial system and growing expectations that index publisher MSCI will decide to include Chinese A shares in its benchmark on June 20. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.8 percent to 3,560.98 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent to 3,150.33. Data on Wednesday showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose more than expected in May to a seven-month high as tougher capital restrictions and a weak dollar reduced pressure from capital outflows. Analysts expect forex reserves to increase further as the yuan has sharply rebounded against the U.S. dollar in recent weeks after the central bank declared war on speculators. Further boosting sentiment, China reported stronger-than-anticipated exports and imports for May despite falling commodity prices, suggesting the economy is holding up better than expected despite rising lending rates and a cooling property market. Most economists, however, still share the view that the economy will gradually lose momentum in coming months as property cooling measures and higher financing costs drag on investment and business activity. Brokerage Lianchu Securities also attributed the market rebound to signs that  the central bank has intentionally moved to stabilise market expectations,  by injecting more liquidity into the banking system. Most sectors advanced. Gains were led by the defensive healthcare and consumer stocks, whose index closed at a record high since its launch in 2005, as investors favoured blue-chips with lower valuations and good fundamentals.

The Warriors had trailed the defending champions for much of the second half but used a late surge to secure a 15th straight win, the longest postseason streak for any team in the four major professional sports. Cleveland had looked like they might prevail when they were ahead by six points with three minutes to play but Kevin Durant led the Warriors on an impressive 11-0 run to close out the game.

The Czech National Bank abandoned its weak crown policy on April 6, after it had prevented the currency from strengthening beyond 27 to the euro for three and half years, buying 75.9 billion euros in the process. The bank's staff forecast, released in May, showed interest rates could rise in the third quarter, while analysts forecast such a move only in the first half of 2018.  There is no reason to question the forecast. That does not mean, however, that the forecast is something the board upholds in all circumstances,  Dedek said in an interview published on Thursday by Czech economic daily paper E15. Dedek declined to speculate when asked whether it was realistic to expect a rate rise this year. Analysts have pinned the crown's development after the exit as a key factor as to when the central bank may make its first rate hike in almost a decade. The currency has firmed 2.7 percent since being set free, less rapid appreciation than many investors expected when they bet on a jump, sending billions of euros into the market in the months before the cap exit that have yet to be cleared out. In the interview, Dedek said the bank was satisfied with the crown development post-cap  even when we do not know how it will be in the future, but like they say, so far, so good.

The landlocked North Asian country of three million people goes to the polls on June 26, just a month after securing a $5.5 billion International Monetary Fund-led bailout to lift the economy out of a balance of payments crisis. Campaigning began on Tuesday, and painful austerity measures agreed by the Mongolian People's Party (MPP), which runs the government but doesn't hold the presidency, have made an easy target for rivals, as have controversies over deals done with foreign mining companies. The presidential election in the former Soviet satellite, wedged between China and Russia, comes amid growing frustration among voters over suspected corruption and the perceived ineffectiveness of their governments. Under Mongolia's parliamentary democracy, the MPP government's term should run for another three years, but its policies could be challenged by a president with veto powers. The outgoing president Tsakhia Elbegdorj belongs to the Democratic Party, but has to step down having served a maximum two terms.  The Democratic Party's new candidate Khaltmaa Battulga, a martial arts star turned business tycoon, opened his campaign with a call for greater government control over the economy and the country's mineral resources.  Our political environment is very unstable, so our big development policy won't go forward. Because of that, we can't solve unemployment or poverty,  Battulga told CI Television in an interview posted on the network's official Facebook account late on Tuesday.  The government should hire experts and take control of everything, including Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi,  he said. His comments could send shudders through Rio Tinto, which owns 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi, and scare off private companies that might be interested in forming strategic partnerships at the giant, fully state-owned Tavan Tolgoi coal mine. Oyu Tolgoi LLC, the Mongolia-based company that runs the project, declined to comment. Rio Tinto did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dale Choi, analyst and head of the Altan Bumba Financial Group, said the Mongolian government did not have a good record when it came to managing its assets.   Most of the SOEs are loss making businesses, and even those that pay some of the highest taxes to Mongolia are not efficient businesses,  he said.  Run Off Likely    The ruling MPP candidate Mieygombo Enkhbold, has called for continued  stability , while the government struggles to introduce economic reforms having already raised some taxes and cut spending as part of the IMF bailout deal. Asked for Enkhbold's position on the mining sector, an MPP spokesman forwarded a statement setting out the party's support for the further development of big mining projects  based on the fundamental interests of our people.  Nationalist politicians have repeatedly called for greater Mongolian control over Oyu Tolgoi, which is forecast to become the world's third-largest copper producer when output peaks at 550,000 tonnes in 2025, up fourfold from this year. A third party candidate Sainkhuu Ganbaatar, who is expected to win enough votes to force Mongolia's first-ever second round presidential election run-off, has continued his hardline stance when it comes to Mongolia's ownership of its resources.  The Mongolian people in Mongolia are the real master. This means that Mongolians are the deciders of their natural resources,  he said in his manifesto.  Attempts to renegotiate ownership and a long dispute over taxes and cost overruns led to the suspension of construction on the underground tunnels at Oyu Tolgoi in 2013, and also scared off investment for other projects.  Construction on the project was relaunched after the signing of a new agreement that ended the dispute in 2015.   During its first phase, the open pit mine had already contributed more than $1 billion in taxes and other payments to the government by 2015, while local businesses and suppliers had earned some $4 billion from the project, according to the International Finance Corporation.

Run Off Likely    The ruling MPP candidate Mieygombo Enkhbold, has called for continued  stability , while the government struggles to introduce economic reforms having already raised some taxes and cut spending as part of the IMF bailout deal. Asked for Enkhbold's position on the mining sector, an MPP spokesman forwarded a statement setting out the party's support for the further development of big mining projects  based on the fundamental interests of our people.  Nationalist politicians have repeatedly called for greater Mongolian control over Oyu Tolgoi, which is forecast to become the world's third-largest copper producer when output peaks at 550,000 tonnes in 2025, up fourfold from this year. A third party candidate Sainkhuu Ganbaatar, who is expected to win enough votes to force Mongolia's first-ever second round presidential election run-off, has continued his hardline stance when it comes to Mongolia's ownership of its resources.  The Mongolian people in Mongolia are the real master. This means that Mongolians are the deciders of their natural resources,  he said in his manifesto.  Attempts to renegotiate ownership and a long dispute over taxes and cost overruns led to the suspension of construction on the underground tunnels at Oyu Tolgoi in 2013, and also scared off investment for other projects.  Construction on the project was relaunched after the signing of a new agreement that ended the dispute in 2015.   During its first phase, the open pit mine had already contributed more than $1 billion in taxes and other payments to the government by 2015, while local businesses and suppliers had earned some $4 billion from the project, according to the International Finance Corporation.

Like rival Tesla's energy storage business, the Renault-Nissan move underscores its desire to cultivate a second-hand battery market while encouraging the development of energy infrastructure that works for electric cars. The Renault-Nissan alliance plant, which has yet to be built, would be big enough to power 120,000 homes, or supplant the role of a gas- or coal-fired power station in meeting peak electricity demand on the grid, the sources said. Rather than generating power, a storage plant charges up in times of excess supply and sells electricity back to the grid when needed. Proponents say such plants can play a key role in smoothing out unpredictable wind and solar power generation. Renault-Nissan is working in partnership with energy storage specialist The Mobility House on the mega battery which would be assembled from new or used electric car batteries, one of the sources said.  We're working with The Mobility House on several programmes including a major energy storage project that is currently still in the study phase,  Renault spokeswoman Celine Farissier said, declining to give further details. Makers of electric cars stand to benefit from the creation of a market for used lithium-ion batteries that can no longer power vehicles to drive far enough. Higher second-hand battery values could help bring down the cost of electric cars and mega batteries are one avenue for recycling the power cells. Nissan, 44 percent-owned by French alliance partner Renault, has already built a back-up power storage system for the Amsterdam Arena, which is home to soccer club Ajax, in a first partnership with the German start-up. Marcus Fendt, its managing director, said the Munich-based company was working on a 100 MW plant with partners he declined to identify, citing confidentiality agreements. He said the studies were aimed at determining where to build the plant. Locations and end markets under consideration for the Renault-Nissan plant include Germany, which is suitable because of its high energy prices and its shift from nuclear to renewable energy, as well as the Netherlands, sources said. Carmaking Utilities Renault-Nissan studied an existing power storage project in the United States before embarking on its own plan to recycle electric car batteries. California's Public Utilities commission selected a 100 MW battery storage system to replace a natural-gas power plant providing electricity for Southern California Edison in the Los Angeles area. Large batteries can help stabilise the primary reserve electricity market, which is responsible for ensuring the grid has at least 50 Hertz. Carmakers can also earn money competing with conventional power stations to guarantee the provision of electricity during periods of high demand or volatility.  We forecast the combined market for electric passenger vehicles, electric buses and battery storage to increase eight-fold to over $200 billion by 2020, a five-year compound annual growth rate of more than 50 percent,  Berenberg analysts said. With about 4 million electric cars expected to be on the roads by 2020, vehicle manufacturers looking at ways to recycle batteries, including Tesla, which already sells everything from solar panels to batteries and electric cars. Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen and China's BYD Co Ltd  are also exploring so-called second-life storage projects with batteries. That includes partnerships such as the recent collaboration between BMW and Vattenfall, in which the luxury automaker will deliver up to 1,000 lithium-ion batteries to the Swedish utility for storage projects this year.  What will end up happening is that BMW and Daimler will ... become utilities themselves,  said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital LLP, a corporate advisor in the energy, power infrastructure and technology sectors.  They use Vattenfall now because they need to learn but I think the amount of batteries coming back will be so big that I think they'll end up engaging directly with the end customer themselves. And they've got the brand name to do that.

Industrial output rose by 0.8 percent on the month after dropping by an upwardly revised 0.1 percent the previous month, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a gain of 0.5 percent. The upturn was driven by a surge in energy production and factories churning out more intermediate goods. But construction activity edged down and fewer consumer goods rolled off production lines.  The German economic recovery has entered its ninth year and there are no signs that this recovery could come to an abrupt halt,  said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING.  Today's industrial production data have not only confirmed this growth picture but actually provide further evidence that this recovery could gain even more momentum,  he added. Other recent data has painted a mixed picture of the sector. The output figures follow data on Wednesday that showed industrial orders dropping far more than expected in April, as factories lacked new contracts for big ticket items. Figures from the VDMA industry association have shown engineering orders falling but a recent purchasing managers' survey showed factory output increasing at the strongest pace in more than six years, as demand from German and foreign clients rose. The Economy Ministry said production remained on an upward trend, with solid order levels and sales plus a strong business climate pointing to a continued upturn in the industrial and construction sectors. The German economy pulled off 1.9 percent growth last year on rising private consumption, state spending and construction. It continued to expand early this year, with higher exports helping to drive 0.6 percent growth in the first quarter. Ulrike Kastens, an economist at Sal. Oppenheim, said the industrial sector had experienced a good start to the second quarter and she expected second quarter growth to roughly mirror the level of the first three months of the year.

May unexpectedly called the snap vote seven weeks ago, seeking to increase her working parliamentary majority of 17 seats ahead of the start of negotiations on leaving the European Union. But the campaign has seen unexpected twists - a steep decline in May's once-commanding poll lead over the opposition Labour Party, and attacks in Manchester and London that killed 30 people. Pollsters still expect May's Conservatives to win, although talk of a landslide majority of more than 100 seats has faded. A final flurry of polls put her party's lead in a range between 1  and 12 percentage points, with most of them suggesting she would increase her majority. The polls started narrowing after May launched a new policy on care for the elderly that proved unpopular. She backtracked days later, prompting opposition parties to pour scorn on her claim to offer  strong and stable leadership . Then came a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester on May 22 that killed 22 children and adults, and a van and knife attack on London Bridge and in nearby Borough Market that killed eight people on June 3, five days before the election. The attacks threw the campaign spotlight onto security and prompted questions from May's opponents and media about her record overseeing cuts in police numbers during her years as interior minister from 2010 to 2016. But the security issue was not seen as helpful to her main rival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has voted against counter-terrorism legislation and expressed reservations in the past about police shoot-to-kill tactics. May vs Corbyn On Wednesday, the eve of the vote, May tried to bring the campaign back to Brexit. Related CoverageFactbox: UK internet crackdown effort fizzles in last days of election campaignPolls on eve of UK election suggest PM May will boost majority When it comes to the election tomorrow, I think the choices and the questions that people need to ask are exactly the same today as they were right at the beginning of the campaign,  she told a campaign rally in Norwich, eastern England.  And the first is a question of who do you trust to actually have the strong and stable leadership that is going to deliver the best deal for Britain in Europe.  May has sought to portray Corbyn as the weak leader of a spendthrift party which would crash Britain's $2.5 trillion economy and lead the country to ruin in chaotic Brexit negotiations. Corbyn, a veteran left-winger who unexpectedly won the Labour leadership in 2015 after three decades on the party fringe, has hit back that Conservative fiscal austerity has hurt the poor and increased social inequalities. Labour propose to build a fairer society through policies such as increasing tax for the richest 5 percent, boosting workers' rights, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds in infrastructure.  The choice is quite simple. Five more years of a Tory government, five more years of austerity, five more years of cuts. Or something different,  Corbyn told supporters in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, to cheers and applause. Workers in protective equipment are reflected in the window of a betting shop with a display inviting customers to place bets on tbe result of the general election with images of Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, in London, June 7, 2017.Marko DjuricaFor May, the challenge is not only to win but to surpass handsomely the 12-seat majority her Conservative predecessor David Cameron won in 2015. A narrow victory would undermine her authority both inside her party and at talks with the 27 other EU leaders. Up to five more opinion polls are expected before voting begins at 0600 GMT on Thursday. Britons have until 2100 GMT to vote, and there will be an exit poll as soon as voting ends. The first handful of seat results are expected to be announced by 2300 GMT, with the vast majority of the 650 constituencies due to announce results between 0200 GMT and 0500 GMT on Friday morning. Jitters Slideshow (25 Images)London police were still dealing with the fallout from Saturday night's attack, when three jihadis drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before running into narrow streets bustling with nightlife, stabbing and slashing people indiscriminately. They said they arrested three more people on Wednesday and searched two locations in connection with the attack. They have also made 25 arrests for hate crimes since Saturday and had stepped up their presence in communities to provide reassurance. With the capital still jittery, police carried out a controlled explosion near the site where a new U.S. embassy is  being built in southwest London because of two suspicious vehicles, but later said it had been a false alarm. Police confirmed on Wednesday the Saturday death toll had risen to eight after they found a body in the River Thames. They also made another arrest in east London in connection with the attack. The dead include people from France, Australia, Canada, Spain and Britain. The attack left 48 injured, of whom 29 were still in hospital on Wednesday. Health authorities said 10 were in a critical condition. Security has been increased nationwide and the violence has dominated the final weeks of campaigning. May responded to the attack with a pledge to crack down on Islamist extremism and strengthen police powers.  If human rights laws get in the way of doing these things, we will change those laws to make sure we can do them,  she said in an interview with the Sun. The head of campaign group Amnesty International said the pledge was outrageous and a gift to autocratic leaders around the world. Two of the three London Bridge attackers, who were all shot dead at the scene by police, had been known to authorities beforehand.  Italy said it had flagged Youssef Zaghba as a potential risk after he moved to England last year, while Khuram Butt was known to British security services.

The latest annual Sohn Hong Kong fundraiser heard a wide range of investment pitches, but when it came to the host city, two of the three were short-selling takedowns. And many local shares sold off beforehand on fears they could be targets. That is hardly a vote of confidence in efforts to clean up the market.  Hedgies pushed a variety of buy ideas at Wednesday's gathering: Japanese blue-chips, turnarounds at Rolls-Royce and Peabody Energy, and a thesis involving Shankara Building Products, a small-cap that could become India’s Home Depot. Chinese recommendations included Sina and Momo, two social media firms with U.S. listings. Meanwhile, veteran short-sellers Carson Block and Dan David laid into two locally listed firms, sofa-maker Man Wah Holdings and Dali Foods. Shares in both fell, and the next morning, Dali rushed out a lengthy riposte. Man Wah has halted trading ahead of its own rebuttal. Whatever the individual merits, it's discouraging that one of the main ways that smart money thinks it can outperform in Hong Kong is through betting against questionable companies. The sole positive recommendation was on mainland carmaker Great Wall Motor.  Man Wah and Dali Foods join a long list of recent short targets. On Tuesday Block said he would announce a new short target at Sohn, and around 50 stocks reportedly fell in response, implying widespread suspicion. There is something seriously amiss with a market that can imagine dozens of plausible potential short targets so quickly. It also suggests too many shares trade on speculation not fundamentals. It is telling that Martin Wheatley, former chief securities regulator in the city, popped up to defend the role played by short-sellers in markets. Authorities have sometimes seemed to take a different view in recent years, coming down hard on the authors of two critical reports.  To be sure, Hong Kong by no means has a monopoly on dodgy companies. It is tightening up in various ways, getting tougher with underwriters and demanding quicker responses from firms to criticism. And some attacks may prove wide of the mark – two short-sellers are now feuding over Apple supplier AAC Technologies, for example. But the spate of criticism suggests it is still falling short.

Durant had ice in his veins late in Game Three of the NBA Finals as he sank a three-pointer over Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James to put Golden State ahead with 45 seconds to play, a lead they would never relinquish. Cleveland led for most of the second half and looked ready to hand the Warriors their first loss of the playoffs but Durant picked his team up off the floor and delivered the victory with 14 fourth-quarter points.      He took over,  said Warriors head coach Steve Kerr.   You can tell, he knows this is his moment. He's been an amazing player in this league for a long time, and I think he senses this is his time, his moment.  The three-point dagger over James was exactly the type of play the Warriors must have had in mind when they signed Durant last July in hopes of avenging their 2016 NBA Finals loss to the Cavaliers.

To see that go in, that was liberating, man. We've got one more to go.  Golden State's victory has Durant one win away from an NBA title, which is the very reason the four-times scoring champion joined the team last year after only reaching the Finals once before.

He was also one win away from returning to the Finals last year with Oklahoma City but they squandered a 3-1 series lead to Golden State, who he joined a little over a month later. Durant's team mates were singing his praises after the game and said there was no doubt in their minds whose hands the ball should be in with the game's result hanging in the balance.  We know in that situation to get that man the rock. He's seven foot, can shoot over almost anybody and has amazing shooting touch,  said Warriors guard Klay Thompson.  We're confident in him taking that shot every time.      Editing by Peter Rutherford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-basketball-nba-finals-durant-idUSKBN18Z0NF"},

That suddenly seems like a long time ago. Zunino hit two home runs Wednesday night, including a two-run shot with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Seattle Mariners rallied for a 6-5 victory against the Minnesota Twins at Safeco Field. Zunino's ninth-inning blast to right-center field off Brandon Kintzler (2-1) gave the Mariners their season-high fifth consecutive win. Kyle Seager and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Mariners, who have won nine of the past 10 games, outscoring opponents 75-30. Seattle (30-30) reached the .500 mark for only the second time this season. Seattle closer Edwin Diaz (2-2) got the victory after pitching a scoreless ninth. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the Mariners' Ben Gamel singled to center field, extending his hitting streak to 10 games. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at MarinersMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchZunino then hit a 2-1 pitch from Kintzler over the right field wall to win the game.  I didn't know he could go the other way like that,  Kintzler said.  I left a pitch out over the plate, and he did what he was supposed to do there.  A month ago, Zunino couldn't have hit a pitch like that. He was sent down to work on his swing. Since returning May 22, he has batted .302 (15-for-46) with four home runs and 15 RBIs in 13 games.  That was the exact swing that I've been trying to build over the last month, against a guy that got a good sinker away,  Zunino said.  That's not a guy that you want to pull. I just tried to elevate. That comes from learning the swing and trusting it.  Yovani Gallardo pitched a season-high seven innings and yielded five runs, including a three-run homer to Miguel Sano in the fifth inning. The home run, Sano's 15th of the season, tied him with Seattle's Nelson Cruz for the AL lead with 46 RBIs.  Whatever happens with one pitch, you can't do anything about it,  Gallardo said.  You've just got to keep putting up zeros.  Gallardo yielded six hits and two walks while striking out six. Sano's blast gave the Twins a 5-2 lead, but they got just one hit over the final four innings.  Miguel hit a hanging curveball to put us ahead, but we just couldn't find a way to add on,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  They kind of pecked away one at a time until they got the big one at the end.  Zunino and Ruiz, the Nos. 8-9 batters in the order, hit back-to-back homers leading off the third inning to give Seattle a 2-1 lead. Ruiz, who entered the game batting .189, was serving as the Mariners' designated hitter. It was his first home run of the season.  We talked to (manager Scott Servais) about how it could be dangerous to put two catchers in there,  Zunino said.  It was great to see Chooch have that swing.  Joe Mauer's single tied the score at 2-2 in the fifth, preceding Sano's home run. The Mariners got one run back without the benefit of a hit in the fifth inning. Zunino led off with a walk and Ruiz was hit by a pitch. Zunino went to third on a flyout, and Tyler Smith's sacrifice fly made it 5-3. Seager hit a solo homer off the facade of the second deck in right field against Twins reliever Tyler Duffey in the sixth to pull Seattle within 5-4. It was Seager's seventh home run of the season. Twins rookie left-hander Adalberto Mejia allowed three runs on two hits in five innings. He walked three and struck out five. NOTES: Seattle 1B Danny Valencia was ejected in the bottom of the eighth inning by plate umpire Dan Iassogna. Valencia grounded out to third, then was ejected for arguing balls and strikes. ... Mariners DH Nelson Cruz missed the game due to right calf tightness. ... The Mariners announced a five-year contract extension with injured SS Jean Segura. The deal is reportedly worth $70 million and includes a no-trade clause. ... The Twins made several roster moves, placing LHP Hector Santiago (shoulder soreness) on the 10-day disabled list and SS Jorge Polanco on the bereavement list. They recalled 1B Kennys Vargas from Triple-A Rochester and claimed RHP Chris Heston off waivers from the Los Angeles Dodgers. ... The Twins are scheduled to start RHP Kyle Gibson (2-4, 7.23 ERA) in the series finale Thursday against Mariners RHP Christian Bergman (3-2, 4.36).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED687R562Q"},

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, through China edged up on unexpectedly solid trade data, while Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.4 percent. European shares were expected to open steady to slightly firmer, with spread-betters looking at a 0.2 percent rise in Germany's DAX and a flat opening in Britain's FTSE . Wall Street shares ticked up on Wednesday, despite sharp declines in energy prices, after written testimony from Comey did not add major revelations about an investigation into Russian meddling with last year's U.S. presidential election. The British pound held firm at $1.2957, near its highest levels in two weeks, supported in part by polls showing Prime Minister Theresa May is on course to increase her majority in parliament. The pound gained as much as 4 percent after May called a snap election seven weeks ago, as polls had initially suggested a landslide win for her Conservative party that would give the prime minister a stronger hand in Britain's negotiations on leaving the European Union. Yet traders are cautious given the Brexit shock last year and as her once-commanding lead over the Labour Party and its veteran hard-left leader Jeremy Corbyn has been narrowing through the campaign.  If the conservatives win big, that will lead to a big relief in markets and buy-back in the pound. But if they win only a wafer-thin majority or even lose an outright majority, that will be a major negative surprise,  said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economist strategy at HSBC in Tokyo. To see a Reuters interactive graphic on the election polls and results, click on tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48 Britons have until 2100 GMT to vote, and there will be an exit poll as soon as voting ends. The first handful of seat results are expected to be announced by 2300 GMT. Ahead of the UK vote results, the European Central Bank will meet, with a policy announcement due at 1145 GMT, followed by President Mario Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT. With no policy change expected, market players are focusing on how the central bank may alter its economic assessment and policy guidance in light of a strengthening euro zone economy. ECB policymakers are set to take a more benign view of the economy and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions have told Reuters. Still many market players expect the ECB to wait until September before signalling further tapering in its bond buying. The euro traded at $1.1259, near its seven-month high of $1.1285 touched earlier this month. The dollar stayed near its seven-month low against a basket of currencies as doubts over Trump's ability to push through his stimulus plans have eroded the greenback's gains made late last year. The dollar index stood at 96.713 , near Wednesday's seven-month low of 96.511. Against the yen, the U.S. currency faltered to 109.40 yen not far from Wednesday's 1-1/2-month low of 109.115 as Japanese Government Bond yields rose partly on speculation about the Bank of Japan's exit strategy from stimulus. The BOJ has insisted it has no plans to start tapering any time soon, but many analysts and traders believe the pace of its bond buying appears unsustainable. The two-year JGB yield rose to minus 0.09 percent, the highest level since February last year.  At a time when the ECB could change its guidance, possibly with an eye on exit from stimulus, and the Federal Reserve is already talking about shrinking its balance sheet, the BOJ's exit could easily come to a focus as well,  said Yusuke Ikawa, Japan strategist at BNP Paribas. But Ikawa added the BOJ is still a long way off from ending its massive stimulus and that the Japanese market is likely to steady soon. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.180 percent after having fallen to a seven-month low of 2.129 percent on Tuesday. Many investors are wary ahead of Comey's Senate appearance later in the day for any hints Trump may have been engaged in obstruction of justice - an offence that could lead to impeachment hearings.  If the hearing does not produce clear-cut evidences of obstruction of justice, uncertainties will remain but for market the issue will likely be put on a back burner,  said Hiroko Iwaki, senior fixed income strategist at Mizuho Securities.  Unless you assume there will be a complete chaos in U.S. politics or a downturn in the U.S. economy, it is hard to see further falls in U.S. bond yields,  she said. Takuro Nishida, manager of investment planning at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance said the risk-on mood is likely to return once Comey's testimony will be out of way.  If the Fed is going to raise interest rates as expected later this month, U.S. bond yields are likely to rise back,  he added. Oil prices licked wounds after sharp falls on Wednesday to a one-month low, following an unexpected increase in U.S. inventories of crude and gasoline that fanned fears that output cuts by major world oil producers have not done much to drain a global glut. Brent crude futures traded at $48.39 per barrel, up 0.7 percent so far on Thursday, though they had fallen 4.1 percent the previous day.

The pound traded at $1.2960, staying near a peak of $1.2970 set on Wednesday, its highest level since May 25. Opinion polls on Wednesday showed that May is on course to increase her majority in parliament in Thursday's election, suggesting her gamble to call the vote to strengthen her position in Brexit negotiations will pay off. To see a Reuters interactive graphic on the election polls and results, click on:  tmsnrt.rs/2q7tC48  Markets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory,  said Jasslyn Yeo, market strategist in Singapore for J.P.Morgan Asset Management. If the Conservative Party gains a decisive majority of more than 50 seats, that would probably be seen as a positive outcome for sterling, Yeo said.  However, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors,  she added. The pound gained as much as 4 percent after May called a snap election seven weeks ago, as polls then suggested a landslide win for her Conservative Party would bolster the prime minister's position when Brexit negotiations open later this month. But recent polls predicting outcomes ranging from a majority for the Conservatives to a 'hung' parliament have seen sterling slip from the $1.30 mark it hit last month. The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.1261, with the market's focus on the ECB's monetary policy announcement due later on Thursday. Earlier in June, the euro reached a high of $1.1285, its highest level in about seven months. The ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.59 trillion) bond-buying programme. The euro's medium-term view looks positive, supported by prospects for the ECB to start heading towards normalising its monetary policy in coming months, said Peter Dragicevich, G10 FX strategist for Nomura in Singapore.  It's more for us a story of positive euro, not just against the dollar but pretty much against all currencies... even against the commodity bloc,  he said. The ECB will probably announce a tapering of its asset purchases in September and actually begin tapering in January next year, Dragicevich added. Investors will closely monitor U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey later on Thursday. Comey was abruptly fired by President Donald Trump in May. Investors are worried his testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of rolling back regulation and overhauling the tax code. In written testimony released on Wednesday, Comey said that Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 109.52 yen, edging back in the direction of Wednesday's low of 109.115 yen, its lowest level in about seven weeks. Traders said the yen edged higher after Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources, that the Bank of Japan was re-calibrating its communications to acknowledge that it is thinking about how to handle a future exit from monetary stimulus.

Zur Rose would be the second Swiss pharmacy group to list shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange this year. Galenica Sante's listing in April was Europe's largest IPO this year. Zur Rose is boosting TV advertising in Germany, its largest market, where it is benefitting from the lifting of bans on prescription drug rebates that helped boost first-quarter sales by 17 percent.

The landlocked North Asian country of three million people goes to the polls on June 26, just a month after securing a $5.5 billion International Monetary Fund-led bailout to lift the economy out of a balance of payments crisis. Campaigning began on Tuesday, and painful austerity measures agreed by the Mongolian People's Party (MPP), which runs the government but doesn't hold the presidency, have made an easy target for rivals, as have controversies over deals done with foreign mining companies. The presidential election in the former Soviet satellite, wedged between China and Russia, comes amid growing frustration among voters over suspected corruption and the perceived ineffectiveness of their governments. Under Mongolia's parliamentary democracy, the MPP government's term should run for another three years, but its policies could be challenged by a president with veto powers. The outgoing president Tsakhia Elbegdorj belongs to the Democratic Party, but has to step down having served a maximum two terms. The Democratic Party's new candidate Khaltmaa Battulga, a martial arts star turned business tycoon, opened his campaign with a call for greater government control over the economy and the country's mineral resources.  Our political environment is very unstable, so our big development policy won't go forward. Because of that, we can't solve unemployment or poverty,  Battulga told CI Television in an interview posted on the network's official Facebook account late on Tuesday.  The government should hire experts and take control of everything, including Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi,  he said. His comments could send shudders through Rio Tinto, which owns 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi, and scare off private companies that might be interested in forming strategic partnerships at the giant, fully state-owned Tavan Tolgoi coal mine. Oyu Tolgoi LLC, the Mongolia-based company that runs the project, declined to comment. Rio Tinto did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dale Choi, analyst and head of the Altan Bumba Financial Group, said the Mongolian government did not have a good record when it came to managing its assets.  Most of the SOEs are loss making businesses, and even those that pay some of the highest taxes to Mongolia are not efficient businesses,  he said. Run Off Likely The ruling MPP candidate Mieygombo Enkhbold, has called for continued  stability , while the government struggles to introduce economic reforms having already raised some taxes and cut spending as part of the IMF bailout deal. Asked for Enkhbold's position on the mining sector, an MPP spokesman forwarded a statement setting out the party's support for the further development of big mining projects  based on the fundamental interests of our people.  Nationalist politicians have repeatedly called for greater Mongolian control over Oyu Tolgoi, which is forecast to become the world's third-largest copper producer when output peaks at 550,000 tonnes in 2025, up fourfold from this year. A third party candidate Sainkhuu Ganbaatar, who is expected to win enough votes to force Mongolia's first-ever second round presidential election run-off, has continued his hardline stance when it comes to Mongolia's ownership of its resources.  The Mongolian people in Mongolia are the real master. This means that Mongolians are the deciders of their natural resources,  he said in his manifesto. Attempts to renegotiate ownership and a long dispute over taxes and cost overruns led to the suspension of construction on the underground tunnels at Oyu Tolgoi in 2013, and also scared off investment for other projects. Construction on the project was relaunched after the signing of a new agreement that ended the dispute in 2015. During its first phase, the open pit mine had already contributed more than $1 billion in taxes and other payments to the government by 2015, while local businesses and suppliers had earned some $4 billion from the project, according to the International Finance Corporation.

Unveiling its mid-term Vision 2030 strategy plan, Honda said it would boost coordination between R&D;, procurement and manufacturing to tame development costs as it acknowledged it must look beyond conventional vehicles to survive in an industry which is moving rapidly into electric and self-driving cars. Honda has already spelled out plans to market a vehicle which can drive itself on highways by 2020, and the new target for city-capable self-driving cars puts its progress slightly behind rivals like BMW (BMWG.DE).  We're going to place utmost priority on electrification and advanced safety technologies going forward,  Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said.  Developing new driving technologies, robotics- and artificial intelligence-driven services and new energy solutions also would be key priorities for Honda in the years ahead, the company said. Leveling Up Honda established a division late last year to develop electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its long-held goal for lower-emission gasoline hybrids, plug-in hybrids, EVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to account for two-thirds of its line-up by 2030, from about 5 percent now. By 2025, Honda plans to come up with cars with  level 4  standard automated driving functions, meaning they can drive themselves on highways and city roads under most situations. Achieving such capabilities will require artificial intelligence to detect traffic movements, along with a battery of cameras and sensors to help avoid accidents.  BMW has said it would launch a fully autonomous car by 2021, while Ford Motor Co (F.N) has said it will introduce a vehicle with similar capabilities for ride-sharing purposes in the same year. Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) is planning to launch a car which can drive automatically on city streets by 2020. Honda has been ramping up R&D; spending, earmarking a record 750 billion yen ($6.84 billion) for the year to March.

The deposits lie around Cinovec, a village with a tradition of mining since the 14th century and situated near the border with Germany, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of Europe's bid to build electric cars and develop battery technology. The resource, a term used for a deposit whose extent has yet to be proven by exploration, could amount to 1.3 million tonnes, or about 3 percent of the global lithium stock, according to the Czech Geological Survey. That would rank the Czech Republic behind Chile, China, Argentina, Australia and other nations with bigger lithium reserves. But surging global demand and hungry European industry are sparking international interest in the Czech deposits. Australia's European Metals, which bought exploration rights around Cinovec in 2012 and wants to start mining by 2019, said the resource could yield 20,800 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate, the processed ore that is sold to customers. Global demand is expected to rise three-fold to 535,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2025 from 2015, due to the boom in electric cars and electricity storage that has added to demand from making mobile phone batteries, Deutsche Bank said. European Metals has dug exploratory shafts and plans to spend $393 million to develop the site near Cinovec, a village surrounded by forests and meadows and showing scars of surface mining for lignite that once employed many people in the area. The region now has the Czech Republic's highest jobless rate.  The permitting process is going along as it should be, everything is happening in an orderly fashion,  European Metals Managing Director Keith Coughlan told Reuters. The company has signed a memorandum on supply of lithium ore to HE3DA, a Czech startup battery producer.  HE3DA can be one of the biggest consumers,  HE3DA chief executive and founder Jan Prochazka told Reuters. Local Support There are also other potential clients nearby. Daimler , owner of Mercedes-Benz, began construction in May of its second factory for lithium batteries, worth about 500 million euros, in Kamenz, a German town 90 km (56 miles) from Cinovec. Tesla Motors Inc. has also announced plans to build another  Gigafactory  for batteries, possibly in Europe, to match its plant in Nevada, the United States. European Metals still has steps to take before it can develop the mining site at Cinovec. It has to apply for permits from the State Mining Administration (SMA), a process that could last more than a year, an SMA spokesman said. It also needs approval from the Environment Ministry, which would consider any objections from nearby municipalities, although local communities have indicated they support the plan.  It would be a contribution to our town,  said Mayor Petr Pipal of Dubi, the municipality that includes Cinovec. Other companies are also showing interest in the resource. Cinovecka Deponie, a unit of privately-owned Czech investment group RSJ, won permits to extract lithium from tailings left around Cinovec from past tin mining. It did not offer further details when contacted by Reuters. Albright Stonebridge Group, co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, made enquiries to the regional authorities about possible lithium extraction, Czech media reported. The group did not respond to Reuters queries. One challenge for miners is that ore around Cinovec contains relatively small amounts of lithium. Jaromir Stary, an expert at the Czech Geological Survey, said it contains four times less lithium in its ore than at the Greenbushes mine in Australia. But European Metals is undeterred. Its pre-feasibility study in April estimated costs at $3,483 per tonne of lithium carbonate, a level it said would ensure it could turn a profit. It said the magnetic-sensitive nature of Cinovec's ore makes processing cheaper than other types. Spot battery grade 99.5 percent lithium carbonate in China AM-995C-LTCB, where most lithium batteries are manufactured, now trades around 140,000 yuan ($20,575.53) per tonne, after a peak of about 171,000 yuan last year.

Unveiling its mid-term Vision 2030 strategy plan, Honda said it would boost coordination between R&D;, procurement and manufacturing to tame development costs as it acknowledged it must look beyond conventional vehicles to survive in an industry which is moving rapidly into electric and self-driving cars. Honda has already spelled out plans to market a vehicle which can drive itself on highways by 2020, and the new target for city-capable self-driving cars puts its progress slightly behind rivals like BMW (BMWG.DE).  We're going to place utmost priority on electrification and advanced safety technologies going forward,  Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said.  Developing new driving technologies, robotics- and artificial intelligence-driven services and new energy solutions also would be key priorities for Honda in the years ahead, the company said. Leveling Up Honda established a division late last year to develop electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its long-held goal for lower-emission gasoline hybrids, plug-in hybrids, EVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to account for two-thirds of its line-up by 2030, from about 5 percent now. By 2025, Honda plans to come up with cars with  level 4  standard automated driving functions, meaning they can drive themselves on highways and city roads under most situations. Achieving such capabilities will require artificial intelligence to detect traffic movements, along with a battery of cameras and sensors to help avoid accidents.  BMW has said it would launch a fully autonomous car by 2021, while Ford Motor Co (F.N) has said it will introduce a vehicle with similar capabilities for ride-sharing purposes in the same year. Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) is planning to launch a car which can drive automatically on city streets by 2020. Honda has been ramping up R&D; spending, earmarking a record 750 billion yen ($6.84 billion) for the year to March.

James and Irving combined for 77 points but their efforts went for naught as the late-game collapse by the defending champion Cavaliers left them trailing the best-of-seven NBA Finals 3-0.  I gave everything I had tonight,  James told reporters after the 118-113 loss.  It's probably the most, most firepower I've played in my career. I played against some great teams, but I don't think no team has had this type of firepower.  The top-seeded and undefeated Warriors, who can close out a perfect postseason run on Friday, boast a slew of weapons, most notably two-time reigning league MVP Stephen Curry and four-times scoring champion Kevin Durant. Cleveland, who suffered a pair of lopsided losses to open the series, looked like they were about to finally beat the Warriors after leading the game for much of the second half. But the Warriors had other plans, especially Durant as he led his team on an incredible 11-0 run over the final three minutes, including a crushing three-pointer with 45 seconds to play that put his Golden State ahead for good.

I mean, just hits an unbelievable game winner, just comes down in transition, that only Kevin Durant can hit.  James has defied the odds before, perhaps most impressively last year against Golden State when his Cavaliers were the first team to win a title after trailing the Finals 3-1.

James knows his team have to play a perfect game on Friday or else they will be on the wrong end of a historic playoff run.  Even when you're playing well, you got to play like A plus plus, because they're going to make runs and they're going to make shots and they got guys that's going to make plays,  said James.   So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ball game, but they made a couple more.

Concerns over China landed squarely back on global investors' radar after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating last month, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. China's imports have been strong in recent months, driven largely by iron ore and other commodities used to feed a year-long construction boom, while exports have rebounded from several years of contraction thanks to improving global demand. While the strength of the May import data surprised economists, and suggested domestic demand remains solid, analysts still expect the world's second-largest economy to lose momentum gradually over the course of the year due to policy tightening.  Government measures to cool heated home prices are expected to dampen property investment eventually and a crackdown on riskier types of lending is pushing up financing costs.  The current strength of imports is unlikely to be sustained if, as we expect, slower credit growth feeds through into weaker economic activity in the coming quarters,  Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.  Export growth is also likely to edge down but should fare better than imports given the relatively upbeat outlook for China's main trading partners.  Growth in both exports and imports accelerated from April, defying expectations of a slowdown. Exports rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier, while imports expanded 14.8 percent, official data showed on Thursday. Related CoverageChina May iron ore imports recover from six-month lowThat left the country with a trade surplus of $40.81 billion for the month, the General Administration of Customs said. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May shipments from the world's largest exporter to have risen 7.0 percent, easing from 8.0 percent growth in April. Imports had been expected to have climbed 8.5 percent, pulling back from 11.9 percent in April. That was expected to produce a trade surplus of $46.32 billion, widening from April's $38.05 billion. Sources at two steel mills told Reuters they expect output to remain high as profit margins and demand are still strong, even though construction activity in China tends to ease in summer due to intense heat and rain in parts of the county.   We think it's quite obvious demand outperformed our expectations because of relatively strong housing and infrastructure sectors,  Richard Lu, an analyst at commodities consulting firm CRU, said ahead of the data.  But there are some downside risks in the second half of the year. Housing sales have declined so underlying (steel) demand may ease,  he said. The key unknown is whether China would continue to boost infrastructure spending for the rest of the year. Much of the building boom has been fueled by government spending on road and rail projects and a frenzied housing market, even as authorities try to contain mounting risks from years of debt-fueled stimulus.     Commodity Imports Lead the Way Analysts had expected import growth to cool largely due to a slump in prices of iron ore and steel in recent weeks on worries about growing inventories and a seasonal slowdown in demand. Iron ore prices are near eight-month lows.[IRONORE/] But China's imports of crude oil, copper, iron ore and soybeans all rose in May from a month earlier on a volume basis, suggesting producers remain optimistic about the outlook.  The copper imports rebound in May is more than market expectations, especially in the off season for copper, (suggesting) markets had overestimated the slowdown in China's economic growth and sluggish domestic demand,  said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong. Exports Also Under a Cloud? Exports benefited from solid demand from Europe and the United States, though trade has been under a cloud since Donald Trump was elected president in November vowing to shrink the large U.S. trade deficit with China.  The world's two biggest economies have started 100 days of trade talks, which was agreed by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping when they met in Florida in April in an effort to reduce the massive U.S trade gap.

The 10-year yield climbed 3 basis points to 0.070 percent, its highest since early April.

While the idea of the BOJ telegraphing an exit from its massive stimulus is not an unfamiliar theme, the report was seen to have caught the market at a vulnerable time.  Both JGBs and the yen appear to be reacting to the Bloomberg article. There was a shortage of immediate incentives today and the market jumped on it,  said Shuichi Osaki, a rates strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities.  Medium-term JGBs had also been weakened by several days of selling, and it was vulnerable to such headlines. That said, the exit theme is not new, so the market could be over-reacting a little.  Yields of two-year and five-year JGBs have risen steadily this week as the market reacted negatively to the BOJ's recent reductions in the amount of shorter-dated debt it buys at regular purchasing operations. The central bank has trimmed its purchases in an attempt to reintroduce liquidity after its massive JGB-buying created a shortage of debt available to market participants. Still, any reductions in the amount it buys have not been met with enthusiasm by a market now accustomed to having the BOJ absorb volumes of JGBs. The five-years fared a little better thanks to a well-received auction of the maturities. The yield on five-year JGBs was up a basis point at minus 0.085 percent after briefly touching a four-month peak of minus 0.075 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, at Thursday's 2.2 trillion yen ($20 billion) five-year auction rose to 4.71 from 3.59 at the previous sale last month. The new five-year JGBs were seen to have drawn ample investor demand as the maturities had cheapened significantly prior to the auction.

The case has been closely watched by the financial industry and corporate governance activists as it is likely to redefine the limits on what can be written in research reports on public companies, potentially curtailing the activities of research firms in the financial center. The Hong Kong court ruled in favor of a March 2016 ruling by the Securities and Futures Appeal Tribunal (SFAT) that partly upheld regulatory action imposed on the Hong Kong unit of Moody's Investors Service in relation to the publication of the so-called  red flags  report. The SFAT had determined that Moody's breached the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) code of conduct through the publication of the July 2011 report that raised corporate governance concerns over 49 Chinese companies, contributing to a fall in their Hong Kong share prices. “Moody's is disappointed by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal's decision. Moody's did not engage in misleading conduct and disagrees that the Securities and Futures Commission should be able to regulate the content of research publications,  Donough Foley, Senior Vice President, Government & Public Affairs, Moody's Investors Service, said in the statement.  Moody's is reviewing the Court's opinion and is considering its options.  The SFC had said that Moody's failed to ensure the accuracy of the report and that the report painted a misleading picture of the companies. It was the first time the SFC had taken action against a credit-rating firm since it started regulating rating activities in June 2011.     A key argument Moody's made in its defense was that the report did not constitute a credit rating and was therefore not subject to the SFC's jurisdiction, but the SFAT did not accept this.  The Moody's case has fueled concerns that governments in the region are increasingly trying to muffle negative research, with the Indonesian Finance Ministry in November penalizing JP Morgan following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia. The court's finding also comes amid renewed focus on negative research in Hong Kong, following a flurry of short-sell reports on companies in the city.   A representative of the SFC could not provide immediate comment.

Janusz Adam Adamski, 49, from Szczecin, Poland, climbed the world’s highest peak on May 21 from the Chinese route and descended on the Nepali side of the mountain that straddles their border. Adamski had a Chinese permit but did not have permission to descend the mountain from the Nepali side, a government official said.  He will not be allowed to climb any mountain peak in Nepal for 10 years under our mountaineering rules,  said Kamal Parajuli, a Nepali tourism official. He said Adamski told officials he chose the Nepali route for his descent because he was running short of oxygen bottles and  hoped to find help on the Nepali side, where there were many climbers at the time. Reuters could not reach Adamski for comment. Nepal will likely deport the climber for entering the country without visa, immigration official Mohan G.C. said. Hundreds of foreign climbers attempt Himalayan peaks in Nepal every year, but it is rare for climbers to do so without permission. Nepal charges $11,000 for an Everest permit.

Kevin Durant, the difference in the 2017 NBA Finals, led the Warriors with 31 points, and Golden State mounted a furious comeback to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 118-113 in Game 3. The Warriors, down by six with less than two minutes remaining, scored the game's final 11 points. Up 3-0 in the best-of-seven series, the Warriors can win their second title in three seasons and become the first team in NBA history to go through the playoffs without a loss with a win in Game 4 on Friday night in Cleveland. Golden State is now 15-0 this postseason. That is the longest winning streak in the playoffs in any major North American professional sport.  It's not done,  Durant said.  Closeout game is always the toughest. We have to be even better in Game 4 if we want to take this. It's an exciting time, but we still have a lot of work to do.  LeBron James scored 39 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and handed out nine assists for Cleveland. Kyrie Irving added 38 for the Cavs, who went scoreless over the game's final 3:09. Related CoveragePreview: Warriors at CavaliersDurant, meanwhile, scored 14 points in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left for a 114-113 advantage.  Even when you're playing well, you got to play like A-plus-plus, because they're going to make runs and they're going to make shots and they got guys that's going to make plays,  James said.  So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ballgame, but they made a couple more.  Klay Thompson had 30 points for the Warriors and Stephen Curry finished with 26 points and 13 rebounds. After committing 20 turnovers in Game 2, Golden State was again careless with the ball (18 turnovers for 22 Cleveland points). And, again, it didn't matter. After J.R. Smith drained a 3-pointer with 3:09 left for a 113-107 advantage, the Cavs missed eight shots. Kevin Love missed a layup, James a turnaround jumper, and Kyle Korver an open 3-point try in the corner.  Obviously K.D. made some huge plays down the stretch,  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.  I thought Klay's defense on Kyrie was amazing. Overall, it was just an incredibly tough, resilient performance. It wasn't our smartest game that we have played all year, but it was maybe our toughest in terms of our ability to just hang in there.  And nothing was really going our way, but we were still there. And we just had to kind of stay with it, and I thought our guys did a really good job of that.  Smith recovered from a poor first two games to score 16 for the Cavs. Love added nine points, 13 rebounds and six steals. Last year, the Cavs recovered from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Warriors in seven games. The year before, Golden State fell behind 2-1 in the series but closed out a title in Game 6 in Cleveland. After the comeback win Wednesday in a game in which they faced their toughest test, the Warriors hope to be popping champagne again at Quicken Loans Arena.  It sets us up for hopefully a great night on Friday,  Curry said. The Warriors entered play as the best team in the NBA in the third quarter, and they outscored the Cavs by 24 in the third quarters of the first two games. Not this time. Irving erupted for 16 points in the period, and the Cavs held a 94-89 edge heading into the fourth. It was Cleveland's first lead at the end of any quarter in this series. Love's 3-pointer at 8:59 gave the Cavs their first advantage at any point after the first quarter in this series, and Cleveland's 94-87 lead toward the end of the period was its largest of the series. The Warriors closed the first quarter on a 10-0 run and led 39-32. They set an NBA record with nine 3-pointers in the period. Thompson was scorching with 16 points, while James countered with 16 for the Cavs. With about six minutes left in the opening quarter, James was caught flush in the jaw by an inadvertent shoulder from teammate Tristan Thompson. James was rushing to the perimeter on defense, and Thompson moved back and the two collided, laying James out on the court. James remained in the game, and after the timeout scored on a drive to the hoop. When the first half was over, James had 27 points and the Warriors had committed 12 turnovers, and yet Golden State still led 67-61. Irving drove the length of the floor and lobbed one high off the glass for a layup at the buzzer to get the Cavs to within six. NOTES: Cavaliers F LeBron James passed Sam Jones (1,143 points), Bill Russell (1,151), and Elgin Baylor (1,161) for fourth place on the NBA Finals all-time scoring list in the first half. He passed Russell (315 assists) for third all time in Finals assists, too. ...

The conclusion was reached in a consultation paper seeking feedback by Aug. 18 from stakeholders on how these macroprudential limits could curb risks associated with high debt-to-income lending. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has been lobbying the government for months to get permission to add DTIs to its macroprudential arsenal. But house price growth has slowed down in recent months and the central bank has said even if the tools were available, they wouldn't use them right away.  The Bank considers that DTI limits could be a useful option in the future,  the RBNZ said in an emailed statement, adding that it  would not implement a DTI policy in current market conditions.  Finance Minister Steven Joyce said the debt-to-income restrictions would represent a  significant intervention  in the housing market.  It's important that all interested parties have their say during this consultation period,  he said in an emailed statement. New Zealand's housing market has soared more than 50 percent in value over the last decade, raising concerns that high mortgage debt could pose a systemic risk in the event of a sharp downturn in property prices. The RBNZ already requires investors to make a 40 percent downpayment on investment properties, after ramping up loan-to-value restrictions (LVR) in 2016. The measures have helped slow the rate of house price growth in recent months, but the central bank has said any resurgence in prices could be a worry. In March this year the International Monetary Fund echoed the policy makers' concerns around rapidly rising house prices in New Zealand, saying high levels of household debt tied up in property pose systemic risks. New Zealand's national household debt-to-income ratio stands at 168 percent, above most other OECD member countries, according to an IMF report in May. Recent data showed house price growth slowing in April and the house market growing at its most sluggish pace in two years in May. The central bank said the debt-to-income restrictions would not necessarily be targeted at investors or contain specific DTI ratio levels.  The DTI limit would be expected to be a speed limit, as with LVRs, so that banks are able to deal with borrowers that appear to be special cases,  according to the consultation paper.  The limit would apply to standard residential mortgages. This includes some loans secured by residential mortgage that fund businesses, but not some larger business loans.

Cuthbert and Escobar combined to drive in five runs as the Kansas City Royals held off the Houston Astros 7-5 on Wednesday night. Cuthbert, Escobar, Torres and Salvador Perez had two hits apiece for Kansas City.  Seven runs on two outs,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  What's impressive was the bottom of our order had been struggling so much and six RBIs from the bottom of the order with Esky, Cuthbert and Torres coming up and making a nice major league debut.  The three went 6-for-12.  I was looking for a good pitch, and he (left) a couple of pitches up,  Cuthbert said. The Astros scored three runs (two unearned) in the eighth inning to cut into the Royals' five-run advantage. Kansas City left-hander Scott Alexander, who was just activated off the disabled list, gave up three hits and one run while retiring only two batters in the eighth. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at RoyalsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchEscobar committed an error with the bases loaded to allow two unearned runs to score. Kelvin Herrera worked around Brian McCann's single in the ninth to pick up his 13th save. McCann had four of the Astros' 11 hits, including a home run. With Dallas Keuchel a game-time scratch, the Astros replaced him with Dayan Diaz, who was just called up from the minors. The Astros announced Keuchel, who is 9-0 with a major-league-best 1.67 ERA, had an illness after he went out to warm up.  It's tough,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of guys filling in for Keuchel at the last moment.  Guys did the best they could. Diaz just got here. He hadn't pitched in a few days. We were fortunate to have him. He went as long as he could.  It started with an already-taxed bullpen. We pieced it together. To even have the tying run up to bat in the eighth, and again in the ninth, was a pretty good testament to our 'pen doing what they could. A couple of guys pitching when they arguably shouldn't have, and our offense hanging in there to make it a game.  The Royals got two runs in the second inning. Perez singled and scored from first on Cuthbert's double to left. Escobar added an RBI single. Lorenzo Cain homered to straightaway center in the third to finish Diaz's first big league start. Diaz allowed three runs and four hits and struck out three in 2 2/3 innings. Left-hander Tony Sipp relieved Diaz and yielded two runs in the fourth. Perez led off the inning with a double and scored on Escobar's two-out single. Torres doubled down the right-field line to score Escobar. It was Torres' first big league hit and RBI in his second at-bat. The Royals pushed their lead to 7-2 in the fifth with Cuthbert's two-out, opposite-field single, scoring Jorge Bonifacio and Cain. Royals starter Jason Vargas (8-3) was removed after 89 pitches and five innings. He allowed two runs and six hits, including McCann's home run in the second.  I thought he scrapped,  Yost said.  His command was off, but he finds ways to grind through it. He did today. That's a mark of a good pitcher: When you don't have your best stuff, you can still grind your way through it. And that's exactly what Vargy did.  Vargas walked one, hit a batter and struck out five. His ERA went from 2.08 to 2.18.  That's definitely a compliment,  Vargas said when told of Yost's comment. McCann's fourth-inning single scored Carlos Beltran with the other Astros run off Vargas.  I knew it was going to be a bullpen game,  McCann said.  Guys made their pitches. I feel like I didn't do a good job tonight of calling the game. I felt like I could have gone a couple of different directions, and I should have. I'm going to be thinking of some pitches that I called tonight.  Perez was replaced by Drew Butera in the ninth after injuring his left thumb.  Alexander was throwing a tremendous sinker and when he struck out Beltran (in the eighth), the ball kind of caught him on the thumb a little bit and bent his thumb,  Yost said.  He's day-to-day. We'll see how he feels tomorrow.  NOTES: The Royals promoted INF Ramon Torres, who was hitting .327 with Triple-A Omaha, and started him at second base in his big league debut. They also activated LHP Scott Alexander from the disabled list after he recovered from a right hamstring strain. ... The Royals optioned RHP Kevin McCarthy and OF Billy Burns to the Storm Chasers. ... The Astros recalled RHP Dayan Diaz from Triple-A Fresno and optioned LHP Reymin Guduan to the Pacific Coast League affiliate. ... Astros RHP Lance McCullers and Royals RHP Jason Hammel are the Thursday probables for the finale of a four-game series.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-astros-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED687MQTZQ"},

The issuance consists of notes backed by Australian residential mortgages originated by MyState Bank Limited. The ratings are as follows: AUD360.0 million Class A1 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD20.0 million Class A2 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD8.0 million Class AB notes: 'NRsf' AUD6.4 million Class B1 notes: 'NRsf' AUD4.0 million Class B2 notes: 'NRsf' AUD1.6 million Class B3 notes: 'NRsf' The notes have been issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as trustee of ConQuest 2017-1 Trust. The collateral pool consisted of loans totalling AUD400 million at the 20 April 2017 cut-off date. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sufficient Credit Support: The class A1 and A2 notes have sufficient credit enhancement (CE) of 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, provided by their respective subordinated notes. Both the class A1 and A2 notes are independent of any credit provided by lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI). Pool Characteristics: The weighted-average (WA) seasoning of the portfolio is 37 months, with a WA unindexed loan/value ratio (LVR) of 64.9% and WA indexed LVR of 62.9%. The average obligor current loan size is AUD221,607; investment loans represent 17.2% of the pool by balance and interest-only loans represent 18.1%. Sequential/Pro Rata Paydown: Interest is paid sequentially towards the class A1, A2, AB, B1, B2 and then the B3 notes. Reimbursement of all losses is paid after the distribution of interest on the class B3 notes. The class A notes will initially receive principal on a pari passu basis, with all other note classes receiving principal sequentially prior to the pro rata test conditions being met. Once met, principal will be allocated on a pro rata basis across all notes. Sufficient Liquidity Support: Liquidity support will be provided via excess spread, principal draws and a liquidity facility sized at 0.75% of the note balance, with a facility floor of AUD300,000. The liquidity facility will amortise, subject to the floor, while performance-based triggers are satisfied. Geographic Concentration: Tasmania accounts for 40.9% of the portfolio and Victoria makes up 20.2% due to existing branch networks in these locations. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in CE and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis of the ratings by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Its analysis found that the ratings of the class A1 and A2 notes were not affected under Fitch's moderate or severe foreclosure stress (15% and 30% increase) scenarios, or moderate or severe recovery stress (15% and 30% decrease) scenarios. The ratings of the class A1 and A2 notes were not affected under Fitch's moderate combination stress in defaults and recoveries, but decreased to 'AA+sf' under Fitch's severe combination stress of 30% increase in defaults and 30% decrease in recoveries. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es;) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  Related Research  below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es; to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the report, Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions, dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of MyState's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was made available. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. Key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further discussed in the corresponding new issue report, ConQuest 2017-1 Trust, published today. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: Loan-by-loan data provided by MyState as at 20 April 2017 Transaction documentation provided by Allens, the issuer's counsel.

The market was also bolstered by Beijing's commitment to further reduce cost burdens on companies, and growing expectations that index publisher MSCI will decide to include Chinese A shares into its benchmark on June 20. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.5 percent, to 3,549.65 points by the lunch break, its best level since early December, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent, to 3,144.81 points. The market responded positively to China's foreign exchange reserves data published on Wednesday showing reserves rose in May for a fourth consecutive month and by more than markets had expected. Analysts expect foreign reserves to increase further as cross-border capital flows stabilise and as the yuan has sharply rebounded against the U.S. dollar. During China's midday break, trade data showed stronger-than-anticipated exports and imports for May despite falling commodity prices, suggesting the economy is holding up better than expected. Brokerage Lianchu Securities also attributed the market rebound to signs that  the central bank has intentionally moved to stabilise market expectations,  by injecting more liquidity into the banking system. Most sectors rose on Thursday, with transport and health care stocks among the biggest gainers. Chinese garment maker Youngor Group jumped more than 5 percent, after the company said China's state-owned margin lender had increased holdings in the company.

Food ordered from top New York restaurants is served, but the real attraction is Martin Lipton, one of the firm's co-founders and corporate America's most famous consigliere. The father of the 'poison pill' – a key defense strategy used against hostile takeovers – Lipton has helped build the firm into the most lucrative legal outfit in the world, a go-to shop for companies seeking to seal complex deals or repel suitors and activist investors. The weekly lunch is just one of the ways the 85-year-old stays in touch with new associates and reinforces the firm's close-knit culture, where young law graduates are often paired with senior partners to work on big deals. Partners say a flat structure and relatively small size - Wachtell's lawyer headcount of about 260 is roughly half of its closest rival Cravath, Swaine & Moore – is key to the firm's success.   The firm's concentrated business model contrasts with the strategy of many law firms to become one-stop shops for deals, from navigating niche regulatory processes to sorting through labyrinthine tax affairs. Lipton is confident that his strategy of concentrating on high-stakes corporate situations will persist, according to interviews with several senior partners at the firm. This is because corporate America continues to turn to Wachtell as its top legal gun for hire.      Wachtell's business model is to be the firm you go to when you are not willing to take any risk at all,  said Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor.  They know that in the big M&A; cases, legal fees, no matter how big they are, are insignificant to the value of concluding the deal.   When French drug giant Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) threatened U.S.cancer drug company Medivation Inc with a $9.3 billion hostile bid last year, for example, Medivation called Wachtell despite having an existing external legal adviser, Cooley.    Cooley helped Medivation to go public in 2004 and is best known for advising on initial public offerings and defending against patent and class action lawsuits. Cooley and Medivation declined to comment. Most Lucrative  With some U.S. companies domiciled overseas, Wachtell's partners often have to adapt their techniques to different jurisdictions.     Rather than opening offices internationally as some of their rivals have done, Wachtell's lawyers fly out to advise, staying weeks in some cases to see a case through, and turn to other law firms to assist them.     The logo for the Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm is seen at their office in New York, U.S., June 7, 2017.Shannon StapletonWachtell did consider opening a London office in recent years, but decided against it, partner at the firm said. The feeling among the firm's senior partners was that expansion would dilute its culture, which is based around forming ad hoc teams to deal with situations, all from the one office in Manhattan.     Keeping itself small has helped Wachtell become the most lucrative law firm in the world, with the average partner making a profit last year of $5.8 million, according to trade publication American Lawyer. The top 100 law firms averaged profit per partner of $1.66 million. Capping the workforce also means that partners do not have an army of associates to foist work onto.       We work harder on average than other places, the work is very partner-heavy. It's the type of work where vast experience is critical,  said Daniel Neff, co-chairman of Wachtell's executive committee.     No one is more experienced than Lipton, referred to as Marty by clients and colleagues. He continues to work on high-profile cases including, most recently, advising General Motors Co's (GM.N) board of directors on its defense against activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital, as well metal parts maker Arconic Inc (ARNC.N) on its settlement with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.  Besides Lipton, two of the other three founding partners, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, have died. However, like Lipton, founding partner Herbert Wachtell remains active at 84 practicing law, focusing on corporate litigation, which is the firm's other major area of strength. M&a; Royalty Lipton has built a bench of seasoned deal lawyers who now account for the majority of the business that comes through the door. They include Neff and Edward Herlihy, who formally lead the firm as co-managing partners, as well as Andrew Brownstein, David Katz, Steven Rosenblum, Adam Emmerich and Andrew Nussbaum, among others.  When Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) turned to Wachtell in 2015 to defend against a $35 billion offer from Mylan NV (MYL.O), it was a 45-year-old partner, Igor Kirman, that the Irish-domiciled generic drug maker chose to lead its defense in three continents. Perrigo subsequently defeated what was the largest hostile bid ever rejected by a company's shareholders.  It was a given for me that by turning to Wachtell we would get excellent legal advice. But Igor also took very complex issues and simplified them so Perrigo's board could understand,  said Joseph Papa, Perrigo's former CEO who now leads Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). Lipton remains influential, fielding calls and studying cases every day from his 31st-floor office, which is filled with memorabilia from major deals stretching back to the 1970s.      Lipton is royalty in the M&A; bar. There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved,  said Gillers.   The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment.

Mancini's pinch-hit homer in the ninth sent the game into extra innings, and his three-run homer with two outs in the 11th gave the Baltimore Orioles a 9-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night. Baltimore (31-26, 9-1 in extra innings) started the winning rally when Joey Rickard singled with one out against Wade LeBlanc (3-2). Caleb Joseph drew a two-out walk, and Mancini crushed LeBlanc's first pitch deep into the seats in left field. Mancini went 2-for-2 with five RBIs; it was the third time he hit multiple homers this year. It was his first walk-off homer.  That was definitely something I wasn't expecting before the game tonight,  Mancini said.  Again, baseball is the game where you never know what can happen.  Mychal Givens (6-0) got the win after throwing a scoreless 11th. LeBlanc lost for the second straight night. Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said losing like this two nights in a row is certainly tough to swallow. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at OriolesPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatch They're challenging; there's no doubt,  Hurdle said.  You come in and you're able to put some runs up and the other team is able to come back and tie you up late and then walk you off; it's tough. It's happened to us before. You never like it.  The Orioles rallied late for a second consecutive night, scoring four in the ninth to tie it. Closer Tony Watson came on with runners on second and third and no outs and allowed a sacrifice fly and J.J. Hardy's RBI double, which cut the deficit to 6-4. Mancini hit a tying two-run homer with two outs off Watson -- on a 2-2 count. Watson now has blown saves in back-to-back games and clearly was frustrated to see this happen for the second time in 24 hours.  Being the closer, you're supposed to close out games,  Watson said.  No excuses. It's not happening. It's inexcusable. We've got a lead there late and guys put up runs and you have to get the job done.  The Pirates (26-33) had been in control as Jose Osuna (two-run homer), Max Moroff and Elias Diaz (both two-run doubles) helped them build a 6-1 lead after seven innings. Pittsburgh starter Chad Kuhl allowed one run and four hits in five innings but did not win for the 11th straight start. Baltimore starter Wade Miley suffered command issues again. He constantly fell behind in the count and allowed four runs and eight hits in 2 2/3 innings. Adam Jones started the Baltimore comeback with a solo homer in the eighth, which made it 6-2. Then came the four-run ninth. The Pirates took a 2-0 lead in the second when Moroff softly lined a two-run double to left. Hyun Soo Kim cut the lead in half for Baltimore in the bottom of that inning with a sacrifice fly. Pittsburgh made it 4-1 in the third when Diaz added another soft double, this one down the right-field line, that also scored two runs. Miley left after walking the next batter. The Orioles also pulled third baseman Manny Machado after the third inning. Machado injured his hand in the second inning when Andrew McCutchen slid into it.  It's a puncture (on the hand), pretty deep. It's not stitchable -- at least we didn't think it was,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  It's more on the top here, pretty deeply bruised, just kind of deep. It's an unfortunate slide, I can tell you that. We've had our share. I don't think Andrew was doing it maliciously. It certainly was an unfortunate execution of a slide.   Showalter said X-rays were negative and they would do an MRI on Thursday. NOTES: RHP Edwin Jackson was brought up from Triple-A Norfolk.

Ramos to salvage a series finale. The Chicago Cubs had scored single runs in the seventh and eighth, and Ramos got the last out in the eight. The sixth Marlins pitcher of the night, he came back out and delivered a scoreless final inning for his ninth save to preserve a 6-5 victory.  Those are the situations I like to be in,  he said.  I kind of stepped off (the mound) to feel the energy of the crowd. Even though it was negative energy toward me, I still feed off that, and I was able to get the job done.  Teammate JT Riddle went 2-for-4 with a go-ahead two-run single in the fourth inning as the Marlins grabbed one victory in the three-game series. Right-hander Jose Urena (4-2) worked five innings for his third straight win as the Marlins (25-33) stopped a two-game slide. Urena allowed three runs on three hits while walking three and striking out five. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at CubsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchJ.T. Realmuto homered in a three-run fourth inning, and Dee Gordon and Tyler Moore had two hits apiece for Miami.  However it comes, we're just happy to have the win,  Gordon said.  Honestly we needed to come out of here with at least one, and we battled the whole game for it.  Cubs right-hander John Lackey (4-6) took his third straight loss as Chicago (30-28) saw a five-game winning streak end. Lackey gave up five runs on seven hits, struck out six and hit one batter in six innings. Chicago's Kyle Schwarber greeted Marlins reliever David Phelps with a leadoff solo homer in the seventh, cutting the Miami lead to 6-4. Schwarber completed a 3-for-4 night as he doubled home Jon Jay off Marlins reliever Nick Wittgren with two outs in the eighth to make it 6-5. The performance was some consolation for the Cubs after Schwarber's struggles in recent weeks.  It's more reminiscent of what we've seen in the past,  Chicago manager Joe Maddon said.  Great balance in his finish. Every time he's hit the ball well, he's just able to stand there because of his balance. ... A nice night for him, absolutely.  The Marlins grabbed an early lead for the second consecutive night. Gordon led off the game with a triple to left and scored on Christian Yelich's sacrifice fly. The Cubs jumped ahead with a pair of third-inning runs. Schwarber doubled to left, Ian Happ walked and Anthony Rizzo doubled to right-center with two outs to bring them both home for a 2-1 lead. The Marlins replied with three runs in the fourth. Realmuto forged a 2-2 tie with a one-out solo home run to left, his fifth of the season. Derek Dietrich then singled, Moore reached on a ground-rule double, and both came home when Riddle singled to center for a 4-2 lead. In the fifth, Marcell Ozuna made it 5-2 with a two-out solo home run to left, his 15th of the season. Happ got one run back for the Cubs, hitting a solo homer to left with two outs in the bottom of the fifth.  I liked the way we played,  Maddon said.  I thought we battled well, we had good at-bats. I thought we caught the ball on defense, Johnny (Lackey) had a tough night, but otherwise it was a pretty good game on our part.  NOTES: The Miami Herald reported Wednesday that Marlins' top-ranked prospect, LHP Braxton Garrett, has a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow and may require Tommy John surgery. ...

China's May exports rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier, while imports expanded 14.8 percent, both beating analysts' expectations.      The regional markets may not react to the Chinese data now as they wait for the results of key global events, said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.      The data will however further bolster the yuan as well as other regional currencies in the near term, he said.      In Southeast Asia, Philippine shares fell as much as 0.5 percent after hitting a near 10-month high earlier in the session.      Industrial and telecom stocks were the biggest drag on the index, with SM Investments Corp dropping 2.9 percent.  PLDT Inc fell 2.6 percent.     Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia were flat.       Singapore shares gained as much as 0.4 percent, with telecom and industrial stocks leading the index.      Singapore Telecommunications gained as much as 0.5 percent, while Jardine Matheson Holdings rose 0.9 percent.     In Asia, shares wobbled as investors braced for any surprises from the UK elections, the ECB meeting and congressional testimony from ex-FBI director James Comey who was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump last month.     Comey's senate appearance later in the day will be closely watched for any hints on whether the U.S. President engaged in obstruction of justice - an offence that could lead to impeachment hearings.

Jay Bruce homered twice, and the Mets squeezed across a run in the ninth to beat the Texas Rangers 4-3 Wednesday night at Globe Life Park. The game-winner came in unorthodox fashion with two outs in the ninth. With runners at first and second against Rangers closer Matt Bush, Jose Reyes sent a bouncing ball up the middle. Texas second baseman Rougned Odor fielded it on the outfield grass behind the base and hurriedly bounced a throw to Elvis Andrus at second. The shortstop appeared to trap the ball, but it slipped out, and pinch runner Matt Reynolds never slowed down on his way home from second.  That's what you've got to do, and one of the reasons why we ran him, in case there was some play where you had to have just a little extra step,  New York manager Terry Collins said.  Matty did a nice job of going hard the whole way.  The play was reviewed, and the safe call at second was upheld. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at RangersNew York Mets - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchAndrus remained incredulous after the game, maintaining he had control of the ball for the third out. Second base umpire Chris Guccione saw it differently.  I hold it. That's what I was talking to him (about),  Andrus said.  I hold it the whole time for like three or four seconds. He just said that he couldn't see the ball, but I saw the video and clearly you can see that I hold it.  It wasn't in my glove, but I hold it the whole time. I never hear safe or out, so I turned to try to throw to home plate, and that's when it dropped. I hold the ball the whole time. There's rules. I don't actually know the rules; maybe it has to be in my glove. Tough play right there.  Addison Reed picked up his ninth save with a spotless ninth to give the Mets a split of the two-game interleague series. The Mets (25-32) had lost five of their previous six games. New York is off Thursday before heading to Atlanta for four games starting Friday, including a doubleheader Saturday. Bruce accounted for the first three New York runs with a pair of blasts off Rangers starter Yu Darvish, giving the Texas native 15 long balls this season. He clubbed a two-run homer in the fourth and a solo shot two innings later.  The two mistakes (Darvish) made, he made to me, and I was able to not miss them,  Bruce said.  Against those aces, the chances you get is what you capitalize on.  Mets starter Zack Wheeler was in position to win after tying his longest outing of the season, throwing seven innings of one-run ball. He kept the Rangers off balance and worked out of a few jams, none bigger than a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the first that yielded only one run. Wheeler left with New York leading 3-1. The Rangers tied it in the eighth. With two outs against reliever Jerry Blevins (3-0), Nomar Mazara singled to center. Robinson Chirinos followed with a drive that cleared the fence down the left field line and knotted the game 3-3. The Rangers picked up another solid outing from Darvish, who didn't factor into the decision despite striking out nine and allowing just three hits and three runs in 7 1/3 innings.  I thought Yu threw the ball really well,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  He made two mistakes to Bruce. Other than that, I feel like he was in control tonight.  Texas (27-32) completed an eight-game homestand at 2-6. The Rangers are off Thursday before opening a three-game series Friday at Washington. Wheeler gave up one run in the first, but it easily could have been worse. The Rangers loaded the bases with no outs on two hits and a walk before ending the inning with groundouts. Mazara beat out a double play to drive in the game's first run. Chirinos wasn't as lucky, rolling into a twin killing to end the early threat. Darvish rolled through the first three innings before finally allowing a baserunner in the fourth as he hit Michael Conforto. New York's first hit was Bruce going deep to right-center. The ball initially appeared to hit the top of the wall before ricocheting back into the field, and Bruce easily reached third. A video review showed the ball cleared the fence, awarding Bruce the homer and giving the Mets a 2-1 lead. NOTES: Rangers 3B Adrian Beltre is out of the lineup indefinitely after spraining his ankle Tuesday night against the Mets. The Rangers didn't make a roster move before Wednesday's game.  I know he is still pretty sore today,  manager Jeff Banister said.  He came in today and got treatment. We'll see where he is at and have the doctor look at him. Right now it's how he feels. He's sore and not available.  ... Mets manager Terry Collins was at a loss when asked about the club's starting pitching woes.  We had no indication at all at the end of last year that we'd be going through what we're going through,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED687MGSZ2"},

The pound held steady at $1.2956, trading near Wednesday's peak of $1.2970, its highest level since May 25. Opinion polls showed on Wednesday that May is on course to increase her majority in parliament in the election, suggesting her gamble to call the vote to strengthen her position in Brexit negotiations will pay off.  Markets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory,  said Jasslyn Yeo, market strategist for J.P.Morgan Asset Management. If the Conservative Party ends up gaining a decisive majority of more than 50 seats, that would probably be seen as a positive outcome for sterling, Yeo said.  However, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors,  she added. The pound gained as much as 4 percent after May called a snap election seven weeks ago, as polls suggested a landslide win for her Conservative Party would strengthen the Prime Minister's position when Brexit negotiations open later this month . But recent polls predicting outcomes ranging from a majority for the Conservatives to a 'hung' parliament have seen sterling slip from the $1.30 mark it hit last month. The euro held steady at $1.1254, with the market's focus on the ECB's monetary policy announcement due later on Thursday. The euro had reached a high of $1.1285 earlier in June, its highest level in nearly seven months. The ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.59 trillion) bond-buying programme. The euro's medium-term view looks positive, supported by prospects for the ECB to start heading towards normalising its monetary policy in coming months, said Peter Dragicevich, G10 FX strategist for Nomura in Singapore.  It's more for us a story of positive euro, not just against the dollar but pretty much against all currencies...even against the commodity bloc,  he said. The ECB will probably announce a tapering of its asset purchases in September and actually begin tapering in January next year, Dragicevich added. Investors will closely monitor U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey later on Thursday. Comey was abruptly fired by President Donald Trump in May. Investors are worried his testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of rolling back regulation and overhauling the tax code. In written testimony released on Wednesday, Comey said that Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The dollar gained 0.1 percent to 109.92 yen, edging up from Wednesday's low of 109.115 yen, its weakest level since April 21. There was little market reaction to reports North Korea fired what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast early on Thursday.

Profitability at steel mills was good in May especially for rebar producers,  said Wang Di, analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing.  I don't think there will be a slump in iron ore imports going forward because while inventory at ports is very high, inventory at mills is relatively low.   Last month, Chinese iron ore futures DCIOcv1 plunged 15 percent for their worst monthly performance in more than a year, with investors liquidating long positions amid worries about slowing construction and infrastructure demand.   While steel prices have come off their recent rally, and we think are set for further declines, iron ore prices could see a short-term stabilization before easing in the second half of the year,  Barclays Capital analysts in a recent research note.  Stockpiles of imported iron ore at China's major ports remain close to 13-year highs.  Steel consumption typically eases during the summer months in the north of the country along with construction activity.

The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) is looking into several officials at FGV, following the suspension of the firm's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and two other executives earlier this week. A MACC spokesman said the anti-graft agency was at FGV's offices in Kuala Lumpur  to collect supporting documents  following a meeting with FGV Chief Executive Zakaria Arshad on Wednesday. The investigators could seize laptops and computers as well, he said, declining to give details on what was discussed with Zakaria. An FGV source, requesting anonymity, said MACC officials also want to meet chairman Mohd Isa Abdul Samad at the company's offices. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Isa said he was willing to meet the anti-corruption investigators if asked. He added that FGV was continuing its own investigation into a transaction with a subsidiary that led to the suspensions of the FGV executives. Isa was a former chief minister of Negeri Sembilan state and a former vice-president of Malaysia's ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation. PRIME MINISTER STEPS IN Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's office stepped into the boardroom spat on Wednesday, asking a former cabinet minister to look into the suspension of FGV's top executives. Turmoil at FGV -- whose biggest shareholder is the state-owned Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) -- could hurt Najib, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. FGV's shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states. Felda  settlers , or land owners, are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the parliament. They own shares in FGV, which raised over $3 billion in one of the world's biggest listings of 2012. The shares have dropped 70 percent since that stock market launch, hurting settlers. They have also complained about delayed payments from Felda, which buys the palm fruit the settlers produce in their land. FGV's shares fell 0.6 percent on Thursday to 1.65 ringgit per share, valuing the company at 5.91 billion ringgit ($1.39 billion). The shares have lost about 6 percent of their value since Tuesday's suspension of the top executives. The FGV board has said a deal with Dubai-based palm oil buyer Safitex was at the heart of the company's internal investigation and Safitex owes an FGV unit about $11.7 million as of 2016. The FGV crisis unfolded on Tuesday when CEO Zakaria's letter to the chairman, stating his refusal to step down as instructed by the chairman, was leaked. FGV's board then suspended Zakaria and three others. The CEO has denied wrongdoing and called on MACC to conduct its own investigation into FGV, but did not provide any details. $1 = 4.2610 ringgit Writing by A.

While steel prices have come off their recent rally, and we think are set for further declines, iron ore prices could see a short-term stabilization before easing in the second half of the year,  Barclays Capital analysts in a recent research note. Stockpiles of imported iron ore at China's major ports remain close to 13-year highs. SH-TOT-IRONINV Steel consumption typically eases during the summer months in the north of the country along with construction activity. Imports of steel products rose 2.8 percent to 1.11 million tonnes in May from April. Exports rose 7.6 percent to 6.98 million tonnes. Reining in excessive local government debt and the shadow banking sector in China has been high on the central government's agenda, leading to concerns that tighter liquidity will affect completion of some large infrastructure projects.

But imports of the fuel were up 16.6 percent from a year earlier, figures from the General Administration of Customs of China showed. The numbers include lignite, a type of coal with lower heating value that is largely supplied by Indonesia. For the first five months, coal shipments rose 30 percent from the year before to 111.7 million tonnes. The month-on-month drop in imports came as the Securities Daily newspaper reported in May that Beijing had asked utilities to reduce their purchases of overseas coal by 5 to 10 percent this year in an effort to restrict low-quality imports. Falling domestic prices have also made imports from Australia and Indonesia less competitive. The most-active-traded thermal coal futures prices touched a two-month-low of 503 yuan ($74.02) per tonne on May 11, down more than 10 percent from a record 566 yuan per tonne on April 5. Inventories at China's major coal port Qinhuangdao SH-QHA-COALINV climbed to 5.94 million tonnes in late May, the highest in three months. Forecasts for an early heat wave could help boost demand before the peak summer season in July, analysts and traders said, with electricity usage jumping as people crank up their air conditioning.

Nick Markakis drove in five runs with three doubles, Dansby Swanson hit a three-run homer as part of a three-hit game, and the Braves snapped the Philadelphia Phillies' four-game winning streak with a 14-1 rout Wednesday night. It was the most runs the Braves have scored since beating the Phillies 15-13 in 11 innings on May 2, 2012. The Braves punished the Phillies' bullpen with four runs in the seventh inning and six runs in the eighth. Matt Adams capped the scoring rampage with a two-run homer off Andres Blanco, an infielder forced to the mound in a mop-up role.  I had to save my bullpen. I didn't want to use another pitcher,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  We talked to (Blanco), and he said he'd try it.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BravesPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchFoltynewicz (4-5) allowed four hits, walked two and struck out four in a follow-up to a dominant performance last Friday in Cincinnati, where he yielded just two hits while striking out 10 and walking two. The Braves lost that game 3-2 in 10 innings, though.  He's making strides,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  As sharp as he was the other day, he built on that one and was able to work his way out of a couple of situations. He did a great job. I felt like when he cocked his arm, he had a pretty good idea where the ball was going.  Jerad Eickhoff, who won 11 games last season for the Phillies, fell to 0-7 despite yielding just four hits in five innings. One of the four runs charged to the right-hander was unearned, and he had four strikeouts and one walk.  He didn't pitch badly. He just hung a slider (to Swanson),  Mackanin said. Eickhoff had faced the minimum 10 batters thanks to a pickoff until Brandon Phillips singled with one out in the fourth inning. Markakis then delivered a run-scoring double to put the Braves ahead. Before Eickhoff got an out in the fifth inning, the Braves led 4-0. Third baseman Maikel Franco was charged with a three-base error on Tyler Flowers' hard grounder, and Rio Ruiz walked before Swanson picked on a hanging 0-1 slider and sent his sixth homer of the season over the fence in left-center field.  I was rolling along and made one bad pitch,  Eickhoff said.  I can take this. I can handle (the losses). I feel that this (game) was a building block.  Markakis had a two-run double in the Braves' four-run seventh inning and another in the six-run eighth as the Phillies went through three relievers before turning to Blanco.  He's Mr. Steady,  Snitker said of Markakis.  He's a boring pro who just comes to work each day and just prepares and plays. He's a real pleasure to be around because of his professionalism and how he goes about it. ... The guy is a true pro.  Odubel Herrera hit his second double and ninth in the past five games in the ninth inning and came around to score on pinch hitter Daniel Nava's single as the Phillies avoided a shutout. Foltynewicz had a runner in scoring position in the first, sixth and seventh innings but worked out of trouble each time as he lowered his ERA to 3.48.  Hopefully, he will just continue to build on the last two (starts) and take away good things,  Snitker said.  I like a lot that I've seen, the mound presence and the confidence you feel when you watch him pitch. There were a couple situations that didn't go his way and he just took a deep breath and kept going.   Very confident,  Foltynewicz said of his outing.  My fastball had some life early in the game and it was one of those situations where I had a little bit of luck on my side. There were a lot of hard-hit balls at people. I kind of basically got through the whole game with my fastball.  NOTES: The Phillies said after the game that LHP Joely Rodriguez will be designated for assignment on Thursday. He faced five batters in the sixth inning and allowed two walks and a hit. ... RHP Hector Neris was removed as the Phillies' closer at least temporarily and replaced by RHP Pat Neshek, who picked up his first save when he bailed out Neris in the ninth inning Tuesday. ... The Braves put 3B Adonis Garcia on the 10-day disabled list because of a sprained left middle finger sustained on a swing Tuesday. They recalled OF Lane Adams from Triple-A Gwinnett. ... RHP R.A. Dickey (3-4, 5.10 ERA) will start Thursday's series finale for the Braves against RHP Ben Lively (1-0, 1.29 ERA). ... The Braves will promote LHP Sean Newcomb and RHP Matt Wisler from Gwinnett to make starts in their Saturday doubleheader against the New York Mets.

It would be difficult to lay out specific scenarios on an exit strategy now. Presenting several versions of it would confuse markets,  Iwata told parliament, responding after a lawmaker said the BOJ should issue scenarios on how it would dial back its massive stimulus programme. But he said the BOJ will keep looking for ways to better communicate to the public how the central bank's asset purchases could affect the central bank's financial health. Iwata said that if long-term interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, it would shave 24.6 trillion yen ($223.9 billion) off the value of government bonds the central bank held as of March. The loss would increase to 44.6 trillion yen if yields rose 2 percentage points and 88.3 trillion yen if they climbed by 5 percentage points, he said. But Iwata stressed it was hard to calculate now how a withdrawal of stimulus could affect the BOJ's balance sheet, as that would depend on economic, price and market conditions at the time.  When the timing for an exit comes, we will guide monetary policy appropriately so that long-term interest rates don't spike abruptly,  he said. After four years of aggressive asset purchases, the BOJ's balance sheet hit a milestone of 500 trillion yen, roughly the same size as that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Growing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented the BOJ with a fresh communications challenge, pushing it to be clearer on how it might dial back its stimulus - even though many analysts say such action remains a long way off. $1 = 109.87 yen Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Richard Borsuk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-economy-boj-iwata-idUSL3N1J51SB"},

The town is famed for a middle school that puts students through rigorous 14-hour days in preparation for the exam, which begins on Wednesday and is usually spread over two days. This year about 9.4 million students will appear, the Xinhua state news agency said, roughly the same number since 2014 and down from a peak of 10.5 million in 2010.  The fiercely competitive test is seen as a key to social mobility and the best chance for school leavers to land a white-collar job. Just 40 percent of students are expected to enroll in undergraduate degrees subsequently, however, Xinhua said, citing the 2017 enrollment plan of the education ministry. But the exception is Maotanchang Middle School, whose website says 80 percent to 90 percent of its students have won college acceptances since 2010.  My mother gave up her job and came here to keep me company,  said Xiang Licheng, a 20-year-old who came to Maotanchang to prepare for a second attempt at the exam.

In the lead-up to the exams, students took part in incense-burning ceremonies to pray for good luck. They also released into the sky floating lanterns inscribed with  gaokao  messages. China's education ministry has urged exam venues to  create an optimal environment for students , and guard against  extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and disease outbreaks that could occur during the exams,  Xinhua added.

Media reports that Sessions offered to resign recently surfaced earlier this week. They added to pressure on Trump as former FBI Director James Comey, who was abruptly fired last month, prepared to testify in Congress on Thursday about his interactions with the president. Trump did not accept Sessions' resignation offer and is now being advised to keep his attorney general in place, at least for the time being, two sources said.  Political and legal advisers inside the White House have told Trump over the past month that firing Sessions would create another political fire storm and make it more difficult to fill key jobs inside his administration, the sources said on the condition of anonymity.  That's the advice he's been given. But he might not listen to that advice,  one of the sources said. A senior White House official confirmed aides have been urging Trump to keep Sessions but said it was because  he's the best man for the job.  A spokeswoman at the Justice Department declined to comment. Trump has repeatedly shrugged off advice from close aides. Earlier this week, he said the Justice Department led by Sessions was wrong to submit a  watered down, politically correct  version of his proposed travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries to the Supreme Court.   The outburst weakened government lawyers' defense that the travel ban, which has been blocked by federal courts, was not intended as a ban on Muslims. Sessions offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over his decision to recuse himself from a federal investigation into ties between Trump's associates and Russian officials when Russia was allegedly meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to media reports. A former senator, Sessions was one of the first senior Republican lawmakers to endorse Trump as a presidential candidate and played an important role in the campaign.  He recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after he failed to disclose a meeting he had with Russia's ambassador in Washington. Trump and Sessions were together at the White House on May 17, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein surprised them both by appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to head the Russia investigation.  After learning the news, Trump lashed out at Sessions, blaming him for recusing himself from the Russia probe and leaving the ability to appoint an outside investigator in Rosenstein's hands, the sources said.  Trump also complained that Sessions had not warned him about Rosenstein's decision. The Justice Department said Sessions played no part in the decision.

Following a banner 2016 driven by expectations that a key federal tax credit would expire at the end of that year, the utility-scale market is expected to drop to 8 gigawatts this year from more than 10 GW last year, according to a report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. The utility market, which accounts for about half of all solar systems, is expected to resume growth in 2019 as utilities seek to procure projects before the 30 percent federal tax credit for solar projects begins to step down in 2020. Prices on solar systems dropped further during the first quarter, falling below $1 per watt for the first time, the report said. Residential solar is expected to rise 2 percent for the year, well below the 19 percent growth it logged last year. California is experiencing a major decline in adoption of home installations that contributed to a 17 percent first-quarter drop in the nationwide market. The state accounted for 35 percent of the total U.S. market during the quarter, its lowest share since GTM began tracking the market in 2010.

Picture taken October 14, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoResidential markets in New York, Massachusetts and Maryland also fell during the quarter as installers found it was taking longer to win over customers beyond the early adopters.  The market for non-residential solar, which includes commercial and community solar installations, rose 30 percent in the first quarter thanks in part to a robust community solar market in Minnesota and growth in New York. GTM would revise its forecasts downward, it warned, if a petition by bankrupt solar manufacturer Suniva to implement a 78-cents-per-watt floor on solar module pricing is approved by the U.S. International Trade Commission. U.S. module prices were around 40 cents a watt in the first quarter. Suniva filed a rare Section 201 petition with the ITC last month, seeking new duties on imported solar products to combat a global oversupply of panels that has depressed prices. If successful, the petition would put solar system costs at 2015 levels, according to GTM.

The e-commerce giant has doled out more than $1 billion in small loans to sellers in the past 12 months, compared with more than $1.5 billion it lent from 2011 through 2015, said Peeyush Nahar, vice president for Amazon Marketplace. Sellers have used the money to expand their inventory or discount items on Amazon, he said. Boosting sales for third-party merchants is lucrative for Amazon, which takes a cut of transactions on its site.  It also has made a business out of handling more leg work for sellers, too. They pay Amazon to fulfill their orders and boost their placement in search results, without which sellers might struggle to grab shoppers' attention. More than 20,000 small businesses have received a loan from Amazon and more than half of those have taken a second loan from the company, it said. Loans range from $1,000 to $750,000. Sellers have said interest rates are between 6 percent and 14 percent.

We do tell them it's to help them grow on the Amazon Marketplace,  Nahar said. Traditional lenders shied away from small merchants after the 2008 financial crisis, which created an opening for other sources of financing. While this exposes Amazon to additional credit risk, the company has near real-time data on sellers' businesses and access to their customer reviews, which are helpful in deciding whether to make a loan. The loan program is invitation-only. Amazon has issued loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. The company has said it would expand to other countries where it operates marketplaces, such as Canada, France and China. On the rollout's timing, Nahar said,  Stay tuned.
