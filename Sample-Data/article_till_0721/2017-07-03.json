Italy has revised its immigration policies in response, including bowing to pressure from other European countries and bottling up the arrivals inside the country rather than waving them through, as well as stepping up deportations.Earlier in the weekend, Mr. Trump had called Chinese President       Xi Jinping,        and \u201creiterated his determination to seek more balanced trade relations with America\u2019s trading partners,\u201d the White House said.He also spoke with Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe,        about North Korea in particular, and Gulf state leaders about the regional dispute over Qatar.", "news_time": "2017-07-03 22:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-talks-trade-and-climate-with-merkel-ahead-of-g-20-summit-1499134809", "news_title": "Trump Talks Trade and Climate With Merkel Ahead of G-20 Summit ", "keywords": "g-20,group of 20,paris climate agreement,steel overcapacity,trade barriers,trade surplus,trump merkel call,u.s. germany tensions,Donald Trump,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Exxon Mobil Corp.       and other energy companies have joined President       Donald Trump      \u00a0in expressing concerns over a bill\u00a0to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners.The pushback from energy companies such as Exxon and             Chevron Corp.      \u2014and other industries\u2014threatens to complicate House passage of the legislation, aimed partly at punishing Russia\u00a0for what U.S. officials describe as interference in last year\u2019s U.S. election. The bill\u00a0breezed through the Senate\u00a0last month\u00a0on a bipartisan, 98-2 vote.Exxon\u2019s advocacy also presents a potential political problem for the Trump administration, which has been trying to avoid conflict-of-interest questions involving Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        the oil giant\u2019s former chief executive.Mr. Tillerson, who has promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon, hasn\u2019t explicitly spoken out against the sanctions bill, but last month urged Congress not to take any actions that tie the administration\u2019s hands.Mr. Trump is set to meet Russian President       Vladimir Putin       face-to-face this week for the first time since the election at the G-20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, Germany. The White House hasn\u2019t ruled out a presidential veto of the sanctions measure, which includes a provision that would make it more difficult for the president to relax existing sanctions against the Kremlin,\u00a0saying that it could erode Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to conduct diplomacy.A U.S. special prosecutor and Congress are investigating Russia\u2019s use of cyberattacks in the election and whether there were improper ties between aides to Mr. Trump and Russia\u2019s government. The president has denied any wrongdoing.As the nation\u2019s top diplomat, Mr. Tillerson has said Russia must be held accountable.\u00a0A senior State Department official said Monday that \u201cSecretary Tillerson retired from Exxon prior to assuming his position as Secretary of State\u201d and added, \u201cAs a general matter, Russian sanctions cover broad areas, including the invasion of Ukraine, and are coordinated with our allies.\u201dLobbyists for Exxon and other oil industry players have expressed dismay to lawmakers about several provisions in the legislation, including\u00a0measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals or companies under sanctions around the world, and\u00a0to\u00a0add congressional review of certain sanctions exemptions. Companies also have expressed concern that the bill could force them to disclose information they consider proprietary.Exxon spokesman       Alan Jeffers       said the company doesn\u2019t have a position on sanctions but has provided legislators with information about how the bill could \u201cdisadvantage U.S. companies compared to our non-U.S. counterparts.\u201d A Chevron spokesman declined to comment.The lobbying by Exxon and other big oil companies is part of a push to preserve potential business relationships with Russia, even as U.S. ties with the Kremlin sink to new lows.The bill has the potential to scuttle any U.S. business partnership around the world that involves Russian partners. That has prompted concerns not only from energy firms but also banking and industrial companies, according to people familiar with the matter.             General Electric Co.       is closely watching the legislation over concerns it could disadvantage U.S. companies relative to global peers, one person said.\u2018This has far-reaching impacts to a variety of companies and industries. It has the potential to penalize U.S. interests and advantage Russia.\u2019\u201cThis has far-reaching impacts to a variety of companies and industries,\u201d said       Jack Gerard,        chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute. \u201cIt has the potential to penalize U.S. interests and advantage Russia.\u201dThe bill faces an\u00a0uncertain fate in the House, after objections raised by\u00a0some House Republicans, including Rep.       Pete Sessions       of Texas.\u00a0A standoff was avoidable, some analysts say.Leon Panetta,        who served as White House chief of staff under former President       Bill Clinton       and as a cabinet member in the Obama administration, said that Congress and the Trump administration should\u00a0try to forge a consensus on what sanctions should be applied.\u201cWhen it comes to sanctions policy the best course for this country is to have both the Congress and the president in the same place,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cIf it looks like there\u2019s a dispute between the president and Congress it sends a terrible message to our adversaries and our allies.\u201dFor Exxon, the stakes are especially high: The legislation could further dismantle its fragile partnership\u00a0with Russian oil giant PAO Rosneft, which has been mostly on hold since the U.S. imposed sanctions on\u00a0the country in\u00a02014\u00a0after Russia\u2019s annexation\u00a0of Crimea. The oil company previously sought a waiver from sanctions, a request the Trump administration rejected in April.Exxon has moved ahead with an expansion of a project with Rosneft\u00a0that preceded the current sanctions\u00a0near Russia\u2019s Sakhalin Island in the country\u2019s Far East. It has produced more than 650 million barrels of oil since 2005 and is one of the largest foreign investments in Russia.As written, the bill could affect two existing Exxon projects outside of Russia in which Rosneft holds a stake, according to people familiar with the matter. One is a development involving the use of hydraulic fracturing in the Permian basin in New Mexico, and the other is a prospect in Canada\u2019s Alberta province.The prohibition on Russia partnerships\u00a0would strike at the heart of efforts by\u00a0Rosneft to expand outside of Russia. British oil giant             BP                   PLC owns 20% of Rosneft, and the Russian company signed a deal in March with Italian energy company             Eni                   SpA to cooperate globally. Rosneft owns a stake in a massive Eni gas field off Egypt\u2019s shores.Some U.S. House members have echoed Exxon and industry concerns that the legislation could lead to the release of proprietary information.\u00a0Mr. Sessions, who represents the Dallas area, said he wants to change provisions that could put U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage.Mr. Sessions said he is \u201crepresenting companies in the energy industry that don\u2019t want to be blocked from these deals.\u201dWrite to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 20:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-giants-lobby-against-bill-to-toughen-russia-sanctions-1499114749", "news_title": "Oil Giants Lobby Against Bill to Toughen Russia Sanctions", "keywords": "bill,chevron,energy companies,energy deals,exxon,interference,lobbyists,sanctions,u.s. election,Exxon Mobil,XOM,Chevron,CVX,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A federal appeals court\u00a0Monday\u00a0blocked the Environmental Protection Agency from loosening controls on emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, setting back Trump administration efforts to rapidly dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s climate-change policies.Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt granted an industry request to suspend a June 2016 rule requiring oil and natural gas producers to fix leaks and take other steps to limit emissions from new or recently modified facilities. Mr. Pruitt suspended enforcement of the rule for two years.On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that while the EPA could re-examine the 2016 regulations, known as new source performance standards, Mr. Pruitt lacked authority to set the rule aside pending completion of the review.The ruling marked a role reversal for Mr. Pruitt, who as Oklahoma attorney general made his name filing suit against Obama administration environmental policies he argued were unlawful.Under the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, federal agencies must follow a complicated series of steps, including providing public notice of proposed rules and inviting comments on them, before issuing regulations. Likewise, agencies must follow certain procedures before revoking regulations.A three-judge D.C. Circuit panel found that the EPA had flouted those requirements in suspending the new-source rule.\u201cWe are reviewing the opinion and examining our options,\u201d an EPA spokeswoman said. Those options could include asking the full D.C. Circuit to review the panel\u2019s 2-1 decision, or appeal to the Supreme Court.A spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group that intervened in the case, couldn\u2019t immediately be reached.\u201cDonald Trump and Scott Pruitt\u2019s attempt to delay the implementation of these crucial protections had no basis in law, and we are glad to see their effort to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry fail,\u201d said Joanne Spalding, chief climate counsel of the Sierra Club, one of six environmental groups that challenged the action.According to the Environmental Defense Fund, another of the challengers, the regulation affects 18,000 oil and gas wells built or modified since September 2015. Suspending the rule, it said, could result in the release of up to 17,000 tons of methane pollution, 4,700 tons of smog-forming volatile organic compounds and 362,000 pounds of benzene and other air pollutants.Federal law mandates \u201cthat agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance,\u201d the D.C. Circuit said, citing a 2015 Supreme Court decision. The appeals court noted that its own 1992 precedent explained that \u201can agency issuing a legislative rule is itself bound by the rule until that rule is amended or revoked\u201d and \u201cmay not alter [it] without notice and comment.\u201dThe court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s claim that the EPA held \u201cinherent authority\u201d to suspend the rule.The panel also dismissed EPA and industry arguments that the final rule published in 2016 differed significantly from the initial proposal, and that therefore the Obama administration had denied oil and gas producers their opportunity to comment during the rule-making process.The Trump EPA sought to halt several aspects of the Obama rule, including the decision to regulate low-production wells; the requirement that a professional engineer certify proper design of vent systems; the grounds for exempting pneumatic pumps from regulation; and an alternative method of proving compliance.\u201cThe administrative record\u2026makes clear that industry groups had ample opportunity to comment on all four issues on which EPA granted reconsideration, and indeed, that in several instances the agency incorporated those comments directly into the final rule,\u201d the appeals court found. The court said the EPA action was \u201carbitrary, capricious\u201d and \u201cin excess of\u201d its legal authority.\u201dThe unsigned decision carried the votes of Judges David Tatel and Robert Wilkins. In dissent, Judge Janice Rogers Brown argued that the court lacked authority to review Mr. Pruitt\u2019s decision to suspend the rule while the review was under way.Appeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'EPA Push on Emissions Standards Blocked.'", "news_time": "2017-07-03 20:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/court-blocks-epa-effort-to-loosen-obama-era-emissions-standards-1499126474", "news_title": "Court Blocks EPA Effort to Loosen Obama-Era Emissions Standards", "keywords": "climate change,emissions,environmental regulations,epa,methane,natural gas,pollution,Environmental Protection Agency,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,standards,standardization,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "The leader of Illinois\u2019s Senate confirmed the chamber will vote Tuesday on Democratic revenue and spending measures that could become the state\u2019s first budget in more than two years.The bills, which cleared the House on Sunday, fund a more than $36 billion spending plan with a roughly $5 billion income tax increase. The state brings in roughly $32 billion a year.Republican Gov.       Bruce Rauner       has threatened to veto the tax increase in the budget package, but Democrats, with some help from Republicans, might be able to override the veto.Democratic Senate President John Cullerton said Monday it would be difficult to pass the tax increase without some Republican support, even though his party holds a supermajority in the chamber.Illinois entered its third fiscal year without a budget on July 1. The state\u2019s record-breaking impasse, which has racked up $14.6 billion in unpaid bills, is the result of a political standoff between Mr. Rauner, elected in November 2014, and House Speaker Michael Madigan, a Chicago Democrat who has held the office for more than three decades.Two Wall Street bond houses Monday lauded the General Assembly\u2019s progress in passing a budget out of the House Sunday, but warned the state\u2019s credit rating is still precariously close to junk status.Democratic Rep. Greg Harris, Mr. Madigan\u2019s top lieutenant in budget negotiations, authored the bills now before the Senate.The revenue bill, the more contentious piece of the budget, increases the state\u2019s personal income-tax rate from 3.75% to 4.95% and the corporate income-tax rate from 5.25% to 7%. The spending bill includes a 5% cut to government agencies and reduces state higher education funding by 10%.The proposed revenue measure is largely in line with a similar Republican plan to raise state funds, but Mr. Rauner favors only a temporary increase in income taxes\u2014not the permanent hike outlined in the legislature\u2019s plan. He is also seeking concessions including a property tax freeze and a revamp of the state\u2019s worker compensation system.Mr. Rauner released a video via Twitter Monday repeating his threat from the day before to veto the tax increase if it gains approval from the Senate. Mr. Madigan said Monday he would fight to override the governor\u2019s veto in the House if the governor follows through on that pledge.The tax increase earned 72 votes in the House Sunday, surpassing the 3/5ths-majority threshold necessary to reverse a veto. Mr. Cullerton would need 36 votes to override a gubernatorial veto in the Senate, and there are 37 Democrats in that chamber.Mr. Cullerton and Mr. Madigan emerged from a meeting Monday afternoon saying Republican minority leaders from both chambers did not appear at the day\u2019s negotiations. Fifteen Republicans voted to support the tax increase in the House Sunday.One of those Republicans, Assistant House Minority Leader Chad Hays, announced Monday he will not seek re-election.\u201cThe functionality of the Illinois General Assembly today is simply untenable and counterproductive,\u201d Mr. Hays said. \u201cLegislators who care deeply and have the courage of their convictions and the intestinal fortitude to do what is right regardless of consequences are increasingly silenced.

Chris Christie       under escalating criticism for his state\u2019s three-day government shutdown, Democratic lawmakers struggled Monday to work out a deal to end the impasse.The Republican governor shut down state government after lawmakers missed Friday\u2019s deadline to pass a balanced budget. The move closed state parks and beaches over the Fourth of July weekend and furloughed more than 30,000 state workers. State courts and many administrative state agencies were closed but essential workers, including the state police, remained on duty.Democratic lawmakers offered varying degrees of optimism Monday afternoon about progress on a deal to end a dispute with Mr. Christie over a bill that would give the state more control over New Jersey\u2019s largest insurer. That is the main sticking point.\u201cWe\u2019re making progress,\u201d Assembly Speaker       Vincent Prieto       said.But another legislator involved in the meetings, Democratic Sen.       Joe Vitale,        said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re any closer. I\u2019d say that we\u2019re not farther apart.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Christie drew national attention and much criticism after the Star-Ledger, one of New Jersey\u2019s largest daily newspapers, photographed him on Sunday sitting with family and friends on an otherwise empty beach at Island Beach State Park. The park, which houses a state-owned residence used by the governor, was closed to the public during the shutdown.Mr. Christie\u2019s top deputy, Lt. Gov.       Kim Guadagno,        delivered her harshest criticism to date of her boss, saying in a             Facebook                   post Monday that the photos were \u201cbeyond words\u201d and calling for an end to the shutdown.\u201cIf I were governor, I sure wouldn\u2019t be sitting on the beach if taxpayers didn\u2019t have access to state beaches,\u201d said Ms. Guadagno, who is running as the Republican nominee to succeed Mr. Christie.The governor, who previously had told reporters he planned to spend the weekend at the closed park, pushed back against the criticism on Monday in morning television interviews.\u201cThey actually caught a politician being where he was going to be with the people he said he was going to be with,\u201d Mr. Christie said in an interview with Fox 5 New York.The shutdown stems from a dispute between Mr. Christie and Democratic lawmakers over legislation that would give the state broader oversight and more financial control of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state\u2019s largest insurer.Mr. Prieto, a Democrat, has refused to put the legislation up for a vote in his chamber. Without it, Mr. Christie said, he would use his line-item veto power to slash much of the more than $300 million in additional spending, for schools and social services, that Democrats have added to his original budget proposal.On Wednesday, Horizon Chief Executive       Robert Marino       met privately with lawmakers in Trenton. \u201cHorizon didn\u2019t ask to be in the middle of this situation but I do appreciate the opportunity to have met with them and expressed my concerns with the bill,\u201d he said afterward.The not-for-profit insurer has strongly opposed the proposed legislative intervention, which executives said would make it less competitive and possibly force them to raise premiums.Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 18:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chris-christie-feels-the-heat-for-beach-weekend-as-budget-shutdown-continues-1499120498", "news_title": "Chris Christie Feels the Heat Over Beach Weekend as Budget Shutdown Continues", "keywords": " budget impasse,new jersey shutdown,Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey,Chris Christie,Kim Guadagno,Vincent Prieto,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "BRIDGEWATER, N.J.\u2014President       Donald Trump       offered assistance for a gravely ill British boy at the center of a legal and moral fight but didn\u2019t say what form that would take, tweeting Monday that \u201cif we can help\u2026we would be delighted to do so.\u201dThe parents of 11-month-old Charlie Gard have battled his doctors in British and European courts for months over continuing life support for the brain-damaged baby.

All our thoughts are with Charlie and with his family, \u201d a spokesman for Prime Minister       Theresa May       said Monday.The case has focused attention on the role of British and European courts in making end-of-life decisions for very young children.Britain\u2019s Supreme Court decided last month that prolonging Charlie\u2019s life would be \u201cnot in his best interests.\u201d His parents asked the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ruling; the court last week said the case raised \u201csensitive moral and ethical issues\u201d but declined to intervene.The U.S.-based physician, whose identity was shielded, testified in court over the experimental therapy. The treatment hasn\u2019t been tested on people or animals with Charlie\u2019s condition.The British hospital treating the boy, Great Ormond Street Hospital, argued in court that Charlie\u2019s health had deteriorated to the point that taking the child to the U.S. for treatment would be futile.The case is unusual in pitting doctors against parents who want to continue medical intervention; in the U.K., it is more typical that parents who refuse a treatment for their child on moral or religious grounds end up in court.The issues in the case have also posed a test to the Catholic Church, which contends that it is immoral to deliberately end a life, but also that Catholic bioethics must recognize the limits of medicine. In a recent statement,       Pope Francis       said the baby\u2019s parents should be allowed to \u201caccompany and treat their child until the end.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s tweet appeared to nod to some of those sensitivities when he wrote that his offer was \u201cas per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope.\u201d The tweet used the hashtag associated with the parents\u2019 social media campaign. The president was spending a long weekend at his golf club in Bedminster ahead of the Fourth of July holiday.In another development Monday, the Vatican children\u2019s hospital, Bambino Ges\u00f9, offered to provide care for Charlie. The hospital\u2019s president, Mariella Enoc, stressed that the Vatican hospital wasn\u2019t able to offer any treatments beyond what were available in London. \u201cWhat we can do is welcome the child and his parents, as the Holy Father invited us to do,\u201d she said.She said her staff had contacted Great Ormond Street Hospital on Monday afternoon to offer its services, but by Monday evening had still hadn\u2019t received a response.A spokesman for Great Ormond Street Hospital said there had been \u201cno change in Charlie\u2019s status\u201d but he couldn\u2019t comment further on the baby\u2019s treatment.When asked about the offer from Bambino Ges\u00f9, the spokesman said the London hospital had nothing further to add beyond its previous statement issued Friday in which it said \u201ctogether with Charlie\u2019s parents we are putting plans in place for his care and to give them more time together as a family.\u201dThe parents took the statements from Mr. Trump and Pope Francis as signs of support for their position. The website charliesfight.org was updated Monday with pictures of the recent tweets by the pope and the president, accompanied by the text: \u201cTwo of the most powerful men in the world want to give Charlie Gard his chance.\u201dLawyers for the boy\u2019s parents weren\u2019t immediately available for comment on\u00a0Monday.Jay Sekulow,        chief counsel for the conservative American Center for Law and Justice and part of Mr. Trump\u2019s private legal team, tweeted his support for the parents and said he has contacted his organization\u2019s office in Strasbourg, France, to help the parents\u2019 legal case.An ACLJ spokesman said the European office was exploring what legal options were available, and that Mr. Sekulow\u2019s actions were tied to his position with the ACLJ, not his work for Mr. Trump.\u2014Joanna Sugden and Jason Douglas in London and Francis X.

Representatives for Fox Sports declined to elaborate on the staff email, and Mr. Shanks didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment.Mr. Horowitz retained well-known entertainment industry lawyer Patricia Glaser, who said the way Fox Sports has treated him is \u201cappalling.\u201d\u201cAt no point in his tenure was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an inability to adhere to professional conduct,\u201d Ms. Glaser said. \u201cJamie was hired by Fox to do a job that until today he has performed in an exemplary fashion. Any slanderous accusations to the contrary will be vigorously defended.\u201dDaniel Petrocelli,        a lawyer with of O\u2019Melveny & Myers representing Fox Sports, responded to Ms. Glaser, saying: \u201cMr. Horowitz\u2019s termination was fully warranted and his lawyer\u2019s accusations are ill-informed and misguided.\u201dThe harassment probe at Fox Sports comes in the wake of an effort by parent company 21st Century Fox to crack down on inappropriate office behavior after a year that has seen numerous lawsuits and allegations of sexual harassment and racial discrimination at Fox News. 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner         News Corp               share common ownership.Mr. Horowitz joined Fox Sports just over two years ago after a long run at             Walt Disney Co.\u2019s       ESPN and a much shorter stint running NBC\u2019s morning news program \u201cToday.\u201dAt Fox Sports, Mr. Horowitz was tasked with boosting the performance of its cable network Fox Sports 1, which was launched in August 2013 to take on ESPN. The network has struggled to develop signature programming that will keep viewers tuned in when there isn\u2019t a sports event on.Among the moves Mr. Horowitz made was to bring some well-known names over from ESPN including Skip Bayless and Colin Cowherd. In a 2016 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Horowitz said he wanted to borrow a page from Fox News and focus on big personalities to discuss and debate the news of the day rather than just be another place to get highlights.Mr. Horowitz was also in charge of digital operations at Fox Sports and has clashed with longtime staffers there over the future direction of the unit, people familiar with the matter said. Last month, Fox Sports let go members of its writing and editing staff there to focus more on video.In a memo explaining the shift in strategy at the time, Mr. Horowitz wrote, \u201cour advertising partners want to be presented alongside premium video across all screens, so we will now focus on delivering high quality sports video content to support their efforts.\u201dMr. Shanks said in his memo to staff that until a replacement is named for Mr. Horowitz, he will handle oversight of programming, marketing and digital operations.Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-sports-fires-head-of-programming-1499113320", "news_title": "Fox Sports Fires Head of Programming ", "keywords": "digital,fox sports,fs1,probe,programming,sexual harrassment,video,21st Century Fox,FOX,FOXA,News Corp Cl A,NWSA,corporate crime,legal action,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,harassment,television,film production,cinema film production,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Dave McClure       has resigned from 500 Startups amid an admission he had made sexual advances toward multiple women in work situations, a spokeswoman for the seed investment group said.Mr. McClure has relinquished his general partner position at all funds and entities managed by 500 Startups, which he launched in 2010. The moves cap a rapid fall for Mr. McClure and come just days after 500 Startups announced a new leadership structure in which he was demoted to general partner and replaced as chief executive by his co-founder, Christine Tsai.Mr. McClure is known in Silicon Valley as a brash and outspoken tech industry leader.

The decision dealt a blow to gun-rights supporters who pressed for the revisions and heartened critics who said the changes made it more difficult to convict people of violent crimes.In the Florida legislative session earlier this year, the Republican-led House and Senate updated the 2005 \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, one of the earliest in the U.S. to expand the concept of self-defense. That measure increased protections for people who use deadly force in response to perceived threats, even when they have the opportunity to flee.The new changes, signed into law by Republican Gov.       Rick Scott       in June, enhanced those protections. They shifted the burden in pretrial \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearings from defendants, who until then had to prove they were entitled to immunity under the law, to prosecutors, who now have to prove defendants aren\u2019t entitled to such immunity. They also raised the standard of proof that prosecutors need to meet to \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201dIn his ruling\u00a0Monday, Circuit Judge       Milton Hirsch       in Miami found that the Legislature overstepped its authority in making the alterations. He said that because the changes were procedural rather than substantive, they could only be made by the Florida Supreme Court, which spelled out how pretrial \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearings should occur in a 2015 decision.The ruling \u201ctotally derails these changes to \u2018stand your ground,\u2019 \u201d said Tamara Lave, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. If the decision is appealed, the matter could eventually end up before the Florida Supreme Court, she said.A spokeswoman for Gov. Scott said his office was reviewing the judge\u2019s ruling. Two Republican legislators who supported the changes didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\u201cStand your ground\u201d laws drew national attention following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager, in Sanford, Fla., in 2012. Florida\u2019s law played a role in authorities\u2019 decision initially not to arrest       George Zimmerman,        the neighborhood-watch volunteer who killed him.Florida is one of about two dozen states in the U.S. with versions of \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws backed by the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups. Supporters of the measures say they help people protect themselves from violent attacks, while opponents say they encourage vigilantism.A study published last year in JAMA Internal Medicine\u00a0found that the law in Florida was associated with a sharp increase in killings\u00a0in the state, though some researchers questioned the findings.Opponents of the law hailed Judge Hirsch\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is a notable setback in the dangerous expansion of \u2018stand your ground\u2019 laws,\u201d said       Lucy McBath,        faith and outreach leader for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, whose son was shot and killed in a Florida parking lot in a dispute over loud music.The NRA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 16:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/florida-judge-rules-stand-your-ground-law-is-unconstitutional-1499113172", "news_title": "Florida Judge Rules Changes to \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 Law Are Unconstitutional ", "keywords": "florida,florida judge,nra,self-defense law,stand your ground,political,general news,society,community,gun control,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues"}, {"content": "Ten pedestrians were injured, some seriously, after a taxi cab on Monday drove into a group of people standing near Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, according to Massachusetts State Police.Police said the 1:40 p.m. crash at a \u201ccab pool\u201d in East Boston didn\u2019t appear to be related to terrorism. \u201cAt this preliminary point in the investigation, there is no information that suggests the crash was intentional,\u201d state police said in a statement.

Brent hasn\u2019t experienced such a winning streak since 2012.On Monday, U.S. crude futures settled up $1.03, or 2.24%, at $47.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 91 cents, or 1.87%, to $49.68 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.The move higher is a sharp turnaround from last month, when U.S. crude prices hit a 10-month low and Brent fell to its lowest level since November.Even with the recent gains, oil prices are still down more than 12% this year. Growth in U.S. output has been hampering efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce global oil inventories.But fresh U.S. data late last week raised some investors\u2019 hopes that the resurgence of U.S. crude production may not be as unstoppable as it once seemed.\u201cThe idea that U.S. output could grow very fast below $50 a barrel turned out to be a little bit overblown,\u201d said       Paul Horsnell,        head of commodities research at             Standard Chartered.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Friday that U.S. oil production fell by 24,000 barrels a day in April, contrary to what many expected based on preliminary weekly figures. The number of oil rigs at work in the U.S. posted its first weekly decline since January on Friday, according to oil-field services firm         Baker Hughes,       which has now combined withGeneral Electric Co.\u2019s       energy business.Even though the decline was a small one\u2014the rig count ticked down by just two last week\u2014some see the drop as a sign that shale producers won\u2019t be able to keep up the relentless pace of drilling at prices below $45 a barrel.\u201cIf prices stay low, we\u2019re going to see capex cuts. We\u2019re going to start dropping rigs,\u201d said       Rob Thummel,        managing director for Tortoise Capital Advisors.Not everyone believes that shale producers are really slowing down. Much of the production decline in April came from the Gulf of Mexico, where maintenance work weighed on output.\u201cI think there\u2019s a decent production overhang building,\u201d said       Bill Herbert,        an analyst at Piper Jaffray, pointing to a growing backlog of wells that have been drilled but not yet tapped. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much capital being invested. I don\u2019t see any evidence of a more constrained U.S. production outlook. In fact, I suspect it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d he said.And the U.S. isn\u2019t the only challenge to OPEC\u2019s efforts to work off a supply glut that has weighed on the market for three years. Output is rising in Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members that aren\u2019t bound by output quotas.\u201cAt current output levels, OPEC will not succeed in eliminating the inventory overhang completely by year\u2019s end,\u201d analysts at             Commerzbank                   said. \u201cThe market ignored this.\u201dSome say the recent rally has been more technically driven than a sign of a tectonic shift. Trading has been light ahead of the July 4 holiday in the U.S. Some analysts said the rally was likely driven more by investors closing out bets on falling prices than by new bets on rising prices.Greg Sharenow,        portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., said the extreme negative sentiment that took hold of the oil market is taking a breather, but that prices are still likely to be range-bound in the near future.\u201cIt\u2019s grinding away in an improving balance.

TSLA -0.91%       on Monday said production shortfalls hindered sales during the second quarter, hours after Chief Executive       Elon Musk       signaled an even tighter timetable for the auto maker\u2019s ambitious plans to produce its new Model 3 sedans.The Silicon Valley auto maker said it sold about 22,000 Model S and Model X sport-utility vehicles during the period ended in June, up about 53% from a year earlier.With 47,100 vehicles delivered in the first half, Tesla just met its goal of delivering 47,000 to 50,000 vehicles. But the quarterly results were short of the average estimate of 23,655 deliveries, according to four analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.Tesla said sales could have been stronger if not for a \u201csevere production shortfall\u201d of battery packs, which until early June caused production to average about 40% below demand. \u201cOnce this was resolved, June orders and deliveries were strong, ranking as one of the best in Tesla history,\u201d the company said in a statement.The company said it expects to deliver more Model S and Model X vehicles in the second half than in the first six months, \u201cprovided global economic conditions do not worsen considerably.\u201dTesla\u2019s jump in second-quarter sales bucks the trend among auto makers such as             General Motors Co.      ,             Ford Motor Co.       and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which earlier Monday reported steep sales declines in June compared with a year ago.Tesla is far smaller than those auto makers by sales, but it aims to become more of a mainstream player with the rollout of its newest car, the Model 3, which at $35,000 is far less expensive than its two existing models and is central to the company\u2019s plans to sharply increase total sales.On Sunday night Pacific time, Mr. Musk tweeted that he aims to have 30 vehicles ready to hand over to customers on July 28, followed by 100 cars in August and 1,500 in September.That initial plan appears slower than one Mr. Musk laid out in February,  when he revealed he was pushing suppliers to be ready for a weekly run rate of 1,000 vehicles in July to 2,000 in August and 4,000 in September.However, Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, sent shortly after 11 p.m. PDT Sunday, said Tesla plans to hit a rate of 20,000 Model 3s a month in December, in line with his previous pledge of having 5,000 vehicles a week by year\u2019s end.In February, Mr. Musk suggested the targets were set for suppliers, knowing they could slip. \u201cThese are parts orders and the parts need to arrive, then you can turn into a car and the car needs to be delivered to customers,\u201d he said in February on an earnings conference call. \u201cNone of these things occur instantaneously.\u201d\u201cThis is definitely scaling back,\u201d said       Rebecca Lindland,        an analyst for the automotive researcher Kelley Blue Book.

GM 0.11%      ,             Ford Motor Co.        F 0.68%       and             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU 0.67%       NV reported steep monthly sales declines compared with the same period in 2016. While retail demand is losing steam, each of Detroit\u2019s players also reported significant reductions in deliveries to daily-rental companies, long the Motor City\u2019s biggest customers.Sales to Enterprise Holdings Inc.\u2019s Enterprise Rent-A-Car or             Hertz Global Holdings Inc.        HTZ 8.81%       traditionally were a way for auto makers to keep factories rolling even as dealership traffic slowed. But an excess of that business has dented profits, auto makers say, and soiled brand reputation.The move away from rental sales reinforces a newfound discipline for domestic players that have been riding a seven-year growth streak since GM and Chrysler sought bankruptcy protection in 2009. The Detroit 3 reported tens of billions in profits during that span, bolstered by tailwinds from falling gas prices and surging demand for profit-rich trucks and SUVs.Overall industry demand softened over the first half of 2017, however, falling about 2% through six months and 3% in June, according to Autodata. The development ushers in an expected plateau for auto sales, an important driver for the broader U.S. economy.The fleet-sales pullback is having a disproportionate impact on wider volumes. Sales to retail customers at dealerships are down less than 1% over the first six months of the year, but sales to nonretail customers such as government fleets, commercial buyers and rental-car companies are off 7.8%, according to J.D. Power.A rental-car reduction \u201cis not something normally seen\u201d at the start of a cyclical sales downturn, R.W. Baird analyst       David Leiker       said in a research note. The reversal of that trend could ease concerns that profit margins will erode as auto makers chase less lucrative business or resort to price wars.Even as auto makers ramp up incentive spending to improve dealer traffic, transaction prices are rising as cars are loaded with more safety gear and connectivity features. A consumer shift away from sedans and toward pricier sport-utility vehicles also aided the trend.Edmunds.com reported that the average monthly payment on a car or truck has soared above $500, forcing buyers to stretch more than ever to obtain a new set of wheels. The firm estimates the average auto-loan length reached a record 69.3 months in June, with the average amount of financing reaching $30,945, up $631 from May.GM\u2019s sales fell 5% to 243,155 vehicles in June, while Ford\u2019s sales totaled 227,979 vehicles, down 5.1%. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sales slumped 7% to 187,348 vehicles.Japan\u2019s top sellers fared better during the period.Honda Motor Co.       reported a 1% increase compared with the previous June, with 139,793 vehicles sold, aided by gains at its Acura luxury division, while             Nissan Motor Co.       sold 143,328 vehicles, or 2% more than the prior year, as it ramps up its reliance on trucks.             Toyota Motor Corp.       notched a 2.1% gain, with 202,376 vehicles sold.Certain Asian auto makers, including Korea\u2019s             Hyundai Motor,       have fueled sales with rental-car sales. At Nissan, rental sales surged 37% in 2016 and were up 9% this year through May, making Nissan the only major auto maker to boost rental deliveries, according to data from Bobit Business Media, a publisher of trade magazines.Detroit\u2019s sales declines, meanwhile, are fueled by lower fleet sales.GM sold 15% fewer cars to rental fleets in the first five months of the year, compared with a year earlier. The auto maker said Monday that when June figures were added, the decline came to 21%. Rentals accounted for 8% of total sales in the first half, compared with 9% in the first five months and less than half the level from a few years ago.Ford said rentals accounted for 13.2% of overall sales in June, down from 15% for the first five months of the year and from 15.6% in June 2016.\u201cWe try to keep our overall daily rentals within a reasonable number,\u201d Ford\u2019s U.S. sales chief,       Mark LaNeve,        said Monday. Rental-car companies are \u201cbecoming a little more cautious given the uncertainty in residual values,\u201d he added. Rental-car companies keep a close eye on the resale value of cars and trucks; a glut in used cars can lead to unexpected lossesFiat Chrysler\u2019s fleet sales sank 15% in June, with rental deliveries at its flagship Jeep brand down by almost half.Enterprise, one of the leading car-rental firms, reduced its vehicle purchases in the first half of the year compared with 2016, said       Kurt Kohler,        a senior executive in charge of the rental company\u2019s fleet acquisition. He said signs of declining used-vehicle prices heading into the year prompted Enterprise to narrow its shopping list.\u201cThe market started to move on us, so we pulled back a bit,\u201d Mr. Kohler said. \u201cThe car segment already had been declining, but we also saw pricing coming down on SUVs and trucks. That affected how much we wanted to buy.\u201dAlan Batey,        president of GM\u2019s North America region, said an unexpectedly severe downturn in consumer demand for sedans has made it more difficult to ease rental sales, because the rental business would typically help make up the shortfall. \u201cIt has tested our commitment\u201d to the strategy, he said, forcing GM to make \u201ctough decisions\u201d to reduce passenger-car production this year, which led to thousands of layoffs at its factories.Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com and Adrienne Roberts at Adrienne.Roberts@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 16:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-car-sales-fall-in-june-1499088635", "news_title": "U.S. Auto Sales Fall as Fewer Vehicles Go to Rental Chains ", "keywords": "auto sales,car sale decline,car sales,cars and trucks,detroit,fleet sales,june car sales,rental cars,truck sales,Enterprise Holdings,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,FCA.MI,FCAU,Ford Motor,F,General Motors,GM,Hertz Global Holdings,HTZ,Kurt Kohler,Alan Batey,Mark LaNeve,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,rental,leasing services,passenger car rental,leasing,automotive,automobile rental,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "An investment group led by Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC is nearing a deal to buy             Monogram Residential Trust Inc.,        MORE 0.17%       according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would boost Greystar\u2019s presence in the high-end apartment market.Greystar and some of its partners are planning to pay $12 a share in cash for Monogram, the people said. A deal between the two apartment owners could be announced as soon as Wednesday, the people said, and would value Monogram at over $2 billion. With debt, the company would be valued at $3.1 billion, the people said.Monogram closed Monday trading at $9.80 a share, giving it a market value of about $1.64 billion. The deal price would be a 22% premium to Monday\u2019s close.The Wall Street Journal reported in September that the Plano, Texas-based real-estate investment trust was exploring a sale and sounding out buyers.Monogram\u2019s portfolio includes investments in 49 high-end apartment communities in 10 states including California and Florida. The portfolio has nearly 14,000 apartment units, according to the company\u2019s website. Many of Monogram\u2019s properties are located in coastal areas such as San Francisco and Miami.Last March, activist hedge fund Snow Park Capital Partners called for Monogram to explore strategic alternatives including a sale of the company, amid unrest on its board and a wave of real-estate transactions. It is unclear whether Snow Park still owns Monogram stock.Greystar, based in Charleston, S.C., is the largest apartment operator in the U.S., according to the company\u2019s website. It manages over 400,000 units in more than 160 global markets. It also has an institutional investment management platform. The company is privately held and was founded in 1993 by chairman and Chief Executive Officer       Bob Faith.       Buying Monogram would give the apartment operator more of a presence in the higher-end section of the apartment market.Monogram has been embroiled in a battle among its board members in recent years.Last March, Monogram issued a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission highlighting its board turmoil by noting that a majority of its directors had formed an executive committee that excluded the two directors from Behringer Investments, the Texas firm that originally sponsored Monogram. The board cited \u201cconflicts of interests\u201d of Behringer\u2019s board members.At the time, Behringer said that \u201cmaking this controversy public is aiming at both stifling dissenting voices on the board of directors and taking attention from the ongoing litigation over fees.\u201d Behringer sued Monogram in 2015, alleging contract breaches over fees. Monogram denied the charges and countersued.There has been a flurry of recent merger and acquisition activity in the real-estate sector. Year to date, it ranks as the second-busiest sector by volume globally, with more than $185 billion in deal value, according to data provider Dealogic.Last year, two other large apartment owners came together when MAA bought Post Properties Inc. for $3.9 billion.

The change in the leadership structure, announced on Friday, comes as 500 Startups struggles to hit its fundraising targets even as it is still trying to prove its unconventional approach to venture capital. His resignation was announced by the seed investment group on Monday.In Silicon Valley, Mr. McClure has built a reputation for speaking his mind \u2014often in profane and bombastic ways. Once again that style was on display on Saturday in making his apology, in which he admitted to making advances toward multiple women in work situations.\u201cBy now you may have heard I f----ed up, and people are calling me a creep,\u201d he wrote.In her announcement about the management changes, Ms. Tsai said 500 Startups had overhauled its leadership structure \u201ca few months ago.\u201d There were no public signals pointing to the leadership shift until late Friday, just hours after a             New York Times                   story detailed some allegations about Mr. McClure\u2019s behavior toward women.A spokeswoman for 500 Startups hasn\u2019t responded to questions from The Wall Street Journal about the timing of the leadership overhaul. The firm hasn\u2019t responded to requests for an interview with Ms. Tsai since the announcement.In a June 8 interview with The Journal, Ms. Tsai talked about how she and Mr. McClure shared management and oversight of 500 Startups, which is based in Mountain View, Calif.Ms. Tsai said then that she was planning to take on more of an external role, to show founders and limited partners other sides of the organization.\u201cI think a lot of folks know Dave as the face because he\u2019s of course more visible,\u201d Ms. Tsai said at the time, adding she was planning to speak publicly more because it was important to show other sides of 500 Startups.For his part in an early June interview, Mr. McClure called their partnership a \u201csort of strange marriage.\u201d He said he acts \u201ccrazy sometimes\u201d while Ms. Tsai brings a \u201cstabilizing\u201d personality to the business. Despite their different styles, the two said they have felt comfortable making decisions together.Previously Ms. Tsai was a product marketing manager at YouTube and then served as the lead for Google I/O, the company\u2019s largest developer event of the year.In a regulatory filing about its Canada fund in May, 500 Startups listed Mr. McClure as an executive officer at the firm.Hunter Walk, a Homebrew general partner and limited partner in 500 Startups\u2019 first fund, said he wasn\u2019t notified of the leadership change until after the New York Times published its report about Mr. McClure\u2019s misconduct.Mr. McClure has sought to prove 500\u2019s strategy as a venture firm that can stretch to a much larger scale by investing in more than 1,500 companies around the world. Unlike most venture firms that employ a limited support staff, 500 Startups has about 150 employees world-wide. Rather than relying on one massive outcome to return the whole fund, 500 Startups bets that it can have multiple large exits if it invests in more companies.As the firm embarks on a new leadership structure, in the background it has struggled to hit its fundraising targets.500 Startups had targeted $200 million for its fourth core fund, according to a regulatory filing in September 2015. In a filing a year later, 500 Startups had lowered its target for that fund to $150 million. 500 Startups has only reported raising $49.6 million toward that fund, according to a filing last September.A spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the fund.Its third core fund closed 15% below its original target at $85 million, after more than a year-and-a-half of bumpy fundraising, Mr. McClure said in September 2015. At the time, he said the firm had struggled to attract large U.S. limited partners, such as pension funds and endowments.Additionally 500 Startups has faced challenges with its investment vehicles abroad. The Journal reported in January that the firm\u2019s Nordic fundraising is on hold and that it scrapped plans to launch a Russia fund. A spokeswoman said Sunday its India fund is on hold and the firm is using its core fund to invest in that region.Meantime Ms. Tsai issued a separate apology on Sunday to the Australian startup community over its handling of an partnership launch. LaunchVic said it was putting 500 Startups \u201con notice\u201d after Mr. McClure was allowed to represent the firm two weeks ago in Australia. LaunchVic, a startup initiative for the state of Victoria, said it is an investor in 500 Startups and called it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that 500 Startups didn\u2019t disclose Mr. McClure\u2019s misconduct earlier.500 Startups is planning a conference call with limited partners on Thursday to discuss its leadership changes.\u201cThe actions we took weren\u2019t easy,\u201d Ms. Tsai wrote in her blog post on Friday, \u201cbut it was critical to us that we uphold our culture and values\u2014even if it meant asking my co-founder to step aside in order for 500 to grow stronger.\u201dWrite to Cat Zakrzewski at cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 15:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-boss-at-500-startups-faces-hurdles-on-fundraising-scandal-1499081400", "news_title": "New Boss at 500 Startups Faces Hurdles on Fundraising, Scandal", "keywords": "management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management"}, {"content": "The U.S. government bond market on Monday extended last week\u2019s selloff, sending the yield on the two-year Treasury note to the highest level in more than eight years.The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose above 2.3% and settled at the highest level since May 11. Yields rise as bond prices fall.Demand for haven bonds pulled back after a report showed that U.S. manufacturing activity expanded last month at the fastest pace in nearly three years.

The two-year yield has more than doubled the level it traded at a year ago as the Fed has raised short-term interest rates three times since last December.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.352%, compared with 2.298% Friday.The U.S. bond market closed at 2 p.m. Monday and remains shut on Tuesday in observance of Independence Day. Some traders said trading was thinner than usual before the holiday, which may have exaggerated part of the bond price slides.The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a fresh intraday record on Monday, a sign of improved appetite for riskier assets.U.S. bank shares were among the winners on Monday, boosted partly by a rise in the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield premium relative to that on the two-year note.The premium was 0.938 percentage point Monday, the highest since May 26. A higher premium is known as a steepening yield curve, a trend that tends to be good for banks, which borrow short-term money and lend out cash longer term. The wider the yield spread, the stronger the profit margin outlook for banks.A steepening curve also would be welcome by Fed policy makers because it is typically interpreted as a sign of rising optimism toward stronger growth and higher inflation. A falling premium is known as a flattening yield curve which tends to flag worrisome signals about growth. The curve had flattened earlier this year and remains close to the flattest level since 2007.Manufacturing data released Monday from China, the eurozone and the U.S. pointed to an improving global economic outlook and supported some central bankers\u2019 view to normalize their interest-rate policy.A gauge of manufacturing in China beat market expectations and a similar gauge in the eurozone reached the highest level since 2011. In the U.S., the monthly manufacturing reading from the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May, the highest level since August 2014.Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield rose by 0.15 percentage point, though it is still below the 2.446% traded at the end of last year.Large and unconventional monetary stimulus via asset purchases by the ECB and the Bank of Japan have played a big factor driving global government bond yields to historically low levels in recent years. Bond investors are concerned that the value of their holdings could fall as central banks reduce their support for the bond markets.\u201cI think the central banks are very cognizant of the fact that they have forced investors into very low yields and they want to do all they can to avoid a sloppy selloff that will create big losses,\u201d said Thomas Roth, executive director in the rates trading group at MUFG Securities Americas Inc.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 15:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bonds-prices-continue-to-slip-1499095851", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Prices Continue to Slip", "keywords": "bond rates,employment,fed tapering,government bonds,haven assets,inflation,interest rates,sahe haven,selloff,sell off,taper tantrum,u.s. treasury bonds,Federal Reserve,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Two Wall Street ratings firms lauded efforts to end Illinois\u2019s fiscal stalemate but warned of consequences if officials can\u2019t agree on a new package of taxes and spending.S&P Global Inc.

The pharmacy\u2019s owner,       Renier Gobea,        is also named as a defendant in the complaint.\u201cMr. Gobea denies the allegations,\u201d said his attorney, Kevin J. Darken.By charging Tricare much higher prices, the pharmacy violated federal regulations that prohibit vendors from charging prices in excess of what they charge the general public, prosecutors claim.\u201cRS Compounding knowingly and routinely charged artificially inflated prices for its creams and gels\u201d from 2012 to 2014, the complaint says. As a result, the U.S. \u201csuffered damages in the form of millions of dollars in unearned Tricare payments\u201d made to the pharmacy, the complaint says.Tricare\u2019s spending on compounded medications, which typically combine multiple generic pharmaceutical ingredients into creams or gels, soared to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2015, triple the amount spent in 2014, according to Defense Department data published in May. The sharp increase was driven in large part by fraudulent schemes that included pharmacies paying kickbacks to physicians and Tricare beneficiaries, prosecutors have alleged in other cases.The Justice Department has reached civil settlements with about two dozen compound pharmacies nationally over the past two years, recovering some $100 million in damages, said       Jason Mehta,        an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida. In addition, the government has brought criminal indictments against dozens of individuals, including pharmacists, doctors and salespeople, related to compounding pharmacy fraud.The suit filed against RS Compounding, which doesn\u2019t allege criminal wrongdoing, \u201creflects a continued and sustained effort to recover [Tricare] losses estimated at nearly $2 billion\u201d from compounding pharmacy fraud, Mr. Mehta said in an interview.The government brought the allegations against RS Compounding and Mr. Gobea under the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era statute created to remedy concerns that military contractors were defrauding the Union Army. The law, which has been amended several times, allows prosecutors to seek triple damages against vendors proved to have defrauded the government.Mr. Gobea allegedly participated in determining the prices charged to Tricare, the complaint says. Mr. Gobea raised his own salary at the company from $20,000 a month to $75,000 a month at the end of 2013, the complaint alleges.By the end of 2014, Mr. Gobea allegedly raised his salary to $120,000 a month.

Not even the cable network itself seems entirely sure. On Sunday morning Mr. Trump tweeted a doctored video of a 2007 appearance he made at a professional wrestling event. The altered video makes it appear as if he is beating up CNN. The network responded not only by condemning the \u201cviolence\u201d but also by claiming that White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u201clied\u201d when she said that Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t \u201cpromoted or encouraged violence.\u201d Yet elsewhere in its statement and in headlines on its website the network has called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet merely \u201cjuvenile.\u201dOf course, kids can be plenty violent, so it seems the network is demanding that Mr. Trump\u2019s latest bizarre social-media message be viewed as an incitement to violence. Let\u2019s consider this episode on CNN\u2019s terms, which requires an examination of the context. The video is from an event called \u201cWrestlemania 23\u201d produced by World Wrestling Entertainment. The drama was billed as the \u201cBattle of the Billionaires\u201d as wrestlers allied with either Mr. Trump or WWE chieftain       Vince McMahon       appeared to brawl inside the ring.The events that CNN has described as violent occurred outside the ring, however. Mr. Trump appeared to be enraged by Mr. McMahon\u2019s taunting of \u201cStone Cold Steve Austin,\u201d who had just been knocked down by a wrestler known as \u201cUmaga.\u201d Mr. Trump threw Mr. McMahon to the ground and appeared to strike him several times in the head. Later, Mr. McMahon appeared to be humiliated as Mr. Trump and his teammates enjoyed shaving Mr. McMahon\u2019s head as a privilege resulting from their victory in the sports-related drama.Outside of CNN, most people believe that professional wrestling features staged events built around simulated rather than actual violence. (For legitimate competition, your humble correspondent is partial to amateur wrestling. While it may be entertaining to watch Donald Trump participating in pro wrestling events before he became America's 45th President, some readers may prefer to see Jim Jordan competing on the mat before he became a leader of the Freedom Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives. Here\u2019s a 1985 clip of Mr. Jordan winning one of his two NCAA championships.)Still, if CNN believes that images from what you might call fake sports news could incite people to commit real violence, the network is not necessarily wrong. Just ask Sgt. Slaughter. Actually, that\u2019s the name of the character played by Robert Remus in an earlier era of pro wrestling. The proudly patriotic \u201cSarge\u201d was a fan favorite as he appeared to battle a heel known as \u201cThe Iron Sheik.\u201d But when Mr. Remus\u2019s character turned against the U.S. and took on a Saddam Hussein look-alike as his manager, fans became angry.Earlier this year, \u201cSgt. Slaughter\u201d recalled for the Orlando Sentinel that he, his family and Mr. McMahon received death threats. Fortunately, no one was harmed, and it seems that even at the time the wrestler and his wife had trouble taking the threats seriously. Reports the Sentinel:The story had a happy ending, according to the Sentinel:For both heroes and villians, WWE has been a lucrative enterprise. Speaking of happy endings, Mr. McMahon and Mr. Trump don\u2019t seem to have any hard feelings resulting from their ringside kerfuffle and in fact Mr. McMahon\u2019s wife and longtime business partner Linda McMahon now runs the U.S. Small Business Administration for President Trump.As for the current drama, let\u2019s hope that it inspires no one to commit real violence. Assuming consumers appreciate it in the spirit of professional wrestling, people can view CNN as either the hero or the heel. Either way, it can be good for CNN, especially on an otherwise slow weekend for news.Earlier this year, the             New York Times noted that CNN boss       Jeff Zucker       wasn\u2019t exactly heartbroken to be criticized by the White House.

PrivatBank was nationalized in December and remains at the heart of a political and financial firestorm there.The National Bank of Ukraine, which earlier this month announced that government spending to shore up PrivatBank had reached 5% of gross domestic product, said Sunday the lender needs an additional 38.5 billion Ukraine hryvnia ($1.5 billion) to stay afloat.Ukraine\u2019s banking system has been severely strained by the country\u2019s continuing conflict with Russian-backed separatists. With international support, the National Bank has attempted to overhaul the country\u2019s banking sector, relying on billions of dollars of loans from the International Monetary Fund.The National Bank has shut down more than 80 banks in the past two years, including Ukraine\u2019s second-largest private lender, Delta Bank. But PrivatBank, which accounts for one-third of all individual deposits in the country, plays an outsize role in Ukrainian politics and has managed to skirt reforms.PrivatBank was controlled by tycoon       Ihor Kolomoisky,        who bankrolled armed formations supporting the Ukrainian military in its fight against Russia-backed separatists and who owns one of Ukraine\u2019s most popular television stations. Nearly all of PrivatBank\u2019s corporate loans were made to companies tied to its shareholders, according to a 2016 analysis by PwC rival Ernst & Young LLP.PwC audited PrivatBank\u2019s finances from the mid-1990s until 2015. In a statement Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s central bank raised questions about PwC\u2019s work, saying it has the power to revoke a firm\u2019s eligibility to conduct bank audits if the quality of those audits is judged to be subpar.\u201c[The National Bank of Ukraine] will consider the quality of the audit performed by PwC and other accounting firms in accordance with established procedures,\u201d the statement read.PwC says its 2015 audit opinion included a qualification regarding the bank\u2019s related-party transactions, and the Big Four accounting firm says it would examine options for reversing any decision revoking its eligibility to work in Ukraine.\u201cPwC remains fully committed to the Ukrainian market and to further constructive dialogue with the [National Bank of Ukraine] in respect of this matter,\u201d a spokesman for PwC said in a statement.The possibility of banning PwC from bank auditing work in Ukraine will go before the National Bank\u2019s Audit Committee this week.News of the possible ban in Ukraine comes as the U.K.\u2019s accounting watchdog said it has launched an investigation into PwC over its audits of BT Italia. The U.K. Financial Reporting Council said last week that it has opened a probe into accounting issues at BT Italia, which led to a \u00a3530 million ($686 million) write-down after concerns were raised by a whistleblower.\u201cAudit quality is of paramount importance to the firm,\u201d a spokesman for PwC said in a statement Friday. PwC said it would continue to cooperate fully with the U.K. inquiry and would use any insights from the investigation to improve its work.The accounting firm has also faced legal action over its work for             Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA,       a Brazilian company at the center of a large political corruption scandal. In addition, PwC\u2019s Indian affiliates were sanctioned by regulators in 2011 over audit deficiencies that the regulators said enabled Satyam Computer Services Ltd.\u2019s founder and chief executive to conceal a long-running fraud. PwC declined to comment on the actions surrounding Petrobras and Satyam.PwC\u2019s problematic audits haven\u2019t been confined to its work overseas. Last year, PwC settled a $5.5 billion lawsuit charging that it failed to uncover a fraud that led Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, once one of the U.S.\u2019s biggest privately held mortgage companies, to collapse during the global financial crisis. PwC\u2019s lawyers said the accounting firm was deceived by Taylor Bean\u2019s founder, Lee Farkas, who is now serving a 30-year prison sentence for fraud.Earlier this year, PwC settled a $3 billion lawsuit over claims it gave bad accounting advice to MF Global Holdings Ltd., which the brokerage says contributed to its 2011 collapse. The terms of the settlements with Taylor Bean and MF Global weren\u2019t disclosed.Another misstep played out on live television earlier this year when a PwC partner gave a presenter the wrong envelope at the Academy Awards, leading to the announcement of \u201cLa La Land\u201d as the winner of Best Picture instead of the actual winner, \u201cMoonlight.\u201dThe mistake was quickly corrected and the firm has apologized, but the blunder caused world-wide embarrassment and damage to PwC\u2019s reputation. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to keep PwC for its Academy Awards work, though it has added new measures to try to prevent a repeat of the snafu.\u2014Michael Rapoport contributed to this article.Write to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 14:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reeling-from-banking-crisis-ukraine-may-ban-auditor-pwc-1499106200", "news_title": "Reeling From Banking Crisis, Ukraine May Ban Auditor PwC   ", "keywords": "accounting,bankruptcynews,finreg,pricewaterhousecoopers,privatbank,ukrainian bank,PricewaterhouseCoopers,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,banking,commercial banking,consulting,business,consumer services,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Americans are buying fewer cars. Will they buy something else?Pushing steel is getting harder.             General Motors,Ford Motor                   and             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU 0.67%       reported on Monday that their car, pickup and other light vehicle sales were down sharply in June from a year ago. Japan\u2019s top sellers did better, but not enough to make up for Detroit\u2019s woes. At a seasonally adjusted, annual rate, auto makers sold 16.4 million light vehicles last month, according to WardsAuto, capping off the weakest quarter for sales since 2014.Weakening auto sales have often been a prelude to the economy contracting. They began trending lower before the 2007 recession started, and were associated with the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s. The situation probably isn\u2019t so dire now, but unless consumers shift the money they\u2019ve been using to purchase cars to other areas, overall spending could weaken.One common factor in those past downturns was higher gasoline prices, which not only prompted people to forgo car purchases\u2014particular, lower mileage, made-in-America ones\u2014but led them to cut back spending on other areas. With gasoline prices a bit lower than they were a year ago, that isn\u2019t a concern at the moment. With unemployment low and incomes rising, it isn\u2019t as if consumers have lost their ability to spend.The recent decline in car sales stems in part from a drop in deliveries to rental-car companies, tighter lending standards and higher prices. It is also comes after a low-rate induced uptick in sales pricey SUVs and trucks, and as young people show less interest in cars than previous generations.So Americans ought to have more to spend elsewhere, which would be good news for retailers, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses with struggling sales. One hurdle to that, however, is that many people are still on the hook for the car they\u2019re driving. The length of a new-car loan reached a record 69.3 months last month, according to Edmunds.com, with average monthly payments rising above $500. The rising share of new cars that are leased leaves people with more monthly payments to meet, either because they need to lease another car every few years or because they need to borrow money to buy the one they are leasing.The slip in auto sales is also reflective of the more frugal consumer behavior that emerged following the recession. If people are shying away from car purchases they don\u2019t see as strictly necessary, they are probably shying away from other purchases as well.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 14:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-buying-stalls-can-consumers-keep-spending-1499104885", "news_title": "Car Buying Stalls, Can Consumers Keep Spending?

That pressure reflects a risk taken by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), perhaps unavoidably, in deciding to delay a vote on the GOP health-care bill until after lawmakers return to Washington the week of July 10.Most vocal are governors of states that expanded their Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. The bill would phase out that expansion and transform the state-federal safety-net program into one in which the federal government\u2019s share would be capped. In all, the bill would cut $772 billion in funding for the program over a decade.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big deal, because in most cases these states have had bitter battles inside the state legislature and [with the] governor about [Medicaid], and it\u2019s been settled in favor of expansion,\u201d said Stewart Verdery, a former GOP Senate aide and founder of Monument Policy Group, a lobbying and public-affairs firm.For any Republican senator \u201cto blow that up from afar is really dicey,\u201d Mr. Verdery said.In Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who faces a tough re-election fight next year, appeared with GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval at a news conference recently and said he opposes the health bill. Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has said the bill\u2019s opioid-addiction measures don\u2019t go far enough, and he said he has conveyed his worries to the state\u2019s GOP senator, Rob Portman. Arkansas Republican Gov.       Asa Hutchinson       said he has spoken to his state\u2019s GOP senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, almost daily about his concerns with the bill.All Democrats are expected to oppose the measure, which means Mr. McConnell can afford to lose no more than two GOP votes to pass the health bill, with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking a 50-50 tie if necessary. That means Republican leaders must flip at least seven of the nine GOP senators who have already said publicly they oppose the bill, a challenge compounded by the recess.\u201cThe further you get away from this place, the more pushback you\u2019ll get,\u201d Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.), who has said he prefers the Senate bill to the ACA, said in the Capitol last week. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 16% of respondents said the version of the bill passed by the House, which also included deep cuts to Medicaid, was a good idea.A White House official on Sunday said Republicans \u201care getting close\u201d to achieving their goals on health-care policy. The official, Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, said the president is calling members of Congress this weekend to help get the Senate bill across the finish line.He suggested if an overhaul isn\u2019t achievable lawmakers should focus on repealing the ACA and then work on a replacement law. \u201cIf the replacement part is too difficult for Republicans to come together, then let\u2019s go back and take a first step and repeal,\u201d Mr. Short said in a Fox interview.Friday, Mr. McConnell indicated he would stick with the current plan to repeal and replace much of the law in a single vote, a strategy supported by many Senate Republicans.The 50 governors have varying views of the Senate bill, which would roll back many provisions of the ACA in addition to the Medicaid changes. The bill would also cut taxes cumulatively by more than $500 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, including repealing taxes on health industries and high-income households.Some governors agree with Senate GOP leaders the Medicaid program should be trimmed back, freeing up money that could be spent elsewhere or used for tax cuts. But governors in the 31 states that expanded the program generally say the bill\u2019s cuts go too far, and 20 Senate Republicans represent such states. Medicaid, the safety-net program for low-income people and those with disabilities, covers roughly one in five Americans, or more than 70 million people.\u201cI know that they\u2019re trying to save money, and they rightfully should,\u201d said Mr. Hutchinson, whose state expanded Medicaid eligibility. \u201cI just want to be able to also not undo some really significant reform that we\u2019re trying to accomplish in Arkansas.\u201dMr. Hutchinson has advocated the health bill either maintain higher levels of funding or exempt elderly and disabled people from caps on Medicaid spending. Without the extra federal help, he said, he would be forced to end the Medicaid expansion immediately.In Ohio, Mr. Kasich has said some of the tweaks under discussion wouldn\u2019t make up for the amount of the Medicaid cuts. Adding money for opioid treatment would be like \u201cspitting in the ocean,\u201d he said.Alaska\u2019s governor, independent       Bill Walker,        said the state could be \u201csorely damaged\u201d by Medicaid cuts in GOP legislation. Alaska\u2019s two GOP senators,       Lisa Murkowski       and Dan Sullivan, have said the current bill doesn\u2019t do enough to address their state\u2019s high cost of health care. They haven\u2019t said whether they would support the legislation.Some Democratic governors are hoping the bill\u2019s repercussions in their states are enough to dissuade GOP senators from supporting it.\u201cI think the governors are actually going to be a major force in this in helping us get to a good place,\u201d Sen. Tom Carper (D., Del.) said Sunday on NBC. \u201cThey have to live with this stuff on a daily basis.\u201dDemocratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he has told the state\u2019s GOP senator, Cory Gardner, \u201cYou\u2019re going to force me into an impossible decision.\u201d Mr. Gardner hasn\u2019t said whether he supports the Senate bill.Republicans have said they want to give states more flexibility in how they spend federal dollars on Medicaid in hopes they can come up with innovative ways to stretch the money. Some health analysts and lawmakers from both parties say that approach would be overwhelmed by the bill\u2019s steep cuts, which would likely force states to limit eligibility or reduce benefits.\u201cProviding extra flexibility to the governors to design programs which are suited for their particular populations is a good thing,\u201d Louisiana Gov.       John Bel Edwards,        a Democrat, told reporters last week. \u201cBut we cannot pretend that giving me all the flexibility in the world will allow me to provide meaningful coverage to the same people who have it today if you give me half as much money.\u201dOther GOP senators are feeling pressure from the opposite direction. In Maine, GOP Gov. Paul LePage has for years castigated the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion as an irresponsible use of federal funds, and he wrote in a letter to Republican Sen.       Susan Collins       that \u201cwe should do everything we can to prevent it from causing more harm.\u201dEven so, Ms. Collins has cited the bill\u2019s rollback of the expansion as a top reason for her opposition.\u2014Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Medicaid is the safety-net program for low-income people and those with disabilities.

In legislative elections last month, he won a commanding majority by fielding many candidates who had no formal political experience.Although the French president gave no details on the type of proportional voting system he seeks, such voting would likely give more seats to parties like       Marine Le Pen\u2019s       National Front, which won only eight of the 577 seats at the National Assembly despite garnering over 13% of the first-round vote.VIEW InteractiveFrance\u2019s current electoral system favors larger political parties by awarding a parliamentary seat only to the candidate who wins the largest share of the ballots in the second round of voting.The 39-year-old Mr. Macron said he would also simplify the legislative process, cut down on the number of laws and make it easier for citizens to petition parliament for change. If necessary, Mr. Macron said, he would call for a referendum on his proposals.\u201cI want all these transformations that our institutions desperately need to be completed in a year, and for us to hold back from half measures and cosmetic changes,\u201d the president said.Presidential addresses to parliament are very unusual in France.       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessor, convened both houses of parliament only once during his five-year term, in that case to propose counterterrorism measures in the immediate aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks. Before Mr. Hollande,       Nicolas Sarkozy       used the forum in 2009 to outline his response to the global financial crisis.Besides special presidential addresses, both houses of parliament are assembled only to change the constitution or to ratify expansion of the European Union.Mr. Macron\u2019s decision to resort to a seldom-used practice to lay out his policies has drawn sharp criticism from some opposition lawmakers.Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,        who ran against Mr. Macron in the presidential election, said his parliamentary group boycotted the invitation to attend the speech from a \u201cpresidential monarch.\u201d\u201cWe are rebelling. We won\u2019t submit,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said.Some centrists from the Union of Democrats and Independents party, which is loosely allied with Mr. Macron in parliament, also stayed away from Versailles. By speaking on Monday, they said, the president is undermining his prime minister,       Edouard Philippe,        who is scheduled to present government policy to the National Assembly the next day.\u201cIt is useless and costly, it belittles the government and the president doesn\u2019t need us to do his communications,\u201d Jean-Christophe Lagarde, head of the UDI, said in a message on             Twitter.Opposition lawmakers who attended Mr. Macron\u2019s address in Versailles Monday said it lacked crucial details.\u201cYou get the impression he\u2019s continuing with the vague song that marked the election campaign,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.Mr. Macron now faces a turbulent few months ahead in parliament.Later this month, lawmakers will vote on using a fast-track decree procedure to push through changes to labor laws.In September, the government will present its first budget, which is likely to be focused on spending cuts, after the state auditor last week revealed a larger-than-expected budget shortfall.But Mr. Macron didn\u2019t detail his government\u2019s policy plans on Monday, saying that task belonged to Mr. Philippe.In his speech on Monday, the French president also announced plans to lift the state of emergency that has been in place since the Paris attacks.\u201cI will bring back the freedoms of the French people by lifting the state of emergency in the fall, because these freedoms are the condition for a strong democracy,\u201d he said.Under the wide-ranging powers allowed under a state of emergency in France, authorities are permitted to bar people from leaving their homes and to conduct searches without a court order.Parliament will vote on new measures that target only terrorism suspects, Mr. Macron said.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 13:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-presses-ahead-with-calls-for-political-reform-in-france-1499104157", "news_title": "Macron Calls for Changes to France\u2019s Parliament, Voting", "keywords": "france politics,Emmanuel Macron,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014French dairy company             Danone SA        DANOY 1.06%       said Monday that it entered a binding agreement to sell its U.S. dairy business, Stonyfield, to Lactalis for $875 million to address U.S. competition concerns.The sale of Stonyfield is part of an agreement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with Danone\u2019s recent acquisition of WhiteWave. Danone and WhiteWave together have big chunks of the yogurt market with brands including Dannon, Oikos, Actimel, Silk, Wallaby and Horizon Organic, which led to concerns from the Justice Department about concentration in the dairy sector.Danone said that the sale price represented a multiple of about 20 times the 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for Stonyfield.Lactalis, based in the town of Laval, about 175 miles southwest of Paris, is a family-owned company whose cheese, milk and other dairy products are sold under well-known brands such as President and Bridel. It said it has 75,000 employees spread across 85 countries.Its agreement to buy Stonyfield comes as the French company faces increasing pressure to offer healthier foods as consumer tastes change.Lactalis generates half its sales from milk, butter, creams, yogurt and desserts, while an additional 36% of its sales come from cheese.It is the first time it has bought a company that is dedicated mainly to making organic products. A deal would also help Lactalis achieve its goal of expanding further into the U.S., where it has factories in Belmont, Wis., and Nampa, Idaho.Other bidders for the asset included big dairy processor             Dean Foods Co.      , Mexico\u2019s Grupo Lala and China\u2019s largest dairy company Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., according to a person familiar with the matter.A Yili spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Dean Foods and Grupo Lala didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Founded in 1983, Stonyfield, which was one of the pioneers in tapping consumers\u2019 growing desire for simpler, more natural products, grew to yearly revenue of about $370 million last year.Danone purchased a 40% stake in the company in 2001, and raised its share to 80% in 2004, which strengthened its position in the U.S. against Minneapolis-based competitor             General Mills Inc.,       maker of Yoplait yogurt. Since 2014, Danone has fully owned Stonyfield.Closing of the sale of Stonyfield is subject to final approval by the Justice Department and is expected in the third quarter of this year. Danone\u2019s $10.4 billion purchase of WhiteWave, agreed in July 2016, closed on April 12 this year.Corrections & Amplifications   Stonyfield is dedicated mostly to making organic products.

A lawyer representing Barclays, which was also charged, said the bank hadn\u2019t yet come to a decision on its own position.Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office has spent five years investigating how Barclays wooed Qatari investors to prop up the bank. In total, Barclays raised \u00a311.8 billion ($15 billion) from investors through two emergency cash calls in June and October 2008. Its examination has focused on \u00a3322 million in \u201cadvisory services\u201d that were paid to Qatari investors as part of the cash injection, an agreement that wasn\u2019t initially disclosed to shareholders.

Mr. Levesque is now the entertainment company\u2019s executive vice president of talent, live events and creative, and Ms. McMahon is WWE\u2019s chief brand officer and the daughter of CEO Vince McMahon.One of WWE\u2019s key missions this year is to build its corporate brand. Ms. McMahon has been increasing her speaking engagements at business events, and Cannes was a vehicle to boost awareness about how and why brands should partner with the entertainment company through sponsorships and advertising.\u201cI think sometimes we still get stuck with people not knowing who we are and not knowing how to define us,\u201d Mr. Levesque said, adding that people are often shocked by the company\u2019s numbers.WWE generated $729 million in revenue last year, up 11% from 2015. The company says it has more than 800 million social media followers and generated 12 billion views in the last 12 months on YouTube. WWE is the number one \u201csports\u201d channel on the video platform, YouTube confirmed.Around two-thirds of WWE\u2019s revenue is tied to TV rights fees, subscriptions and advertising, while the rest comes from selling live events tickets and products. In the U.S., WWE airs five hours of prime-time programming a week on NBCUniversal\u2019s USA Network all year round, and that rights deal comes up for renewal in 2019. Its WWE Network, a Netflix-style streaming service for wrestling that costs $9.99 a month, had 1.95 million subscribers after its most recent WrestleMania event in April.When WWE first launched its subscription streaming service in 2014, there were some concerns it could cannibalize its live TV audience.But ratings remain relatively strong. In April 2017, for example \u201cWWE Entertainment\u201d and \u201cWWE Smackdown\u201d on the USA Network averaged over 3.5 million viewers either watching live or watching on-demand within seven days, according to Nielsen. That was up slightly from the 3.4 million viewers watching those programs in April 2016, according to Nielsen\u2019s figures.WWE\u2019s executives will be hoping its performance in the ratings will help it gain leverage in the next round of rights negotiations. Brandon Ross, an analyst at BTIG Research, estimates NBCUniversal is paying around $150 million a year on average for WWE rights--\u201ca fraction\u201d of what top sporting leagues demand for their content on a per viewer hour basis. WWE declined to comment on that figure, and NBCU didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.When WWE\u2019s ratings deal comes up for renewal in 2019, \u201ceven if they got a 50% increase from where they are now, it would pale in comparison on a per eyeball basis to what other live sports can get,\u201d Mr. Ross said.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter.

WWE created 1,500 hours of original content in 2016.WWE says it has attracted around 50 \u201cblue chip\u201d sponsors over the past two years. Recent brand partners have included Mars, KFC, PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9 and Mattel.Still, boosting WWE\u2019s appeal to more advertisers may have its challenges, according to Mr. Ross. Although staged, its main events are still fights, and there is the perception WWE attracts \u201ca lower income audience with less wallet than other programs,\u201d according to Mr. Ross.A WWE spokesman responded, saying: \u201cThe reality is that WWE has a massive, young, diverse and multigenerational audience that is proven to have significant spending power, reinforced by our blue chip advertisers and sponsors.\u201dThe NXT developmental competition, which airs on the WWE Network, is a key area of growth for WWE. The company is also aiming to expand more internationally, particularly in China, where it launched a media partnership with PPTV last year, and in India, where Ms. McMahon says WWE is second only to cricket in terms of social media followers in the sports category.\u201cIf you take all our platforms, all of the viewership, 70% of our viewership comes from outside the U.S., but only 30% of the revenue comes from outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Levesque said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity.\u201dWWE has also made efforts to build the profile of women. At one time, women in wrestling were mostly there to be looked at and were called \u201cDivas,\u201d not \u201cSuperstars\u201d like male wrestlers.Things changed in 2015\u2014a year that hosted a tag match between female wrestlers Brie and Nikki Bella vs. Emma and Paige that lasted just 30 seconds\u2014when fans began demanding women\u2019s wrestling be elevated to the main roster. The protest hashtag #givedivasachance trended world-wide for three days as fans called for more athleticism, enhanced characters and better story lines for female WWE athletes.The following year, WWE rebranded its Divas division, announcing that all its performers would be known as \u201cSuperstars,\u201d no matter which gender.\u201cIt\u2019s not just because we see it as this movement or thing to jump on,\u201d Mr. Levesque said. \u201cAny day of the week, I can go through our ratings numbers and the women will have the highest-rated segments of the night across the board.\u201dAbout 40% of WWE viewers are now women, thanks to the number of families that watch its shows.That\u2019s a key stat for marketers and could encourage more brands to partner with the entertainment company. WWE creates content that \u201cappeals to both children and adults\u201d that has to be compelling for both, \u201clike a Disney movie,\u201d Ms. McMahon said.Corrections & Amplifications   Stephanie McMahon is chief brand officer for World Wresting Entertainment Inc.

The contract is the first Iranian exploration and production project awarded to a major European company in 10 years, after a deal with global powers last year ended Western sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program.To make it happen, the Paris-based company spent years maintaining relationships in Iran even after Western sanctions were tightened in 2012, and then took months to negotiate the details after announcing a preliminary agreement last year.\u201cWe were here 20 years ago. We\u2019ve come back today,\u201d Total Chief Executive       Patrick Pouyann\u00e9       said at a Tehran news conference. \u201cAnd again it\u2019s a long history for the company.\u201dTotal was in a stronger position to make a deal than competitors like             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC, which has long eyed going back into Iran.             BP                   PLC, which helped build the Iranian oil industry, remains on the sidelines.Those companies do more business in the U.S., where President       Donald Trump       has said he would re-examine the deal that lifted Western sanctions on Iran last year, said       Homayoun Falakshahi,        a research analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Mr. Falakshahi       said he didn\u2019t expect the deal to open a floodgate of contracts with other foreign oil giants.\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional situation, by a long stretch,\u201d he said of Total\u2019s contract.Iran\u2019s oil output has jumped 1.2 million barrels a day to 3.9 million barrels a day since sanctions were lifted. But it still needs $100 billion of investment in its oil and gas fields to reach a goal of 5.7 million barrels a day the end of 2020.Shell signed a preliminary agreement to explore opportunities in Iranian oil fields late last year. The Anglo-Dutch company held meetings in Tehran and Dubai in the two past months with the National Iranian Oil Co. and Chinese state-run Sinopec to work together on an oil field called Yadavaran, according to a person familiar with the discussions. But people who work with the company said it is concerned about its exposure to the U.S. and is more selective in the choice of its banks than Total.A Shell spokeswoman said the company remained \u201cinterested in exploring the role it can play in developing Iran\u2019s energy potential.\u00a0We have been engaging with Iranian officials but it is still too early to discuss potential Shell investment in any project.\u201dU.S. sanctions remain on Iran over terrorism, weapons and human rights, prohibiting deals with American companies like             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Chevron Corp.      , but European companies can still try to make a deal work. Total said it was in compliance with all sanctions.A diplomatic crisis in the Persian Gulf is adding another level of uncertainty for big oil companies looking to invest in Iran. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have mounted a campaign to isolate their neighbor Qatar, partly because of its rapprochement with regional rival Iran.\u201cThe landscape of political risk in the region is changing profoundly,\u201d said       Neil Quilliam,        the European head at consultancy the Rapidan Group.Total built Monday\u2019s deal out of a longstanding knowledge of and commitment to Iran. Back in the 1990s, Total signed a deal to work on the South Pars\u2014the massive sub-Persian Gulf field shared with Qatar. Total was the first Western company to load an Iranian oil cargo in February 2016 after sanctions lifted.According to people familiar with the matter, Total\u2019s decision to enlist China Petroleum National Corp. as a 30% partner enables the easy transfer of money in and out of Iran. CNPC owns its own financial institution, Kunlun, one of the few sizable banks that work with Tehran.This first contract is also less politically sensitive than most,       Mr. Falakshahi       said, because it is for natural-gas production headed to the domestic Iranian market along with condensates and liquefied-petroleum-gas.It will be harder for big energy companies, including Total, to make deals for the country\u2019s crude-oil fields, which generate export revenues and are caught up in Iran\u2019s political push and pull between outward-facing moderates and religious hard-liners wary of foreign influence.Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 12:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/total-plows-into-iran-leaving-shell-bp-on-sidelines-1499096856", "news_title": "Total Plows Into Iran, Leaving Shell, BP on Sidelines", "keywords": "energy deals,iran gas,iran sanctions,natural gas,south pars,western sanctions,Total,TOT,FP.FR,BP,BP.LN,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,Homayoun Falakshahi,output,production,contracts,orders,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,floods,tidal waves,natural disasters,catastrophes,risk news,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Red Ventures LLC said Monday it has agreed to buy personal finance website operator             Bankrate Inc.             in a $1.24 billion all-cash deal, as it seeks to expand its presence in the financial-services industry.Red Ventures, a Fort Mill, S.C., data company that connects financial services, home services and health-care businesses to consumers, plans to pay Bankrate shareholders $14 a share, an 8.9% premium to Friday\u2019s closing price.

EQT 2.24%       and is seeking to scuttle\u00a0the energy company\u2019s\u00a0proposed $6.7 billion acquisition of             Rice Energy Inc.        RICE 1.63%Instead of buying Rice, Jana wants EQT to fully separate its pipeline operations,\u00a0according to a securities filing and people familiar with the matter. The goal would be to make EQT a pure exploration-and-production company. While that could happen after a Rice deal, tax rules mean it could take years.Jana questions the benefits of the deal and believes the price is too high, the people said.In a statement, EQT said the deal would further its efforts to improve operations and tap the value of its natural-gas resources. Responding to the split suggestion, the company said it has acknowledged the market is missing value between its pipeline operations and exploration business and that \u201cmanagement has committed to evaluating options and devising a plan to address this discount by the end of 2018.\u201dRice declined to comment.The activist hedge fund had been buying the stock before EQT announced the deal\u00a0two weeks ago and was blindsided by the announcement, the people said. It is working with executives who built and sold various iterations of shale pioneer Atlas Energy.EQT is based in Pittsburgh and operates largely in the Marcellus Shale formation, which spreads from New York to Virginia. Rice is also an Appalachian-focused energy company.The combination would create the largest natural-gas producer in the country by volume, the companies say. Their large adjacent acreage and pipelines is part of the appeal of the deal.EQT\u2019s stock dropped 13% in the three days after the deal was announced June 19, though it mostly recovered last week. The shares closed\u00a0Friday\u00a0at $58.59, giving EQT a market capitalization of $10.2 billion. Rice closed at $26.63, up 35% since the deal was announced and slightly below the current value of the cash-and-stock offer.If Jana succeeded in getting other EQT holders to vote down the deal, it could trigger a $67 million payment to Rice.Instead of doing the deal, Jana wants EQT to fully list its pipelines, which already trade publicly. They are run by             EQT Midstream Partners                   LP, which is more than 26%-owned by a third entity,             EQT GP Holdings                   LP, that is 90%-owned by EQT.As allies, Jana had signed up three well-known executives who ran the corporate family tree of Atlas Energy. Most of Atlas was sold to             Chevron Corp.       for more than $3 billion in 2011, before the executives took a remaining operation, built it into a new version of Atlas and sold it again in 2015.Jonathan Cohen,        executive chairman of the current version of Atlas, and       Daniel Herz,        president, are potential board nominees. Jana is also working with       Edward Cohen,        Jonathan\u2019s father, who led the original Atlas. All three have bought EQT shares.Oil-and-gas exploration companies frequently shift assets around and build pipelines that then are housed in separate publicly traded operations with tax-efficient structures.The possibility for such moves often draws activists, who take stakes and push for changes that will drive up stock prices. Jana has a history of energy campaigns, including calling for a similar split at El Paso Corp. But as energy prices plunged, many activists, including Jana, lost money on some big bets and have slowed down their activity in the sector.This year, there has been a resurgence that is coinciding with a pickup in deals among shale companies. Elliott Management Corp. is urging mining giant             BHP Billiton                   PLC to shed its U.S. shale assets, and Corvex Management LP is pushing             Energen Corp.       to sell itself. Both companies have rebuffed the suggestions.Jana has been particularly busy this year, including a high-profile campaign to push             Whole Foods Market Inc.       to sell itself.Corrections & Amplifications   If EQT Corp.\u2019s deal to buy Rice Energy Inc. is voted down by shareholders, EQT would owe a $67 million fee to Rice. An earlier version of the article incorrectly included the $255 million fee that applies to other termination reasons. (July 3, 2017)That campaign looks likely to score the fund a quick $400 million profit thanks to             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       deal to buy the grocer. Jana also helped more quietly drive board changes at             Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.       and             Tiffany                   & Co. this year after a quiet 2016.Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 12:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jana-takes-roughly-5-stake-in-energy-company-eqt-1499086003", "news_title": "Jana Takes Roughly 5% Stake in Energy Company EQT ", "keywords": "activist investor,activist shareholder,energy company,midstream assets,pipeline company,planned,proposed acquisition,rice deal,stake,EQT,Jana Partners,Rice Energy,RICE,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,natural gas,oil exploration,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The strongest reading on U.S. factory activity in nearly three years signaled underlying health in the economy headed into the second half of 2017.The Institute for Supply Management on Monday said its index of U.S. manufacturing activity rose to 57.8 in June, its highest level since August 2014.

In Maine, Republican Gov.       Paul LePage       has implemented a partial shutdown until\u00a0Monday. Connecticut Gov.       Dannel P. Malloy      \u00a0on Friday\u00a0signed an executive order that sharply curtailed state spending after the Legislature failed to approve a budget plan to close a two-year deficit of $5.1 billion.

Visitors were turned away from state beaches and parks\u00a0Saturday\u00a0and\u00a0Sunday, although the governor and his family spent the weekend at a state-owned residence in Island Beach State Park.Mr. Christie said he would sign a budget sent to him by Democrats, including more than $300 million in additional spending for education and other services, but only if lawmakers passed a bill\u00a0giving the state more control over its largest insurer. The insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, has strongly opposed the legislation.Mr. Christie, who earlier this year said he wanted the company to contribute to a new state fund for addiction-treatment services, has called for more transparency on executive and lobbyist pay and more state oversight of its finances. A spokesman for Horizon said the proposed legislation would be unduly burdensome and force the insurer to raise premiums.Assembly Speaker       Vincent Prieto,        a Democrat, has refused to put the legislation demanded by Mr. Christie up for a vote, calling it an unfair intervention in the not-for-profit company that shouldn\u2019t be part of the budget process.

His two youngest children last month accused their elder brother\u2014the current prime minister\u2014of misusing state powers to frustrate their father\u2019s wishes.These allegations \u201care entirely baseless,\u201d Prime Minister Lee told lawmakers. \u201cToday I stand here before you to answer your questions, clear any doubts, and show you that you have every reason to maintain your trust in me and my government.\u201dThe rupture in the Lee family has set off a political firestorm in a city-state that prides itself on its orderly meritocracy, and sparked debate about government integrity in a country where public criticism of leaders is rare and can result in jail.Lee Kuan Yew first moved into his Oxley Road home at the end of World War II and held weekly political discussions there that led to the 1954 founding of the People\u2019s Action Party, which took power five years later when Singapore became self-governing.As prime minister from 1959 to 1990, Mr. Lee steered Singapore\u2019s transformation from a colonial trading post to one of the world\u2019s richest nations, providing a model for other authoritarian governments. His elder son, Lee Hsien Loong, became prime minister in 2004.All three children have publicly said they want to honor Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s desires, though Prime Minister Lee and his siblings have accused each other of misrepresenting their father\u2019s wishes.Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will stated his wish to tear down the house, but also stated that if changes to laws and regulations prevent his house from being demolished, then access to the premises should be granted only to his children, as well as their family members and descendants. Prime Minister Lee said in parliament Monday his siblings seem to assert that their father wanted nothing short of demolition of the house, a claim that the siblings have denied.Some Singaporeans, meanwhile, have called for the house to be preserved as a monument or heritage site. Singapore\u2019s government has the power to acquire property for purposes of heritage preservation.The dispute over the house burst into the open on June 14, when Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s daughter       Lee Wei Ling       and younger son       Lee Hsien Yang       published a six-page statement alleging that their brother had misused his \u201cposition and influence over the Singapore government\u201d to try to preserve the Oxley Road home.A key part of their claims centers on a ministerial committee that the government says was set up to consider options for the Oxley Road house. The siblings allege that Prime Minister Lee was making use of the committee to question the validity of their father\u2019s will. They also allege that the four-member panel isn\u2019t impartial as it comprises the prime minister\u2019s subordinates, and was dealing with a private dispute that should be heard in court.Prime Minister Lee on Monday denied these allegations, saying he has recused himself from any government decision related to the Oxley Road house. \u201cI had nothing to do with the decision to set up the ministerial committee,\u201d and \u201cdo not give any instructions\u201d to the panel or its members, he said.Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who chairs the committee, on Monday defended its impartiality and said it isn\u2019t attempting to investigate the validity of the will.The prime minister said he prefers not to take his siblings to court over their allegations, even though in \u201cnormal circumstances\u201d he would have \u201cimmediately\u201d sued people making similar claims. Singapore\u2019s leaders, from Lee Kuan Yew to Lee Hsien Loong, have successfully sued some of their critics for defamation.\u201cI believe I have a strong case,\u201d the prime minister told parliament. \u201cBut suing my own brother and sister in court would further besmirch my parents\u2019 names.\u201d\u201cIt would also drag out the process for years, and cause more distraction and distress to Singaporeans,\u201d he said.Over the weekend before Monday\u2019s parliamentary debate\u2014arranged by Prime Minister Lee to answer allegations that he abused power\u2014his siblings published             Facebook                   posts reiterating their allegations. They also questioned whether parliament was the proper venue for discussing allegations against the prime minister.Prime Minister Lee on Monday defended the process, saying he expected all lawmakers to engage in a \u201cfull airing and accounting of the public issues and allegations.\u201dHis ruling PAP dominates parliament with 83 members in a chamber of 89 directly elected lawmakers. The opposition Workers\u2019 Party fields six full parliamentarians and three so-called nonconstituency members with limited voting rights.Workers\u2019 Party chief Low Thia Khiang, speaking in response to Prime Minister Lee, said the Lee family dispute ought to be dealt with in court and resolved as soon as possible. He urged the government to ensure that officials adhere to clear distinctions between their public and private lives.Other Workers\u2019 Party lawmakers said a parliamentary debate won\u2019t resolve the dispute, and called for an independent fact-finding process to look into the allegations made by the prime minister\u2019s siblings.The parliamentary session is due to end Tuesday.Write to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 11:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/singapore-prime-minister-lee-rejects-claims-he-misused-state-powers-in-family-feud-1499094761", "news_title": "Singapore Prime Minister Lee Rejects Claims He Misused State Powers in Family Feud ", "keywords": " family dispute, family feud, lee hsieng loong, lee kuan yew, lee kuan yew house,singapore,Lee Hsien Yang,Lee Hsien Loong,Lee Kuan Yew,Lee Wei Ling,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch"}, {"content": "SENATE MAJORITY LEADER       MITCH MCCONNELL      : It\u2019s a very complicated subject. I had hoped, as you know, that we could have gotten to the floor this week. But we\u2019re not quite there. But I think we\u2019ve got a really good chance of getting there. It will just take us a little bit longer.PAUL GIGOT       : Welcome to \u201cthe Journal Editorial Report.\u201d I\u2019m Paul Gigot.That was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this week following his announcement that the Senate would break for the July 4 recess without a vote on health care. Negotiations continue as the Republicans scramble to settle on a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. With the impatient President       Trump       tweeting Friday, \u201cIf Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date.\u201dWhat are the main obstacles of an agreement and what are the consequences for the GOP if they fail to pass a bill?Let\u2019s ask \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d columnist and deputy editor,       Dan Henninger      ; editorial board member,       Joe       Rago; and columnist,       Bill McGurn.Joe, you\u2019re fated to cover this for us. What are the divisions inside the Republican Party that are preventing an agreement?JOE RAGO: Well, there are two camps. One it\u2019s the conservatives, people like       Ted Cruz,       Ron Johnson,        who are kind of disappointed that it doesn\u2019t do enough on deregulation. I think they are amenable to a deal.The real problem are the moderates. They --GIGOT: Who are you talking about?RAGO: I\u2019m talking about       Rob Portman.GIGOT: Of Ohio.RAGO:       Shelley Moore Caputo       of West Virginia,       Bill Cassidy       of Louisiana. I mean, there is a whole list of them. But --GIGOT: All right. What\u2019s their beef?RAGO: Their main problem is with Medicaid. They think the cuts -- this bill transitions to a block grant. They think the block grant is not generous enough. And then there is all kinds of cats and dogs. They don\u2019t want to cut taxes for the rich.GIGOT: They don\u2019t want to repeal some of the Obamacare taxes that they campaigned to repeal.RAGO: Right.GIGOT: OK. So that\u2019s a problem.RAGO: Their problem is when they said they wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare, they really didn\u2019t want to repeal all that much. So, the question is, where is the vin diagram between these two camps.RAGO: We\u2019ll see it Mitch McConnell can find it.GIGOT: That\u2019s what McConnell has been trying to negotiate.The bigger problem you are saying though, politically, is the moderates, who want to do much less on Medicaid reform. Aren\u2019t some of these people the same people who said, you know, we can\u2019t -- oh, my god, the deficit is too large. We have to do something about health care entitlements?RAGO: Right. They have run on repeal and replace across four elections for nearly a decade. They have -- all these guys have voted in 2015 to repeal the bill, to repeal ObamaCare.GIGOT: Right.RAGO: Now that it might actually happen, they are getting cold feet.GIGOT: They are saying, oh, don\u2019t make me take a tough vote.DAN HENNINGER: Look, Paul, it\u2019s clear, in retrospect, to me, that the most politically shrewd thing that       Barack Obama       and the architects of the Affordable Care Act did was expand Medicaid. Because there are states, like West Virginia, Ohio, Arizona, that took -- the states have always been desperate to fund their Medicaid.GIGOT: And here is the key, Dan. Medicaid is typically, traditionally funded on a 50/50.HENNINGER: Exactly.GIGOT: This was a 90/10 deal.HENNINGER: A 90/10 deal.GIGOT: The feds give 90 percent of the cash to get new people on.HENNINGER: And so you had - you had Republican governors, like       John Kasich,        who took the money, and now they are literally addicted to this Medicaid money. And the problem is that if the Medicaid reforms go, states who didn\u2019t take the money, say, like Florida, I think they are going to be obligated to buy into the Medicaid expansion and then it\u2019s game over.GIGOT: The expansion of the Medicaid, it wasn\u2019t just more money at a 90/10 rate. It was also extended up to 138 percent of poverty.BILL MCGURN: Right.GIGOT: It came not just, Bill, for the disabled, not just for the truly needy and in poverty. It became, essentially, a slowly moving, gradually upward, middle-class entitlement.MCGURN: Absolutely. It\u2019s a huge -- I mean, really, it\u2019s Obamacade. Right? When they talk about people who now have health coverage, it\u2019s mostly Medicaid.Look, I think one of the issues, Medicaid is a great sort of crucible for this. And what\u2019s missing is the president on this. He has tweeted. I think he has done some good things. Had some Senators in. But what this really calls out for is like an Oval Office address where you address these myths. As this is happening, the Democrats are putting out that the Republicans are cutting Medicaid rather than cutting the growth and so forth. And it would be very helpful for the president to give an address on what the Republicans want to do, why they do, and explain it. That\u2019s supposed to be his strength.GIGOT: All right.There\u2019s this idea about, Joe, that if Republicans can\u2019t get a deal, somehow, they should go -- reach out to Schumer, the Democratic leader, and say let\u2019s come reason together and have a bipartisan support -- bipartisan deal. Possible?RAGO: No. Well, in a limited sense. But the people calling for everybody to come together in a kumbaya circle, never say what that deal would look like. There is no substance there whatsoever. And that\u2019s because there is not a bipartisan compromise. What happens if this fails is that Mitch McConnell is forced to go to Chuck Schumer and say we have got to do something about the exchanges.GIGOT: Because they are failing.RAGO: They are failing. You have high and rising premiums and insurers leaving and tens of thousands of people in counties with zero insurers.RAGO: So you will get a bailout of the exchanges that will be mainly Democrats, with a few Republicans, who are trying to prevent a crisis.GIGOT: It will be a ratification of ObamaCare, essentially, with more dough. It will have none of the reform that\u2019s in this current bill. So you will get bipartisan, but it will be as if       Hillary Clinton       got elected.RAGO: Yes. It will be worse than the deal Republicans probably would have cut if President Clinton was in office right now.GIGOT: All right. What about this tweet by Donald Trump saying if the Senate Republicans fail, then let\u2019s just go to Plan B. Plan B being we are going to repeal it, you all promised to do it. We will repeal it first and then we will go work on replace.       Ben Sasse,        the Nebraska Senator, Republican, recommended the same thing to Donald Trump. Plausible?HENNINGER: I don\u2019t see how that really works. I mean, it seems to me that, if you repeal it, whatever that may mean, the exchanges --GIGOT: -- repealing it.HENNINGER: Well, the exchanges are up and running out there, more or less, right? I think that throws the burden on       Tom Price       and Health and Human Services to start tinkering with the exchanges to keep them afloat until they get to replace. But that itself is going to be a mess.GIGOT: The danger is it ruins health care markets --MCGURN: Yes. Look, and the larger thing is the Republican Party is supposed to be offering solutions to the American people. And the real goal of Republican health care policy is not just to return it to the status quo before ObamaCare, which was not that good, but to improve it. That, to me, would be an abdication.GIGOT: They would be responsible because they\u2019re running --MCGURN: They\u2019d be holding it in 2018. That\u2019s exactly what the Democrats want, to transfer ownership from the Democrats to the Republicans.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, all.When we come back, a victory for President Trump and the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers as the Supreme Court allows most of his travel ban to go into effect.GIGOT: Parts of President Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban went into effect Thursday night after the Supreme Court ruled this week that nearly all of the president\u2019s directives could go forward. In a unanimous decision, the justices also agreed to review a series of lower court rulings blocking the implementation of the March executive order, which temporarily bars entry to the U.S. by nationals of six Muslim-majority nations. Oral arguments in the case are set for the fall, setting up a Supreme Court showdown over presidential power.Attorney       David Rifkin       served in the White House and in the Justice Department under Presidents       Ronald Reagan       and       George Bush.Welcome, David. Good to see you.DAVID RIFKIN: Good to be with you.GIGOT: So I know that you wrote for us. And you believe that this decision was a victory for presidential power, as a legal matter, and was the right decision. Never mind the policy, but just as a legal matter, why?RIFKIN: Because of the lower courts, district courts and two courts of appeal, the Fourth and the Ninth, have fundamentally deviated from the established Supreme Court case law that distinguishes between the extent of judicial engagement in domestic affairs, where the courts pay some deference to the executive but, basically, scrutinize, particularly, in situations where there\u2019s alleged violations of fundamental constitutional rights.GIGOT: Right.RIFKIN: Executive actions and in foreign affairs, where the deference is upmost, reflecting recognition that the two political branches possess the totality of foreign affairs power. Judiciary doesn\u2019t have the expertise nor the ability to really do very much there. So this basically pushes the pendulum back to where the law should be. Let me emphasize, this is way beyond this executive order, Paul. The framework that those lower courts have adopted would fundamentally destroy the ability of the presidency to carry out foreign policy.GIGOT: I want to get -- OK, I want to get into that. But let\u2019s --this is a really interesting opinion because it was unanimous in order to reinstate the policy, at least until they can hear the merits in the autumn. Why do you think -- how much do you read in, how much significance do you read into the fact that it was unanimous?RIFKIN: Quite a bit. Not too be too harsh, but what the courts of appeal have done is utterly aberrational. They have paid scant regard to the Supreme Court case. In a way, it was a challenge not only to the presidency, because, as you know, Paul, I believe there is a, quote, \u201cresistance\u201d portion of the federal judiciary, which is bad enough, politicized judicial making, but it also was an implicit challenge to the Supreme Court. Remember, Article III is a hierarchal entity. The Supreme Court sets the tune and the lower courts are supposed to follow the music, so to speak.GIGOT: When you say Article III, you mean the article in the Constitution that applies to the Courts.RIFKIN: Right.GIGOT: And you\u2019re saying that there are plenty of Supreme Court precedents that have said that on matters of national security, courts must defer to the political branches, in particular, when those political branches, the Congress and the president, are united behind a policy. And you are saying that the lower branches here, the Fourth and the Ninth Circuit, the lower courts, really just ran roughshod over this, in part, because they don\u2019t like this president.RIFKIN: They don\u2019t like this president. And they have done it in a way that was most disingenuous. As I said, they paid no attention to the Supreme Court precedent.And it\u2019s just not a matter of deference. What\u2019s important here is this, and this transcends immigration. The same logic could be applied to the decision to use drones, the decision to impose economic sanctions, frankly, decisions to use military force. Once the executive indicates clearly and it\u2019s legitimate, bona fide reason why it\u2019s doing something, this is it. The judiciary takes it on board. There is no balancing type of analysis that you invariably see in domestic affairs.GIGOT: OK. And you think that the lower courts were so out of line, that they should have reinstated -- the Supreme Court should have reinstated the whole injunction -- I mean, barred, rather, the whole injunction. Should have allowed it to proceed, the travel ban. Yet, they did say that the travel ban -- they did overrule the travel ban in certain narrow cases of individuals who have ties to American families, the families in America, or institutions, such as a college or university where you have been accepted for admission. And, yet, there was a dissent on that from three justices. What do you make of that disagreement?RIFKIN: I, frankly, think, Paul, it\u2019s a slight disagreement. I think the chief justice has accepted this fairly narrow category of people who will come in.Again, this is not about policy equity, Paul. This is about the Constitution at the highest level.RIFKIN: Getting nine justices on board is perfectly fine. As far as the exceptions the Supreme Court exercised own equitable discretion.What\u2019s important to underscore for the viewers, if the lower courts were right, nobody could be stopped under this executive order. The very fact that the vast majority of the people are going to be stopped now for a duration underscores how thoroughly they have taken this off the table. The legal theories. Again, what troubles me the most are not the policy consequences, frankly, of stopping this ban. But the legal consequences of eviscerating established case law, which says, again, in foreign affairs, political branches reign supreme.GIGOT: You don\u2019t want justices meddling, making -- second guessing decisions on the executive. They don\u2019t have the expertise or knowledge to do so.But I want to ask you about what to expect in the fall when the justices address this on the merits. You could go for a 9-0 decision. We know the chief justice likes those kinds of decisions. But would he have to make too many concessions to the get the liberals on board? And would you prefer a 5-4 split that makes a really thunderous ruling on behalf of presidential power?RIFKIN: That latter, Paul. Because, again, the policy stakes here, in my opinion, are quite minor. I think speaking with a clear voice, some chastisement, in a measured fashion, and articulation of the proper paradigm for judicial engagement in this area is absolutely essential. This was a reasonable compromise to get nine on board for the stay. When we get to the merits, oral argument coming, I think the first week of October, look, I hope we\u2019re going to get nine perfect decision.GIGOT: Right.RIFKIN: But probably not. So, 6-3, 5-4 would be wonderful. This would not be the time to pull punches.And by the way, as you point out in your editorial, I have no doubt that the left is going to put serious pressure on the chief justice, the way they have done with ObamaCare, for example. So it\u2019s very important to keep up the countervailing pressure as well.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, David Rifkin.When we come back, the Supreme Court wraps up its term with a big victory for religious liberty. We\u2019ll take a closer look at this week\u2019s ruling and what it says about the court\u2019s newest justice.GIGOT: The Supreme Court wrapped up its term this week with a big win for religious liberty. In a closely watched case, the justices ruled, 7-2, that Missouri acted improperly when it denied public funds to a Lutheran church seeking assistance from a state program providing grants for playground improvements.We\u2019re back with Dan Henninger. \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d columnist, Bill McGurn; and editorial page features editor,       James Taranto,        also join us.Bill, so how big a victory was this for religious freedom?MCGURN: I think it\u2019s a big victory. I said before, in medieval times they debated angels on pinheads. Today, we debate whether a playground that\u2019s Lutheran can qualify for funds.I will say I don\u2019t think these are the biggest religious liberty cases, because it\u2019s about funding or the previous case in the Supreme Court that was 9-0 about running their own business. Where it\u2019s really going to clash are the cases that they are going to take, like the cake baker case from Colorado.GIGOT: Whether or not they can exercise conscience in relation to gay marriageMCGURN: Lesbian and gay rights. That\u2019s where the real nasty clashes are going to occur.GIGOT: James, really interesting dynamics here. Seven to two.       Elena Kagan       joined the majority.JAMES TARANTO: Right, and       Stephen Breyer.GIGOT:       Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s       descent was really tough. And so there\u2019s some division there even among the liberals on this.TARANTO: Yes, that\u2019s true. Also there was a footnote in the case, which was the only part of the opinion of       Justices Thomas       and       Gorsuch       didn\u2019t join, which said we\u2019re only deciding the limited circumstances of this case. So the majority is leaving some wiggle room for future cases.GIGOT: What do you make of this division between the liberalsTARANTO: This is a case in which it\u2019s a question of how absolute do you want to be about the separation of church and state. The argument here was the state had a policy of giving grants to organizations, and it was discriminating against religion, as opposed to supporting religion for the sake of religion.GIGOT: That\u2019s where some liberals might say, OK, that\u2019s just not right.TARANTO: Right.GIGOT: OK.HENNINGER: But interestingly, the next day, the Supreme Court then sent orders back to the Supreme Courts of Colorado and New Mexico, which had ruled against the public funding being used for religious purposes, religious school programs --GIGOT: Schools?HENNINGER: Schools.GIGOT: Private school vouchers.HENNINGER: And the Supreme Court told those two courts, reconsider your opinion. That\u2019s a big deal. Because there are these so-called Blaine Amendments all over the country that forbid using public money for religious schools.TARANTO: By the way, when the court said, about 15 years ago, that states could, not must, but could extend voucher programs to parochial schools, that was a 5-4 decision.GIGOT: That was a 5-4 decision. These Blaine amendments, Bill, go back to the 1880s, I think.MCGURN: Right.GIGOT: And they are basically -- they were aimed at a period where the Protestant majorities in this country were trying to say, no money for all these upstart Italian and Irish immigrant schools.GIGOT: We don\u2019t want Catholic schools.MCGURN: The way they did it was the public schools were Protestant schools, sectarian --GIGOT: Right.MCGURN: -- and Catholics. And we are stuck with this.I would say, look, this is where Donald Trump gets credit for Neil Gorsuch. If you read his opinions, they are very subtle. And he also rejects kind of these distinctions. He talked about someone who says grace before a meal, is that a religious meal or a religious man or so forth.I think this is far more important than, for example, the president\u2019s executive order on religious liberty, which I don\u2019t think amounts to as much.GIGOT: Yes. Let\u2019s talk, fellows, about Gorsuch. Because we got our first glimpse of him as a justice this week or this term. And I don\u2019t think you can reach conclusions about any justice in a few weeks, maybe even in a couple of years. It takes a while to see how they do. But what do you think about his debut?TARANTO: Well, the thing that strikes me most about it, is he is a wonderful writer. My job is finding good writers.I\u2019ve read -- I think he has only written three opinions so far. Most of them have been about boring subjects, like the regulation of debt collection agencies. But you read them and they are marvelously clear and just a pleasure to read. But the clarity is also important. I think that carries over to the way he thinks about the law.GIGOT: Yes. And I would just elaborate on that, Dan. The clarity shows, to me, anyway, a justice who is very confident in his -- in what he thinks about the law. This is somebody who feels very comfortable with the text of statutes, knows that that that\u2019s how he interprets statutes. Goes to the text, and then is\u2014so it\u2019s not, I\u2019m going to make it up as I go. You know\u2014he knows what he is doing in looking at these cases. And you can almost sense, you know, that he is going to be a force intellectually on the court.HENNINGER: Well, it sounds like you are describing Justice Scalia without the doubts.He did align himself several times --GIGOT: Without the Scalia self-doubt?HENNINGER: Without Scalia\u2019s self-doubts.GIGOT: That\u2019s an ironic point, just for the record.HENNINGER: For instance, he aligned himself with Justice Thomas where the court declined to hear a case on whether people could carry guns outside their home for their personal use. Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch wanted to take that case. And that is the kind of area in which Scalia might have had a little bit of doubt. He aligned himself with Justice Thomas, on what Bill was talking about, a more forceful, vigorous defense of the free expression of religion. So I think he is going to be solidly there with Justice Thomas and probably Justice Alito on everything.GIGOT: This wasn\u2019t a big term in terms of\u2014because it was 4-4 for much of it. But there was a big case on free speech, James.TARANTO: Yes. This was the case involving the Slants, which is an Asian American rock band. They had been denied a trademark on the grounds that it was disparaging and they challenged this. And the Supreme Court struck down the Patent and Trademark\u2019s Office disparagement clause. Which means the Washington Redskins will continue to be around.But what was really important about this case was the cultural statement the court made. Two decisions, two opinions, one by Justice Alito and one by Justice Kennedy, both affirmed, in very strong terms, that there\u2019s no such things as a separate category of hate speech that is not protected by the First Amendment. A common misunderstanding these days.GIGOT: All right. Fascinating, gentlemen.Still ahead, the White House issued a rare public warning for the Syrian government this week amid signs that they are planning another chemical attack. So did the warning save lives? And is there a long-term, serious strategy in the works?PAUL GIGOT: The White House warned this week that Syrian forces would, quote, \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d amid signs that the Assad government may be planning another chemical attack on its people. The Pentagon on Tuesday said it detected active preparations for chemical weapons used at Shayrat Airfield, the site of April\u2019s U.S. cruise missile site.But U.N. Ambassador       Nikki Haley       told Congress Wednesday that the administration\u2019s warning may have averted the attack and saved innocent lives.U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY: I think that by the president calling out Assad, I think by us continuing to remind Iran and Russia that while they choose to back Assad, that this was something we were not going to put up with. So I would like to think that the president saved many innocent men, women, and children.GIGOT: Cliff May is the president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He joins me now from Washington.Welcome back, Cliff. Good to see you.So you really think that the Assad regime would tempt fate again and try another chemical attack after what happened to them the first time?CLIFF MAY: I certainly think the warning has given them pause. And it may be that they are not going to do that again, that they recognize that if they cross that red line, there is a president now who will take action and make them feel some pain. I certainly hope that\u2019s true for the sake of saving innocent lives.I also think it\u2019s important that the U.S. show again, as it has in this instance, that it is a power to be reckoned with. The other ways that it\u2019s been done in recent days, shooting down a Syrian plane and shooting down some Iranian-made drones. Those are important signals, among other things.GIGOT: So what you are seeing here is the resurrection, the revival of the U.S. deterrent effect against rogue behavior. And that was, of course, missing for many, many years under the previous administration. Is that how you see it?MAY: Absolutely, I do. If the deterrent is credible, it means you probably don\u2019t have to take action. Having used missiles once against Assad, it may be that we don\u2019t have to do it another time in this instance. Although, there is plenty more we have to do. And that has to be done if this part of the world\u2014if the fires in this part of the world are going to subside, much less be put out.GIGOT: I want to talk about that. But let\u2019s talk about, you mentioned the drone and the airplane shootdown. Now, when that happened, the U.S. was\u2014attack was taking down aircraft that looked to be threatening American forces\u2014forces allied with America on the ground in fighting Islamic State. Russia and Iran reacted and said, don\u2019t do it again. We\u2019re going to challenge your aircraft. And, yet, we haven\u2019t seen that at all since then. Was that just a false threat?GIGOT: Well, I think it was a bit of game of chicken. I think the Russians and others have to decide whether they think they can make the current U.S. administration back down. As you inferred or implied, I don\u2019t think they had any fear whatsoever of the Obama administration. They knew that Obama would also back down, would always stay away from action. Now they have to say, do we want to escalate.Now, there is a possibility of escalation. They have to decide, if they go out at high noon and draw their gun, are they going to be first and more accurate.GIGOT: We know, we have heard this week that Mosel in Iraq is about to be liberated from Islamic State. Raqqa in Syria may not be far behind. Islamic State is going on the road to defeat, at least in its major enclaves. What happens then? Is there a strategy that you see here that the United States has?MAY: Yes. This is a key question. Look, I think the defeat of the most ambitious and adventuristic jihadist expression, which is the reestablishment of the caliphate in the 21st century, if we defeat that, that\u2019s a good day. Let\u2019s celebrate that. But let\u2019s be careful because we have a big day-after problem. What do we do after? We do not want to be the expeditionary force for Iran and Russia and for Assad in Syria and others in Syria. And that\u2019s\u2014that could be the case.As far as a policy or a strategy\u2014GIGOT: Yes. That\u2019s what I want to hear. What\u2019s the U.S. strategy?MAY: I do not think we\u2014if we have a strategy, it has not been clearly articulated yet. It\u2019s not going to be easy to come up with because, whatever strategy we have, is going to have some serious down sides. There are no good strategies. There are bad strategies, and worse. And it\u2019s going to take a bit of thought and consideration to figure out which is which. So I do think the day-after problem is enormous.I think there are things that are\u2014there are aspects of a strategy, such as safe zones, or I call them protection zones. There are enclaves that have been in place really since 2012 that we can fortify. But we do not want to do to do, essentially, what we did in Iraq, which is, we take the country away from a terrible ruler, such as       Saddam Hussain,        and end up giving the\u2014having that rebound to the benefit of Iran, which is trying to establish a new empire, a Shia crescent in the Middle East.GIGOT: That\u2019s the point I wanted to ask you about. Because I think I know, after ISIS is defeated, what Iran and Syria and Russia want. OK? Syria wants\u2014Assad wants to run all of Syria again. Iran wants a Shiite arch of power from Tehran all the way to the Mediterranean. And the Russians want an ally that they can say we helped survive, and you give us a couple of military bases and a port. But it isn\u2019t clear that any of that is in the United States\u2019 interest. And how do we stop that from happening. Because those forces on the ground are going to keep pressing that? And it seems to me that we are going to have to respond with some kind of military force, either enforcing the enclaves for the Kurds or for the Sunnis or maybe air power.MAY: I think that\u2019s exactly right. And that\u2019s why it is so difficult, because we could win the battle today and lose the war tomorrow. And that\u2019s why we do need a policy and a strategy. And I think at the least part, some of its components are going to be to set up those enclaves, to have the Sunnis not feel threatened by the Shia, by the Iranians. Because if they do, they will look for any champion, including a champion like ISIS.We haven\u2019t mentioned al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is very strong. It hasn\u2019t gotten media attention. It hasn\u2019t gotten military attention. There are various al Qaeda affiliates that are also looking to take advantage of the situation. Assad\u2014and he is supported\u2014most of his vector of fighting forces are Iranian proxies. He trying to now move east --GIGOT: That\u2019s right.MAY:\u2014towards the Iraqi border. We have all of these problems. I have to think that Secretary       Mattis       and National Security Advisor       McMaster       need to be thinking about this very hard and saying, how do we at least frustrate\u2014at least frustrate the ambitions of Iran and of Russia and of Assad and not allow this to become part of a knew Persian Empire.GIGOT: All right. Cliff May, thanks for being here.MAY: Thank you.GIGOT: Still ahead, from independence to dominance. A look at President Trump\u2019s new energy strategy, next.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We\u2019re here to issue in new American policy, one that unlocks millions and millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in wealth.My administration will seek not only the American energy independence that we have been looking so long, but American energy dominance.GIGOT: From independence to dominance. That was President Trump Thursday unveiling his administration\u2019s new energy policy and vowing to reduce regulations and boost U.S. production of oil, natural gas and coal to export around the world. It\u2019s a move the White House says will create American jobs and help American allies.We\u2019re back with Dan Henninger,       Joe Rago       and Bill McGurn.So, it was supposed to be energy week, Dan. The president\u2019s tweets got in the way again of that. Instead of energy week, maybe energy hoursHENNINGER: Right.GIGOT: Energy day. Nonetheless, a lot going on behind the scenes on policy. What\u2019s happening?HENNINGER: Yes, that\u2019s right, Paul. That speech was given around 3:30, about the hour, the entire media was, you know, obsessing over the       Mika Brzezinski       tweet.But nonetheless, the president announced some very serious things. He wants to\u2014he is going to allow drilling for oil in the Artic and in the Atlantic. He is going to accelerate the creation of pipelines. He\u2019s going to have a re-think of nuclear policy, more permitting for new coal mines. He is going all out, full speed ahead on energy policy, which arguably at this point, Paul, is the strongest card Donald Trump has played since he has become president.GIGOT: What do you mean the strongest card? You mean economically, strategically or both?HENNINGER: Economically and strategically. Economically, because the United States is now beginning to export up to a million barrels of oil a day - unprecedented\u2014because of the revolution in fracking. Strategically, because Energy Secretary       Rick Perry       was talking about energy dominance. And what he means by that with the United States now exporting all of this energy out there, we\u2019re going to establish new relationships with trading partners that we haven\u2019t had before. Probably, reducing the dominance of Russia. Because formerly, all the liquified natural gas would go through pipelines. Now we will be able to ship it directly to Europe --GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER:\u2014and OPEC and Saudi Arabia. So it\u2019s a big deal.GIGOT: It is a big deal, Joe. And let\u2019s just kind of break that down a little bit. It\u2019s really got two big components. Let\u2019s leave coal aside. You\u2019ve got this liquified natural gas, building these terminals. That gas is being produced through, you know, through the fracking revolution, this new way of tapping into\u2014horizontal drilling, tapping into natural gas reservoirs underneath the ground. And also, oil exports. The Congress basically forced President Obama to lift the oil export ban. And that\u2019s paying big dividends.RAGO: It is. Crude oil exports have doubled over the last six years. It\u2019s really a sea change. And it\u2019s an incremental policy win of the kind that pays dividends over time. A lot of conservatives said timed (ph) well. The export ban wasn\u2019t sufficient to justify a deal. But, we\u2019re really seeing the economic results of that right now.GIGOT: That\u2019s helped American producers find new markets, Bill --MCGURN: Right.GIGOT:\u2014which is crucial because, with oil prices falling in half, a lot of them might have gone out of business, drillers, if we didn\u2019t have this new export market. And now we are also being able to displace some of the imports in oil that we otherwise would have had to buy.MCGURN: Right. We\u2019re allowing markets to develop. Look, one of the problems we have had over the years is that the countries that had oil that we were dependent on were generally not great actors, Russia, Venezuela, the Arab countries, and we were very vulnerable. That\u2019s why the pitch to American energy independence was so strong for every president. You know, I\u2019m a little skeptical of that becauseMCGURN:\u2014you want a global market. Right.GIGOT: Yes, you want a global market.MCGURN: But now we have\u2014as we say, we have new jobs everywhere because of this. And especially with       Mr. Putin       in Europe. It gives the Europeans some assurance that he is not going to use his energy to bully them into something. So it\u2019s a win all around for this. And a lot of this was\u2014a lot of reason it didn\u2019t develop was because of regulations. And that\u2019s where he\u2014that\u2019s really where is he going at it.GIGOT: That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s really the difference, a huge difference between the Obama administration and Trump. The Obama administration just hostile to fossil fuels, generally. Even Obama couldn\u2019t stop the fracking revolution, it was so strong. But he could deter it, slow it down, make it harder. And what Trump is doing is unleashing it.HENNINGER: Yes. It relates as well, as Bill was suggesting, to our foreign policy. We moved away from this kind of pointless argument about energy independence, there is never going to be any such a thing with global energy markets. Trump has recognized that energy markets are global. He is using our skills in energy to establish relationships both economically and strategically with allies out there in Europe. This has moved the energy conversation in an entirely more productive direction.GIGOT: Thank you, all.When we come back, \u201cFalse Black Power,\u201d a provocative new book by the \u201cWall Street Journal\u2019s\u201d own       Jason Riley       who argues that the political strategy of civil rights leaders has left many blacks behind. Jason joins us next.GIGOT: \u201cFalse Black Power,\u201d that\u2019s the title of \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d Columnist and Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Jason Riley\u2019s new book, out this week.Jason joins us now.Here we go. It\u2019s a spritely read, Jason, provocative. What do you mean by false black power?JASON RILEY: Well, the book is really a critique of a civil rights strategy that\u2019s been in place since really the 1960\u2019s. That is to focus on gaining political power for blacks, electing more black officials in the hopes that that will bring along socioeconomic advancement. I thought Obama\u2019s presidency was sort of the culmination of this strategy.GIGOT: In the White House.RILEY: So let\u2019s look back and see how that strategy has fared.GIGOT: What do you think? Where has it failed?RILEY: It\u2019s failed for a number of reasons. But we should never have thought it would succeed based on how other groups have risen from poverty to prosperity.GIGOT: But wait a minute.RILEY: They haven\u2019t focused on\u2014GIGOT: The Irish, they put a premium, when they came here, on political power\u2014RILEY: Right.GIGOT:\u2014in Boston and New York.RILEY: Yes.GIGOT: You would think that has had some success.RILEY: Well, they are an example of a group that has followed a similar path to what blacks are following. It turns out that the Irish were the slowest to grow economically of all the immigrant groups from Europe.GIGOT: In contrast to the Germans --RILEY: In contrast to the Germans, the Italians --GIGOT: Japanese.RILEY:\u2014the Asians, and so forth. All of whom did not place their focus on attaining political clout first. They focused on building their human capitol: cultural development, skills and attitude and so forth. Politics came later.GIGOT: Politics is not this promised land. It can help but\u2014so what\u2014where should the focus be?RILEY: I think the focus should be on what it was before the civil rights establishment adopted this strategy. And so, a lot of people don\u2019t like comparisons between blacks and immigrant groups because of the history of slavery and so forth.GIGOT: Of course.RILEY: So I say compare blacks today to blacks in the first half of the 20th century. If you look back at that period, when focus was not on politics, when blacks had virtually no political clout, you saw racial gaps closing in income and educations attainment and lifting ourselves out of poverty and so forth. After the 1960s, after the switch in\u2014the shift in the strategy to gaining political clout, a lot of those trends stalled, slowed, even retrogressed. And I think we need to get back to building that human capital, which is what blacks were more focused on before the attention turned to pursuing politics.GIGOT: But the focus\u2014you are not saying that       Jim Crow       did not have to be destroyed. And that was a focus on political power?RILEY: No. It was.GIGOT: OK. And that had to happen.RILEY: What I\u2019m saying is that political power is neither necessary, nor sufficient for a group to rise.And, by the way, this strategy has worked on its own terms. The number of black elected officials in this country grew from something like 1500, or less than 1500 in 1970, to more than 10,000 by 2010. Including a black president. But you look at how the black poor have fared in the wake of all this gaining of political power and it\u2019s not well. And we should have learned this lesson from what was happening in cities where blacks had been run, your Detroits, your       Clevelands,        your Philadelphia. You look at Coleman Young\u2019s detroit,       Marion Barry\u2019s       Washington, D.C., the black poor did not do well during those periods.GIGOT: So was the break from a policy and intellectual point of view, in the 1960\u2019s, you had the great success of the civil rights movement. You had the smashing of Jim Crow. You had the Voting Rights Act. You had the Civil Rights Act. And the empowerment of millions, tens of millions of black Americans because of that. But then the focus shifted away from things where it should have shifted. The focus then become economic empowerment, economic growth, and things like education opportunities.RILEY: Yes. Yes. And that\u2019s what was happening before, and that\u2019s what was working before in closing these racial gaps. When that strategy was abandoned, or when the emphasis shifted, that is when - again, we talk a lot about the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, Paul. We don\u2019t talk a lot about the legacy of the welfare state.GIGOT: That\u2019s where the focus shifted. Suddenly, the political power, they all said, oh, we are going to give, provide these benefits to you.RILEY: Yes.GIGOT: You are saying that\u2019s been destructive?RILEY: It\u2019s been extremely destructive. And can you look at case studies in places like Atlanta where, in the 1970s and \u201880s, black mayors, like       Maynard Jackson       and       Andrew Young,        came in and they gave black city contractors special permissions and catered to affirmative action policies and set-asides for minority contractors and so forth. The black poor lost ground in this period. In this age of more black political empowerment, the black poor have lost ground economically, both in absolute terms and relative to the white poor. So the strategy is not working. We ought to revisit it.GIGOT: All right. Jason Riley, thanks for being here.We have to take one more break. When we come back, \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.GIGOT: Time now for our \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.Joe start us off.RAGO: Paul, a miss this week to one of America\u2019s worst-governed states, Illinois. How bad is the tax-and-spend crisis? The state has $14.6 billion in unpaid bills. This is to hospitals, dentists, airports, universities. Governor       Bruce Rauner       and the Democratic legislator are locked in a battle over unfunded pension liabilities. But, boy, what a mess.GIGOT: All right, Joe, thanks.James?TARANTO: This is a miss to the European Court of Human Rights, which this week order 10-month-old       Charlie Gard       to be taken off life support. Charlie was terminally ill, but this was not a question of resources. His parents had raised more than a million pounds, British pounds, to pay for experimental treatment in America. The court not only said that he couldn\u2019t go but they said his parents couldn\u2019t even take him home to die. The court said that\u2019s a decision for the government to make, not the parents.GIGOT: Awful.Bill?MCGURN: Big hit for the Czech parliament. You know that, in Europe, gun control is an article of faith, never mind that it didn\u2019t stop these bloody attacks in Paris. The Czech parliament, the lower House, has passed a provision altering the constitution to allow for gun ownership. So they are going up against this. And it looks like it will pass their upper House. Good message to the terrorists: You attack someone in a Czech\u2014in Prague.GIGOT: Czech Republic, in Prague.MCGURN:\u2014and someone might shoot back.GIGOT: All right. Thank you all.And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC.That\u2019s it for this week\u2019s show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching.

Less obvious, but more important, is how any Russian meddling in the American presidential-election season\u2014whatever form it may have taken\u2014fits into a much larger tale. This is the tale of a systematic Russian effort to disrupt democratic and capitalist systems internationally, using an updated version of tactics Mr. Putin learned in the bad old days of the Soviet KGB.In fact, one of the dangers in the current hyperpartisan American debate over Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election is that it is blurring this larger picture. If the 2016 election was the tip of an iceberg, the rest of the iceberg warrants serious attention.A useful reminder of the breadth of the problem comes in the form of \u201cThe Kremlin Playbook,\u201d a publication released last October by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist American think tank, and the Center for the Study of Democracy, a European public-policy institute. In retrospect, it was a remarkably prescient look at the controversies that have mushroomed since the American election that came a month later.The Playbook is an in-depth study of Russian efforts to use overt and covert tactics over a period of a decade to expand its economic and political influence in five Central and East European nations. A group of regional leaders from such nations warned President       Barack Obama       in a 2009 letter\u2014which also looks prescient now\u2014that Russia was conducting \u201covert and covert means of economic warfare, ranging from energy blockades and politically motivated investments to bribery and media manipulation in order to advance its interests\u2026.\u201dThe Russian strategy, the study finds, isn\u2019t ad hoc. Rather, it is the implementation of a doctrine developed by Russian Gen.       Valery Gerasimov       called \u201cnew generation warfare.\u201d One European analyst called that \u201cprimarily a strategy of influence, not of brute force\u201d aimed at \u201cbreaking the internal coherence of the enemy system.\u201dThe strategy, as it has unfolded in Central and Eastern Europe, proceeds along two parallel tracks, the study found. The first track is economic. Russia seeks to find business partners and investments that allow it to establish an economic foothold, which in turn produces economically influential patrons and partners who have a vested interest in policies friendly to the Kremlin. That is a particularly fruitful endeavor in Europe, where many nations depend on Russian energy supplies.The goal on this track is to cultivate \u201ca network of local affiliates and power-brokers who are capable of advocating on Russia\u2019s behalf.\u201dThe second track, perhaps more relevant to the U.S., is designed to disrupt prevailing democratic political patterns. The goal, the Playbook says, is \u201cto corrode democracy from within by deepening political divides and cultivating relationships with aspiring autocrats, political parties (notably nationalists, populists and Euroskeptic groups), and Russian sympathizers.\u201dOn this track, the effort is designed in part to advance parties and figures sympathetic to Russia. But the broader goal is simply to disrupt the process, create confusion and discord, and discredit democratic systems both in targeted countries and in the eyes of Russian citizens, who are told the chaos to their West shows they shouldn\u2019t long for a Western-styled democratic system at home.A key tool in this effort, the report says, is a \u201cwar on information\u201d campaign that uses disinformation and propaganda to disable opponents and foment nationalist and anti-Western sentiment. \u201cToward this end, Russia exploits existing political pressure points such as migration and economic stagnation, blames Western and U.S. operations for all negative international dynamics (such as the attempted July 2016 coup in Turkey), and discredits the current state of Western democracy,\u201d the report says.Remember that this was written before Mr. Trump won the American presidency and the investigations into Russian influence went into high gear. The findings are about a broader pattern of Russian behavior, not about what it might have done in the U.S. political system.Yet these findings present a backdrop for both the current debate over Russia\u2019s 2016 U.S. activities, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting in Germany this week.Heather A. Conley, a senior vice president of CSIS and one of the authors of The Kremlin Playbook, says the months since its publication have brought \u201can acceleration\u201d of Russian influence-seeking, ranging from a plot against the prime minister of Montenegro to interference in the French election to cyberattacks in Ukraine.The goal, she says, \u201cis disruption, to create governmental policies that accommodate Russian interests,\u201d first in ending Western economic sanctions and then in building a broader sphere of influence.

GE 0.19%       closed its deal to combine its long-suffering energy business with         Baker Hughes Inc.       on Monday, creating one of the largest companies in the oil-field services industry.The new publicly traded company, which will retain the Baker Hughes name, will pursue further cost cuts as it awaits an elusive recovery in oil prices. Majority-owned by Boston-based GE, it will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BHGE, with dual headquarters in Houston and London.While oil services wasn\u2019t a core part of GE\u2019s industrials business, the new Baker Hughes could be better equipped to compete with industry leaders             Halliburton Co.        HAL 3.59%       and             Schlumberger Ltd.        SLB 1.90%       in providing equipment and services to major oil producers.\u201cWe are really filling one of the gaps that GE oil and gas had with oil-field services,\u201d said       Lorenzo Simonelli,        who is CEO of the new company after having run GE\u2019s oil and gas operations. \u201cIt evens out the total exposure in the portfolio.\u201dGE has been cutting costs for years but plans to trim another $1.2 billion from the combined company by 2020. It has declined to say how many employees could lose their jobs as a result of the merger.The deal gives GE a larger footprint in an industry that has been decimated since 2014 as oil prices fell from over $100 a barrel to less than $30. The industry shed more than 160,000 jobs over the last three years and was forced to accept pricing cuts\u2014sometimes more than 50%\u2014from its customers. More than 200 oil-field-service companies went bankrupt.The industry\u2019s outlook rebounded earlier this year as oil prices stabilized around $50 per barrel, but optimism has fizzled with another drop in prices in June.             Barclays                   predicts the U.S. rig count, a widely used measure for drilling activity, to decline by the end of the year, after adding 270 rigs earlier this year.Reduced drilling could make one of Baker Hughes\u2019s key businesses even more lucrative: artificial lift, a technology used to force oil out of older wells as they run dry. Baker Hughes owns about 18% of the global market for artificial lift, second only to Schlumberger, while GE controls about 11%, according to 2016 data from Spears & Associates.GE\u2019s core business is making jet engines, turbines, MRI machines and other heavy-duty industrial equipment, and its oil and gas operations have long weighed on financial results. Baker Hughes is focused on oil-field services, helping producers drill and frack their wells. The deal will double GE\u2019s exposure to the exploration-and-production side of the industry.Baker Hughes, formed in a 1987 merger of Baker International and Hughes Tool, dates back to Howard Hughes Sr.\u2019s revolutionary drillbit invention in the early 20th century.Halliburton attempted to buy the company in 2014 in a $28 billion deal that was ultimately scuttled in early 2016 amid regulatory objections. During those negotiations, the companies held talks with GE to sell off more than $7 billion in assets to help win federal approval.Today, oil and gas extraction are increasingly technically sophisticated, and GE plans to make a push into sensors and data that can boost oil-field profitability. Some analysts believe the shifts in the industry have created openings for leaner, more efficient and digitally minded service providers to gain market share.\u201cWe continue to view [the merger] as one of the most transformative deals to take place in the oil-service space in decades,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst       James West       wrote in a note to investors. \u201cThe new entity should be considered an industry powerhouse with a full cycle portfolio of products and services...and a leading position at the forefront of the digital revolution.\u201dThe new structure could also allow GE to exit the sector entirely, analysts have noted. When GE\u2019s new chief executive,       John Flannery,        takes the helm in August, he is expected to review the conglomerate\u2019s entire portfolio.\u201cIt remains to be seen if oil and gas is a keeper,\u201d said       Deane Dray,        an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, adding, \u201cIf GE hadn\u2019t done this deal, they would be in a worse situation.\u201dWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com and Christopher M.

When the shares start trading soon after, get ready for a wild, and potentially very profitable, ride.The company, known as Brighthouse Financial, will be highly leveraged to interest rates, offering investors a timely chance to take sides in one of the great financial debates of our time. The key question is whether interest rates will return to what were previously regarded as more normal levels, or if they have settled at a permanently lower plateau.If you believe that last week\u2019s kick up in yields was a first step in the higher rates scenario, Brighthouse is for you. The company\u2019s main businesses of individual life insurance, variable and standard annuities are all highly sensitive to interest rates. This has made them a drag on MetLife\u2019s performance for the past several years.The regulatory filing for the Brighthouse spinoff lays out the company\u2019s expected performance under five scenarios for rates and equity markets. Its base case scenario somewhat bullishly assumes that rates on 10-year U.S. Treasuries will gradually rise over the next decade to 4.25%, from around 2.30% today. It also assumes that variable annuity policyholders will see annual returns of 6.5% on their stock and bond investments.Under this scenario, Brighthouse believes it should be able to achieve a 9% return on equity. That is still a bit subpar by the standards of most financial companies, which investors generally expect to post a 10% or higher ROE. Lower interest rates or weaker equity markets would mean a worse return. Brighthouse didn\u2019t give a specific ROE forecast for the other scenarios.This underwhelming outlook is why Brighthouse is likely to sport a relatively cheap valuation when it starts trading. Evercore ISI analyst       Thomas Gallagher       figures Brighthouse is likely worth 0.5 to 0.7 times adjusted book value, similar to where annuity provider             Voya Financial                   is trading.Voya has acted as a leveraged play on interest rates since it was spun out of ING in 2013. When rates spiked after last year\u2019s presidential elections, for instance, Voya rallied nearly 30% in a month.After shedding Brighthouse, MetLife will get more boring in more ways than one. It will specialize in selling group policies to businesses, becoming less visible to consumers. It will also be a more predictable earner through the economic cycle, less prone to whiplash from changes in rates. That will appeal to many investors.But assuming Brighthouse begins life at a modest valuation, investors probably shouldn\u2019t rush to sell it. Owning shares of Brighthouse could itself act as a kind of cheap insurance policy, against the risk of suddenly higher interest rates.Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 10:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-metlife-spinoff-could-shine-bright-1499092882", "news_title": "How MetLife Spinoff Could Shine Bright ", "keywords": "insurance,interest rates,spinoff,MetLife,MET,Brighthouse Financial,corporate changes,plans,strategy,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,new companies creation,demergers,commodity,financial market news,life insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Matt Freund is co-chief investment officer and head of fixed-income strategies at Calamos Investments LLC in Naperville, Ill. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Jacob Meade.Over my nearly 30 years in bond investing, I\u2019ve learned the various misperceptions that investors have about how this asset class works. These misperceptions can lead clients to overreact to market trends and make rash or misguided financial decisions. To help clients see and avoid these pitfalls, advisers should take time to understand how investors\u2019 pre-existing notions about bonds can veer from reality.One common error I encounter is people\u2019s idea that we have a unified bond market, not a market of bonds. When investors say \u201cthe bond market is unattractive,\u201d they fail to appreciate how at any given point some types of bonds are overvalued while other types are undervalued. Investors may be concerned by rising rates, but a rising-rate environment causes some bonds (such as high-yield and floating-rate debt) to do reasonably well. So there are plenty of colors on the palette, and a skilled adviser can help their client implement the best ones for each situation.Another common misperception is that there will always be parallel changes in interest rates. If the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates, people might assume that will cause an equal increase for 10-year, 20-year, and 30-year bonds as well. The truth is different. Parallel rate changes are unicorns: They don\u2019t exist.For clients who understand that bond prices fall as rates rise, the prospect of multiple Fed rate increases might make them fear their assets will decline in value. What they don\u2019t consider is that bonds will continue to mature at par, or face value, as long as there is no default.Clients also tend to forget that bonds pay interest that can offset price declines. The final piece of the puzzle is that as the remaining time to maturity gets shorter, a bond\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates diminishes. Together, these facts can minimize a bond\u2019s losses and in some instances provide a positive total return by \u201crolling down the yield curve\u201d despite rising rates. In other words, if I buy a five-year bond today, what will it be a year from now? A four-year bond, naturally. That means I will have earned a year\u2019s worth of interest and will be a year closer to maturity. Many people don\u2019t understand that the combination of these factors can leave them in a more stable position than they think.Advisers can help clients avoid these and other frequent mistakes by reminding them why they are investing in bonds in the first place. Bonds are clients\u2019 best hedge on stocks, and in many cases bonds outperform when stocks underperform. Combine that diversification advantage with the general value of an inflation-beating, safe income-producing asset, and there will always be a place for bonds in a properly balanced portfolio. By shedding light on these core ideas and correcting misperceptions, you can help your clients steer clear of mistakes so they get the most out of their fixed-income investments.", "news_time": "2017-07-03 10:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearing-up-misperceptions-on-bonds-1499092407", "news_title": "Clearing Up Misperceptions on Bonds", "keywords": "Calamos Investments,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,fixed income investing,personal finance,personal investments,banking,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Some dates deserve a place in market history. Black Monday 1987 and Black Thursday 1929 occurred before the VIX fear gauge was created, but the volatility index\u2019s three biggest intraday rises also resonate: August 2015\u2019s China fears. May 2010\u2019s flash crash. February 2007\u2019s subprime concerns mixed with another China panic.Last Thursday shouldn\u2019t merit being on the list. Central bankers kind of maybe indicated that just possibly they might do what they previously said they would do, and tighten monetary policy if the economy improves. Yet the VIX, a measure of the volatility expected over the next 30 days, had its fourth-biggest ever rise of 55% from open to peak, before recording its eighth-biggest fall from peak to close. By its low on Friday it was back in the lowest 1% of VIX readings ever. The VIX was created in 1993.The outsize reaction to so little news tells us three things, all worrying.First, investors are very concerned about any signs that central banks might pull back from super-easy monetary policies. Second, when volatility starts to go up it can go up a lot faster than anyone thought. And third, complacency still rules, with \u201cbuy the dip\u201d firmly embedded in investor psychology after an eight-year bull market.The second of these is the biggest danger to the growing group of investors who have been betting on low volatility. They are convinced it is safe because in the past the markets have given plenty of warning before a spike. When low-volatility regimes have ended in the past, they have typically trended higher before turning really nasty, giving investors time to get out. If volatility is no longer predictable, the \u201cshort-vol\u201d strategies used by hedge funds, pension funds and institutional investors\u2014and available through exchange-traded products, too\u2014are riskier than their advocates suggest.Just how risky was evident last week. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX exchange-traded note, known by its ticker XIV, tumbled 15% intraday on Thursday. Investors must decide if this is advance warning of danger ahead, or merely a move to be expected after gains of 263% in the previous 12 months.In some ways, this is the same assessment investors always have to make. Is the market signaling complacency, or is volatility low\u2014and stock and bond prices high\u2014for a good reason: Because profits are strong, inflation low and the economic outlook sunny? Christian Mueller-Glissmann, a strategist at             Goldman Sachs,       says in past periods of low-inflationary growth such as the 1960s and 1990s, volatility stayed low.But in another way the decision is specific to volatility. It is one thing to put money on volatility staying low as a high-risk, high-reward bet that nothing upsets the calm in the next 30 days. It is quite another to do it on the basis that when markets start to become more volatile there will be a shift to a higher volatility regime before a major VIX spike.The losses to the strategy when the VIX does jump can be torture.The August 2015 panic meant those who had continued selling volatility\u2014despite a warning from a smaller VIX rise earlier that summer\u2014lost more than half their money. The XIV exchange-traded note took until January 2017 to recover all its losses.There are two causal stories to tell behind these concerns. One is that explicit bets against volatility are crowded, so when volatility starts rising, the rush for the exit drives it up further. Anecdotally this feels right, and open interest in VIX futures is close to record levels. Against that, Goldman analysts point out that across all VIX-related exchange-traded products, overall bets are still on higher volatility\u2014so still more could go in before short vol positions are as extended as in 2015.The second story is that implicit bets against volatility such as equities or emerging-market debt are crowded. Investors who have been persuaded by calm markets to move out of their comfort zone to buy riskier assets are very sensitive to any sign that the market or economic cycles might be ending.Accept either of these stories, and you will want to avoid bets against volatility and have a more balanced portfolio. Unless, that is, you buy into a radical explanation for low volatility: Perhaps the market is finally approaching efficiency.The efficient-market hypothesis has been roundly ridiculed since the Lehman crash, and for good reason.But one of the academic arguments against is that if markets were truly efficient, they would be much less volatile than they actually are, as       Robert Shiller,        now at Yale, set out in a 1981 paper. Investors should trade less and shares move around much less.

Germany hasn\u2019t seen significant tax cuts since the mid-2000s.\u201cOur plan for the future is prosperity and security for everybody,\u201d said Ms. Merkel, who according to opinion polls is the front-runner in the autumn ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s a government program that brings the country together and doesn\u2019t divide it.\u201dIn their joint platform, the conservatives pledged to bring unemployment down from 5.5% to below 3%, which economists consider full employment.The health of the German economy\u2014with its strong jobs market, budget surplus and declining public debt\u2014is one of Ms. Merkel\u2019s main assets in the campaign, though most economists credit       Gerhard Schr\u00f6der,        her predecessor as chancellor, for turning the country around with painful and unpopular economic reforms.Families are likely to be among the main beneficiaries of the conservatives\u2019 planned largesse. In addition to \u20ac15 billion ($17 billion) a year in income-tax cuts, the parties have pledged extra tax breaks for families with children and grants to home buyers with children. They also promised to phase out the unpopular \u201csolidarity tax,\u201d a 5.5% income-tax surcharge added in 1991 to help fund development in the former East Germany.In total, the platform would bring tax relief valued at \u20ac27 billion ($31 billion) annually, according to Germany\u2019s conservative MIT economic group, which includes more than 25,000 small and midsize businesses.Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc currently has a 15-percentage-point lead over the Social Democrats, according to an Emnid poll of 936 voters conducted between June 22 and 24. The poll showed 39% of the voters favored Ms. Merkel\u2019s camp while 24% support her center-left rivals.Ms. Merkel\u2019s rivals for the chancellorship in September\u2019s election have already lined up spending proposals that include free child care, higher unemployment benefits and infrastructure investment, as well as tax cuts that could leave German voters tens of billions of euros extra a year, economists said.The Social Democrats have pledged \u20ac5 billion in income-tax cuts, but they want to raise the burden on top earners while focusing the cuts on low- and middle-income households. They also pledged to keep state pensions at their present level without raising the retirement age. Given Germany\u2019s rapidly aging society, economists expect this to require significant increases in pension-insurance contributions.In the opposition, the pro-business Free Democrats aim to cut taxes by \u20ac30 billion a year. Others, including the antiestablishment AfD and the Left Party, want to focus spending on families, from one-time cash benefits for newborns to free day care and a near doubling in child benefits. The Greens have said they would earmark an extra \u20ac12 billion for families on low incomes and single parents.Despite their agreement on the economy, the conservatives failed to hammer out a joint position on how to tackle the continuing refugee crisis. The crisis has eased since 2015, when almost a million asylum seekers arrived in Germany, but security officials say they are still registering some 700 new arrivals daily.Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union wants the government to set an upper limit on new arrivals, something Ms. Merkel has refused to endorse.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 09:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/merkel-puts-economy-at-forefront-of-german-election-campaign-1499089861", "news_title": "Merkel Puts Economy at Forefront of German Election Campaign ", "keywords": " angela merkel,christian democrats, full employment,german election 2017, social democrats, tax cuts 2025,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "The U.S. Department of Transportation has pulled out of the group leading the $23.9 billion Gateway Program that includes digging a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River.In a letter sent to the Gateway Program Development Corporation board on Friday and obtained by The Wall Street Journal, the transportation department\u2019s acting general counsel said the federal government will \u201cpermanently withdraw\u201d from the board.\u201cIt is not DOT\u2019s standard practice to serve in such a capacity on other local transportation projects, and DOT\u2019s Trustee has had to recuse from several board actions already,\u201d acting general counsel       Judith Kaleta       wrote.The Gateway Program is the largest and, arguably, the most important infrastructure project in the Northeast. It aims to double rail capacity between Newark, N.J., and New York City by laying two new sets of tracks, building several new bridges and expanding New York Penn Station.\u2018It is not DOT\u2019s standard practice to serve in such a capacity on other local transportation projects.\u2019A spokesman for the Department of Transportation said Sunday that the withdrawal is \u201cconsistent with the department\u2019s provision of effective and objective oversight in instances where we provide financial assistance.\u201d\u201cThe decision underscores the department\u2019s commitment to ensuring there is no appearance of prejudice or partiality in favor of these projects ahead of hundreds of other projects nationwide,\u201d the spokesman added.\u201cThe decision to resign from the board should not be misinterpreted as a final decision about the multiple individual projects promoted by the Gateway Development Corporation.\u201dThe new rail tunnel is seen as a race against time because the current two-tube tunnel was flooded during superstorm Sandy. Its concrete bench walls, cables and wires are being eaten away by residue from the floodwaters.If one of the tubes has to be shut down for repair before the new tunnel is built, train capacity into New York would be reduced by 75%, stifling the Northeast Corridor rail line, the busiest in the country.Gateway\u2019s development corporation was created in 2015 with four trustees representing what were seen as the major partners in the program: one representative each from New York and New Jersey, one representative from Amtrak and one representative from the federal department of transportation.The Obama administration made Gateway a priority. It fast-tracked the rail tunnel\u2019s environmental review process and it committed to funding half of the entire program as well to providing low-cost loans that the states could draw upon to fund their 50% share.The creation of the development corporation was itself a sign of determination to get the long-sought project moving. The corporation was created to allow the agencies involved in Gateway to consider a variety of funding structures that might not have been possible through conventional channels, including possible private financing of some of the tunnel construction costs.The Trump administration, under Secretary       Elaine Chao,        has been less supportive. Earlier this year, President Trump\u2019s preliminary 2018 budget proposed to eliminate a grant program that the development corporation was relying upon for $750 million toward the building of a new Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River just east of Newark.Local funding for the bridge is in place and pre-construction work is due to begin within weeks even though it remains unclear if or when the federal government will supply its share of the funding.The interim executive director of the Gateway Program Development Corporation,       John Porcari,        said Sunday: \u201cMoving forward and completing the new Portal Bridge and Hudson River Tunnel is critical to create and preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs and to avoid the economic, transportation and environmental calamity that would occur were the existing tunnel to be closed before the new tunnel is opened.\u201dMr. Porcari added that the corporation believes that the Gateway Program \u201csatisfies each of the Administration\u2019s infrastructure priorities, including project sponsors committing their own financial resources. While the Gateway team knows that a project of national significance cannot proceed without a federal funding partner, we appreciate the important technical assistance provided by Secretary Chao and her team at USDOT in advancing this vital project.\u201dLast week, the transportation department delayed publication of a draft environmental impact statement for the rail tunnel, which was supposed to have been released on Friday as part of the expedited review process.The transportation department spokesman said Sunday: \u201cDOT expects to make several project announcements regarding the Northeast Corridor in the coming weeks, including the Hudson Tunnel and other projects in the region.

They were also a reminder of the highly abnormal situation bond markets find themselves in, with little or no cushion for investors against rising yields. It is too easy to lose money in bonds.Returns on bonds come from two sources: the interest income that accrues to holders and changes in bond prices. But years of zero-interest-rate policy have drastically reduced the former, making the latter far more important. That shift is important, in that it has changed the way in which normally reliable bonds behave.Take Germany, which was at the center of last week\u2019s repricing. The country\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond pays a coupon of 0.25%, and at the start of last week was priced nearly close to par, with a yield of 0.25%. By the end of the week, it yielded 0.47%, but the bond\u2019s price had dropped by around 2%, data from Tradeweb show. In other words, the price move in one week was equivalent to eight years of income: the 0.25% yield on offer at the start of the week was no protection against losses.It gets worse. Yields on all German government bonds that mature out to the start of 2024 are still negative, adding to the drag on returns. So far this year, the German bond market as a whole has returned minus 1.9%, according to             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch index data; of the four biggest eurozone economies, only Spain is in positive territory, by all of 0.1%.The U.S. is faring a bit better, and higher bond yields give a little more room for maneuver. But last week\u2019s swing still reduced year-to-date returns to 1.9% from 2.7% a week earlier on BAML\u2019s index.Even if yields don\u2019t surge higher from here\u2014with forces like demographics, regulation and still-soft inflation weighing on the market\u2014the outlook for returns is hardly inspiring.

Some swear that cleaning before bed, especially in hotter months, relaxes the muscles and improves sleep, while others insist an eye-opening morning shower is ideal. So which is it? One expert,       Temitayo Ogunleye,        an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine, has answers.Most people shower to remove or prevent body odor. That odor is produced in part by sebum, an oil the skin manufactures to keep it moisturized. When you shower, you remove the sebum from the skin\u2014along with all the dirt it can collect. Hot showers further strip the skin of sebum, dirt and potentially offensive odor.\u201cThat\u2019s why people are inclined to shower more frequently in summer,\u201d when sunblock and sweat may add to that tacky, dirty feeling, Dr. Ogunleye says. However, she adds, \u201clotion may marginally attract more dirt, but not enough to make a huge difference as far as odor.\u201dWhile the cultural norm in the U.S. is to shower at least once a day, typically in the morning, showering habits are actually more tied to culture than many would suspect. \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that different ethnicities produce different levels of sebum,\u201d the dermatologist says. \u201cSome people shower every night because that was what their family did,\u201d she says.For many Americans, there is a mental component to a morning shower: \u201cThat jolt of water wakes you up. It also makes many people feel fresh for the coming day,\u201d says Dr. Ogunleye, herself a morning washer. But because mornings can be so rushed, many forgo the sunrise rinse and instead wash at night. \u201cIf you like your sheets clean or work in a dirty or germ-filled job, that makes sense,\u201d she says.People with eczema or other skin conditions should take fewer showers, and use lukewarm, not hot, water to keep some of the sebum intact, she says. As long as your bedroom is cool and you\u2019re not sweating all night long, showering in the evening can give a nice coda to a long, hot day, with the added bonus of removing all that icky stick.She only recommends people shower twice a day if they participate in activities like swimming in bacteria-laden lakes, salty oceans or drying pools, or working out. If you wear open-toed shoes and stomp through city grime, evening showers are useful\u2014though for morning shower-takers, just washing the feet will suffice. \u201cDo most people need to take a second shower?\u201d Dr. Ogunleye asks. \u201cProbably no. Need is a strong term.\u201dSome studies have suggested that taking hot baths or showers in advance of a hot day might prep the body for the coming heat wave, but Dr. Ogunleye hasn\u2019t seen strong enough evidence to advise this. \u201cWhen air hits your skin when you step out of the shower, it\u2019s like sweating, which decreases your body\u2019s temperature,\u201d she says. \u201cAs that water evaporates, you will feel cooler, but that feeling lasts minutes, not hours,\u201d she says.When to shower is ultimately a question of preference. But in the summer, you might sleep more soundly with clean skin. \u201cKids usually shower at night, when they are sweaty and filthy after a long day, and that makes total sense,\u201d Dr. Ogunleye says.", "news_time": "2017-07-03 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-it-better-to-shower-at-night-in-the-summer-1499083200", "news_title": "Is It Better to Shower at Night in the Summer?", "keywords": "before bed,eczema,evening,morning,night,odor,sebum,showers,skin conditions,summer,Temitayo Ogunleye,political,general news,health"}, {"content": "Tara Comonte       struggled to make a perfect burger on her first day at the             Shake Shack        SHAK 0.03%       restaurant on the\u00a0Upper East Side of Manhattan.\u201cWorking in the shack was a physically hard day.

Part of Ms. Comonte\u2019s task will be to make sure investor expectations are realistic, Ms. Regan said. \u201cShe will have to protect the company\u2019s unique ability to think small while growing large.\u201dMs. Comonte said her focus at Shake Shack is to leverage the use of technology to connect with customers as the company continues to grow. Shake Shack launched its mobile app earlier this year allowing customers to skip the physical line.The app is only one piece of the broader technology push. Ms. Comonte is looking to bolster the company\u2019s internal processes through technology that supports inventory, invoicing and other financial systems.Ms. Comonte joined the company a little more than two weeks ago, succeeding       Jeff Uttz,        who retired earlier this year. She was previously CFO at Getty Images Inc., a digital media company. Before Getty, she was finance chief for McCann Worldgroup, a subsidiary of             Interpublic Group of Co      s., a publicly traded advertising company.It was Ms. Comonte\u2019s marketing experience and brand awareness that made her a good fit for the company, said Randall Garutti, Shake Shack\u2019s chief executive.\u201cShake Shack is such a strong brand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed a CFO who understands how the brand informs the financials.\u201dMs. Comonte was cognizant of Shake Shack\u2019s brand value even before she was brought on board. \u201cAs a New Yorker, I knew Shake Shack. It was a brand I love, a brand my kids love,\u201d she said.Now, she\u2019s tasked with preserving that brand identity from a glass office at Union Square, Manhattan, not too far away from the first store that opened in Madison Square Park in 2004. Working for \u201cthe shack,\u201d as employees call it, is about identifying and keeping the cultural feel of a startup.\u201cI can\u2019t help this company if I come in and try to put in practices or systems or processes that happen to work for me elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Comonte said.On a late June morning, a group of employees at the company\u2019s headquarters, wrapped up a monthly morning meeting with Mr. Garutti and Ms. Comonte joining Shake Shack\u2019s loud clap anthem.\u201cIt would have been perfectly acceptable for them to hire a typical public company restaurant executive,\u201d Ms. Regan said. \u201cBut in this case, the cultural fit and financial experience is important, and not coming out of the restaurant business.\u201dMs. Comonte plans to continue to spend more time in the stores, even after she finishes her three-day kitchen training period, to get insight into what processes she can centralize, or bring back to headquarters, to be more efficient, she said.Ms. Comonte said her work in the restaurant didn\u2019t stop once the burger patty was smashed and seared on both sides. She had to scrape stuff off the griddle and start all over again, ending her day elbow deep in dish soap, scrubbing pans. On a second day at a different store, she was responsible for assembling the orders.\u201cAll I wanted to do was eat the fries,\u201d she said.", "news_time": "2017-07-03 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shake-shack-to-serve-up-changes-with-new-finance-chief-1499083201", "news_title": "Shake Shack to Serve Up Changes With New Finance Chief", "keywords": "Shake Shack,SHAK,Shake Shack Cl A,Tara Comonte,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "The Bank of England faces strike action by some of its staff after a ballot of workers in the maintenance, parlors and security departments found 95% supported a series of walkouts.The Unite labor union Monday said that, as a result of the ballot, staff will strike on July 31, and August 1, 2 and 3 unless the BOE acts to resolve a dispute over pay.The BOE said the three departments account for just 2% of its employees and it has plans in place to ensure it can \u201ccontinue to operate effectively.\u201dStaff have been given a 1% pay rise for the year commencing March 1, in line with a cap on public sector wages imposed as part of the government\u2019s efforts to cut borrowing, though the central bank isn\u2019t bound by that rule.

Party putsches have turned out three prime ministers since 2010, and he had said over the weekend that he would quit politics if he lost the leadership of the Liberal Party, the more conservative of the two main blocs.\u201cI can assure you I will be prime minister for many, many years to come,\u201d Mr. Turnbull told reporters Monday. \u201cI will be running at the 2019 election and will win.\u201dWith his coalition trailing in opinion polls after scraping through cliffhanger elections a year ago, Mr. Turnbull has been beset by party turmoil. The man he ousted two years ago, Tony Abbott, has railed in speeches against what he calls a leftward drift under Mr. Turnbull.For months, surveys by Newspoll\u2014triggers for previous leadership challenges\u2014have shown Mr. Turnbull\u2019s Liberal-National coalition trailing the opposition Labor Party by around 53% to 47%.Labor leader Bill Shorten, a former union official, has proved a more durable opponent for Mr. Turnbull than many expected, positioning his party as most-trusted on education and health care.Mr. Turnbull in turn has borrowed from populist measures that propelled U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       victory, such as tightening immigration rules and increasing military spending. He has also courted left-leaning and centrist voters with a multibillion-dollar tax increase on banks\u2014a popular target. And seeking to ease household-energy costs in cities like Sydney, the government has restricted exports of liquefied natural gas exports by             Royal Dutch Shell,Exxon Mobil                   and others.But partisan rancor spilled over last month after a senior member of Mr. Turnbull\u2019s cabinet,       Christopher Pyne,        said moderate lawmakers in the government are now politically ascendant and could drive social changes such as legalizing same-sex marriage.The combative Mr. Abbott, a former seminarian from the right wing of the Liberal Party, said Mr. Turnbull had abandoned traditional supporters by backing gay marriage and climate-change action, increasing government borrowing and pushing for Australia to become a republic.\u201cThere\u2019s a fight for the kind of policy which a Liberal-National government should be on about,\u201d Mr. Abbott said Monday. \u201cNow, traditionally what we\u2019ve been on about is lower taxes, smaller government, greater freedom.\u201dThe leadership \u201csoap opera\u201d is distracting from necessary reforms, said Deputy Prime Minister       Barnaby Joyce.       One major newspaper complained of a \u201cdecade of major-party tomfoolery\u201d\u2014with leadership battles that undermined not just Mr. Abbott, but previous Labor administrations of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard\u2014and compared Australia with postwar Italy for instability.Mr. Turnbull does have one advantage over his ousted predecessors: There isn\u2019t an obvious challenger within his party, said       Jill Sheppard,        a political analyst at the Australian National University.Some of Mr. Turnbull\u2019s woes are due to the same forces seen in Europe and the U.S., Dr. Sheppard said: the rise of anti-elite voters disenchanted by globalization, rising joblessness outside cities, the decline of manufacturing, and competition from migrants.\u201cIt\u2019s just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in Australian politics,\u201d she said.Write to Rob Taylor at rob.taylor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 07:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-australian-politics-its-turmoil-time-once-more-1499080948", "news_title": "In Australian Politics, It\u2019s Turmoil Time Once More ", "keywords": "australian politics,australia ouster,australia politics,austrialian prime minister,labor,liberal-nationals,Liberal-National,Liberal Party,Malcolm Turnbull,Tony Abbott,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The settlement in the case regarding health insurer             Anthem Inc.       could make it possible for plaintiffs in future class action cases involving data breaches to argue they were harmed as a result of their personal information being stolen or exposed.Anthem has agreed to pay $115 million to settle a class action suit filed in the wake of a 2015 data breach that exposed information--including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and health-care identification numbers--belonging to more than 78 million people. The proposed settlement, which still requires court approval, promises to pay for two years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection for plaintiffs, along with a $15 million fund to compensate victims for any out-of-pocket costs incurred as a result of the breach.That deal, lawyers say, opens a new door for consumers affected by a data breach case to argue they have been harmed. Courts often refuse to hear proposed breach class actions because victims can\u2019t effectively argue their information, which was exposed as part of the breach, was used against them. Anthem consistently denied that the breach did harm to consumers, though outside legal experts suggested the company agreed to settle because of vulnerabilities in its argument.\u201cThe court allowed the plaintiffs to bring to trial the Anthem privacy policies,\u201d said Mark Paulding, senior counsel specializing in privacy matters at Info Law Group LLP. \u201cThe promises and disclosures in those policies could be a triable fact over whether Anthem defrauded customers by incorporating the privacy policy into insurance contracts.\u201dDoing so, Mr. Paulding said, would include demonstrating that promises made in the privacy policy were an extension of a customer\u2019s\u2019 insurance contract.\u201cThere could have been some very ugly facts brought out there,\u201d Mr. Paulding said.It is not clear whether any such factors played a part in the Anthem settlement.An Anthem spokeswoman referred questions to a fact sheet on the company\u2019s website. Lawyers for Anthem could not immediately be reached for comment.Anthem didn\u2019t encrypt the stolen customer information, the Wall Street Journal reported one week after the breach was revealed, and was not required to do so under the terms of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. HIPAA requires health care firms to \u201caddress\u201d encryption in their systems, but does not compel firms to use encryption if that would create an unreasonable burden.\u201cThere were no legal violations, so it may be the case that Anthem did nothing technically wrong and are still agreeing to pay $115 million,\u201d said James J. Ward, an attorney specializing in data security at Bilzin Sumberg. \u201cThe data they kept wasn\u2019t encrypted, but legally speaking there wasn\u2019t any reason to encrypt it. The question is whether that wades into negligence.\u201dThose questions will almost certainly become more difficult for courts to answer, in part because security standards update so quickly. Encrypting information, especially tens of millions of customer records, is a cumbersome, expensive process that has nonetheless been recommended by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other regulators.Before the data breach settlement, Anthem agreed to spend $260 million to upgrade its information security systems as part of a deal with insurance regulators. Yet the challenges will only become more complicated--and expensive--as cyberattackers dedicate more resources to stealing sensitive data .Neither the Federal Bureau of Investigation nor other U.S. investigators involved in the Anthem breach have pointed to a final suspect, though the cybersecurity vendors and the research community quickly decided hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government were responsible. Beijing has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack.Even the best-funded private enterprises are ill equipped to withstand a prolonged cyberattack conducted by a military. Yet the high price tags on class action suits seem to suggest that breach penalties will only continue to grow.\u201cWe have tacitly told health care, as a nation, they need to withstand nation state attacks,\u201d said       Kevin Mandia,        chief executive of the cybersecurity vendor             FireEye Inc.,       which was involved in the Anthem investigation.(Jeff Stone writes exclusively for WSJ Pro Cybersecurity.

Now, new cereals, snacks and beverages from Kraut Krisps to Gut Punches and Wellness Waters are featuring the microorganisms touted to help digestive and immune systems function.Mariani\u2019s Probiotic Prunes say they \u201cdeliver active cultures 10 times more effectively than yogurt.\u201d Brad\u2019s Raw Foods LLC\u2019s kale chips has added \u201cshielded probiotics to promote digestive and immune health.\u201d The number of food products in the U.S. making a probiotic-related claim has nearly tripled to more than 500 in the last five years, according to food market research firm Innova Market Insights.The additions come as consumers are looking for medicinal, in addition to nutritional, benefits from their food. \u201cPeople now want food to be functionally formulated, not just delicious,\u201d says       Elizabeth Moskow,        culinary director for food consultancy Sterling-Rice Group in Boulder, Colo. Many stores stock the probiotic-infused foods, but some retailers filter the offerings, skeptical of some of the claims that otherwise less-healthy foods may make.New strains of probiotics don\u2019t require refrigeration. These newer spore-forming strains produce coated cell structures that help extend probiotics\u2019 shelf life. Still, most probiotics can\u2019t survive heat, processing or air exposure and often degrade with time.The new food introductions reflect a growing consumer interest in gut health and the belief that the microbial composition of the intestines can foster good health outcomes. The impact of probiotics on digestive health is well documented, says       Robert Hutkins,        a professor of food science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A 2014 study published in the journal Vaccine looked at 500 hospital patients who were suffering from antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Those patients who received the highest doses of probiotics showed the most symptom relief compared with those patients who got more moderate doses or none at all. The benefits of probiotics on other body functions, from sleep to stress, however, are less clear.Ganeden Inc. began selling a branded spore-forming strain of probiotic bacteria called GanedenBC30 to food and beverage manufacturers in 2008, when it had eight natural-foods customers. Today nearly 800 food products are pitching BC30 as a probiotic ingredient, chief executive       Mike Bush       says.He argues that the health message pays off. It can cost a company 3 to 4 cents a serving, which might then mean the consumer pays an additional 6 to 8 cents a serving.Compared with the cost of taking additional supplements, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty minimal investment,\u201d he says. A 45-day supply of Bayer TruBiotics supplements costs about $30.Some food scientists argue that, unlike strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, which are more documented in scientific research and typically appear in yogurt, there are far fewer studies on spore-forming varieties now appearing in so many foods.\u201cThe industry is introducing them into foods far faster than the clinical research can keep up,\u201d says Prof. Hutkins.Mr. Bush says the company\u2019s probiotic is recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration and has appeared in 26 pieces of published research since 2009.Earlier this year, the International Probiotics Association worked with the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association for the supplements industry, to establish voluntary guidelines on labeling, stability testing and storage recommendations. In February, representatives from the association met with Food and Drug Administration officials to present its guidelines. \u201cWe want them to know the industry is doing a good job of setting good standards and self-policing,\u201d says Ganeden\u2019s Mr. Bush, who is president of the probiotics association\u2019s board of directors. FDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer says that the agency \u201cencourages dietary supplements manufacturers who have questions about their products to meet with the agency.\u201dMondelez International Inc.\u2019s       Enjoy Life infuses probiotics in their $7 baking mixes for muffins, waffles and pizza crust. \u201cConsumers want something that is healthier\u2014not necessarily healthy,\u201d says       Joel Warady,        the brand\u2019s chief sales and marketing officer.Still, some retailers, such as             Whole Foods,       are cracking down on suppliers it says try to pitch more foods as good for you because they contain probiotics. \u201cWe would see a cheese pizza with added Bacillis coagulants marketed as a health-enhancing food to consumers when it was relatively high in fat and sodium,\u201d says       Joe Dickson,        Whole Foods Market Inc.\u2019s quality standards coordinator. He says the retailer works with suppliers to make sure the nutrition label is kept in check even with the addition of a probiotic.The probiotics have also inspired new packaging. Karma Probiotics Wellness Waters have a special cap that allows consumers to push the powdered probiotic into the beverage when they are ready to drink from the 18-ounce plastic bottle.Dan Johnson,        a 30-year old pastor in Durham, N.C., says he tries to consume some form of probiotics every day to help with digestion. He likes the Wellness Waters, because it helps reduce the amount of sodas and sugary drinks he consumes. \u201cI try to drink one of those a day,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has certainly helped my issue.\u201dWrite to Anne Marie Chaker at anne-marie.chaker@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-03 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/probiotics-with-your-pizza-1499079602", "news_title": "Probiotics With Your Pizza?", "keywords": "digestive health,gut biome,gut health,probiotic,probiotic foods,yogurt,Sterling-Rice Group,Mondelez International Cl A,MDLZ,political,general news,natural environment,food,drink,health,living,lifestyle,nutrition,air,water,land quality,advertising,marketing,public relations,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is accused of amassing billions of dollars as the leader of the world\u2019s biggest drug-trafficking organization.Now he is struggling to pay for a private lawyer.It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t afford one. But Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, from his detention facility in lower Manhattan, has to first figure out how to get a hold of money to pay his legal fees.The U.S. government wants to seize $14 billion of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s alleged drug profits if he is convicted, which could make his payments to lawyers vulnerable to forfeiture. Before agreeing to represent Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, any defense lawyer will likely demand an upfront fee and seek assurance from prosecutors that the government won\u2019t block the payment or indict the lawyer later for money laundering.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has pleaded not guilty to 17 criminal charges, including drug trafficking, money laundering and murder conspiracy. His trial is scheduled to begin in Brooklyn federal court on April 16, 2018.Since his extradition to New York in January, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has interviewed at least 16 defense lawyers, according to court filings.Jeffrey Lichtman, a seasoned criminal defense attorney in New York, is the front-runner to become Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyer, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lichtman, who famously secured an acquittal for John A. Gotti, son of the notorious mob boss, has been engaged in discussions with the government about his possible representation of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, the people say.A spokesman for the Brooklyn U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which is leading the prosecution against Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, declined to comment. Mr. Lichtman said, \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to comment at this time.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has been represented by court-appointed federal defenders, who are funded by taxpayer dollars and intended for low-income defendants. The government has opposed his use of federal defenders, calling him a billionaire who can afford his own lawyer.However, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s federal defenders said he \u201chas no ability to access funds himself\u201d and needs to determine if a relative or friend can help pay the legal fees, according to a court filing from March. The process has been prolonged because the government monitors his communications and has severely restricted his ability to contact his family, court documents say.Lawyers must have a good-faith basis for believing the money they are receiving from clients isn\u2019t the product of criminal proceeds, according to Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University School of Law. If the money is later found to be \u201cdirty,\u201d the government can force the lawyer to forfeit the fee.The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a lawyer in federal prosecutions, but the Supreme Court has ruled that defendants aren\u2019t entitled to use money subject to forfeiture to pay for counsel. In a 1989 decision, the justices used an analogy that a robbery suspect couldn\u2019t hire a lawyer with money that was stolen from a bank.A similar issue arose in 2010 during the case against five associates of Bernard Madoff, when federal prosecutors sought to seize payments to defense lawyers, alleging they were the profits of Mr. Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme. After several months of litigation, a federal appeals court ruled in the government\u2019s favor. Some lawyers in the case opted to stay on and be paid with taxpayer dollars under the Criminal Justice Act, at a rate of approximately $100 an hour.Any lawyer who takes money from Mr. Guzm\u00e1n must apply for a special license from the Treasury Department that would allow the lawyer to conduct financial transactions with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. The department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control blacklisted Mr. Guzman in 2001, which generally bars U.S. citizens from conducting such transactions with him. OFAC has also blacklisted several family members and associates of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n.For Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s defense team, there are obstacles beyond getting paid.Obtaining a favorable outcome at trial or sentencing will be a major challenge. The evidence against Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, often called the most notorious drug trafficker in the world, covers nearly 30 years of alleged criminal activity, and there are more than 40 witnesses ready to testify against him, according to prosecutors.If Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is convicted on the first count alone of \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise,\u201d he faces mandatory life imprisonment. Mexico agreed to extradite Mr. Guzm\u00e1n after the U.S. promised not to seek the death penalty against him.There is also the logistical issue of meeting with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to prepare his defense. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is in solitary confinement 23 hours a day and has been placed under extraordinary security measures, given he escaped twice from high-security prisons in Mexico.When lawyers visit, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n speaks to them through a metal screen and is separated from them by a Plexiglass divider. Federal defenders have asked to meet with him in the same room, saying the current arrangement makes it almost impossible for them to review large volumes of evidence with him.The government says the regular attorney visitation room has cords and wires that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n could use to injure himself and prompt a trip to the hospital, where he could more easily escape. He could also use items in the room to take his lawyers hostage, prosecutors said.U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan has rejected multiple requests from federal defenders to loosen Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s confinement conditions, although the judge did allow Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to send pre-cleared letters to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, to facilitate his hiring of a private lawyer.Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/latest-legal-woes-for-el-chapo-paying-for-a-lawyer-1499079600", "news_title": "Latest Legal Woes for \u2018El Chapo\u2019: Paying for a Lawyer", "keywords": "el chapo,el chapo lawyer,el chapo trial,political,general news,crime,legal action"}, {"content": "Whether the             Nintendo        NTDOY 2.82%       Switch or             Sony\u2019s        SNE 0.47%       PlayStation 4 is a better videogame console is a matter of debate. When it comes to their Japanese makers\u2019 share prices, Sony is clearly the better bet.Nintendo has staged a remarkable share-price rally of late, gaining 50% this year and briefly taking over its rival\u2019s market value. At Monday\u2019s prices, both are valued at nearly $50 billion.That looks like an anomaly. Revenue at Sony\u2019s games and network division alone is more than three times that of Nintendo, and it enjoys better operating margins. Add in Sony\u2019s other businesses in areas like image sensors and music and financial services, and its operating profit is almost 10 times that of Nintendo\u2019s.True, Nintendo is sitting on $8.4 billion of net cash. But while it trades at an enterprise value of 27 times its forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Sony trades at six times its Ebitda. The difference reflects the market\u2019s blind optimism that Nintendo can pull off stunning growth. Analysts estimate its operating profit will increase nearly eightfold in the next two years, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Sure, the Switch console has been selling like hot cakes, contrary to prelaunch predictions. Yet it is still too early to tell if that will last beyond the initial craze. Some investors clearly hope Nintendo will adapt more of its valuable franchises such as Pok\u00e9mon and Super Mario to be used on mobile devices. The opportunity there is great for Nintendo, but its past mobile rollouts have been flawed and it isn\u2019t clear how committed the company is to this platform.Sony offers a more reliable growth prospect. Operating profit at its game segment grew 53% last year, mostly because of a one-third increase in revenue from its high-margin subscription-based business, which allows users to play against other gamers, download goodies and stream movies, among other things.

Most vocal are governors of states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell risked the pressure, perhaps unavoidably, when he delayed a vote on the bill until after lawmakers return to Washington next week. Republican leaders must flip seven of the nine GOP senators who have publicly stated their opposition\u2014a challenge compounded by the recess.The dollar lost 1% last week, closing its worst two-quarter stretch since 2011. Down 5.6% in the first half as investors grew more confident that economic recoveries elsewhere are gaining on or surpassing growth in the U.S., the dollar has come under fresh pressure since central-bank officials in Europe and Canada last week strongly signaled they could soon begin winding down measures meant to spur economic growth. Viewing these statements as a sign of strength and a possible portent of higher interest rates in those countries, investors rushed to buy the currencies, and the euro soared to its highest level against the dollar in more than a year. As recently as six months ago, few expected such a turnabout.The leader declaring an end to the Islamic State caliphate is someone few would have imagined in the position. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, seen as the favorite of none but acceptable to all, managed to turn that tepid sentiment into a defining strength. Over nearly three years in office, the 65-year-old former electrical engineer has narrowed gaps between Iraq\u2019s warring Shiite and Sunni politicians. He balanced competing interests among geopolitical rivals Iran and the U.S., and spearheaded an overhaul of Iraqi security forces, who had fled advancing Islamic State fighters. Now, Iraq is close to retaking the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul. We look at how Mr. Abadi sought to keep everyone on the same side.Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll hasn\u2019t ruled American pop culture for decades, but in the South, it is enjoying a renaissance. From the garage-punk bands of Nashville to Atlanta\u2019s metal-heads, Southern rock is flourishing, sprouting new acts, clubs and publications. The new acts are different from their predecessors: They are multiethnic and tackle thorny subjects with a centrist voice. Rather than hiding their accents, they take pride in their Southernness and flaunt it. Musically, they\u2019ve splintered into styles from retro-soul and revved-up Lynyrd Skynyrd-esque rock to punk. The latest rock revival shows how dramatically the region\u2019s demographic and economic landscape is changing. We explore how what unites the new crop of bands is their inclusive definition of Southernness.Nathan\u2019s Famous July Fourth hot-dog eating contest has been dominated by international and West Coast eaters, but some New York-area contestants have their sights set on reclaiming the mustard-belt trophy.

While I understand that GE would choose to move factories abroad for strategic purposes to expand their company, it\u2019s disheartening to see people in my own town left unemployed as GE makes cuts as they prepare to move abroad. At its height, GE had around 30,000 people employed in the Schenectady facility, but it is now closer to 4,000 employees. The results of these layoffs are evident in the lifestyle of the Schenectady residents\u2026It\u2019s sad to see how GE\u2019s global expansion comes at the expense of the everyday American people.\u201d And David P. Miller of Michigan said: \u201cAs the global economy grows it makes perfect sense for U.S. companies to manufacture goods in other countries.

Moeller-Maersk        AMKBY 0.55%       A/S hit operations at the world\u2019s biggest container-ship operator in a single flash but the business is still recovering nearly a week later. Maersk Chief Operating Officer       Vincent Clerc       tells the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris that computer screens suddenly \u201cwent blank,\u201d as systems from email to cargo booking and APM Terminals operations in the U.S., Europe and India shut down. One early decision in the cyberattack proved critical: Maersk pulled the plug on its entire system once it realized it was under siege, opting not to trigger a backup system because it feared the backup could also be infected. The company says its operations are largely running today but that cargo handling and booking in some areas aren\u2019t up to normal speed. Maersk expects various areas to come back online this week even as the carrier, and the rest of the shipping industry, assesses safeguards against such attacks in the future.Shortages of some low-cost but critical medicines are hitting U.S. health-care supply chains, raising overall costs and treatment risks. The latest scarcity is sterile talc powder, a relatively simple medicine used to treat a serious lung problem affecting 150,000 Americans, the WSJ\u2019s Peter Loftus reports, one of dozens of shortages in some medical products causing problems in the U.S. In this case, supplies of sterile talc have dwindled because of a production problem at the only U.S. supplier, Lymol Medical, which relies on a single contract manufacturer. That\u2019s a recipe for greater supply-chain risk, and in fact studies say similar problems across U.S. medical businesses have triggered chronic drug shortages. That adds more than $400 million in annual health-care costs as hospitals and doctors seek more expensive alternatives. One cause is basic economics: companies face thinner profit margins for older, low-cost drugs and so have less incentive to invest in production.Upheaval in retail trade is bringing a new lineup of suppliers to the forefront. In the midst of a broader reset of its business,             Target Corp.       is cleaning house in its apparel and home furnishings segments, shedding some stalwart brands and launching more than a dozen new ones over the next 18 months. Faced with slumping sales and stiff competition from rivals\u2014most prominently             Amazon.com Inc.      \u2014Target is trying to tap broader consumer trends toward niche brands, the WSJ\u2019s       Elizabeth Holmes       writes, with distinctive personality beyond the mass-market mainstream. That\u2019s similar to the moves             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       has made with its recent acquisitions of niche online sellers including Bonobos and Moosejaw. In this case, however, Target is hoping fresh clothing and furnishings launches will drive more traffic to stores.

President Donald Trump highlighted his call for a new pact in a meeting with South Korea\u2019s president, the WSJ\u2019s Carol E.

All regulatory clearances have been granted for the transaction, which is expected to be completed in three months.Abraaj didn\u2019t disclose how much it paid for Java House Group, but previous reports indicate that the seller, Emerging Capital Partners, was looking for about $100 million for its 90% stake in the group.While the value of the deal is relatively low, it marks the first serious investment in an African casual-dining chain. Abraaj Group is one of the most important investors in the Middle East and Africa, and its choice to invest in Java House Group at this time, when African economies have lost some of their shine because of the commodities crash, marks a reboot of investor interest for the broader region. This is the first major secondary exit for a private-equity fund in Kenya, creating a benchmark for future deals.The fund has several businesses in Kenya ranging from a steel factory to a dairy firm. It has joined with French food and dairy giant             Danone                   in Brookside Dairy Limited, a firm partly owned by the family of Kenyan president       Uhuru Kenyatta.       Sub-Saharan Africa has grown in importance for Abraaj in recent years. Until a few years ago the fund was mostly focused on the Middle East but has increasingly positioned itself as an emerging-markets specialist with businesses in Latin America, Asia and Africa.Abraaj bought the chain from private-equity firm ECP, which had in turn bought it from its founder in 2012. The founder, American       Kevin Ashley,        had retained 10% in the group, which he is also selling to Abraaj, but he will stay on as adviser or board member, Abraaj said.\u201cThe Abraaj acquisition of Java House signifies a maturing African private equity industry, especially as Abraaj is acquiring Java House from another leading PE firm, Emerging Capital Partners (ECP),\u201d said       Michelle Kathryn Essom\u00e9,        chief executive of AVCA, the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. \u201cIt reinforces findings from our research, which showed a significant increase in PE-to-PE sales in the last year. This transaction suggests a continuation of the trend and demonstrates the plethora of attractive opportunities in Africa,\u201d she added.Abraaj plans to grow Java House Group in \u201cmultiple avenues,\u201d       Ashish Patel,        the fund\u2019s Nairobi-based managing director, said in an interview.\u201cThere are themes that can be introduced on the Java platform, and geographic expansion further into Uganda and Rwanda plus other East African countries,\u201d Mr. Patel said. He said that Tanzania would be the most obvious next country to take Java to because of geographical proximity, but he will also be looking to take the brand across the continent to Ghana and Nigeria.He added that Java could also interest international franchise owners looking for a reliable partner in sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cWhoever that international brand may be, they would be interested in quality and hygiene, and that\u2019s something Java can uniquely offer,\u201d he said.Java House Group includes 60 coffee and fast-food shops in 10 cities\u00a0across Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda,\u00a0the frozen-yogurt\u00a0chain Planet Yogurt and the upmarket pizzeria called 360 Pizza.The transaction is the fourth for Abraaj\u2019s third Africa fund, which closed at $990 million in 2015. Abraaj has placed $3.2 billion in 80 investments across Africa, a spokeswoman said.Java House has seen fast growth in its home market of Kenya: in the five years that ECP has owned it, it went from 13 stores in Nairobi to 60 in three countries. In recent months, smaller Java House shops have been opening next to petrol stations, and they have been bustling with business. Java House serves some 320,000 guest checks a month, and employs 2,000 people, Abraaj said.Kenya\u2019s market has long been of interest to investors looking to tap its growing middle class. Its economy has been resilient in recent years, maintaining an annual growth rate of over 5%\u2014well above the continent\u2019s average\u2014when African giants like South Africa and Nigeria have stalled significantly at the back of the commodities price crash.But concerns still linger about the robustness and longevity of Kenya\u2019s growth story and, just ahead of elections in August, investors are holding out in case volatility and violence observed in previous electoral cycles return, unsettling the economy.The Kenyan market has also been rattled in recent weeks by financial trouble hitting the biggest retail chain in East Africa, Kenyan supermarket chain Nakumatt, casting further doubt on the true potential of businesses targeting middle-class consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0fair to say we have a perfect storm happening in Kenya, with elections, a credit crunch, Nakumatt,\u201d Mr. Patel said.\u201cWhat we are likely to see is a year of difficulty, generally in the market 12-18 months, which we will ride out postelection and as soon as the credit cycle loosens up,\u201d he added.He said Abraaj is looking to hold on to Java for five to six years.Some $23 billion\u00a0has been invested in Africa\u00a0by private-equity firms since 2011,\u00a0with $3.8 billion in transactions last year,\u00a0a significant decline since 2014, when a peak of $8.1 billion was invested across the continent, according to AVCA, the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.\u2014       Nicolas Parasie       in Dubai contributed to this articleWrite to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 06:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/abraaj-acquires-kenya-based-java-house-group-1499072820", "news_title": "Abraaj Acquires Kenya-Based Java House Group", "keywords": "abraaj group,acquisition,african market,african middle class,casual dining,coffee shop,emerging capital partners,java house group,m&a,merger,private equity,Abraaj Group,Emerging Capital Partners,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The era of global easy money may be nearing a turning point, a development that could test frothy financial markets that have enjoyed vast monetary support since the 2007-09 financial crisis.The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since the end of 2015, including two increases this year, and has outlined plans to begin reducing its portfolio of Treasury and mortgage securities.Other central banks are signaling they may be ready to follow as their economies strengthen, which would mark an important shift in the long postcrisis recovery.VIEW InteractiveAmong 21 central banks profiled here by The Wall Street Journal, four are seen as possibly moving to ease monetary policy, and three are viewed as potentially raising rates. The other 14 likely will be on hold.But even among central banks unlikely to make changes this quarter, a move away from an easing bias seems under way.In late June, European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       hinted the ECB might start winding down its large bond-purchase program launched in 2015, designed to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate economic growth. The eurozone has witnessed a strong run of economic data this year.Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments came the day before Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       said excess slack in Canada\u2019s economy has been absorbed \u201csteadily,\u201d a clue some investors say points to an increase in short-term rates as early as July.Meanwhile, Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       in late June said interest rates in the U.K. may need to rise if the economy stays on track. He laid out conditions for the economy to meet before officials withdraw stimulus they implemented after last year\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. While a move isn\u2019t expected this quarter, it shows the balance has increasingly tilted toward removing support rather than providing it.On the flip side, a handful of central banks\u2014in Brazil, South Africa and India\u2014see an opportunity to cut rates to boost economic growth. In China, officials may slightly loosen their monetary stance ahead of a Communist Party national congress later this year, but the People\u2019s Bank of China is likely to leave its main one-year borrowing and lending rates unchanged.See the full third-quarter outlook.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-central-banking-in-2017-1499076000", "news_title": "Global Central Banking in 2017", "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The opening up of China\u2019s financial markets is gathering pace\u2014a bond trading link between the mainland and Hong Kong launched Monday, which should make it easier for foreign investors to access the country\u2019s $8.5 trillion bond market. Pockets of opportunity exist there, but only for those with their eyes wide open.China\u2019s bond market is already the world\u2019s third largest, but there is much scope for it to grow. At current levels, it is only equivalent to around three-quarters of the country\u2019s GDP: by contrast, the U.S. bond market is twice the size of the economy. While the market now largely consists of government bonds, Beijing is keen for Chinese companies to become less reliant on bank funding and tap bond buyers more.For the yield-hungry global investor, there are already decent returns on offer, thanks in part to the yuan\u2019s recent strength and higher rates. A one-year yuan-denominated Chinese government bond currently has a total return close to 5%, for example, in dollar terms. A five-year Chinese government bond or a bond issued by a state-owned Chinese policy bank yields around 1.5 percentage points more than the equivalent U.S. Treasury. Both of these bond types have almost nonexistent default risk and are actively traded.The market\u2019s biggest challenge to date has been mispriced credit. More than 90% of Chinese bonds have some sort of government backing, skewing investor perceptions of actual risk: some state-owned companies have defaulted in the past year. Local rating companies are too forgiving on their credit assessment of companies, with more than 95% of rated corporate bonds assigned to one of the top three credit ratings.A silver lining is emerging, as investors force struggling Chinese borrowers to compensate them better for their higher risk. The difference in yields between unsecured, low-rated bonds and the highest quality, secured bonds has risen to its highest level in two years in recent months.All this bodes well for parts of the Chinese bond market. Yet investors can\u2019t just rely on bottom-up analysis of Chinese companies\u2019 financials. Intangible risks abound, from sudden regulatory clampdowns to whole industries falling out of political favor. Bond issuers that are assumed to have the implicit backing of Beijing or state-owned banks can suddenly lose such support. Pricing this type of risk remains tricky for even the best credit analysts.", "news_time": "2017-07-03 05:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-bond-market-is-attractivefor-the-wary-1499075490", "news_title": "China\u2019s Bond Market Is Attractive\u2014for the Wary", "keywords": "bond connect,bond trading link,china bond market,china bonds,china credit,china hong kong bond connect,economic performance,indicators,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "ZHENGZHOU, China\u2014Farmer Zhang Hailin remembers the day in 2010 when he watched as helicopters flew in over fields of corn and wheat here, hovering in spots to drop balloon-shaped markers.\u201cThree days later, a hundred bulldozers were here,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.The iPhone was coming, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before a new industrial town on the edge of Zhengzhou would be known as iPhone City.Within months, boxy beige factory buildings appeared, power lines were connected and buses packed with workers began rolling up to             Foxconn Technology                   Group, which assembles most of             Apple Inc.\u2019s        AAPL 0.63%       smartphones.A year later, Foxconn\u2019s billionaire chairman       Terry Gou       said the iPhone factory complex had 100,000 workers.

Foxconn said it employs 1 million people across China and elsewhere, including southern Shenzhen, where it began manufacturing the first iPhone amid great secrecy.With Apple embracing outsourced manufacturing in Chinese cities, the iPhone\u2019s success in the decade since it launched has fueled China\u2019s rise at the center of the global electronics supply chain.The explosion of higher-tech manufacturing was encouraged by Beijing as leaders sought to move factories up the value chain from making plastic toys and clothes. That shift transformed the lives of millions of Chinese, bringing welcome jobs but also leading to complaints from some workers of repetitive labor, restrictive work rules and crowded living conditions in company housing.The iPhone\u2019s global success has increased scrutiny of Apple and its suppliers. The Cupertino, Calif., company said it holds Foxconn and others \u201cto the strictest standards in the industry.\u201d It said it has educated 12 million workers on their rights, ensured workweeks don\u2019t exceed 48 hours, and offered career- and personal-development courses. \u201cWe hold our suppliers to the standard we hold ourselves: They must treat everyone with dignity and respect,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. Apple said wages and working conditions at its suppliers have improved significantly in the past five years.The move to Zhengzhou followed a spate of suicides in 2010 at Foxconn\u2019s other primary iPhone production facility in Shenzhen, along the coast where wages were higher. Foxconn said in response to questions from The Wall Street Journal that many factors were behind choosing Zhengzhou, including the proximity to workers\u2019 hometowns, and suitable infrastructure and transportation.\u201cZhengzhou\u2019s pro-business policies and the investment the government continues to make to build strong infrastructure to support manufacturing make the province an attractive location for our operations,\u201d Foxconn said in a statement.Like American company towns a century ago\u2014Pullman, Ill., Hershey, Pa., and Henry Ford\u2019s Detroit\u2014iPhone City revolves mainly around a single product, and it largely depends on that product for its wealth.In iPhone City, shopping malls, restaurants and karaoke parlors, some started by former Foxconn workers, sprouted to cater to the Foxconn workforce. Government statistics indicate that exports of electronics have skyrocketed from Henan, a poor province of 94 million people with Zhengzhou at its heart.Officials had welcomed the iPhone: China\u2019s top leaders greenlighted a national-level special trade zone, and the province threw its resources into constructing and populating what would become iPhone City.During last fall\u2019s rush to make the iPhone 7, when Foxconn was short-handed, state-owned coal companies lent workers to Foxconn. In past years, according to government notices online, the province issued quotas to local authorities stating how many workers they needed to produce for Foxconn.Readying for a production surge to make the next iPhone model, due this fall, recruiters recently visited villages to put up posters and find workers.\u201cWhile the government has provided assistance in helping us with our recruitment requirements, the costs associated with hiring and training new workers are all covered by Foxconn,\u201d the company said.On a recent June day, a speaker blared outside the factory gate: \u201cWe\u2019re recruiting the cream of society. Your personality must be optimistic, your work diligent.\u201dFoxconn workers earn some 1,900 yuan ($278) in quiet months to more than 4,000 yuan with overtime when production ramps up. Their income isn\u2019t high, but many are better off than they were as rural villagers. For the workers, the iPhone is an expensive choice, and many say they buy cheaper, Chinese-branded smartphones instead.Yuan Yanling, 28 years old, said she has worked three stints on iPhone assembly lines, quitting each time better-paid or more fun jobs appeared. Last November she traded in her Foxconn uniform for heels and began selling cosmetics in a nearby mall.\u201cOur customers are virtually all Foxconn workers,\u201d said Ms. Yuan, who lives with her husband, a Foxconn employee, and two children in a rented one-room apartment.Some of Ms. Yuan\u2019s neighbors in the apartment complex are less content than she, with some who relocated during development complaining about inadequate land compensation. Zhengzhou authorities said their land compensation was based on national standards.In 2013, one farmer, Xiao Malai, rankled local government officials by protesting his home\u2019s demolition for a development inside the industrial park anchored by Foxconn\u2019s factories, according to court documents from the trial of an official who allegedly paid an industrial park employee and other villagers to beat the farmer. Mr. Xiao died as a result of the beating, and the official, the industrial park employee and others were jailed over his death.\u201cWe were not aware of the tragic death of Xiao Malai or the circumstances of his death,\u201d an Apple spokesman said.Other local farmers say the compensation paid for their land was more than they could ever earn in a lifetime cultivating wheat and corn. Mr. Zhang, who saw the markers drop from the helicopters in 2010, used part of his payout to buy two apartments. He said he earned more as a street sweeper than he did on the farm. His wife works at Foxconn, and their son also has.Yet unease abounds in Zhengzhou over how long Foxconn\u2014or Apple\u2014will need iPhone City. Sales of the iPhone declined last year for the first time since its debut in 2007. During last year\u2019s production downturn, Chinese Premier       Li Keqiang       asked Mr. Gou whether iPhone production would rise or fall this year, according to people present at the meeting.Foxconn said it has acquired 80% of the buildings it uses in Zhengzhou, leasing the remainder, and will continue to invest there.Regardless, Chinese officials see the iPhone factory as a worthwhile investment, said Shi Pu, an economics professor in Henan. \u201cFoxconn has helped train hundreds of thousands of Henan\u2019s people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can use those skills to go on to other jobs.\u201d\u2014Kersten Zhang and Yang Jie in Beijing and Tripp Mickle in San Francisco contributed to this article.Write to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-iphone-built-a-city-in-china-1499074203", "news_title": "How the iPhone Built a City in China        ", "keywords": "apple,chinese boomtowns,chinese economy,foxconn,iphone,iphone china,iphone city,iphonedecade,iphone manufacturing,zhengzhou,Apple,AAPL,Hon Hai Precision Industry,2317.TW,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014China\u2019s bond market showed little reaction as Beijing and Hong Kong opened a trading link giving global investors additional access to the world\u2019s third-largest debt market.Despite fanfare at the opening ceremony in Hong Kong for the so-called Bond Connect link, Chinese bond prices were mostly steady throughout the trading day. The yield on China\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bond dipped 0.04 percentage point to 3.53%, while on the one-year it was down 0.005 percentage point at 3.46%.\u201cI am sure there\u2019s champagne and balloons at the ceremony in Hong Kong, but here in Shanghai it\u2019s just another trading day. I don\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d said a Shanghai-based senior bond trader at an Asian bank.The link allows investors based in Hong Kong to trade directly in China\u2019s $9 trillion market. Its launch follows last year\u2019s landmark opening of the bond market to global investors with trading accounts inside China, and is modeled in part on the stock-market links between Hong Kong and Chinese exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Unlike the stock-market links, the bond-trading connection is one-way: Foreigners can buy bonds in the mainland market, but Chinese investors can\u2019t do likewise in Hong Kong. China has been fighting to stem capital outflows and reduce downward pressure on its currency.Few expect a huge rush of foreign money into Chinese bonds as a result of the new trading link, given that investors can already buy bonds in China. Chinese bonds aren\u2019t yet included in major bond indexes, so the many investment funds that track those indexes don\u2019t have to enter the market. And analysts say concerns about frequent bouts of volatility and the reliability of local credit ratings could keep investors away.\u201cThe bond connect will at best serve to improve investor sentiment now, but given the less-than-convenient arrangements regarding clearing and so on, its positive impact will only become material in the medium to long run,\u201d said       Tang Yue,        an analyst at Industrial Securities. Market participants say that in addition to the paperwork, there are also concerns about currency conversion and hedging to offset exchange-rate risks.Asked at the opening ceremony whether Beijing will make the link two-way, the deputy governor of China\u2019s central bank,       Pan Gongsheng,        said \u201cnot at the moment.\u201d He said it would depend on the amount of trading activity and initial demand from the market.To showcase the new trading link, one of China\u2019s biggest banks, Agricultural Development Bank of China, on Monday issued 15 billion yuan worth of bonds that will be available to both domestic and global investors. China Development Bank will follow with 20 billion yuan worth of bonds Tuesday.International banks including             Citigroup                   and             HSBC                   said Monday they had concluded their first deals as market makers for trading via Bond Connect.Chinese bond investors are preoccupied less with the link than with what the People\u2019s Bank of China will do next in the money market and how the economy will perform in the coming months, said the Shanghai trader.After injecting a large amount of funds into the financial system in mid-June to meet a seasonal surge of cash demand, the PBOC hasn\u2019t used its money-market liquidity operation during the past seven business days. The inaction is widely interpreted as a signal from policy makers in Beijing that they wish to continue their campaign to reduce debt and leverage in China\u2019s financial markets.Foreign investors\u2019 share of China\u2019s interbank bond market remains low. At the end of March, the total amount of Chinese domestic bonds they held was around 830 billion yuan ($122.42 billion), or around 1.4% of the market, according to             Goldman Sachs.\u201cForeign money accounts for very little in our market, and it won\u2019t change much just because of the Bond Connect,\u201d the Shanghai trader said. \u201cThe local players will continue with their own game.\u201d\u2014Gregor Stuart Hunter in Hong Kong contributed to this article.Write to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 05:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-mainland-china-bond-link-gets-off-to-quiet-start-1499059284", "news_title": "Hong Kong-Mainland China Bond Link Gets Off to Quiet Start", "keywords": "bond connect,bond-trading link,china bond market,china bonds,hong kong-china bond link,hong kong-mainland bond link,HSBC Holdings (UK Reg),UK:HSBA,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Eurozone factories had their busiest month in more than six years during June, with the expansion even spreading to Greece, a persistent laggard.The pickup is consistent with other indications that economic growth in the currency area accelerated in the three months to June, having already speeded up in the first quarter.Data firm             IHS Markit                   Monday said its Purchasing Managers Index for eurozone manufacturing\u2014which is based on a survey of 3,000 companies\u2014rose to 57.4 from 57.0 in May, reaching a 74-month high. That was slightly higher than the preliminary estimate of 57.3.The pickup in manufacturing was led by Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, but also saw activity increase in Greece for the first time since August 2016, albeit very slightly.A separate release from the European Union\u2019s statistics agency showed the jobless rate stalled at 9.3% in May, with only 5,000 people finding jobs during that month, but the manufacturing survey suggests that will prove temporary.\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of the impressive performance ending any time soon,\u201d said       Chris Williamson,        chief business economist at IHS Markit. \u201cOptimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest for at least five years, backlogs of orders are building up at the fastest rate for over seven years and factories are reporting near-record hiring as they struggle to deal with the upturn in demand.\u201dThe strengthening economic recovery has prompted some policy makers at the European Central Bank to question the need to maintain its stimulus measures at the current settings, although opinion is divided.Speaking Friday, executive board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the central bank should prepare to reduce its monetary stimulus despite falling short of its inflation target.However, others are more cautious given that the annual rate of inflation fell for a second straight month in June, and to its lowest level in 2017. Speaking Sunday, fellow board member Yves Mersch said that while low interest rates ushered had helped bolster the currency area\u2019s economy, the recovery isn\u2019t yet self-sustaining.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 05:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-manufacturing-accelerates-as-greece-joins-in-1499072781", "news_title": "Eurozone Manufacturing Accelerates as Greece Joins In", "keywords": "economic performance,indicators,industrial production,euro zone,currency,economic news,purchasing managers index"}, {"content": "Stock markets around the world collectively had their best first half in years, but not everyone was a winner.Just four prominent stock-market indexes fell through the first six months of the year. Benchmarks tracking Russia, China, Israel and Canada were the rare losers in an environment where nearly everything else rallied. In the past 20 years, there have only been four other instances in which such a small number of indexes started off the year in the red.Analysts cite a confluence of reasons for why those four indexes declined, including exposure to falling oil prices and so-called mean reversion\u2014the idea that a pullback in those markets was inevitable following sharp rallies in 2016.Here\u2019s a look at the countries that are lagging and what could be in store for the rest of the year.RussiaRussia\u2019s RTS Index sank 13% in the first half, the worst performer of the 30 indexes tracked by The Wall Street Journal. While the drop looks severe, it follows a 52% surge in 2016 and heightened volatility for much of the past decade.The index lost four-fifths of its value peak to trough during the financial crisis. It then nearly recovered through 2011 before falling another 70% over the ensuing five years.Oil prices are down 14% this year and in June entered a bear market. Oil\u2019s decline and the possibility of tighter sanctions on Russia have hit the country\u2019s stock market, whose heavy weightings include resource giants such as             Rosneft Oil Co.       and gas giant Gazprom PJSC.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a 180 degree turn on sentiment around Russia,\u201d said       Geoffrey Wong,        head of global emerging markets and Asia-Pacific equities at UBS Asset Management. \u201cAny stabilization in oil prices should be good for equities going forward.\u201dPolitics have played a part in diminishing Russian stocks\u2019 appeal, too, thanks to the continuing probes into Russia\u2019s alleged influence over the U.S. presidential election last year.ChinaWhile most barometers of Chinese equities have done well this year, Shenzhen-listed stocks have lagged behind. The Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 3.6% in the first half, while its Shanghai counterpart rose 2.9%. And the MSCI China Index, which includes mostly Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and the U.S., surged 24%.Shenzhen\u2019s weakness is a surprise. The market is home to many companies that should benefit as China\u2019s economy shifts to being driven more by consumer demand. Around a fifth of the market is made up of tech stocks, a sector that has enjoyed a stellar start to the year in other countries. Foreign investors late last year gained access to Shenzhen-listed stocks through a new trading link with Hong Kong, although demand from them has been underwhelming.Still, Shenzhen-listed companies tend to be smaller and more volatile than those listed in Shanghai. Slowing economic growth and a crackdown on speculative investing driven by leverage could hurt Shenzhen-listed equities in the second half of the year, analysts warn.Another consideration is valuation. The Shenzhen Composite Index trades at 25 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, compared with only 15 times for the Shanghai Composite Index, according to             HSBC.\u201cValuations make a big difference,\u201d said       Grace Tam,        senior market specialist at HSBC Global Asset Management. \u201cPeople are worried about Shenzhen stocks being too expensive.\u201dMeanwhile, indexes like the MSCI China have benefited from China\u2019s tech giants             Tencent Holdings Ltd.       and             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , which both surged in the first half of the year. Tencent is listed in Hong Kong and Alibaba trades on the New York Stock Exchange.IsraelIsrael is another market whose weighting toward tech stocks ought to have given it an advantage this year. But Tel Aviv\u2019s flagship TA-35 Index slipped 3.1% in the first half.Still, three of the index\u2019s top five constituents are from the pharmaceuticals sector, which has struggled during the first half of the year.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.      , the world\u2019s biggest seller of low-price generic drugs and Tel Aviv\u2019s biggest listing by market cap, slumped 16%, hurt by an increasingly difficult pricing environment. The debt-laden company\u2019s chief executive stepped down in February.Another generic-drug maker,             Perrigo Co.      , slumped 9.3%, while shares in EpiPen maker Mylan NV, which has lost almost half its value over the past two years, were up slightly.CanadaOh, Canada.The Toronto exchange\u2019s benchmark S&P TSX waffled between small gains and losses in the first half before finishing down 0.7%, with companies like             Suncor Energy Inc.       weighed down by falling oil prices.Canada\u2019s robust housing market has also shown signs of strain. In April, Canadian authorities accused lender             Home Capital Group Inc.       of misleading investors about mortgage-application fraud. The company soon afterward tapped an emergency line of credit. Moody\u2019s Investors Service also downgraded the Canadian banking sector in May, citing high private-sector debt levels.The S&P TSX gained 18% last year, so the index\u2019s slow start this year might also be a partial swing back from last year\u2019s rally.Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 04:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-china-israel-and-russia-buck-the-markets-trendbut-not-in-a-good-way-1499071695", "news_title": "Canada, China, Israel and Russia Buck the Markets Trend\u2014But Not in a Good Way", "keywords": "2q market report,canadian markets,chinese markets,equity market moves,first half results,israeli markets,market trends,russian markets,stock indexes,stock market cycles,stock markets,financial performance,earnings,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Trading through China\u2019s bond-connect program kicked off Monday, marking China\u2019s latest attempt to encourage foreign investment in the third-largest bond market in the world.The program allows global investors with trading accounts in Hong Kong to access China\u2019s interbank bond market. Foreigners with trading accounts in China have been able to access that market since last year. Other programs have allowed certain investors to buy Chinese bonds for years.For now, the connect works only for foreigners; Chinese investors can\u2019t use the trading link to buy bonds in Hong Kong and it isn\u2019t clear when they will be able to do so.Here\u2019s what you need to know about China\u2019s bond market:The value of China\u2019s bond market has doubled in the past five years, according to Wind Info. Chinese policy makers have been encouraging the market\u2019s development, partly because they want Chinese companies to have a wider range of funding options than relying on bank loans.Still, China\u2019s domestic bond market remains dominated by government and state-owned policy banks like China Development Bank. Chinese companies have been flocking to issue dollar-denominated debt offshore this year in part because it is cheaper than borrowing within China.The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has risen this year, making it more expensive for companies to issue debt within China. That yield surged to the highest level in more than two years in May, though it has come down a bit since. Bond prices have been dropping in China partly because of the authorities\u2019 efforts to cool speculation by investors using large amounts of borrowing.At certain points this year, yields on shorter-dated debt have risen above yields on longer-term bonds, likely as a result of Beijing\u2019s crackdown on leverage. That phenomenon, called yield-curve inversion, typically reflects investors\u2019 gloom about a country\u2019s long-term outlook. Normally, bonds with longer maturities pay investors more through a higher yield.Just because more foreigners can now buy Chinese bonds, it doesn\u2019t mean they will.             Goldman Sachs                   estimates that foreign investors held about 1.4% of Chinese domestic bonds at the end of the first quarter. Few analysts expect the appetite for this debt to be significant at first, especially since Chinese domestic bonds aren\u2019t currently included in major bond indexes that are tracked by passive money.\u2014Shen Hong contributed to this article.Write to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-03 01:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-bond-connect-program-in-five-charts-1499060384", "news_title": "China\u2019s Bond-Connect Program in Five Charts ", "keywords": " bonds,china bond connect, china bond market, china debt,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,capital movements,invisible trade,economic news,foreign direct investment,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "The U.S. conducted a naval patrol close to a China-controlled island in the South China Sea on Sunday\u2014the second such operation confirmed by American officials in less than six weeks\u2014following several recent moves that appear to signal Washington\u2019s displeasure with Beijing.taiwanchinaPARACELISLANDSSouthChinaSeaTritonIslandvietnam", "news_time": "2017-07-03 00:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-navy-patrols-near-disputed-island-in-south-china-sea-1498986188", "news_title": "U.S. Navy Patrols Near Disputed Island in South China Sea", "keywords": " china disputed islands, china islands, disputed islands,south china sea, spratly islands, spratly islands china, u.s. navy patrol,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,navy,politics"}]
