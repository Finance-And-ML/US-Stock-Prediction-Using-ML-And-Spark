Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Ramirez combined for seven hits and two home runs as the Indians avoided a three-game sweep by beating the San Diego Padres 11-2. Yan Gomes also homered for the Indians, who pounded out 14 hits leading to 11 runs. The Indians also had 14 hits in Wednesday's game, but only scored two runs in that 6-2 loss to the Padres.  We had a much better approach tonight. We were taking balls to the opposite field, not trying to pull everything,  said acting Indians manager Brad Mills.  The way we stayed on the ball, we hadn't done that in a while.  Cleveland starter Josh Tomlin (5-9) pitched seven-plus innings, giving up two runs on four hits with six strikeouts and no walks. Excluding the fifth inning, in which the Padres scored their runs, he retired 18 of the 19 batters he faced.  I just tried to miss as many barrels as I could, and get deep into the game. I was happy that I finally gave my team a chance to win after a long drought of not doing that,  said Tomlin, who in his five starts prior to Thursday was 1-2 with a 7.94 ERA. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at IndiansSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchSan Diego starter Dinelson Lamet (3-3) allowed six runs (five earned) on six hits and four walks in four-plus innings. It was an ugly game for the Padres, who were held to five hits and committed three errors.  All around, it was not a very good effort by us,  said Padres manager Andy Green.  Three errors, and a couple other plays we didn't make. I think our youth compounds it.  Leading 6-2, the Indians scored three times in the sixth, on a solo home run by Gomes, an RBI double by Encarnacion, and an RBI single by Ramirez. A two-run double by Lonnie Chisenhall in the eighth completed Cleveland's scoring. After scoring only two runs in the first two games of the series, the Indians scored three runs in the first inning off Lamet. With one out, Francisco Lindor singled and scored on a triple into the right-field corner by Michael Brantley. One out later, Ramirez belted a 1-2 pitch over the wall in right-center field for his 16th home run, giving Cleveland a 3-0 lead. Ramirez's home run snapped a streak of 66 consecutive innings at home in which the Indians had not gone deep. In their last nine home games prior to Thursday, the Indians had been out-homered 14-1. The Indians added two more runs in the third inning on sacrifice flies by Chisenhall and Encarnacion to make it 5-0. Tomlin retired the first 12 batters he faced before Hunter Renfroe led off the fifth inning with a double. Renfroe went to third on a single by Cory Spangenberg. A double by Erick Aybar scored Renfroe and moved Spangenberg to third. Carlos Asuaje flied out for the first out, but a sacrifice fly by Allen Cordoba scored Spangenberg to cut the Cleveland lead to 5-2. Following Aybar's double, Tomlin retired nine batters in a row.  He moved the ball around. Changed speeds. Worked quick. Commanded the zone. He did a really good job,  said Mills.  He could throw any pitch in any count,  Green said.  And I think our guys were a little overanxious to do something. We couldn't muster much against him.  The Indians got one of those runs back when Encarnacion led off the fifth inning with a booming home run over the center-field wall to push the lead to 6-2, sending Lamet to the showers.  He didn't have the velocity or life on his fastball that he normally does,  Green said.  His fastball command wasn't good. The ball kept leaking over the middle of the plate.  NOTES: Indians manager Terry Francona missed his third consecutive game as he remains hospitalized and undergoing tests to determine the cause of his rapid-heartbeat issues. Bench coach Brad Mills continues to be the acting manager. ... Indians RHP Danny Salazar made a rehab start for Triple-A Columbus on Thursday against Indianapolis. He pitched 3 1/3 innings, giving up three runs on three hits, all home runs, with four strikeouts and two walks. Salazar has been on the disabled list since June 6 due to right shoulder soreness. ... Padres C Austin Hedges sat out a second consecutive game with a stiff neck. ... Padres OF Hunter Renfroe leads all National League rookies with seven outfield assists. Renfroe is tied with Cleveland's Bradley Zimmer for the major league lead in that category.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-padres-indians-writethru-idUSMTZED77P8U6T5"},

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in China's northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer.  Liu Xiaobo has not stopped being medicated, but because his condition is grave and the tumour is rapidly progressing, after a consultation by top domestic specialists, the medication has been adjusted, with his family's consent,  the letter read.  I express resentment at the people who spread and create rumours and distort facts,  added the handwritten document that appeared to be written and signed by the brother-in-law, Liu Hui, and was released late on Thursday on the hospital website. A woman who answered the hospital telephone said she did not know about Liu's case. Also on Thursday, the hospital said in a statement that doctors had stopped using sorafenib, a drug to fight liver cancer, and Chinese medicines, because of Liu's worsening condition. Neither the statement nor the letter identified the treatments now being administered to Liu. Earlier, the hospital had said Liu's liver function had worsened, with his levels of bilirubin gradually rising, and that he had a thrombosis on his lower left leg. A family friend of Liu said his medication had been halted as his liver was unable to take it. Calls have grown from rights groups, international bodies and western governments for China to allow Liu and his wife Liu Xia to be treated overseas if they wish. The European Parliament on Thursday urged the Chinese government to immediately release the couple from house arrest, and allow Liu to seek treatment freely.  The Chinese government often pressures family members to write statements or record videos to make claims in its favour,  Patrick Poon, a China researcher for rights group Amnesty International, said in a message, referring to the letter.  If Liu Hui is free, why can't he talk to journalists?  added Poon, who is based in Hong Kong. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks. The hospital has invited doctors from the United States and Germany to help with Liu's treatment, the Shenyang city justice department said on Wednesday. Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China has been nervous the concerns over Liu could overshadow President Xi Jinping's appearance at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday and Saturday. At the meeting, Xi will seek to project Chinese leadership on issues such as climate change and free trade.

In a move aimed at stemming a rise in yields, the central bank on Friday offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a yield of 0.110 percent and also increased its buying of five- to 10-year JGBs through an auction to 500 billion yen from 450 billion yen. The Nikkei dropped 0.1 percent to 19,979.72 in midmorning trade, after falling to as low as 19,856.65 earlier, the lowest point since June 15. For the week, the Nikkei is on track to fall 0.3 percent.  The BOJ showed its intent on rising bond yields, which triggered the yen to weaken that was positive for the stock market,  said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The central bank's move quickly triggered a turnaround in currency-sensitive exporters, such as automakers and tech companies, which fell initially after a sharp decline in Wall Street soured sentiment. Toyota Motor Corp rose 1.1 percent, Nissan Motor Co added 0.7 percent and Tokyo Electron gained 1.0 percent. The dollar soared 0.6 percent to 113.82 yen, compared with 113.11 yen earlier. On the other hand, domestic-demand sensitive stocks languished. Real estate companies Mitsui Fudosan Co and Mitsubishi Estate Co both dropped 1.4 percent. Construction shares also underperformed. Kajima Corp shed 1.9 percent and Taisei Corp declined 1.2 percent. Wall Street retreated after disappointing labour market data clashed with the possibility of a more hawkish Federal Reserve. That said, investors are cautious with rising yields in Europe on bets the European Central Bank is moving ever closer towards unwinding its massive monetary stimulus. Also making investors wary is ongoing tension in the Korean peninsula after North Korea's launch this week of what it said was a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile. Before the G20 summit on the weekend, Japan, the United States and South Korea agreed to push for China to play a larger role in reining in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, said the geopolitical risks were a cloud over the Japanese market for the time being, with the Nikkei's put-call ratio - viewed as an indicator of investor sentiment - rising since earlier this week. The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of traded put Nikkei options by the number of traded Nikkei call options.  The rising put-call ratio reflects investors' cautious stance in the market, which reminds us about the geopolitical tensions in the region in the spring,  Kagawa said. The broader Topix dropped 0.2 percent to 1,613.01. (Editing by Jacqueline Wong)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-stocks-midday-idUSL4N1JY1L7"},

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Tampa Bay Rays catcher Wilson Ramos had never faced Boston Red Sox ace Chris Sale before Thursday night, but his pregame video scouting paid off in a big way. Ramos had an RBI double and a two-run home run, powering Tampa Bay to a surprising 4-1 win over Sale and the Red Sox at Tropicana Field.  This series, for me, is very important,  said Ramos, who missed the first 76 games of the season recovering from a torn ACL.  I talked to my guys, my teammates. We're behind that team, so this series we have to play hard. We have to win this if we want to be in first place in this division.  The Rays (45-42) got a big win to open their final series before the All-Star break, pulling to 4 1/2 games behind Boston (49-37) in the American League East. Boston dropped its second straight after a six-game winning streak ended Wednesday against the Texas Rangers. Sale (11-4) lost for only the second time in his past nine starts. He yielded four runs on seven hits and no walks, and he struck out 12 to extend his major league-leading total to 178. Sale had limited opponents to three runs or fewer in each of his previous six outings.  Ramos is the one guy in that lineup that came back to haunt him a little bit,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  We just couldn't string the hits together tonight, even when we started a number of innings with the leadoff man getting on.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RaysBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchFaria (4-0) made his sixth consecutive quality start to begin his major league career, holding the Red Sox to one run on four hits in six innings. He walked four and struck out two. The Rays bullpen, which gave up seven runs Wednesday, turning a 3-0 sixth-inning lead into a 7-3 loss to the Chicago Cubs, stepped up with three scoreless innings Thursday. Brad Boxberger pitched a 1-2-3 seventh, Tommy Hunter a scoreless eighth and closer Alex Colome the ninth for his 23rd save. Colome had given up runs in his previous five appearances, ballooning his ERA from 1.95 to 4.10, but he worked around one hit to close out the win. In the sixth, the Rays' Evan Longoria pulled a ground ball just past third baseman Deven Marrero's glove, then scored on Ramos' two-run home run for a 4-1 lead.  It's not so much the single runs, it's that sixth inning. That home run really just sucks the energy right out of us,  Sale said.  It's easier to fight down one than down three. I put my guys in a bad spot.  The Rays took a 2-1 lead in the fifth inning as Peter Bourjos hit a solo home run down the left field line off Sale. Sale had eight strikeouts in his first 10 outs, dominating the Rays lineup and taking a shutout into the fourth inning. Logan Morrison singled and scored on a double by Ramos to tie the game in the fourth.  I'm feeling a lot better at the plate, getting my timing back with my swing,  Ramos said.  I feel so happy to be able to be aggressive and move behind the plate, to get more confidence to go out and do my job.  Boston took a 1-0 lead in the third inning when Tzu-Wei Lin walked, took third on a single by Dustin Pedroia and scored on a sacrifice fly by Marrero. Marrero was in the game because Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts left in the first inning after being hit by a pitch on the right hand. Bogaerts stayed in the game as a runner but was replaced in the bottom of the first. The team announced the injury was a contusion and that X-rays were negative. Bogaerts is listed as day-to-day. NOTES: Tampa Bay 1B Logan Morrison and Boston SS Xander Bogaerts were both among the five AL candidates in the  Final Vote  contest for the All-Star game, but both lost out to Royals 3B Mike Moustakas. Bogaerts finished second in the voting, while Morrison took last among the five options. ... Rays 2B Tim Beckham was a late scratch due to an ankle injury, with Taylor Featherston replacing him at second and batting sixth in the batting order. 2B Brad Miller was pulled from the lineup in a rehab appearance at Triple-A Durham, so it is possible Miller could return Friday if Beckham is headed to the disabled list. ... The Red Sox activated LHP Brian Johnson (left shoulder) off the disabled list before the game and optioned him to Triple-A Pawtucket.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED77P7V9RS"},

The power of the Pittsburgh Pirates rookie first baseman, on the other hand, leaves nothing to be desired. Bell hit a two-run homer and drove in the eventual game-winning run to help the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday night at Citizens Bank Park. Bell put his team up 2-1 in the fourth inning with a two-run shot to left, his 16th homer of the season and part of a three-run frame that for a while was his team's only offensive output. Though he is batting just .229, his 16 home runs are a Pirates rookie record before the All-Star break, and his 42 RBIs are the most by any Pittsburgh rookie pre-All-Star Game since Warren Morris' 47 in 1999.  It's cool,  he said.  A lot of ups and downs with the average, but when it comes to slugging and stuff like that, I'm definitely proud of where I am.  After the Phillies (28-56) tied it 3-3 in the seventh inning, Bell came up big again. He laced a one-out double down the right field line in the eighth inning to score center fielder Andrew McCutchen and put the Pirates back on top for good. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at PhilliesPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchGregory Polanco and Elias Diaz followed later in the eighth with RBI doubles to chase Joaquin Benoit (1-3), who took the loss by giving up three runs on four hits in two-thirds of an inning. Polanco also hit a solo home run in the fourth. The victory was the third in a row for Pittsburgh (40-46) to close out the four-game series. Chad Kuhl (3-6) picked up the win with seven strong innings. Juan Nicasio earned his first save since 2015 with a 1-2-3 ninth. Polanco (4-for-4, two RBIs, two runs), Bell (2-for-5, three RBIs, two runs) and McCutchen (3-for-4, two runs, walk) accounted for almost all of the Pirates' offense. The rest of the Pittsburgh lineup totaled two hits and a walk. The Pirates who didn't hit certainly fielded. Left fielder Jose Osuna threw out three runners trying to stretch singles into doubles, becoming the first Pirates outfielder with at least three assists in a game since 1991.  I encourage the guys to be aggressive, to turn the single into the double,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said,  but when you take that hard turn into second base, you should have time to decide when to go.  Bell's clutch hits helped make up for a costly error he was partially responsible for in the third. Diaz tried to pick off the Phillies' Andrew Knapp at first base after a swing-and-miss by Andres Blanco. But with Bell distracted by Blanco's bat heading into the stands, the ball whizzed right by Bell and down the first base line, allowing Knapp to get around all three bases and score.  I've never seen it, and I've been in the game 43 years,  Hurdle said.  And I played baseball before that, and I've never seen that play.   I think a lot of the stadium was looking at the bat,  Bell said.  A tough situation, I was just happy to capitalize and make up for it.  Phillies starter Jeremy Hellickson settled down after the two home runs, retiring the last eight batters he faced before departing for a pinch hitter after six innings. He threw just 77 pitches, 50 for strikes, striking out four while allowing three runs and five hits with no walks. That still wasn't enough to avoid running his streak of winless outings to nine (0-4), though he avoided taking the loss thanks to a two-RBI single by Aaron Altherr in the seventh to make it 3-3.  Hellickson pitched pretty well, he had the one inning where he got hurt by the long ball again,  Mackanin said.  Occasionally he just gets into, I won't call it a rut, but he gets into a situation where he just pushes his changeup, he doesn't have the good arm action he usually has.  Altherr's hit was the only major blemish in what was otherwise a second consecutive strong outing by Kuhl. The right-hander went seven innings for the first time this season, giving up three runs (two earned) and six hits while walking three and striking out three. In Kuhl's last two starts, he has given up four runs (three earned) in 13 innings.  Two (earned) runs on the night, 20 out of 24 first-pitch strikes, live fastball from start to finish, slider and changeup played off that,  Hurdle said.  I liked the matchup, liked where he was with the pitch count, it was another opportunity for him to show some growth and develop some growth.  NOTES: The game was delayed 47 minutes because of rain. ... Pittsburgh's bullpen did not allow a run in 11 innings through the four-game series, striking out 13 Phillies batters. ... Philadelphia begins a three-game series at home against San Diego on Friday. The Phillies send RHP Nick Pivetta (2-4, 4.85 ERA) against Padres LHP Clayton Richard (5-8, 4.85). ... The Pirates will travel to Chicago to start a three-game series against the Cubs on Friday afternoon. Pittsburgh RHP Trevor Williams (3-3, 4.67 ERA) goes against RHP Eddie Butler (4-3, 4.18 ERA).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED77P7Q8R8"},

The EU Commission said it had reached a preliminary view that Canon breached rules by using a so-called  warehousing  two-step transaction structure involving an interim buyer to buy the company prior to obtaining relevant approvals. Ten percent of Canon's annual revenue would be roughly equivalent to $2.9 billion. The $6 billion deal, completed late last year, raised eyebrows at the time due to the unorthodox method which allowed Toshiba, which was struggling for cash after an accounting scandal, to book proceeds in time for the financial year-end in March. Rival bidder Fujifilm Holdings Corp  had criticized it as a  mockery of the law .  Canon said in statement that it would respond appropriately, but declined further comment before regulators make their final decision. Canon shares fell as much as 3 percent to its lowest level since May 1. The stock was the fifth most traded stock by turnover. EU regulators also accused General Electric  and German drugmaker Merck KGaA  on Thursday of providing misleading information during separate merger deals.  Facebook Inc  was hit with a 110-million-euro ($125 million) fine in May for providing misleading information during the EU review of its messaging service WhatsApp purchase in 2014. Last month, EU antitrust regulators hit Alphabet's Google with a record 2.4-billion-euro fine for favoring its own shopping service.

The EU Commission said it had reached a preliminary view that Canon breached rules by using a so-called  warehousing  two-step transaction structure involving an interim buyer to buy the company prior to obtaining relevant approvals. Ten percent of Canon's annual revenue would be roughly equivalent to $2.9 billion. The $6 billion deal, completed late last year, raised eyebrows at the time due to the unorthodox method which allowed Toshiba, which was struggling for cash after an accounting scandal, to book proceeds in time for the financial year-end in March. Rival bidder Fujifilm Holdings Corp had criticised it as a  mockery of the law . Canon said in statement that it would respond appropriately, but declined further comment before regulators make their final decision. Canon shares fell as much as 3 percent to its lowest level since May 1. The stock was the fifth most traded stock by turnover. EU regulators also accused General Electric and German drugmaker Merck KGaA on Thursday of providing misleading information during separate merger deals. Facebook Inc was hit with a 110-million-euro ($125 million) fine in May for providing misleading information during the EU review of its messaging service WhatsApp purchase in 2014.

Parts of Fukuoka, on the southwestern island of Kyushu, were hit by 593 mm (23 inches) of rain in the 48 hours to 9:00 a.m. Friday (midnight GMT), well over the rainfall of a usual July, the meteorological agency said. Heavy rain continued to fall, shifting to the northern part of Kyushu, although emergency rain warnings had been lifted. Six people had died and at least 22 could not be reached, officials said. Just under 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate, down from more than 400,000 at the peak of the rains, with tens of thousands more advised to leave their homes.  At first, it wasn't raining that much,  said Sumie Umeyo, a resident of Asakura.  But they spoke of record-breaking rain and it started raining heavily, then they began closing the roads. We looked outside and the roads were like rivers,  Umeyo said. Around 12,300 soldiers, policemen and firemen waded through mud and climbed over piles of splintered wood to reach several hundred people cut off by landslides. Large boulders and uprooted trees littered the landscape. Fukuoka and neighbouring Oita, the hardest hit by the rain, are both largely rural prefectures but rivers were also rising in the city of Kitakyushu, which has a population of some 950,000 and issued evacuation orders for several districts. The rain was caused by a low pressure area over the Pacific that fed warm, moist air into Japan's seasonal rainy front.

Bitcoin does not have the fundamental attributes needed to be a currency as it is a string of code generated by complex algorithms... But I do not deny that virtual currencies have technical value and are a type of asset,  he said. His comments come after the Chinese central bank increased scrutiny of the country's bitcoin exchanges earlier this year, a move that prompted the companies to stop margin lending, introduced trading fees and issue rules to rein in users.  Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000. China has classified it as a  virtual good . Squaring in on bitcoin, Sheng said expectations that bitcoin supply would be capped in the year 2140 would make it difficult for it to become a medium of exchange that could meet modern economic development needs as money supply should be related to economic needs.

The dollar was on track for weekly gains, though investors were unlikely to push the upside significantly as they braced for monthly U.S. employment data later in the global session, following some downbeat jobs figures overnight. The dollar extended gains against its Japanese counterpart after the BOJ's move, rising 0.6 percent to 113.830 yen after touching a session high of 113.835 yen, its highest level since May 12. It was up 1.3 percent for the week. The BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at yield of 0.110 percent and also increased its buying of five- to ten-year JGBs through an auction to 500 billion yen from 450 billion yen.   The move shows the BOJ's determination to control JGB yields,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo, after the 10-year yield rose to a five-month high of 0.105 percent in the morning.  The timing was not a surprise, because there are no operations scheduled on Monday, and if U.S. employment data surprises on the upside, today was the BOJ's only chance to take pre-emptive action against rising JGB yields,  she said.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.2 percent higher on the day at 95.947 up 0.3 percent for the week.  Investors awaited the Labor Department's June nonfarm payrolls report. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs last month, above May's relatively small gain of 138,000.  Ahead of Friday's jobs data, the ADP National Employment Report showed private-sector payrolls increased by 158,000 jobs last month, coming in below the 230,000 jobs created in May and below economists' expectations for a rise of 185,000.  Separate figures from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 248,000 in the week ended July 1, marking the third straight weekly increase in claims. The U.S. services sector index, released by the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday, rose to 57.4 in June, compared with a forecast of 56.5. The employment index, however, fell to 55.8, compared with 57.8 in May, suggesting the labour market could be cooling. The dollar was bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields which rose even after the uninspiring data, amid concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin unwinding its bond holdings sometime this year.  The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield touched a nearly eight-week high of 2.391 percent on Thursday. It last stood at 2.389 percent in Asian trading, above its U.S. close of 2.369 percent.  Minutes from the Fed's June meeting released on Wednesday showed that some policymakers wanted to announce the beginning of the central bank's reduction of its massive debt portfolio by the end of August, but others wanted to wait until later in the year.  The euro edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.1412, and was down 0.1 percent for the week. European Central Bank policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing their monetary stimulus but are likely to move slowly out of fear of causing market turmoil, minutes of their last meeting showed on Thursday.

Things turned in Eastbourne, where Watson reached the semi-finals, and she has continued that momentum at Wimbledon with wins over Maryna Zanevska and 18th seed Anastasija Sevastova. Azarenka represents a step up in class, even if the former world number one is just feeling her way back into the game after maternity leave. Watson will, of course, have a Centre Court crowd roaring her on, just as it did in 2015 when she served for the match against the mighty Serena Williams before losing a thriller.  The thing I remember most is just the support and the crowd during that match,  Watson recalled.  That's the best atmosphere I've ever played in my life. I was getting goosebumps after every point.

Mnuchin,BC,FINREG,CHINESE,BANKS,NORTH,KOREA","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The U.S. Treasury Department last week moved to sever a Chinese bank from the global financial system over concerns it was a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity. The move signaled the United States is no longer willing to tolerate the actions of Chinese entities that support Pyongyang and plans to mete out punishment in the form of financial sanctions to alter behavior, experts said.  I think this is significant, not because of the effects of this singular action, but because it is, I think, the opening salvo of a broader campaign to pressure North Korea through the Chinese financial system. It begins to lay the groundwork for an isolation of Chinese actors that are facilitating illicit North Korean activity,  former senior Treasury and White House official Juan Zarate told Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) employed a seldom-used USA Patriot Act Section 311 authority to label the Bank of Dandong an institution of  primary money laundering concern,  thereby effectively excising it from the global financial system.  While Treasury's action is technically a proposed rule rather than a final, binding rule, in practice it is a signal to banks around the world that they should immediately sever ties to Bank of Dandong. Banks are likely to do so rather than risk the loss of access to the U.S. financial system.  The Department of the Treasury is committed to protecting the U.S. financial system from North Korean abuse and maximizing pressure on the Government of North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,  Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a written statement(here).  While we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies, and financial institutions who enable this regime.  U.S. officials were continuing to look at other companies that may be helping North Korea and may roll out additional sanctions, Mnuchin told a press conference. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Thursday also blacklisted two Chinese nationals and one Chinese company over their ties to Pyongyang. The blacklisted entity is Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co Ltd and the individuals are Sun Wei and Li Hong Ri, both of who reportedly are linked to North Korean banks that aid the regime's illicit activity. Bank of Dandong did not respond immediately to a request from Reuters for comment. A staff member at Dalian Global Unity would not comment on the sanctions and subsequent calls to the firm's office in Dalian went unanswered. CHINESE BANKS  ON NOTICE,  BETTER DUE DILIGENCE NEEDED TO ADDRESS RISK Treasury's action puts Chinese banks  on notice for either direct or indirect risk to North Korea,  said Zarate, now chair of a consultancy, The Financial Integrity Network. In other words, Chinese banks not only must avoid direct exposure to the North Korean regime, but would be wise to conduct due diligence necessary to ensure they are not serving peers with ties to the North Koreans.  The big Chinese banks don't want to be caught with their hand in the cookie jar with respect to North Korea any more than an American or European bank,  he said. But Chinese banks are not alone in their potential peril. Any non-U.S. banks that want to maintain U.S. dollar-clearing capacities also must  worry about indirect risk assuming that they're not directly trading with North Korea,  Zarate said.  The tentacles may run deeper and broader than people think, so they're going to have to engage in due diligence to worry about this now,  Zarate said.  Although the targeted Chinese bank is small, the FinCEN 311 designation  is a big deal,  said a former banker who led sanctions compliance at one of the largest institutions in the United States.   The banks will have to ensure that the banks they have correspondent relations with are not acting on behalf of the Chinese bank. It will be carefully implemented and watched closely by regulators,  said the source. Treasury's action was only the latest taken by the U.S. government against a Chinese entity suspected of aiding North Korea. Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of more than $1.9 million held by Mingzheng International Trading Limited, a China-based company that prosecutors said was a front used to launder money for sanctioned North Korean entities.

Tourists and residents gathered early to catch a glimpse of the massive carrier on its maiden visit to Hong Kong, part of celebrations marking 20 years since the handover of the city from British to Chinese rule. The Liaoning was accompanied by several other naval ships from its strike group, with jet fighters and helicopters visible on the flight deck alongside hundreds of crew dressed in white uniforms.  The Liaoning's visit shows that China is a militarily superior country,  said Jack Chan, a retired businessman, who was watching the aircraft carrier from an oceanfront park. Thousands of Hong Kong residents queued for hours on Monday, many unsuccessfully, for 2,000 tickets allowing access to the vessel this weekend. Even though the former Russian naval ship remains a training vessel for China's rapidly modernising navy, its missions through tense regional seas have been closely followed in Hong Kong, which is more used to hosting U.S. carriers and other foreign warships.  I think Liaoning's visit definitely gives the central government a chance to display its military power. It's quite a positive and smart strategy to step up publicity overall,  said Sean Moran, a tourist from the United States, as the ship passed behind him on a blustery morning. U.S. consulate officials told Reuters that they have yet to be invited on board the Liaoning. The U.S. navy often hosts the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on ships visiting Hong Kong, sometimes flying local military chiefs to aircraft carriers. The Liaoning's most recent drills at the weekend included operations in the Taiwan Strait that were closely monitored by Taiwan's military given recent tensions with Beijing, which regards the island as a breakaway province. With its Soviet-era takeoff ramp distinguishing it from the ordinary Hong Kong traffic of container ships and bulk cargo vessels, the 55,000-tonne Liaoning steamed down the congested East Lamma channel shortly after dawn. Significantly smaller than the U.S. carriers that have long stopped in Hong Kong, the Liaoning started life as one of the Soviet Union's last carriers under construction, before being sold by Ukraine as a stripped down hulk to private Chinese interests in 1998. The vessel was later refitted in a northern Chinese shipyard in what was seen by foreign military analysts as a key early test of China's naval modernisation. The Liaoning began sea trials as China's first aircraft carrier in 2011 and has more recently conducted fully integrated drills with its complement of J-15 jet fighters and a variety of support ships.

Bitcoin does not have the fundamental attributes needed to be a currency as it is a string of code generated by complex algorithms...But I do not deny that virtual currencies have technical value and are a type of asset,  he said.

Squaring in on bitcoin, Sheng said expectations that bitcoin supply would be capped in the year 2140 would make it difficult for it to become a medium of exchange that could meet modern economic development needs as money supply should be related to economic needs.

The deal is a bold bet by Buffett that he can win approval for the acquisition from Texas regulators, after they blocked two earlier attempts to sell Oncor, one of the largest U.S. power-transmission networks, to other companies. It also represents a return to a previously soured investment for Buffett, who in 2013 lost $873 million on a $2 billion bond investment in Oncor's bankrupt parent, Energy Future Holdings Corp. Berkshire Hathaway's deal, which could be announced by Friday, would value Oncor at slightly less than a previous $18.4 billion bid by Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc - which Texas regulators rejected - making it Buffett's third biggest acquisition ever, two people said. The Wall Street Journal, which reported on the acquisition earlier, said the deal could be valued at more than $17.5 billion. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which would have to approve the deal, declined to comment. Oncor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire declined to comment. Any deal for Oncor, considered the most valuable among Energy Future's assets, would also have to be approved by the judge overseeing the bankruptcy. Energy Future has been stuck in bankruptcy since it filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014 as plans to sell Oncor, repay creditors and fund its exit have collapsed under regulatory scrutiny. KKR & Co LP, TPG Capital LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's private equity arm took Energy Future private in 2007, in the biggest ever leveraged buyout with a total deal size of $44 billion. In the deal, the private equity firms also acquired Energy Future's retail and power generation businesses, the largest in Texas, which also then later filed for bankruptcy. Earlier this year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas rejected NextEra's deal for Oncor, deeming it not to be in the public interest. Another deal for Oncor led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas fell through in 2016 after regulators also put up roadblocks. Berkshire Hathaway had been among the leading bidders for Oncor. It is unclear what concessions Berkshire is prepared to make to meet the requirements of Texas regulators. Prized Asset Investors have prized regulated utilities such as Oncor for their steady cash flow. Adjusted operating cash flows rose 12.6 percent year-on-year in 2016, according to securities filings. Berkshire's energy division, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, owns several other utilities, natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission businesses, including the PacifiCorp and NV Energy utilities in the western United States. The energy unit contributed $2.29 billion in profit last year, while Berkshire overall made $24.07 billion. A deal for Oncor would also help Buffett utilize some of Berkshire's unused pile of cash, which totaled $96.5 billion at the end of March. The biggest creditor of Energy Future, activist investor Elliott Management Corp, filed a lawsuit against the company in May, asking it to pursue alternatives beyond the deal with NextEra. According to the lawsuit, Elliott wanted to lay the groundwork for a standalone plan of reorganization for Energy Future, allowing the utility to exit bankruptcy as an independent company, or find another buyer.

Protests by Gorkhas, ethnic Nepalese living India's West Bengal state, halted the plucking of Darjeeling's premium  second flush  tea crop, named for the harvest period that starts in mid-May and peaks in June.  Second flush Darjeeling teas are prized by tea consumers for their amber color and muscatel flavor that is unique to the region and harvest timing. The taste and color characteristics are the result of genetic changes to the tea leaves caused by insects that infest the plants before the second flush harvest. Some second flush teas have sold for as much as $1,850 a kg because of this uniqueness. Losing the second flush harvest will cut grower's incomes and leave blenders scrambling to find substitutes.  This is the first time we lost the entire second flush,  said A.N. Singh, managing director of Goodricke Group, a Kolkata-based producer with gardens in Darjeeling.  The viability of tea estates is totally dependent on the second flush volume and quality. This is 20 percent in terms of volume and 40 percent in terms of revenue. This is a complete disaster for the industry.  Tea plucking has been suspended since June 9 after the Gorkha community started strikes and protests, which turned violent, demanding a separate state within India to protect their Himalayan culture. Later flushes would not compensate for the second flush loss since they yield comparatively poorer crops.  Key buyers of Darjeeling tea are Germany's Hälssen & Lyon, London-based Unilever and prominent UK brands Typhoo, Twinings and Tetley. Second flush Darjeeling teas average about 1,000 rupees ($15.45) a kg, and more exotic varieties can command 5,000 rupees ($77.20) versus only 130 rupees ($2.01) for black tea grown in neighboring Assam state. Significant Price Hikes    Without doubt this crisis will lead to further price increases,  said Angela Pryce, an independent tea consultant with 15 years of experience as a blender and taster at Twinings.  If supply becomes untenable then brands may look at their blends to replace Darjeeling teas where possible, though for pure Darjeeling blends this will have a number of impacts - either a significant price hike, or an out of stock situation.  Darjeeling produces about 8 million kg of tea per year, more than two-thirds of which is exported mainly to Europe. Global tea production in 2016 was 5.46 billion kg, according to International Tea Committee data.  We have been sourcing teas for more than 300 years and disruption of all sorts, including this type, is something we have to contend with from time to time,  said a spokesman from Twinings, owned by Associated British Foods. Darjeeling tea planters like Goodricke Group have already lost more than 2.6 billion rupees, or about $40 million, in potential revenues due to the turmoil, said Kaushik Basu, secretary of the Darjeeling Tea Association (DTA), representing more than 100 tea exporters in the region.      Unfortunately, the indefinite shutdown is still on and no one knows when there would be a respite,  said Basu. Three Gorkha activists have died in clashes with police, while dozens of security personnel have been seriously injured during the current unrest. At least 1,200 people died during the first Gorkhaland protests in the 1980s. The plucking delay has caused the loss of the entire July crop as well since workers have been unable to maintain the plants to cause them to grow leaves.   First we have to slash tea bushes then only leaves will grow and become ready for plucking after three weeks,  said Kalyan Sundaram, secretary of the Calcutta Tea Traders Association.  I would expect many brands to have second flush stock (season 2016) to cover until around September 2017, at which point inventory will become exhausted,  tea consultant Pryce said.

The four-year agreement between Glencore and Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), struck last October, comes as global carmakers race to lock in battery supplies and move away from traditional combustion engines. The trend was reinforced this week by Chinese-owned, Sweden-based Volvo, which said all of its models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrid. Cobalt is a key ingredient in the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles (EVs), with sales expected to grow fast in coming years as governments around the world clamp down on polluting fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline.  It was a triangular deal where Glencore, CATL and VW got round the table,  said a cobalt trading source.  CATL on their own weren't willing to commit to such a large quantity so VW said they would buy the batteries (from CATL).  The contract to supply cobalt hydroxide and alloys, the sources said, was based on cobalt metal prices which at the time were around $28,500 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. They have since more than doubled to above $58,000 a tonne. Glencore and CATL declined to comment on the agreement.  There is no guarantee from the VW group to anyone,  said a spokesman for VW's operations in China. A source at VW said the carmaker was talking to Chinese suppliers about securing batteries for its EV program, with those discussions focusing only on supplies and not the possibility of creating a joint venture for battery production.  CATL is among the suppliers VW is currently talking to,  the VW source said. Asked whether this was true, the spokesman said:  We are not commenting on our business relations.   Caught by Surprise  Volkswagen, which has been slow to develop battery-powered vehicles, is pushing an electric-car offensive, aiming to launch more than 10 electrified models by the end of next year and is targeting over 30 new battery-powered models by 2025.  Electric cars are a key part of VW’s efforts to draw a line under its diesel emissions scandal as it battles to regain trust among customers and investors. VW wants to increase electric-car sales to 1 million autos a year by 2025 from a five-digit number at present.  All the big car manufacturers even early last year were thinking EVs were pie in the sky. They've been caught by surprise, especially VW ... That's when they panicked and did this deal,  a Europe-based cobalt trader said.  Volkswagen quickly identified raw materials would be an issue and there would be advantages to securing supplies.  Minerals such as cobalt from Democratic Republic of Congo have been associated with fuelling conflict and child labor, but analysts say Volkswagen would derive a measure of comfort from locking in supplies from Glencore as a listed company answerable to shareholders and regulators.     For Glencore, the advantage was the removal of a massive overhang of inventory capping prices, though some sources did question the timing of the sale.   To clear that inventory without hurting prices would have taken 12 to 18 months. Selling it in one chunk allowed them to be more aggressive on prices for new production,  a cobalt producer said.  But nobody thought prices would rise so much.  Glencore this year tightened its grip on Congo's copper and cobalt resources by buying the remaining stake in one mine and upping its share in another for $960 million. It said the complex had the potential to become the world's largest cobalt producer. Morgan Stanley analysts expect global car sales to rise 50 percent by 2050 to more than 130 million units a year. Its base case is for battery EVs to account for 47 percent of that total. Glencore produced 28,300 tonnes of cobalt last year, dominating a market estimated at 100,000 tonnes. Roughly half was used in batteries for electric cars, as well as products including mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and cordless power tools. Cobalt is mostly a byproduct of nickel and copper. The DRC is estimated to produce 65 percent of the world's cobalt.

The Apple Inc smartphone rival and global memory chip leader said second-quarter operating profit was likely 14 trillion won ($12.11 billion), compared with the 13.1 trillion won average of 19 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue likely rose 18 percent from a year earlier to 60 trillion won, also a quarterly record, versus analysts' forecast of 59 trillion won. The South Korean firm did not elaborate and will release detailed earnings in late July. The robust estimates reinforce expectations for best-ever earnings for Samsung this year, fuelled by a so-called memory chip supercycle. Analysts predict shortages for both DRAM and NAND chips to persist for the rest of this year due to limited supply growth and demand for more computing power on smartphones and servers, padding margins for memory makers. Another profit driver has also emerged in the form of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. Samsung has a stranglehold on the market for the bendy, next-generation screens which are widely expected to be used for Apple's latest iPhones, due out by October.  In July DRAM prices will go up again, while from mid-August on, OLED panels go out for Apple,  HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh said. He expects Samsung's third-quarter operating profit to exceed 15 trillion won. Samsung shares were down 0.3 percent in early Friday trade, compared with a 0.2 percent fall for the broader market, as the strong earnings outlook was already priced in. The stock is up more than 30 percent this year and hovering near all-time highs. While analysts say the memory chip industry will ride a super-cycle for several years on the back of consolidation and new demand from services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, its growth rate may slow from the massive jump expected this year. Samsung said on Tuesday it would invest $18.6 billion to extend its lead in memory chips and next-generation displays, a move likely to ease shareholder fears that major decisions were on the backburner while Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee fights bribery charges in court. On the mobile front, sales prospects for the Galaxy Note 8 will be closely watched in the third quarter, after its predecessor was pulled from the market last year due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung is preparing to unveil the handset in August, a source told Reuters, underscoring the firm's desire to continue the Note brand.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading down 58 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $47.53 per barrel by 0137 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $44.95 per barrel, down 57 cents, or 1.3 percent. News of the production rise outweighed positive sentiment from falling crude and gasoline inventories in the United States.  Oil prices were initially stronger of the back of the better than expected drawdown in inventories... However, the exuberance was short-lived, as the market turned its attention to another increase in U.S. production,  ANZ bank said on Friday. U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.3 million barrels in the week to June 30, to 502.9 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Gasoline stocks fell by 3.7 million barrels, to 237.3 million barrels. The data suggested strong demand in the United States, but this was offset by a 1 percent rise in weekly U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA to 9.34 million barrels per day (bpd). Since mid-2016, that's an increase of more than 10 percent. The rising U.S. output comes as supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose for a second month in a row in June, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Research, despite its pledge to hold back production between January this year and March 2018. OPEC exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, 450,000 bpd more than in May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier.

After a bogey at the 13th, Munoz began his charge by running in a 20-footer at the par-four 14th and three shorter birdie putts at subsequent holes put him clear at the top of the leaderboard. A par at the last gave him a nine-under-par 61, relegating Love to second place with the seven-under 63 he had crafted in perfect morning conditions on the Old White TPC in West Sulphur Springs. Love, last year's winning U.S. Ryder Cup captain, had turned back the clock with a sizzling start reminiscent of the halcyon days of the 1990s and early 2000s when he was a regular winner on the PGA Tour. The 53-year-old American picked up four birdies in his first five holes before capping a glorious day with a 45-foot chip-in for birdie at the 17th.  It’s about as good as it gets,  he told PGATour radio after posting his lowest score on tour since 2002.  I hit it stiff at the first hole, made a nice putt at the second hole. I was rolling it real well, hitting it real well.  The 1997 U.S. PGA Championship winner, who caddied for his son Dru at the U.S. Open last month, arrived at the Greenbrier having missed the cut in his last four starts on tour. He found a spark, at least for one day, on a course that is not overly long by modern standards. Love was one of the longest drivers back in his prime, the last prominent player to give up traditional persimmon woods in favor of metal, but these days he plays within himself.  I’ve been working real hard the last couple of weeks on trying to fix my swing, swing around a stiff back and a stiff hip,  he said. “I’ve put a lot of time in hitting balls and getting back to hitting it solid. I’ve given up on hitting it a long way. I’ve just got to hit it straight. This is a perfect golf course for me.  Munoz credited his lowest ever round on tour to a tournament eve putting tip from Spanish pro Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano.  Yesterday I had no idea what I was going to do. I didn't feel comfortable,  Munoz told reporters.  I just talked to (Fernandez-Castano) for ten minutes and things kind of clicked. It was a good surprise. He helped me figure out some stuff and definitely worked.  The advice, Munoz revealed, was to focus his eyes on the front of the ball and not worry about making a perfect stroke. Danny Lee was among a group of six players on 64, the New Zealander having had to wait two years for a chance to defend his title after flooding forced the cancellation of the tournament last year.

The officer, Miosotis Familia, 48, a 12-year veteran of the force, was shot in the head as she sat in a mobile command truck in the Bronx borough with her partner at about 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT), the New York Police Department said.  This was an unprovoked direct attack on police officers who were assigned to keep the people of this city safe,  Police Commissioner James O'Neill told a news conference. Earlier on Twitter, he said that Familia had been  assassinated.  Police said that alleged gunman Alexander Bonds, 34, shot Familia through the vehicle's window, hitting the mother of three in the head. Bonds fled and was shot dead about a block away by two officers after he drew a handgun, according to police. A bystander was shot and wounded during that encounter, O'Neill said. He said the person, who was not identified, was in stable condition at a nearby hospital. A New York City Police Department (NYPD) officer places a candle outside the 46th police precinct after a gunman fatally shot a female New York City police officer in an unprovoked attack early on Wednesday in the city's Bronx borough of New York City, U.S., July 5, 2017.Mike SegarBonds had been arrested six times, including once in 2001 for assaulting a police officer, said NYPD spokesman Detective Ahmed Nasser. Bonds pleaded guilty to second-degree misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to community service, according to a Queens county court official.At the time of Familia's shooting, Bonds was on parole after being convicted of a robbery in Syracuse, New York, according to a police source. Bonds' social media history included an anti-police rant, posted in a Facebook Live video in September. Slideshow (15 Images) That ain't no badge of honor or nothing,  Bonds said in the video.  I don't care about a 100 police watching this shit.  The shooting was similar in style to the December 2014 ambush of two New York City police officers who were slain as they sat in a patrol car by a man who traveled to the city from Baltimore after promising to kill officers. A total of 24 U.S. law enforcement officers have been killed by gunfire so far this year, a 9 percent increase from the same period in 2016, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial Fund.  The president of the city's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association union, Patrick Lynch, condemned the attack.   Violence against police officers cannot stand,  he said.

(Reuters) - People injured by Takata Corp's defective air bags were given an official role in the bankruptcy of its U.S. unit on Thursday, allowing them to challenge restructuring plans that plaintiffs' lawyers have criticized as protective of automakers. A seven-member official committee will represent economic loss and personal injury or tort claimants, David Buchbinder, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, told a meeting of creditors of Takata's U.S. business. Official committees receive funds from a debtor to hire professionals who can carry out investigations and test financial assumptions.     William Weintraub, a lawyer with Goodwin Procter who is not involved in the Takata case, said he expected the committee  to be active and to make sure that the claims of the car manufacturers are not treated preferentially and that tort victims are fairly compensated.   A second five-member committee of suppliers and vendors was also appointed, according to Buchbinder. Takata filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United States last month, facing billions of dollars in liabilities from recalls and lawsuits stemming from its air bags.  The inflator compound used in the bags becomes volatile with age, causing the devices to inflate with too much force. The air bags have been linked to 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and hundreds of injuries.    One person appointed to the personal injury committee, Adrian Antonio Pielago, allegedly suffered a major neck laceration and nerve damage last year in an accident involving a Takata air bag, according to court records. Takata is finalizing a $1.6 billion sale of most of its business to Michigan-based Key Safety Systems, owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS). The deal is meant to save 14,000 jobs, provide a stable supply of replacement air bags and finance a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. government.    Personal injury lawyers said at a bankruptcy hearing last month that Takata was deferring too much to automakers, which claim they are owed billions of dollars in recall costs. Lawyers for Takata's U.S. business said the automakers provided financing to Takata and received protections in return. The company has set aside $125 million for injury claims, but lawyers for injured drivers said it may not be enough because millions of air bags have yet to be recalled. The lawyers say more money could come from Takata's insurance, as well as from its sale to Key Safety. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-takata-bankruptcy-usa-idUSKBN19R2ZN"},

Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of total pay and determines base salaries, jumped 0.9 percent in May from a year earlier - the biggest rise since March 2000, labor ministry data showed on Friday. Inflation-adjusted real wages rose an annual 0.1 percent in May, following a flat reading in April. The rise in real wages, though small, suggests that Japan's tight labor market is starting to translate into higher pay, and adds to other signs its economic recovery is gaining momentum. This is encouraging news for the Bank of Japan, which hopes higher pay will help boost private consumption and spur inflation toward its 2 percent goal.  I think wages and inflation are going to rise gradually, given the labor shortage,  said Shuji Tonouchi, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  The fact that wages are rising offers some support to the BOJ,  Tonouchi said. Companies will eventually have to raise prices to cover the rising labor costs, he added. Wage earners' nominal cash earnings rose an annual 0.7 percent in May, the biggest rise in 10 months, the data showed. It followed a 0.5 percent increase in April. Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, grew 0.7 percent in May from a year earlier, the biggest rise in 13 months. Special payments, such as bonuses, dropped 1.6 percent in May on year. Special payments are generally small, so even a slight change in the amount can cause big percentage changes. Japan's economy expanded an annualised 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports, and business confidence hit a three-year high in the three months to June. At a rate review on July 19-20, the BOJ is set to keep monetary policy steady and offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than it did in June to say it is expanding moderately, sources have told Reuters. However, the central bank will cut its inflation forecasts and its nine-member board will seek to explain why the strength in the economy has yet to translate into firmer prices, sources have also said.

Then, as the first round drew to a close, Hebert finished with four birdies in his final six holes to join Im on eight under at the top of the leaderboard. Defending champion and home favorite McIlroy began tentatively, dragging a putt past the hole at the third to card a bogey, before finding bunkers at the 12th and 13th, only to save par on both occasions.  The rest of the day remained a battle for the world number four as he finished with a disappointing 72, missing putt after putt as he parred the final 11 holes -- his longest run of level scores on the European Tour this year.

It was a harsh learning experience but one from which he profited. Romano returned to the mound Thursday for the Reds and helped them beat the Colorado Rockies 6-3 to gain a split of their four-game series. After lasting just three innings April 16 against Milwaukee, an 82-pitch struggle that included four walks and two home runs allowed, Romano had much better control of his emotions and his pitches this time. Admittedly overamped and overthrowing against the Brewers earlier, Romano, who was optioned back to Triple-A after that game, held the Rockies to six hits and two runs in five innings with one walk and six strikeouts. In his first career win, Romano threw twice as many strikes (56) as balls (28).  He made really large steps today,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  Being able to go out there and command the zone, not try to do too much -- made some really good pitches when he was ahead, below the zone. Faced a very good lineup, very good team and he controlled it really well ... I anticipate we'll see more of Sal.  Three relievers followed Romano to the mound. The last was closer Raisel Iglesias, who pitched for the first time in five days and worked two innings in a non-save situation. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RockiesCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchThe Reds banged out 13 hits, seven for extra-bases. That output included five doubles and Adam Duvall's 20th home run. Romano (1-1) gave up a two-out RBI single to Trevor Story in the second that tied the game at 1-1. In the fifth, Tony Wolters followed Story's bunt single with a run-scoring double that cut the Reds' lead to 3-2. The double was Wolters' first extra-base hit since his double on June 11. After issuing his first walk to Raimel Tapia, Romano had runners on the corners with two outs but retired DJ LeMahieu on a grounder to second on a 3-1 pitch after falling behind 3-0.  I wanted to attack with (Charlie) Blackmon on deck, but I fell behind,  Romano said.  I knew if I just let my sinker work when I did fall behind, I was hopefully going to get a ground ball.  This was the first road start for Romano, at Coors Field no less, which can be a challenging place to pitch. But Romano faced just four batters with a runner in scoring position, three in the 23-pitch fifth that exerted Romano to the point where Price said it made no sense to send him out for the sixth.  You dream to get here,  Romano said.  To get the first win is pretty special. Not just for me but my family, too. This one was fun.  Not for the Rockies (50-38), who have lost 12 of their past 15 games. During that stretch, they are hitting .226 overall, .216 with runners in scoring position and have a 6.43 team ERA.  Everybody gets frustrated when we have a chance to win games, and we're not winning them,  Rockies starter Tyler Chatwood said.  But at the same time, it is a long season, and I think we're still 12 games over .500 right now. So, we've endured this stretch, and we just got to turn around.  Chatwood (6-10) allowed a season-high-tying eight hits and three runs in six innings with four walks and four strikeouts. He ended three innings with double-play grounders. A two-out double in the fifth by Duvall put the Reds ahead 3-1. The hit scored Scooter Gennett, who drew a one-out walk. Eugenio Suarez's single in the third gave the Reds a 2-1 lead after Chatwood gave up a double and walk to start the inning. Billy Hamilton opened the game with a triple when right fielder Carlos Gonzalez got a glove on the ball but could not hold it. Gennett followed with a walk and Joey Votto delivered a run-scoring single. The Reds tacked on three runs in the eighth against Scott Oberg. He has stranded 22 of 25 inherited runners and 12 of his past 13 but has been less effective starting an inning. Duvall led off and belted Oberg's second pitch for a home run. Suarez flared a single to center and scored when Scott Schebler followed with a double. Pinch hitter Zack Cozart's double off Jordan Lyles made it 6-2. The Rockies added a run in the eighth before Iglesias struck out two of the three batters he faced in the ninth, sealing the Rockies' latest loss.  We have to combine the pitching with the hitting,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  Right now, there are games we pitch well enough to win, but we're not hitting. Or we don't hit well.  NOTES: Reds RHP Sal Romano was recalled from Triple-A Louisville to start against the Rockies, and RHP Austin Brice was optioned to Louisville. ... Reds SS Zack Cozart was not in the starting lineup, part of his planned playing schedule this week after being reinstated Friday from the 10-day disabled list, but he doubled home a run as a pinch hitter in the eighth. ... Rockies 2B DJ LeMahieu returned to the lineup after missing the past two games with right groin soreness. ... Rockies CF Charlie Blackmon, who typically hits leadoff, made his second career start batting third. The other was Aug. 25, 2015, at Atlanta. ...

North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea said it could carry a large nuclear warhead. Speaking at a news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Trump said North Korea was  a threat, and we will confront it very strongly . He said the United States was considering  severe things  for North Korea, but that he would not draw a  red line  of the kind that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had drawn but not enforced on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Trump added:  They are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner and something will have to be done.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the missile test in itself did not bring the parties closer to a war and stressed that America's focus was on diplomatic efforts to pressure Pyongyang.  We stand ready to provide (military) options if they are necessary. But this is a purely diplomatically led (effort),  Mattis told a small group of reporters at the Pentagon. Related CoverageChinese paper says assess North Korea trade 'fairly', after Trump tweetJapan, South Korea, U.S. demand greater Chinese effort on N.KoreaRussia objects to U.N. condemnation of North Korea, says test was not ICBM Diplomacy has not failed. ... Diplomatic efforts remain under way as we speak.  Mattis spoke by phone with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo on Thursday, reaffirming Washington's commitment to the U.S.-South Korea alliance and promising  the full range of U.S. capabilities.  He spoke with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday.  The issue presents Trump, who took office in January, with perhaps his biggest foreign policy challenge and has put pressure on his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom the Republican president had pressed without success to rein in Pyongyang. China called on Thursday for restraint and made clear it did not want to be targeted by U.S. sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump gives a public speech in front of the Warsaw Uprising Monument at Krasinski Square in Warsaw, Poland July 6, 2017.Carlos BarriaChinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said that while China would implement relevant U.N. resolutions,  the U.S. should not use their domestic laws as excuses to levy sanctions against Chinese financial institutions . Late on Thursday, court filings made public disclosed that U.S. authorities were trying to seize millions of dollars from companies that deal with North Korea, including the country's military, from eight large international banks. Russia objected on Thursday to U.N. Security Council condemnation of the North Korean rocket launch because the U.S.-drafted statement referred to it as an intercontinental ballistic missile, diplomats said. Moscow has said it believes Pyongyang fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, while China has not identified the rocket launched. North Korea said it tested an ICBM and the United States said that was likely true. Slideshow (3 Images)'Bad Behavior' Trump flew to Hamburg on Thursday to attend a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 developed nations, and was due to meet with Xi there. His frustration that Beijing has not done more to clamp down on North Korea prompted him to tweet on Wednesday:  Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!  Trump did not mention China in his remarks in Poland but his message that other countries needed to do more was clearly meant for Beijing.  President Duda and I call on all nations to confront this global threat and publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences for their very, very bad behavior,  he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions in coming days, and that if Russia and China did not support the move, then  we will go our own path.  Some diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North. U.S. officials have said the United States might seek unilaterally to sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks, echoing a tactic it used to pressure Iran to curb its nuclear program.

Morva's death sentence, for killing an unarmed security guard and a sheriff's deputy in a 2006 escape from custody, has triggered renewed debate about capital punishment for the mentally ill. Morva, 35, is scheduled to die by injection at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT on Friday). Governor Terry McAuliffe said examinations by prison doctors since Morva's 2008 conviction had shown no sign that he suffered from severe mental illness or delusional disorder, an ailment akin to schizophrenia, as his lawyers have argued.  The record before me does not contain sufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary step of overturning the decision of a lawfully impaneled jury following a properly conducted trial,  McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement. Lawyers for Morva said in a statement that McAuliffe turned down an 11th-hour request for a temporary reprieve based on reporting about the lethal drugs by the Guardian newspaper. A review of the autopsy of Ricky Gray, a Virginia inmate executed in January, showed fluid in the lungs and blood on Gray's lips, suggesting the drugs had not quickly stopped his heart as intended, the newspaper said. A McAuliffe spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. More than 34,000 people, along with U.N. human rights experts and the daughter of the slain deputy, had asked McAuliffe to spare Morva's life. Morva holds dual U.S.-Hungarian citizenship, and the European Union and the Hungarian Embassy in Washington had called on McAuliffe for clemency. Morva's deadly rampage took place after he was taken to a hospital while being held in the Montgomery County Jail on robbery charges. At the hospital he stole a gun and shot the security guard. The next day, Morva shot the deputy sheriff during a search for him. The U.S. Supreme Court declined in February to hear Morva's appeal. Morva's execution will be the 13th in the United States this year, and the 113th in Virginia since the Supreme Court allowed resumption of the death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. That number would place Virginia second among states on the U.S. executions list behind Texas, which has had 542.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/virginia-execution-idUSL1N1JX1LW"},

After speaking a few words, she hangs up and scribbles in a wrinkled notebook.  My driver has found another customer so won't be back for another 30 minutes,  she says with a satisfied smile. Hujale, who lives in the northeast Kenyan town of Wajir, used to make and sell kitchen utensils,  mostly to pastoralists who would use them as dowry for their daughters' weddings .  But as they lost their animals to drought, they had no money left to buy my products. So I had to find an alternative,  she said. Last year she secured a loan of 370,000 Kenyan shillings (about $3,560) through Crescent Takaful Sacco, an Islamic finance institution, and used the money to buy a tuk-tuk and set up a taxi business in Wajir. Access to credit is critical to help communities prepare for and cope with increasingly frequent climate shocks like droughts and floods, experts say.  But in this Kenyan region bordering Somalia, where over 90 percent of the population is Muslim, few banks or institutions offer financial services that comply with Islamic law, which bans gambling and speculation, including interest-bearing loans, said Diyad Hujale, a program coordinator at Mercy Corps, a charity, and no relation to Hamara. To remedy this, in 2016 a project helped set up the county's first private cooperative offering financial products in accordance with Islamic principles – such as interest-free loans, with no fees for late payment. The initiative, which is part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program, is funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and led by Mercy Corps. Gladys Mutisya, manager of the Wajir sacco, said it targets  the unbanked: pastoralists – who make up half of our clients – farmers, and poorer communities in general.   We're trying to fill a gap that banks and traditional institutions are not able or willing to fill.  Diyad Hujale explained that while Sharia-compliant financial services already exist in Nairobi, the capital, and elsewhere in the country, they are too far away and expensive for local residents to access – so the BRACED program supported the sacco to hire and train staff in Wajir.  Preparing for Shocks The toughest challenge in this largely pastoralist county is prolonged drought, which Hamara Hujale said  affects everyone . In addition to her kitchen utensil business, she used to herd over 100 goats - but drought has claimed many of them.  I can't even remember how many have died,  she said, bending to smell her pot of ugali. Catherine Simonet of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a London-based think tank, said that families with little or no disposable income are most affected when drought hits. Repeated droughts create  a vicious circle where they not only have no alternative income if they have lost their harvest, for example, (but) they are also made more vulnerable to the next shock , she said. Gladys Mutisya at her desk at the sacco in Wajir, Kenya, June 8, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabaryTo avoid this situation, Mutisya said the sacco's clients tend to take out loans in  good times , such as the harvesting season, when they can most easily qualify for loans. They then hold the cash as easily accessible savings, so that in dry periods they can buy food and fodder for their animals to survive.  Businesses for Resilience While many clients use the sacco as a way to boost their cash on hand, others like Hamara Hujale take out larger loans to set up their own businesses. That fills a key gap in the market that is not met by other banks or institutions, Diyad Hujale said.  Wajir [county] is vast and its residents earn very little, so to most investors they don't make 'business sense,'  he said. Receipt for money deposited into a savings account at the sacco in Wajir, Kenya, June 8, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabarySimonet concurred that the potential for pastoralists to launch businesses is often underestimated.  We tend to only look at pastoralists for example as households, when they're also producers, businesses, and a hugely untapped source of investment,  she said.  Key to the sacco's model is trust, said Mutisya.  We don't just blindly give out loans. We assess the viability of our clients' business ideas and we train them on issues like accounting.  To minimize risk, the financial institution often lends money to groups rather than individuals.  The group's cohesion and reputation acts as a guarantee for us,  Mutisya said. Hamara Hujale, who took out a loan on her own, now makes up to 2,000 shillings ($20) per day from her two businesses – nearly twice as much as when she only sold utensils.  But I need the money to repay over 30,000 shillings per month to the sacco,  she said. Her dream, once she has repaid the loan in full, is to  buy a bigger car to serve as a taxi in rural areas . Reaching Remote Areas Since the sacco opened, about 500 accounts have been created, Diyad Hujale said. But  we're only present in a 20km radius around the town, when the entire county needs us,  he said. He hopes mobile phone technology will allow the initiative to expand and reach more people through an online platform, without the need to physically meet with an agent.  Currently the only way to get a loan outside of Wajir town is for our agents to travel to outside villages, so the operation is currently very costly,  he explained.  Simonet said a mobile service would make particular sense for pastoralists.  Pastoralists not only live in rural areas, they are also constantly on the move. So to them a physical branch or agents don't make sense,  she said.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly higher on the day at 95.836, up 0.2 percent for the week. The dollar was flat on the day against its Japanese counterpart at 113.23 yen and was up 0.8 percent for the week in which it scaled a peak of 113.69, its highest level since mid-May. Investors awaited the Labor Department's June nonfarm payrolls report. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs last month, above May's relatively small gain of 138,000.  Asian investors don't want to chase the dollar up today, ahead of the nonfarm payrolls, in case the numbers disappoint,  said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. Ahead of Friday's jobs data, the ADP National Employment Report showed private-sector payrolls increased by 158,000 jobs last month, coming in below the 230,000 jobs created in May and below economists' expectations for a rise of 185,000. Separate figures from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 248,000 in the week ended July 1, marking the third straight weekly increase in claims. The U.S. services sector index, released by the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday, rose to 57.4 in June, compared with a forecast of 56.5. The employment index, however, fell to 55.8, compared with 57.8 in May, suggesting the labour market could be cooling. But the dollar was bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields which rose even after the uninspiring data, amid concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin unwinding its bond holdings sometime this year. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield touched a nearly eight-week high of 2.391 percent on Thursday. It last stood at 2.374 percent in Asian trading, above its U.S. close of 2.369 percent. Minutes from the Fed's June meeting released on Wednesday showed that some policymakers wanted to announce the beginning of the central bank's reduction of its massive debt portfolio by the end of August, but others wanted to wait until later in the year. The euro edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.1417 , and was down 0.1 percent for the week. European Central Bank policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing their monetary stimulus but are likely to move slowly out of fear of causing market turmoil, minutes of their last meeting showed on Thursday. Faster economic recovery in the euro zone is giving the ECB room to pare its extraordinary stimulus measures, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Thursday.

A constitutional energy overhaul in 2013 paved the way for the auctions by ending the decades-long monopoly enjoyed by national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, better known as Pemex. A champion of the energy opening, President Enrique Pena Nieto was elected in 2012 to a six-year term and is by law prohibited from seeking reelection. The front-runner to succeed Pena Nieto in Mexico's 2018 election is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a vocal opponent of the oil opening who could put a halt to future auctions. Coldwell said bid terms for the next deep water oil auction should be published by the end of this month, with contracts awarded by early January. An onshore oil auction covering 24 blocks will take place next week, following a shallow water tender last month.

Turner, who will be making his first All-Star appearance, tallied an all-time record 20.8 million votes in winning the online vote for the National League berth in Tuesday's Midsummer Classic in Miami.  It truly has been a wild ride,  said Turner, a seventh-round draft pick who had been in three previous MLB organizations before signing a minor league deal to join his hometown Dodgers in 2014.  I wanted to be back in LA. I grew up here, grew up a Dodger fan ... leading to today getting voted as an All-Star. It's hard to believe. I'm just so honored and happy to be out there and can't thank the fans enough,  he told MLB TV. Moustakas garnered 15.6 million votes in becoming the second player ever to win the Final Vote twice, joining Shane Victorino. The lefty-swinging Moustakas also won the American League Final Vote in 2015 for his first All-Star appearance.

The MLB All-Star Game Final Vote was conducted in online voting on MLB.com, individual club websites and Twitter. High percentage hitter Turner outdistanced Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant, Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon, Rockies first baseman Mark Reynolds and Marlins first baseman Justin Bour for the All-Star honor. Moustakas, who will compete in Monday's Home Run Derby, used a slugging spree to press his case over Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts, Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius, Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus and Rays first baseman Logan Morrison. The hard-hitting Royal has homered in six of his past eight games, increasing his career-best season output to 25 and helping slow-starting Kansas City move within a half-game of Cleveland in the AL Central standings. Entering the NL West-leading Dodgers' game on Thursday against Arizona, Turner led the major leagues with a .384 batting average and a .473 on-base percentage in 61 games.

After speaking a few words, she hangs up and scribbles in a wrinkled notebook.  My driver has found another customer so won't be back for another 30 minutes,  she says with a satisfied smile. Hujale, who lives in the northeast Kenyan town of Wajir, used to make and sell kitchen utensils,  mostly to pastoralists who would use them as dowry for their daughters' weddings .  But as they lost their animals to drought, they had no money left to buy my products. So I had to find an alternative,  she said. Last year she secured a loan of 370,000 Kenyan shillings (about $3,560) through Crescent Takaful Sacco, an Islamic finance institution, and used the money to buy a tuk-tuk and set up a taxi business in Wajir. Access to credit is critical to help communities prepare for and cope with increasingly frequent climate shocks like droughts and floods, experts say.  But in this Kenyan region bordering Somalia, where over 90 percent of the population is Muslim, few banks or institutions offer financial services that comply with Islamic law, which bans gambling and speculation, including interest-bearing loans, said Diyad Hujale, a program coordinator at Mercy Corps, a charity, and no relation to Hamara. To remedy this, in 2016 a project helped set up the county's first private cooperative offering financial products in accordance with Islamic principles – such as interest-free loans, with no fees for late payment. The initiative, which is part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program, is funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and led by Mercy Corps. Gladys Mutisya, manager of the Wajir sacco, said it targets  the unbanked: pastoralists – who make up half of our clients – farmers, and poorer communities in general.   We're trying to fill a gap that banks and traditional institutions are not able or willing to fill.  Diyad Hujale explained that while Sharia-compliant financial services already exist in Nairobi, the capital, and elsewhere in the country, they are too far away and expensive for local residents to access – so the BRACED program supported the sacco to hire and train staff in Wajir.  Preparing for Shocks The toughest challenge in this largely pastoralist county is prolonged drought, which Hamara Hujale said  affects everyone . In addition to her kitchen utensil business, she used to herd over 100 goats - but drought has claimed many of them.  I can't even remember how many have died,  she said, bending to smell her pot of ugali. Catherine Simonet of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a London-based think tank, said that families with little or no disposable income are most affected when drought hits. Repeated droughts create  a vicious circle where they not only have no alternative income if they have lost their harvest, for example, (but) they are also made more vulnerable to the next shock , she said. Gladys Mutisya at her desk at the sacco in Wajir, Kenya, June 8, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabaryTo avoid this situation, Mutisya said the sacco's clients tend to take out loans in  good times , such as the harvesting season, when they can most easily qualify for loans. They then hold the cash as easily accessible savings, so that in dry periods they can buy food and fodder for their animals to survive.  Businesses for Resilience While many clients use the sacco as a way to boost their cash on hand, others like Hamara Hujale take out larger loans to set up their own businesses. That fills a key gap in the market that is not met by other banks or institutions, Diyad Hujale said.  Wajir [county] is vast and its residents earn very little, so to most investors they don't make 'business sense,'  he said. Receipt for money deposited into a savings account at the sacco in Wajir, Kenya, June 8, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Zoe TabarySimonet concurred that the potential for pastoralists to launch businesses is often underestimated.  We tend to only look at pastoralists for example as households, when they're also producers, businesses, and a hugely untapped source of investment,  she said.  Key to the sacco's model is trust, said Mutisya.  We don't just blindly give out loans. We assess the viability of our clients' business ideas and we train them on issues like accounting.  To minimize risk, the financial institution often lends money to groups rather than individuals.  The group's cohesion and reputation acts as a guarantee for us,  Mutisya said. Hamara Hujale, who took out a loan on her own, now makes up to 2,000 shillings ($20) per day from her two businesses – nearly twice as much as when she only sold utensils.  But I need the money to repay over 30,000 shillings per month to the sacco,  she said. Her dream, once she has repaid the loan in full, is to  buy a bigger car to serve as a taxi in rural areas . Reaching Remote Areas Since the sacco opened, about 500 accounts have been created, Diyad Hujale said. But  we're only present in a 20km radius around the town, when the entire county needs us,  he said. He hopes mobile phone technology will allow the initiative to expand and reach more people through an online platform, without the need to physically meet with an agent.  Currently the only way to get a loan outside of Wajir town is for our agents to travel to outside villages, so the operation is currently very costly,  he explained.  Simonet said a mobile service would make particular sense for pastoralists.  Pastoralists not only live in rural areas, they are also constantly on the move. So to them a physical branch or agents don't make sense,  she said.

That is what the director of  Spider-Man: Homecoming  hopes audiences will be drawn to as the third Spider-Man reboot in a decade hits movie theaters on Friday.  Jon Watts said he wanted to make  Homecoming  a cross between a superhero movie and a high school comedy where the dorky lead is a fanboy of other superheroes.   Homecoming  takes a lighter tone to the last two iterations of Spider-Man, in keeping with Marvel's proclivity for harnessing laughs in its superhero franchise.  Unlike previous films where Spider-Man was the lone superhero,  Homecoming  has the web-slinging crime fighter battling alongside Marvel characters Iron Man and Captain America. Usual scenes explaining Spider-Man's origins - the death of his Uncle Ben and being bitten by a radioactive spider - are notably absent.   We've seen that origin story before,  Watts told Reuters.  Here's Spider-Man, he's a kid, let's take him on an adventure ... it's all part of trying to show people something new.   The World Premiere of “Spider-Man: Homecoming”  – Arrivals – Los Angeles, California, U.S., 28/06/2017 - Actress and singer Zendaya and actor Michael Keaton.Mario AnzuoniSpider-Man, this time played by Tom Holland, was first introduced alongside other Marvel characters in 2016's  Captain America: Civil War.   A deal between Sony Corp, which holds rights to Spider-Man, and Walt Disney Co which has those for superheroes like Iron Man, let Spider-Man feature next to fellow Marvel characters. That allowed Watts to explore the boy hero in a way he said creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originally envisioned in comic strips with multiple characters.  They wanted to give a different perspective on this world of superheroes, like a regular guy's perspective, that was one of the things that made Spider-Man so special,  Watts said.  Slideshow (11 Images) Homecoming  takes place after the events of  Civil War,  and 15-year-old Peter Parker feels neglected by Iron Man, struggling to adjust back to the mundaneness of high school while disguising his superpowers.   We've seen a lot of superheroes dealing with responsibility and burden of their powers ... but if you have a 15-year-old kid with super powers, definitely there's going to be some funny moments,  Watts said.  Parker also faces foes, particularly The Vulture, played by Michael Keaton, who has built an underground arms trade with the debris of high-powered superhero weapons littered across New York City during 2012's  Avengers.    Homecoming  has received warm reviews from critics and trade publication Variety said the film was projected to open with upward of $85 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office. The film follows Andrew Garfield's  The Amazing Spider-Man  franchise from 2012 to 2014 and movies featuring Tobey Maguire from 2002 to 2007.

To register, the groups must first approach a government ministry from a provided list and ask it to become a  supervisory body  that will vet financial and operational details of the NGO’s work before filing them with the Ministry of Public Security. Beijing says the law boosts Chinese state support for foreign NGOs and only need worry a handful of illegal groups whose political and religious work harms China's national security. But the majority of the dozen NGOs approached by Reuters for this article say the law, which came in on Jan 1, has been a bureaucratic nightmare and appears to be aimed at making it more difficult for them to operate in China. Some NGOs say the ministries are often reluctant to take on the sponsor's role. When foreign NGOs limit their operations in China it can not only curb the direct flow of funds into projects but can also hurt their Chinese non-profit partners. Many of these partnerships have been instrumental in establishing building blocks of modern Chinese society in areas such as education and healthcare. Dog Rescue The law is already preventing foreign NGOs from doing some of their previous activities. Humane Society International (HSI), the animal welfare activist group, was unable to attend the annual Yulin dog meat festival to rescue dogs from being killed and eaten this year, according to its Director of International Media, Wendy Higgins.  We are trying to meet the criteria, but until we receive formal approval we have not been able to have HSI personnel on the ground as before and our funding to our partner groups is temporarily frozen,  she said in an email. The Washington, D.C.-based National Geographic Society has said it cannot accept applications for grants to do research, conservation or exploration projects in mainland China or from Chinese applicants due to the new law, according to an email from the organization reviewed by Reuters. The email did not elaborate and National Geographic declined to comment. Germany's Stiftung Asienhaus, an NGO that runs regular exchanges between European and Chinese NGOs, has seen applications from NGOs in China cut in half since the law took effect, according to Nora Sausmikat, head of its China program.  Bureaucratic hurdles, which have never been easily managed in China, have now become nearly insurmountable,  she said. Many other NGOs approached for this article either declined to be interviewed or to be identified for fear that they would upset the Chinese authorities and damage their registration prospects. FILE PHOTO: People eat dog meat at a dog meat restaurant district on the day of local dog meat festival in Yulin, Guangxi Autonomous Region, June 22, 2015.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoThe Ministry of Public Security did not reply to a faxed request for comment. China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Hot Potato  The Chinese government estimates there are around 7,000 overseas NGOs in mainland China; academics who have studied the sector suggest about 1,000 of these have a permanent presence in China and so need to register. According to the Ministry of Public Security database, only 139 representative offices of foreign NGOs have been registered so far. Among the handful of groups registered who are working in more sensitive fields such as policy advocacy or the environment, are well-known groups with Chinese government ties, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, set up by the Microsoft Corp founder and his wife. FILE PHOTO: Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp co-founder and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, smiles after putting on a shirt bearing the slogan:  Say No to Involuntary Smoking , during a media conference in Beijing June 11, 2011.David Gray/File PhotoAll the NGOs with offices in mainland China who were contacted by Reuters are attempting to register. Those who do not have offices hope to continue working using a system of temporary permits applied for by a Chinese partner. Finding and securing a  professional supervisory unit  willing to sponsor an NGO's application is a stumbling block for NGOs seeking to register, according to four employees from separate NGOs.  We are passed back and forth ... like a hot potato. No one wants to take the imitative,  said one employee at an NGO that works in the education field. The reticence of ministries to act as sponsors is likely due to fear of being held responsible for the actions of NGOs, said Lester Ross, a partner at the U.S.-based WilmerHale law firm, who advises a number of foreign NGOs in China.  What is the advantage for them (the ministries)? Why stick your neck out?  he said. But according to Sun Jiangang, a lawyer at the JunHe law firm in Shanghai who previously worked with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, holdups are because local officials and NGOs need time to familiarize themselves with the new process. Indefinite Hold A Western conservation organization, which has operated in China for more than a decade, has put work on indefinite hold as its researchers are not being approved to enter Chinese national forestry reserves to study endangered species, an employee told Reuters. “They want to strictly control who studies what and what results they get from reserves,” said this person, who asked that the group not be named. “The overall environment is unwelcoming.

But the $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion tax hike may not save Illinois from becoming the first-ever U.S. state with a junk credit rating. The Democratic-controlled House mustered some Republican votes to enact a trio of budget and revenue bills into law over Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's objection. The House's action, which was delayed by a nearly two-hour lockdown of the state Capitol in Springfield after a woman threw a white powder into the governor's office, followed successful Senate veto override votes on Tuesday.  The spending plan for the fiscal year that began on July 1 ends an unprecedented two-year budget impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. Rauner pointed to House Speaker Michael Madigan as the architect of the 32 percent permanent increase in the state's personal income tax rate, which will rise to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent.  His tax-and-spend plan is not balanced, does not cut enough spending or pay down enough debt, and does not help grow jobs or restore confidence in government,  Rauner said in a statement, adding that Illinois  desperately  needs local property tax relief and term limits for elected officials.  Madigan, who next month will becomes the longest-serving House speaker in U.S. history, said he acted in the state's interest. “The people in this chamber did not do what was easy today, but we did what was right for the future of our state,” Madigan said after the House completed veto overrides of the budget and tax package, which ranks as one of the brightest legislative victories of his three decades as speaker.  Financial Abyss  After the security scare, when a woman threw a white powder which was later determined to be harmless into the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor and the House gallery, the bipartisan turning back of Rauner's budgetary vetoes came swiftly. For Rauner it was the most significant and humiliating political blow of his 30 months in office. FILE PHOTO: A general view of the  joint session of the General Assembly in the House Chambers of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois February 1, 2012.Sarah Conard/File PhotoRepresentative David Harris, who was among the 10 Republicans who voted to overturn the tax hike veto,  rhetorically asked Rauner from the House floor how he willingly could take the state into the “financial abyss” considering the governor’s long-established business acumen as a former private equity investor. “You are an astute, capable businessman. You understand what the numbers are here,  Harris said.  You understand the implications of junk-bond status. Is that what we want for the fifth-largest state in the union?”  Rauner’s allies made an effort to defend the governor’s position to hold out for non-budgetary priorities like a property-tax freeze and changes in how injured workers are compensated by employers, but it was a lost cause. “I hope that everybody back home and everybody across this state will rise up, let everyone in this chamber know exactly how they feel after this vote is taken,” said Representative John Cabello, a Republican  no  vote. Illinois has been operating for two fiscal years on stop-gap budgets and spending ordered by courts and mandated by Illinois law. Its unpaid bill backlog has ballooned to $15 billion, leaving state universities, social service and health care providers and scores of vendors starving for cash. Moody's Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk, placed the state under review on Wednesday for a potential downgrade, saying the budget plan may fall short in addressing the state's huge unfunded pension liability and the bill backlog.  The new budget aims to initially reduce the bill pile by only about a third, while banking on a projected $1.5 billion in savings from creating a hybrid retirement plan for new hires and other pension measures. Praise for Thursday’s House action flooded in from cash-deprived social-service groups, including the Chicago-based Ounce of Prevention Fund, a group dedicated to fighting childhood poverty whose president is Diana Rauner, the governor’s wife. “We applaud the members of the General Assembly in both parties who took the tough vote to try to end this impasse,” the group said in a statement.

Usually so serene on his Centre Court stage, the 35-year-old Swiss was visibly snatching at some shots early on against 79th-ranked Serb Dusan Lajovic and dropped his first service game before ironing out the kinks to win 7-6(0) 6-3 6-2. His record-extending 86th win at the All England Club put him closer to becoming the first man to claim eight Wimbledon singles titles, having first lifted the trophy in 2003, but it was far from a routine day at the office for the 35-year-old.  I was feeling nerves for some reason. Not sure why,  third seed Federer, who will face German serve-and-volleyer Mischa Zverev in round three, told reporters.  It was definitely more acute than I normally feel it. It was just like all of a sudden I was walking up to the locker room after my warm-up and I was feeling excited and nervous. Related CoverageFactbox: Highlights of Wimbledon fourth day Then when I walked to the court it was still ongoing and after the warm-up it was still there. And down 1-0, 0-40, it was still there, and it was still there at 6-6 in the first set.  Just took a while to shake it off.  Nervous Tension Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 6, 2017   Switzerland’s Roger Federer waves to the crowd as he celebrates winning the second round match against Serbia’s Dusan LajovicStefan WermuthThat Federer still has nervous tension after winning 18 majors is perhaps the strongest argument to suggest he can reclaim the title he last won in 2012. He is clearly not a man just playing out the last few years of his magnificent career for fun. Slideshow (3 Images) It's weird how sometimes you can be way more nervous for a second round than for a final,  he said.  I'm happy I got through this one feeling the way I did, because in a way it's strange playing this way when you're so tense.  His early-evening match became a piece of cake after he demoralized Lajovic with a masterful tiebreak. Lajovic had played admirably to stay with Federer throughout the first set and even led by an early break. The 27-year-old Serb must have felt he was in with a chance as the tiebreak began but Federer played seven scintillating points to finally calm the nerves. With dark clouds looming overhead the Swiss looked in a hurry to get the job done and broke early in the second set. The third set was one-way traffic and Federer sealed victory with his ninth ace.

The incident was one of the largest oil-related spills on North American soil and stoked fierce criticism about the environmental impact of Canada's oil sands industry in northern Alberta. The leak of bitumen emulsion, a mixture of bitumen, water and sand, affected an area of about 21,900 square meters (235,730 square feet) about 36 km (22 miles) south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray. Alberta Energy Regulator staff have been gathering evidence over the past two years to determine the cause of the spill and whether Nexen complied with regulations. On the recommendation of the province's Crown Prosecution Service, the AER laid five charges under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and Public Lands Act.  When we believe that the rules are not followed, we have a variety of tools, including laying charges that we can and do use in an attempt to ensure that potential offenders are held accountable,  AER Chief Executive Jim Ellis said.  Nexen declined to comment beyond saying it had received the charges and would  consider  them. The charges include releasing a substance in the environment that caused an adverse effect, failing to report the release of a substance as soon as possible, failing to take all reasonable measures to remediate and causing a disturbance to public land. The maximum fine Nexen could face is C$3 million ($2.31 million), according to the AER. A spokesman for the regulator said it would not be able to release a full investigation report into the cause of the leak until the court case is settled. Nexen's first court appearance is scheduled for Aug. 16 in Fort McMurray provincial court. Chinese state-owned oil company CNOOC bought Calgary-based Nexen in 2013 for C$15.1 billion, giving it control of the 60,000-barrel-per-day Long Lake site and billions of barrels of oil sands reserves. Oil prices have since crashed, leading many industry players to questions whether CNOOC overpaid for the company. Long Lake has also been beset with problems, including an explosion in early 2016 that killed two workers and prompted Nexen to suspend repairs on its upgrader indefinitely.

But the $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion tax hike may not save Illinois from becoming the first-ever U.S. state with a junk credit rating. The Democratic-controlled House mustered some Republican votes to enact a trio of budget and revenue bills into law over Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's objection. The House's action, which was delayed by a nearly two-hour lockdown of the state Capitol in Springfield after a woman threw a white powder into the governor's office, followed successful Senate veto override votes on Tuesday.  The spending plan for the fiscal year that began on July 1 ends an unprecedented two-year budget impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. Rauner pointed to House Speaker Michael Madigan as the architect of the 32 percent permanent increase in the state's personal income tax rate, which will rise to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent.  His tax-and-spend plan is not balanced, does not cut enough spending or pay down enough debt, and does not help grow jobs or restore confidence in government,  Rauner said in a statement, adding that Illinois  desperately  needs local property tax relief and term limits for elected officials.  Madigan, who next month will becomes the longest-serving House speaker in U.S. history, said he acted in the state's interest. “The people in this chamber did not do what was easy today, but we did what was right for the future of our state,” Madigan said after the House completed veto overrides of the budget and tax package, which ranks as one of the brightest legislative victories of his three decades as speaker.  Financial Abyss  After the security scare, when a woman threw a white powder which was later determined to be harmless into the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor and the House gallery, the bipartisan turning back of Rauner's budgetary vetoes came swiftly. For Rauner it was the most significant and humiliating political blow of his 30 months in office. FILE PHOTO: A general view of the  joint session of the General Assembly in the House Chambers of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois February 1, 2012.Sarah Conard/File PhotoRepresentative David Harris, who was among the 10 Republicans who voted to overturn the tax hike veto,  rhetorically asked Rauner from the House floor how he willingly could take the state into the “financial abyss” considering the governor’s long-established business acumen as a former private equity investor. “You are an astute, capable businessman. You understand what the numbers are here,  Harris said.  You understand the implications of junk-bond status. Is that what we want for the fifth-largest state in the union?”  Rauner’s allies made an effort to defend the governor’s position to hold out for non-budgetary priorities like a property-tax freeze and changes in how injured workers are compensated by employers, but it was a lost cause. “I hope that everybody back home and everybody across this state will rise up, let everyone in this chamber know exactly how they feel after this vote is taken,” said Representative John Cabello, a Republican  no  vote. Illinois has been operating for two fiscal years on stop-gap budgets and spending ordered by courts and mandated by Illinois law. Its unpaid bill backlog has ballooned to $15 billion, leaving state universities, social service and health care providers and scores of vendors starving for cash. Moody's Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk, placed the state under review on Wednesday for a potential downgrade, saying the budget plan may fall short in addressing the state's huge unfunded pension liability and the bill backlog.  The new budget aims to initially reduce the bill pile by only about a third, while banking on a projected $1.5 billion in savings from creating a hybrid retirement plan for new hires and other pension measures. Praise for Thursday’s House action flooded in from cash-deprived social-service groups, including the Chicago-based Ounce of Prevention Fund, a group dedicated to fighting childhood poverty whose president is Diana Rauner, the governor’s wife. “We applaud the members of the General Assembly in both parties who took the tough vote to try to end this impasse,” the group said in a statement. With a new budget in hand, the Illinois Lottery will immediately seek leave to resume sales of Mega Millions and Powerball tickets after they were suspended in late June, and a shutdown of billions of dollars in state road projects will end, according to state spokespeople.

In April, the department had asked a handful of states and cities to document by June 30 their compliance with a statute that says local governments cannot prevent their employees from sharing information with U.S. immigration officials. The Trump administration has said jurisdictions that do not fully cooperate are shielding  criminal illegal aliens,  and has promised to crack down on cities that do not comply. The sanctuary jurisdictions say they are following the law and do not want to spend local resources on immigration enforcement.  It is not enough to assert compliance, the jurisdictions must actually be in compliance,  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Thursday. He said the 10 jurisdictions had written in with  alleged compliance information  and that the government would  examine these claims carefully.  Sessions' statement said  some of these jurisdictions have boldly asserted they will not comply with requests from federal immigration authorities.  If the government finds the cities are violating the statute, known as Section 1373, it could decide to cut federal funds.  In the letters seen by Reuters, the jurisdictions say they are following the law even though some do not honor all  detainer  requests sent by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE.) A  detainer  asks local authorities to hold people in jail up to 48 hours beyond when they are set to be released so immigration officials can take them into custody. Many of the letters noted that compliance with detainer requests is voluntary and is not required under the statute. The jurisdictions targeted are the states of California and Connecticut, Chicago and Cook County in Illinois, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Miami, Milwaukee and New York. At least one of the jurisdictions – Nevada's Clark County, which is dominated by Las Vegas – has a long-standing formal agreement with ICE in which local police officers help with federal immigration enforcement. New York City said it complies with detainer requests for people who have been convicted of certain  violent or serious  crimes, so long as the request is accompanied by a judicial warrant. Like other cities, New York said its priority is creating trust between immigrant communities and local police to encourage residents, even if they are living in the country illegally, to report crimes. Mitchell Landrieu, the Mayor of New Orleans made a similar argument in a letter to Sessions. He said the administration has erroneously characterized sanctuary cities as havens for Central American gangs. Landrieu said an audit of gangs in New Orleans did not find a single Latino-dominated group.   Undocumented people who commit violent crimes must face the criminal and immigration legal systems of this country. But that does not mean that all people are illegal immigrants that are part of violent gangs,  Landrieu wrote.  Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele called the Justice Department's statement on Thursday  inflammatory.   The county is at risk of losing more than $6 million in revenue if the Justice Department follows through, a June 28 letter from its lawyers said. It said Milwaukee would  avail itself of all legal options available  to  protect its grant funding.  Trump's executive order early in his presidency pledging to cut funding to sanctuary cities has been challenged in the courts. In April, a federal judge in San Francisco said in a case brought by Santa Clara county that cities were likely to succeed in proving Trump's order unconstitutional. The California county wrote in a court filing on Thursday that top administration officials have repeatedly stated that federal funding should be tied to local willingness to honor ICE detainer requests.

The incident was one of the largest oil-related spills on North American soil and stoked fierce criticism about the environmental impact of Canada's oil sands industry in northern Alberta. The leak of bitumen emulsion, a mixture of bitumen, water and sand, affected an area of about 21,900 square meters (235,730 square feet) about 36 km (22 miles) south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray. Alberta Energy Regulator staff have been gathering evidence over the past two years to determine the cause of the spill and whether Nexen complied with regulations. On the recommendation of the province's Crown Prosecution Service, the AER laid five charges under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and Public Lands Act.  When we believe that the rules are not followed, we have a variety of tools, including laying charges that we can and do use in an attempt to ensure that potential offenders are held accountable,  AER Chief Executive Jim Ellis said.  Nexen declined to comment beyond saying it had received the charges and would  consider  them. The charges include releasing a substance in the environment that caused an adverse effect, failing to report the release of a substance as soon as possible, failing to take all reasonable measures to remediate and causing a disturbance to public land. The maximum fine Nexen could face is C$3 million ($2.31 million), according to the AER. A spokesman for the regulator said it would not be able to release a full investigation report into the cause of the leak until the court case is settled. Nexen's first court appearance is scheduled for Aug. 16 in Fort McMurray provincial court. Chinese state-owned oil company CNOOC bought Calgary-based Nexen in 2013 for C$15.1 billion, giving it control of the 60,000-barrel-per-day Long Lake site and billions of barrels of oil sands reserves. Oil prices have since crashed, leading many industry players to questions whether CNOOC overpaid for the company. Long Lake has also been beset with problems, including an explosion in early 2016 that killed two workers and prompted Nexen to suspend repairs on its upgrader indefinitely.

The findings come as investors worry that demand for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan is waning ahead of the mass market Model 3 launch. Tesla earlier this week reported first-half global deliveries of its Model S and its Model X SUV at the low end of its own forecast, driving down the stock and raising questions about demand for the older models. Tesla’s share price more than doubled between early December and late June as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s strategy to transform the low-volume luxury electric car maker into a diversified producer of mass market vehicles, storage batteries, electric commercial trucks and rooftop solar panels. The company’s market value rose past larger rivals General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  Since June 23, however, Tesla shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent amid concerns that demand for the company’s existing models is weakening. Overall sales of electric vehicles in the United States remain stuck at less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales, despite a growing number of models fielded by Tesla and other car makers. Tesla declined to comment on California registration figures and noted that second-quarter global deliveries rose 53 percent from a year earlier, to just over 12,000 Model S and just over 10,000 Model X. It said earlier this week that battery pack production problems held back vehicle output in the second quarter until early June. California, a haven for environmentalists and techies, is one of the company's leading markets. The company does not break out results by geographic area. IHS analyst Stephanie Brinley cautioned that a single month of data could not fully explain Tesla demand.   If Tesla had an issue with its production for the month, that could explain  the drop in registrations, she said, noting in particular the problems with battery pack output. Still, she said, Tesla's Model S, launched in 2012, could be in need of a refresh.   They haven’t changed much on the exterior or much on the package,  and it is a high-fashion car, she said.  I can certainly understand where Model S sales may be softening a little bit because it’s an older product. That could be contributing to the issue.   Industry data reviewed separately by Reuters showed that the Model S registrations in California were uneven over the first four months of 2017, varying by more than 1,000 units month-to-month. In percentage terms Model S growth peaked in February, decelerated in March and turned negative in April in California. Brinley said it was difficult to assess whether that reflected demand or availability. IHS measures vehicle registration, which comes after a sale. Registration in California and overall in the United States rose sharply for the combined first four months of the year, but April showed steep declines. IHS has not released data for May or June. Chief Executive Musk in May stoked concerns that the Model 3 would cannibalize demand for the Model S when he told investors that some  confused  Tesla buyers regarded the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, affecting Model S orders. The new car is a $35,000 mass market vehicle, which costs about half the price of the Model S. Tesla reported first-half 2017 global deliveries rose to 47,100 in 2017. Tesla had predicted 47,000 to 50,000. Musk in May said there would be demand for 100,000 luxury Teslas. IHS reported April Tesla registrations fell to 2,177 from 2,867 in California. Nationally they dropped nearly 10 percent to 3,911 from 4,334. For the first four months, California registrations rose to 6,926 from 5,804 and U.S. registrations rose to 15,288 from 10,937. Tesla shares fell 5.6 percent to close at $308.83 on Thursday, although the stock is up about 45 percent for the year to date.

In April, the department had asked a handful of states and cities to document by June 30 their compliance with a statute that says local governments cannot prevent their employees from sharing information with U.S. immigration officials. The Trump administration has said jurisdictions that do not fully cooperate are shielding  criminal illegal aliens,  and has promised to crack down on cities that do not comply. The sanctuary jurisdictions say they are following the law and do not want to spend local resources on immigration enforcement.  It is not enough to assert compliance, the jurisdictions must actually be in compliance,  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Thursday. He said the 10 jurisdictions had written in with  alleged compliance information  and that the government would  examine these claims carefully.  Sessions' statement said  some of these jurisdictions have boldly asserted they will not comply with requests from federal immigration authorities.  If the government finds the cities are violating the statute, known as Section 1373, it could decide to cut federal funds. In the letters seen by Reuters, the jurisdictions say they are following the law even though some do not honor all  detainer  requests sent by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE.) A  detainer  asks local authorities to hold people in jail up to 48 hours beyond when they are set to be released so immigration officials can take them into custody. Many of the letters noted that compliance with detainer requests is voluntary and is not required under the statute. The jurisdictions targeted are the states of California and Connecticut, Chicago and Cook County in Illinois, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Miami, Milwaukee and New York. At least one of the jurisdictions – Nevada's Clark County, which is dominated by Las Vegas – has a long-standing formal agreement with ICE in which local police officers help with federal immigration enforcement. New York City said it complies with detainer requests for people who have been convicted of certain  violent or serious  crimes, so long as the request is accompanied by a judicial warrant. Like other cities, New York said its priority is creating trust between immigrant communities and local police to encourage residents, even if they are living in the country illegally, to report crimes. Mitchell Landrieu, the Mayor of New Orleans made a similar argument in a letter to Sessions. He said the administration has erroneously characterized sanctuary cities as havens for Central American gangs. Landrieu said an audit of gangs in New Orleans did not find a single Latino-dominated group.  Undocumented people who commit violent crimes must face the criminal and immigration legal systems of this country. But that does not mean that all people are illegal immigrants that are part of violent gangs,  Landrieu wrote. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele called the Justice Department's statement on Thursday  inflammatory.  The county is at risk of losing more than $6 million in revenue if the Justice Department follows through, a June 28 letter from its lawyers said.

Giovanni Pamio, an Italian citizen, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud, and violation of the Clean Air Act, the Justice Department said in a news release. The complaint released on Thursday evening said U.S. authorities had help from an unidentified Audi employee who works in the German luxury brand's diesel engine development department. The witness is cooperating with U.S. authorities, and they agreed in return not to prosecute the person.

Audi employees feared that an AdBlue tank big enough to require refills only every 10,000 miles (16,000 km) would  interfere with features considered to be attractive to customers, such as a high-end sound system,  according to the government's complaint.

Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward, but if we as a society are to succeed, we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth,  Fischer said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Summer Institute of Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center.  Fischer did not address the current state of the U.S. economy or monetary policy, but focused instead on the importance of output per worker as a fundamental driver of economic growth and standards of living.    Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth,  he said.  Such policies include more investment in basic research, infrastructure, early childhood education, financial aid for higher education, and public health, including clean air and drinking water, he said.  Fischer did not offer any specific commentary on policies under the new administration of President Donald Trump, who has so far struggled to turn his political agenda into legislation during the first several months of his term.  But Fischer did say it would be  highly desirable  to provide more clarity about health care, regulation, taxes and trade policy because uncertainty over the policy environment is making businesses  reluctant to invest.

In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a  tax  on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban  iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.  Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall.  I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,  Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm's practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for  modem  chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using  anticompetitive  tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose  onerous  supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm. Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-qualcomm-idUSL1N1JX274"},

Twitter filed the lawsuit in 2014 after revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about the extent of U.S. spying. The lawsuit is aimed at ending legal limits on details that tech companies can provide about U.S. national security requests. Currently, companies can reveal the number of requests they have received, but only within a range, such as 0-499 in a six-month period. Facebook Inc, for example, has disclosed that during the last six months of 2016 it received between zero and 499 national security letters, a type of U.S. government order for communications data that does not require a warrant.

The deal is a bold bet by Buffett that he can get the deal past Texas regulators after they blocked two earlier attempts to sell Oncor to other companies. It also represents a return to a previously soured investment for Buffet, who in 2013 lost $873 million on his bonds in Oncor's parent, Energy Future Holdings. Berkshire Hathaway's deal, which could be announced by Friday, would value Oncor at slightly less than Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc's previous $18.4 billion bid, making it Buffett's third biggest acquisition ever, two people said. The Wall Street Journal, which reported on the deal earlier, said the deal could be valued at more than $17.5 billion. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Terry Hadley, a spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, declined to comment. Oncor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire and Energy Future declined to comment. Any deal for Oncor would have to receive approvals from the judge overseeing Energy Future's bankruptcy, as well as federal and state regulators. Earlier this year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas rejected NextEra's deal for Oncor, the largest network of power lines in the state, deeming that it was not in the public interest because it did not substantially ringfence Oncor's finances. Another deal for Oncor led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas fell through in 2016 after regulators also put up roadblocks. Berkshire Hathaway had been among the leading bidders for Oncor in earlier auctions for the utility, according to the sources. Energy Future filed for Chapter 11 in April 2014 after it failed to meet its debt obligations as electricity prices weakened. This followed a $31.8 billion acquisition in 2007 by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's private equity arm, the biggest leveraged buyout of all time that became the biggest bankruptcy ever.

The order is the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump to make it easier to drill and mine on federal land, which Zinke said is a source of income for the government. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is supposed to take 30 days to review applications for permits to drill but Zinke said the average time for processing in 2016 was 257 days.  I'm directing the BLM to conduct quarterly lease sales and address these permitting issues,  Zinke said in a statement.  We are also looking at opportunities to bring support to our front line offices who are facing the brunt of this workload.  There were 2,802 permit applications pending as of Jan. 31, with three quarters of them filed in five field offices in Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota and New Mexico. On a call with reporters, Zinke did not say how long this streamlining process would take.  This is not going to be done overnight. What we don’t want is unintended consequences,  he said. Environmental groups criticized the announcement and said that companies have already leased vast amounts of public lands but have held off on drilling due to record low oil prices.  With historically low gas prices, these companies aren’t using millions of acres of leases they already have, so there’s no reason to hand over even more,” said Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project. The group pointed to Interior Department data that showed that oil production on federal land increased by 77 percent between 2008 and 2015. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, a lobby group for independent drillers, welcomed the announcement, which came a week after Zinke met with its president, Barry Russell.

The signs of pay pressure in the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) survey contrast with Britain's official measure of growth in earnings which has weakened recently. Growth in starting salaries for permanent jobs hit a 19-month high in June in June, REC said, offering Bank of England policymakers a rare suggestion that wage growth in Britain will accelerate, as they expect.   With fewer people currently looking for jobs, employers are having to increase starting salaries to secure the talent they need,  Tom Hadley, REC Director of Policy, said.  Existing skills shortages are being exacerbated by Brexit. For example, demand for accountants and other financial roles has increased recently as organizations try to protect themselves against economic uncertainty.  Other indicators of pay have been weak. Official data showed wages grew at the slowest pace since February last year in the three months to April, rising 2.1 percent on the year and falling further behind inflation which is close to 3 percent. Other business surveys have also pointed to weak upward pressure on wages.

The infection, which in many cases has no symptoms on its own, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, as well as increasing the risk of getting HIV. Wi, who gave details in a telephone briefing of two studies on gonorrhoea published in the journal PLOS Medicine, said one had documented three specific cases - one each in Japan, France and Spain - of patients with strains of gonorrhoea against which no known antibiotic is effective.

Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill said the 79-year-old comedian would be tried again beginning on Nov. 6. He is accused of the sexual assault of Temple University administrator Andrea Constand in his Philadelphia-area home in 2004. Cosby built a long career on a family-friendly style of comedy exemplified by the 1980s TV hit  The Cosby Show  before dozens of women came forward to accuse him of sex assault in a series of incidents dating back to the 1960s. The vast majority of those alleged incidents were too old to be the subject of criminal prosecution, but Cosby has faced one criminal trial because prosecutors in Pennsylvania charged him in December 2015, just days before the statute of limitations was to run out on Constand's claim. The jurors who heard Cosby's first trial in Norristown, Pennsylvania, who were bused in from Pittsburgh, 300 miles (480 km) away, failed to reach a unanimous verdict last month after 52 hours of deliberations that often stretched late into the night. Cosby has long denied any criminal wrongdoing and has said that any sexual contact he had with his accusers was consensual. His spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, hailed the hung-jury outcome as a victory for Cosby, who has not performed to a paying audience for more than two years. Cosby is also awaiting two trials over civil lawsuits filed against him by accusers, with both scheduled for the summer of 2018.

The poll is being seen as a referendum on the government's economic recovery plans and the role of giant southern neighbour China in the landlocked but resource-rich country known as the birthplace of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan. The presidential race went into a run-off after none of the three candidates won a majority late last month. A populist former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party won the most votes, but fell short of the required majority. Voters regard Battulga as a resource nationalist who is suspicious of China. He faces the candidate of the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), Miyeegombo Enkhbold, who came second. Enkhbold has stood behind the current government and prime minister, pledging to stay the course for economic recovery following a $5.5-billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund and partners in May. Battulga has captured the attention of voters who feel Mongolia has got a bad deal on investments, promising greater government control of strategic mines, such as Rio Tinto's , Oyu Tolgoi copper mine. Enkhbold, for his part, has promised to deliver money owed from a universal child welfare fund. The race has been clouded by allegations of corruption and voter fraud by all sides, with many voters dismayed by their choice of candidates and the government's inability to bring them prosperity. But the country's 1.9 million voters also have a third option, according to the so-called  White Ballot  campaign, to leave their votes blank.  Our goal is to have every voter know they have an option to vote for none of the above,  said spokesman Mogi Badral Bantoi. For many voters, handing in blank ballots is a last-ditch effort to deny either candidate a majority, so forcing a re-run of the poll from scratch, with selection of fresh candidates. The run-off vote comes amid a government crackdown on election reporting and a controversial new anti-defamation law that took effect from July 1 and which Mongolian rights groups fear could discourage free speech. Mongolia is a parliamentary democracy. The government is run by a prime minister, but the president has powers to veto legislation and make judicial appointments.

Compared to health insurance plans with larger provider networks, plans with fewer providers to choose from were more likely to exclude cancer doctors at National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Centers, researchers found.  We think there should be more transparency about this when patients are signing up for these plans,  said lead author Laura Yasaitis, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. Health insurance plans that offer a narrow network of providers are usually cheaper than plans with more doctors to choose from, Yasaitis and colleagues write in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. To be able to offer lower premiums, insurance plans might exclude higher-cost doctors or hospitals. Also, some doctors and hospitals may refuse to accept the reimbursement terms offered by the lower-cost plans, thereby excluding themselves. It's not clear whether a narrow network affects the quality of care people receive, but the researchers say the limited selection may cut access to high-quality providers like those at NCI-Designated Cancer Centers. A NCI-Designated Cancer Center earns the distinction through top quality care and research, Yasaitis told Reuters Health. Past research shows patients - especially those with the most complex cancer cases - do better at those centers. To examine access to doctors at those top cancer centers, the researchers analyzed the plans offered in 2014 on the individual health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. They looked at differences between geographic areas with and without at least one of the 69 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, and they compared plans that did or didn't pay for treatment by doctors at those centers. Altogether, the researchers identified 23,442 oncologists. About three quarters participated in at least one network offered on the insurance exchanges. The ratio of cancer doctors to patients was higher in the 51 insurance markets with at least one NCI-Designated Cancer Center, at roughly 14 oncologists per 100,000 people, compared to about 9 per 100,000 people in markets without a top cancer center. But whereas in areas without an NCI-designated cancer center, nearly 50 percent of oncologists were available to narrow-network plan members, that was true for only about 39 percent of oncologists in areas that did have the highly-rated hospitals.      When the researchers analyzed the 248 insurance plans in markets with NCI centers, they found 33 didn't include any of those institutions' oncologists.  The narrow-network-included physicians were less likely to be NCI affiliated,  said Yasaitis. The pattern was similar when the researchers looked at markets with National Comprehensive Cancer Network Cancer Centers, which are known for treating complex and rare malignancies.  The findings are clear and consistent,  said Dr. Justin Bekelman, a study co-author also at the Perelman School of Medicine. Bekelman told Reuters Health that patients need to be aware of their insurance plan's offerings.  It looks like most of these centers known for the highest quality care are being cut out of these plans,  he said. Bekelman said insurers can mark which insurance plans include NCI-affiliated oncologists. Yasaitis also said insurance companies should allow people to ask for an exemption that allows them to seek needed treatments.  They should be able to pursue it at that center without incurring a whole lot of additional charges,  she said.

The survey results from Coworker.org, which hosts online petitions, come a year after U.S. Starbucks workers used the site to protest staffing cutbacks that they warned were slowing service and hurting morale at the popular coffee chain. Coworker.org said its poll included 184 self-identified, current U.S. Starbucks cafe workers, supervisors and managers across 33 states. New Chief Executive Kevin Johnson launched the initiative at Starbucks, which has more than 13,000 U.S. coffee shops, with more than 150,000 workers. In January, Starbucks said some of its busiest U.S. cafes were grappling with bottlenecks at drink pick-up stations during peak hours. Executives blamed the delays on an avalanche of mobile orders and said the backups had chased away some walk-in customers.  The company, which has reported two straight quarters of declines in U.S. traffic, reworked tasks to make them more efficient and gave managers more leeway to add staffing as part of a broad customer re-engagement program dubbed  North Star.  That effort is led by Kris Engskov, Starbucks' president  of U.S. retail, under the guidance of Johnson, who succeeded longtime CEO Howard Schultz in April.  FILE PHOTO - Kevin Johnson delivers remarks at the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2016.Andrew Kelly All of our metrics show we are moving in the opposite direction of what the survey claims,  Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said.  Over the last eight months, we've added labor to about 15 percent of our stores and are looking to add more in the months ahead,  he said. Despite that, 75 percent of the Starbucks workers polled by Coworker.org said their stores were not staffed to meet the goals of North Star.  Eighty-nine percent of respondents said staffing levels were still a problem in their stores in the past three months, and 62 percent said their ability to deliver the best customer service possible decreased during that time. Mobile ordering has  added to the work load immensely, and yet again, there aren't even enough people scheduled to share the workload,  an unnamed Starbucks partner told Coworker.org. A Starbucks employee last year launched a Coworker.org petition, accusing the chain of  extreme  cutbacks in work hours that were crushing morale. The petition currently has more than 18,000 signatures. Workers last year told Reuters they noticed the reduction in hours in April 2016, after Starbucks reported a deceleration in quarterly cafe sales growth.

In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a  tax  on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban  iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.  Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7.  Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall.  I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,  Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm's practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for  modem  chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using  anticompetitive  tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose  onerous  supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm.  Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks.

Republicans have been critical of the CFPB, saying it is too unaccountable to Congress because its budget is not appropriated and it is governed by a single director. The Trump Administration has called for reforms to the CFPB, but has been silent on whether it intends to try to have CFPB Director Richard Cordray removed before his term expires next summer. In a July 6 letter to Cordray, the National Credit Union Administration's chairman asked the CFPB to stop conducting compliance exams of large credit unions and complained about  aggressive punitive fines.  Last year, the CFPB fined Navy Federal Credit Union $28.5 million for allegedly making false threats about debt collection to active duty and retired members of the military. The case was resolved without the credit union admitting or denying wrongdoing.     NCUA Chairman J. Mark McWatters wrote that imposing  aggressive punitive fines on the very consumers the CFPB is tasked with protecting... is tantamount to imposing a 'the beatings will continue until morale improves' approach to consumer protection enforcement.  I believe there is a better way,  he added. “We have received Chairman McWatters’ letter and we are reviewing it,” CFPB Spokesman David Mayorga told Reuters. McWatters, a Republican, was first appointed to the NCUA by President Barack Obama in 2014. Trump designated him acting NCUA chairman in January and made him  chairman last week. The NCUA is the primary regulator over most credit unions. But the CFPB was granted examination and primary enforcement powers by the Dodd-Frank law over large credit unions with assets of more than $10 billion. In his letter, McWatters said the CFPB should exempt those credit unions from its oversight to avoid duplicative regulations.  If  in the unlikely case  Cordray refuses this request, McWatters said he will demand the two regulators conduct joint compliance examinations. Mortgage lender PHH Corp (PHH.N) is currently locked in a legal battle with the CFPB over whether Cordray's appointment violates the U.S. Constitution because he can be removed by the president only for cause, and not at will.

In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a  tax  on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban  iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.  Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7.  Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall.  I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,  Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm's practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for  modem  chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts.

The survey results from Coworker.org, which hosts online petitions, come a year after U.S. Starbucks workers used the site to protest staffing cutbacks that they warned were slowing service and hurting morale at the popular coffee chain. Coworker.org said its poll included 184 self-identified, current U.S. Starbucks cafe workers, supervisors and managers across 33 states. New Chief Executive Kevin Johnson launched the initiative at Starbucks, which has more than 13,000 U.S. coffee shops, with more than 150,000 workers. In January, Starbucks said some of its busiest U.S. cafes were grappling with bottlenecks at drink pick-up stations during peak hours. Executives blamed the delays on an avalanche of mobile orders and said the backups had chased away some walk-in customers.  The company, which has reported two straight quarters of declines in U.S. traffic, reworked tasks to make them more efficient and gave managers more leeway to add staffing as part of a broad customer re-engagement program dubbed  North Star.  That effort is led by Kris Engskov, Starbucks' president  of U.S. retail, under the guidance of Johnson, who succeeded longtime CEO Howard Schultz in April.  FILE PHOTO - Kevin Johnson delivers remarks at the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2016.Andrew Kelly All of our metrics show we are moving in the opposite direction of what the survey claims,  Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said.  Over the last eight months, we've added labor to about 15 percent of our stores and are looking to add more in the months ahead,  he said. Despite that, 75 percent of the Starbucks workers polled by Coworker.org said their stores were not staffed to meet the goals of North Star.  Eighty-nine percent of respondents said staffing levels were still a problem in their stores in the past three months, and 62 percent said their ability to deliver the best customer service possible decreased during that time. Mobile ordering has  added to the work load immensely, and yet again, there aren't even enough people scheduled to share the workload,  an unnamed Starbucks partner told Coworker.org. A Starbucks employee last year launched a Coworker.org petition, accusing the chain of  extreme  cutbacks in work hours that were crushing morale. The petition currently has more than 18,000 signatures. Workers last year told Reuters they noticed the reduction in hours in April 2016, after Starbucks reported a deceleration in quarterly cafe sales growth.

U.S.-based stock funds posted $3.3 billion of outflows in the week ended July 5, while non-domestic equities attracted $3.3 billion for the same period, Lipper data show.     High valuations stateside and perhaps more bargains overseas are pushing investors across the pond,  said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Thomson Reuters Lipper. U.S.-based stock mutual funds posted $1.3 billion of outflows and stock exchange-traded funds posted $2 billion of outflows in the latest week.   Micro- and macro-economics appear to be improving, particularly in the European Union. The European Central Bank is talking more hawkish and showing signs of comfort with recent economic data.  Consequently, U.S.-based international and global debt funds posted $944 million of outflows over the weekly period, the first weekly outflows since early February, Lipper said. Investors were also tentative about putting money to work in U.S. bond funds. Taxable bond funds posted $242 million in outflows to mark their second straight week of outflows. U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds posted $1.16 billion of outflows, marking their third week of outflows from the funds, Lipper said. But high-quality investment-grade U.S. bond funds posted inflows of $2.5 billion for the week, extending an unbroken weekly inflow streak since mid-December.  Low-risk money market funds attracted $1.6 billion in inflows to mark their second straight week of new demand.   While it looked like there was no place to hide except for money market funds, investors were selective,  Roseen said.  In particular international equity funds, sector-energy funds, and sector-financial/banking funds were main attractors of investor assets. And despite rising rates - courtesy of the Fed, ECB and Bank of Canada hawkish tone - investors appeared to embrace corporate investment-grade debt funds, while shunning high-yield junk funds.  U.S.-based energy stock funds attracted $228 million of inflows over the weekly period, their second straight week of inflows, according to Lipper data. For their part, emerging market equity and bond funds ended their positive streak of new money. U.S.-based emerging markets equity funds posted $45 million of outflows over the weekly period, their first weekly outflows since early May, Lipper said. U.S.-based emerging market debt funds posted $862 million of outflows over the weekly period, the group's first weekly outflows since early February, Lipper added.

That is what the director of  Spider-Man: Homecoming  hopes audiences will be drawn to as the third Spider-Man reboot in a decade hits movie theaters on Friday.  Jon Watts said he wanted to make  Homecoming  a cross between a superhero movie and a high school comedy where the dorky lead is a fanboy of other superheroes.   Homecoming  takes a lighter tone to the last two iterations of Spider-Man, in keeping with Marvel's proclivity for harnessing laughs in its superhero franchise.  Unlike previous films where Spider-Man was the lone superhero,  Homecoming  has the web-slinging crime fighter battling alongside Marvel characters Iron Man and Captain America. Usual scenes explaining Spider-Man's origins - the death of his Uncle Ben and being bitten by a radioactive spider - are notably absent.   We've seen that origin story before,  Watts told Reuters.  Here's Spider-Man, he's a kid, let's take him on an adventure ... it's all part of trying to show people something new.

A deal between Sony Corp, which holds rights to Spider-Man, and Walt Disney Co which has those for superheroes like Iron Man, let Spider-Man feature next to fellow Marvel characters. That allowed Watts to explore the boy hero in a way he said creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originally envisioned in comic strips with multiple characters.  They wanted to give a different perspective on this world of superheroes, like a regular guy's perspective, that was one of the things that made Spider-Man so special,  Watts said.  Slideshow (11 Images) Homecoming  takes place after the events of  Civil War,  and 15-year-old Peter Parker feels neglected by Iron Man, struggling to adjust back to the mundaneness of high school while disguising his superpowers.   We've seen a lot of superheroes dealing with responsibility and burden of their powers ... but if you have a 15-year-old kid with super powers, definitely there's going to be some funny moments,  Watts said.  Parker also faces foes, particularly The Vulture, played by Michael Keaton, who has built an underground arms trade with the debris of high-powered superhero weapons littered across New York City during 2012's  Avengers.    Homecoming  has received warm reviews from critics and trade publication Variety said the film was projected to open with upward of $85 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office.

Merkel, who is campaigning for a fourth term, can ill afford the images of chaos and disharmony that dominated news coverage of the summit. The summit, which starts in earnest on Friday, is a chance for her to polish her diplomatic credentials but would be disastrous if marred by widespread violence. She met U.S. President Donald Trump for an hour on Thursday evening, but less than an hour later police clashed with anti-capitalist demonstrators near the summit venue, firing water cannons and pepper spray at hundreds of black-clad protesters after they threw bottles. Nearly 75 police officers were injured throughout the evening, with three requiring treatment in hospital, police said. The pilots of a police helicopter sustained eye injuries when laser pointers were directed at them, police said. Protesters damaged cars, set other objects ablaze and threw bottles in roving clashes that lasted until midnight. A Reuters eyewitness saw at least one protester with blood on his face being treated.   Welcome to Hell  was the protesters' greeting for Trump and other world leaders arriving for the two-day meeting. Merkel has taken a high-risk gamble by choosing to hold the summit in the northern port city of Hamburg, partly to show the world that big protests are tolerated in a healthy democracy. Before meeting Trump, she struck a consensual tone, holding out hope for agreement on the divisive issue of climate policy and pledging to broker compromises. She promised to represent German and European interests at the summit, but added: Related Coverage'Welcome to hell' - protesters vow to disrupt G20 summitTrump says 'never give up' when asked about U.S. relationship with China On the other hand, as hosts we - and I - will do all we can to find compromises.  Trump faces a testy confrontation at the summit with leaders of the other big Group of 20 economies after deciding last month to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate deal.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel cited  many commonalities  on foreign policy after a meeting that included Merkel, Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Trump family members and advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. But he told German broadcaster that  clear differences  on climate change and trade continued to divide the two allies. Merkel said there were  various options  that could be discussed, noting that nearly all other G20 countries besides the United States stood by the accord. U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrive for the G20 leaders summit in Hamburg, Germany July 6, 2017.Axel SchmidtAs the leaders began holding informal meetings, thousands of protesters from around Europe, who say the G20 has failed to solve many of the issues threatening world peace, poured into Hamburg to join the main demonstration. Police expected around 100,000 protesters in the port city, some 8,000 of whom are deemed by security forces to be ready to commit violence. At least 13,000 protesters joined the main march on Thursday, including around 1,000 black-clad and masked  anarchists, police said. Up to 20,000 police officers from across Germany are on hand. Delicate Balance As summit host, Merkel must seek consensus among the G20 leaders not only on the divisive issue of climate policy but also on trade - an area fraught with risk as Trump pursues his 'America First' agenda. Slideshow (19 Images)Indonesian finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said Merkel must be careful not to allow acrimony to undermine the summit.  There is quite a delicate balance that Angela Merkel will have to navigate in a way, because it is not clear that being confrontational won't just create even more of a credibility problem for G20 cooperation,  she told Reuters. Merkel earlier said she was committed to an open international trading system, despite fears of U.S. protectionism under the Trump administration.   We're united in our will to strengthen multilateral relations at the G20 summit ... We need an open society, especially open trade flows,  Merkel said in Berlin. She and Trump discussed G20 themes, North Korea, the Middle East, and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, according to German and U.S. government officials. Later, Merkel met with Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan, who this week sharply criticized the German government's rejection of  his plans to address Turkish citizens outside the G20 event. Trump, who earlier in Poland called again on NATO partners to spend more on defense and said he would confront the threat from North Korea, will also meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time on the sidelines of the summit. Their meeting, scheduled for Friday, will be closely watched at a time when mutual ties remain strained by U.S. allegations of Russian election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and a U.S. dispute over Trump associates' links to Moscow. Ahead of the meeting, Putin threw his weight behind the Paris accord.  We see the Paris Agreement as a secure basis for long-term climate regulation founded on international law and we want to make a comprehensive contribution to its implementation,  he told German business daily Handelsblatt.

Republicans have been critical of the CFPB, saying it is too unaccountable to Congress because its budget is not appropriated and it is governed by a single director. The Trump Administration has called for reforms to the CFPB, but has been silent on whether it intends to try to have CFPB Director Richard Cordray removed before his term expires next summer. In a July 6 letter to Cordray, the National Credit Union Administration's chairman asked the CFPB to stop conducting compliance exams of large credit unions and complained about  aggressive punitive fines.  Last year, the CFPB fined Navy Federal Credit Union $28.5 million for allegedly making false threats about debt collection to active duty and retired members of the military. The case was resolved without the credit union admitting or denying wrongdoing.     NCUA Chairman J. Mark McWatters wrote that imposing  aggressive punitive fines on the very consumers the CFPB is tasked with protecting... is tantamount to imposing a 'the beatings will continue until morale improves' approach to consumer protection enforcement.  I believe there is a better way,  he added. “We have received Chairman McWatters’ letter and we are reviewing it,” CFPB Spokesman David Mayorga told Reuters. McWatters, a Republican, was first appointed to the NCUA by President Barack Obama in 2014. Trump designated him acting NCUA chairman in January and made him  chairman last week. The NCUA is the primary regulator over most credit unions. But the CFPB was granted examination and primary enforcement powers by the Dodd-Frank law over large credit unions with assets of more than $10 billion. In his letter, McWatters said the CFPB should exempt those credit unions from its oversight to avoid duplicative regulations.  If  in the unlikely case  Cordray refuses this request, McWatters said he will demand the two regulators conduct joint compliance examinations. Mortgage lender PHH Corp (PHH.N) is currently locked in a legal battle with the CFPB over whether Cordray's appointment violates the U.S. Constitution because he can be removed by the president only for cause, and not at will.

U.S.-based stock funds posted $3.3 billion of outflows in the week ended July 5, while non-domestic equities attracted $3.3 billion for the same period, Lipper data show.     High valuations stateside and perhaps more bargains overseas are pushing investors across the pond,  said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Thomson Reuters Lipper. U.S.-based stock mutual funds posted $1.3 billion of outflows and stock exchange-traded funds posted $2 billion of outflows in the latest week.   Micro- and macro-economics appear to be improving, particularly in the European Union. The European Central Bank is talking more hawkish and showing signs of comfort with recent economic data.  Consequently, U.S.-based international and global debt funds posted $944 million of outflows over the weekly period, the first weekly outflows since early February, Lipper said. Investors were also tentative about putting money to work in U.S. bond funds. Taxable bond funds posted $242 million in outflows to mark their second straight week of outflows. U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds posted $1.16 billion of outflows, marking their third week of outflows from the funds, Lipper said. But high-quality investment-grade U.S. bond funds posted inflows of $2.5 billion for the week, extending an unbroken weekly inflow streak since mid-December.  Low-risk money market funds attracted $1.6 billion in inflows to mark their second straight week of new demand.   While it looked like there was no place to hide except for money market funds, investors were selective,  Roseen said.  In particular international equity funds, sector-energy funds, and sector-financial/banking funds were main attractors of investor assets. And despite rising rates - courtesy of the Fed, ECB and Bank of Canada hawkish tone - investors appeared to embrace corporate investment-grade debt funds, while shunning high-yield junk funds.  U.S.-based energy stock funds attracted $228 million of inflows over the weekly period, their second straight week of inflows, according to Lipper data. For their part, emerging market equity and bond funds ended their positive streak of new money. U.S.-based emerging markets equity funds posted $45 million of outflows over the weekly period, their first weekly outflows since early May, Lipper said. U.S.-based emerging market debt funds posted $862 million of outflows over the weekly period, the group's first weekly outflows since early February, Lipper added.

Everybody's mindset was a little upset that we had a night game yesterday and they scheduled a day game after they (the Cubs) had a day game yesterday,  said Brewers starter and winner Zach Davies, who improved to 10-4.  I think as a team we wanted to put it on them early and that kind of showed right out of the gate.  The Brewers jumped on two Chicago pitchers in a seven-run third inning and never looked back. Milwaukee (48-40) opened a 4 1/2-game lead over the Cubs (42-43) in the National League Central with the win. Thursday's standalone game was rescheduled from an May 20 Wrigley Field postponement -- a day when it did not actually rain. It was listed on both teams' schedules as a day game, originally a mutual off-day.  Off days are precious, you never want to give those away and obviously the game that got rained out ended up being a beautiful day,  said Brewers left fielder Ryan Braun.  We would have loved to have had the off day but if you have to play, it's always nice to get the win.  The Brewers had played a Wednesday night game, a 4-0 victory over the Orioles, before traveling to Chicago. The Cubs beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-3 on Wednesday afternoon. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at CubsMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchDavies worked six innings for his third straight win and fifth in his last seven starts. Cubs left-hander Mike Montgomery (1-6) suffered the loss in a 2 1/3-inning start, his shortest of the season. Domingo Santana went 4-for-5 and walked once, Jesus Aguilar was 3-for-5 while Hernan Perez added two hits to lead an 13-hit Milwaukee attack. The Cubs managed just six hits.  There's not a whole lot to talk about,  said Cubs manager Joe Maddon.  That game goes in the trash can as quickly as any game we've ever played. We just didn't pitch well early and it's very difficult to fight back.  The Brewers jumped to a first-inning 1-0 lead when Jonathan Villar drew a walk on four pitches and Santana drilled a 1-1 pitch into the left-field corner for a run-scoring double. Santana reached third on Braun's fielder's choice groundout and came home for a 2-0 lead on Perez's two-out single up the middle. Braun made it 4-0 in the third with his one-out home run to center that also brought home Santana. After back-to-back singles by Aguilar and Perez, Manny Pina followed with a one-out base hit to drive in Aguilar for a 5-0 lead. That was it for Montgomery, who left with two runners on and one out. He was ultimately charged with seven earned runs on six hits while striking out four and walking two. Cubs left-handed reliever Jack Leathersich walked Keon Broxton to load the bases and then issued back-to-back four-pitch bases on balls to Orlando Arcia and Davies to score Perez and Pina for a 7-0 lead. Villar's sacrifice fly to left brought Broxton from third an 8-0 lead. Santana's two-out double to right drove in Arcia to make it 9-0. The seven-run inning was the most allowed by the Cubs this season. The Cubs loaded the bases with none out in the third but managed just one run as Kris Bryant's fielder's choice grounder scored Javier Baez. Willson Contreras hit his 11th home run of the season with one out in the fourth to make it 9-2. Milwaukee's 10th run came in the fifth on a double steal and Contreras' throwing error as Villar took third and then scored. Santana reached third on the error and made it an 11-2 game on Aguilar's single to center. Davies allowed just two runs on five hits while striking out three in his third straight six-inning effort.  Personally, (10 wins is) something that kind of makes you happy,  Davies said.  There are personal goals that you want to hit, but at the same time, we want to play in October.  Maddon wanted to preserve his bullpen for the weekend Pittsburgh series and called on outfielder Jon Jay to pitch the ninth. He allowed one hit in a scoreless inning.  For all the folks that stuck around, they were definitely rewarded,  Maddon said.  It was entertaining, you've got to find a bright spot in the game.

That is what the director of  Spider-Man: Homecoming  hopes audiences will be drawn to as the third Spider-Man reboot in a decade hits movie theaters on Friday. Jon Watts said he wanted to make  Homecoming  a cross between a superhero movie and a high school comedy where the dorky lead is a fanboy of other superheroes.  Homecoming  takes a lighter tone to the last two iterations of Spider-Man, in keeping with Marvel's proclivity for harnessing laughs in its superhero franchise. Unlike previous films where Spider-Man was the lone superhero,  Homecoming  has the web-slinging crime fighter battling alongside Marvel characters Iron Man and Captain America. Usual scenes explaining Spider-Man's origins - the death of his Uncle Ben and being bitten by a poisonous spider - are notably absent.  We've seen that origin story before,  Watts told Reuters.  Here's Spider-Man, he's a kid, let's take him on an adventure ... it's all part of trying to show people something new.  Spider-Man, this time played by Tom Holland, was first introduced alongside other Marvel characters in 2016's  Captain America: Civil War.  A deal between Sony Corp, which holds rights to Spider-Man, and Walt Disney Co which has those for superheroes like Iron Man, let Spider-Man feature next to fellow Marvel characters. That allowed Watts to explore the boy hero in a way he said creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originally envisioned in comic strips with multiple characters.  They wanted to give a different perspective on this world of superheroes, like a regular guy's perspective, that was one of the things that made Spider-Man so special,  Watts said.  Homecoming  takes place after the events of  Civil War,  and 15-year-old Peter Parker feels neglected by Iron Man, struggling to adjust back to the mundaneness of high school while disguising his superpowers.  We've seen a lot of superheroes dealing with responsibility and burden of their powers ... but if you have a 15-year-old kid with super powers, definitely there's going to be some funny moments,  Watts said. Parker also faces foes, particularly The Vulture, played by Michael Keaton, who has built an underground arms trade with the debris of high-powered superhero weapons littered across New York City during 2012's  Avengers.   Homecoming  has received warm reviews from critics and trade publication Variety said the film was projected to open with upward of $85 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office.

Speaking at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky, McConnell said:  If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur,  the Associated Press reported.  No action is not an alternative,  McConnell was quoted as saying.  We've got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed McConnell's comments as a possible opening that could help achieve a bipartisan solution to fix problems with former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law, dubbed Obamacare.  It is encouraging that Senator McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the (health insurance) exchanges are fixable and opened the door to bipartisan solutions to improve our healthcare system,  Schumer said in a statement.  Democrats are eager to work with Republicans to stabilize the markets and improve the law,  he added. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks at a Harden County Republican party fundraiser in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, U.S., June 30, 2017.Bryan WoolstonMany of the individual health insurance markets established under Obamacare have struggled, hurt by an unfavorable balance of sick and healthy customers, and some insurers have pulled out because of uncertainty on whether the government will continue to fund cost-sharing subsidies to help individuals pay premiums. Republicans have been fighting to repeal Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation since it was first approved. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress made repeal a central campaign promise last year. But efforts to replace the healthcare law this year have run into difficulties. The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a replacement bill in May. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 23 million people would lose insurance coverage under the House plan, the Senate made clear it would write its own bill rather than voting on the House measure. The Senate unveiled its healthcare measure in late June. That measure's fate was uncertain after the CBO predicted that under it 15 million people would lose health insurance in 2018, with the number growing to 22 million as a result of cuts to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled that would take place in 2025. At least one Republican senator publicly opposed the bill and others were critical of it. McConnell can only afford to lose two Republicans from his 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate and still pass the measure.

Security Council statements have to be agreed by all 15 members. The Russian mission to the United Nations said it had proposed amendments to the U.S. draft. It was not immediately clear if the United States would continue to negotiate with Russia in an effort to reach a council consensus on a statement. Moscow's resistance to defining Pyongyang's missile launch as long-range does not augur well for Washington's planned push to impose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday that she plans to propose new measures in coming days. Moscow has said it believes North Korea fired an intermediate range ballistic missile on Tuesday, while China has not identified the rocket launched. North Korea said it tested an ICBM and the United States said that was likely true.  The rationale is that based on our (Ministry of Defence's) assessment we cannot confirm that the missile can be classified as an ICBM,  Russia's U.N. mission said in an email to its Security Council colleagues.  Therefore we are not in a position to agree to this classification on behalf of the whole council since there is no consensus on this issue,  the email said. Haley on Wednesday denounced Russia's reluctance to recognize that North Korea had test-launched an ICBM, which some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii.  If you need any sort of intelligence to let you know that the rest of the world sees this as an ICBM, I'm happy to provide it,  she told the Security Council on Wednesday. Possible Sanctions Haley did not give details on what sanctions would be proposed, but outlined available options. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.  The international community can cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime. We can restrict the flow of oil to their military and their weapons programs. We can increase air and maritime restrictions. We can hold senior regime officials accountable,  Haley told the council meeting. Diplomats said Washington proposed such options to Beijing two months ago, but that China had not engaged in discussions on the measures and instead only agreed to adding some people and entities to the existing U.N. sanctions list in June. Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September, while U.S. President Barack Obama was still in office, it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree strengthened sanctions. It was not immediately clear how long U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was prepared to negotiate with China and Russia on possible new U.N. sanctions. Trump has threatened to use trade to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea and U.S. officials have said the United States might seek unilaterally to sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks.

The photo, found in the U.S. National Archives by retired U.S. Treasury Agent Les Kinney and the subject of a new History Channel documentary titled,  Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence,  shows what appears to be a Caucasian woman sitting on a dock in the Marshall Islands. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan were last seen taking off in her twin-engine Lockheed Electra on July 2, 1937, from Papua New Guinea en route to tiny Howland Island, some 2,500 miles away in the central Pacific. Radio contact with her plane was lost hours later after 39-year-old Earhart reported running low on fuel. A massive air-and-sea search, the most extensive such U.S. operation at that time, was unsuccessful. Earhart's plane was presumed to have gone down, but it has never been known whether she survived, and if so, for how long.     In the two-hour documentary, which airs on Sunday, researchers say body image comparisons between the photographed woman and Earhart make the match  very likely.  They hypothesize that Earhart veered away from Howland Island, crash-landed on the Marshall Islands and was then taken captive by Japanese forces. A woman who, according to a new History Channel documentary, is said to resemble pilot Amelia Earhart (C) sitting on the dock is seen in this undated photo taken in the Marshall Islands.

He added, however, that after Kinney made the case for why he thought the photograph showed Earhart, he was  instantly intrigued.      Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), on the other hand, said there is no evidence the person in the photograph is Earhart.

The bones' dimensions match Earhart's build, likely revealing she died there as a castaway.  I could show you a dozen pictures of Amelia Earhart in the last days of her world flight,  said Gillespie.  Her hair's shorter than that. It's not down on her collar. It's shorter,  he said,  and that doesn't look like Fred Noonan.   We knew there were going to be people questioning its validity, especially other people who have spent their lives or their careers trying to find more information on Amelia Earhart,  Tarpinian said.  We think we have real evidence and we stand behind it.

The woman, whose lawyers have asked that she be identified only as E, was rebuffed under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) when she arrived at the Canada-U.S. border early on Wednesday morning seeking refuge. A federal judge in Toronto granted a suspension order on Thursday afternoon, allowing E and her daughters to remain in Canada with her husband as the constitutional challenge goes through the courts. The denial of E's refugee claim set in motion a constitutional challenge months in the making that could strike down a Canadian law criticized as the motivating factor for thousands of asylum seekers crossing the border illegally. E's lawyers say she and her daughters fled El Salvador in November, hoping to escape the gang whose members raped her and terrorized her family. Gang violence is one of the main reasons many people are fleeing El Salvador and Central American neighbor Honduras. Lawyer Prasanna Balasundaram and his colleagues at Toronto's Downtown Legal Services, along with interveners the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches, argue that the United States is not a safe country and that it has become less so after President Donald Trump gave immigration officers broader powers to detain and deport people.

And, yeah, I panicked a little bit, as well.  It was shocking as she is a good friend of mine. She was shouting 'Sorana, help me' and all I could say was 'I'm here, be strong'.

Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsCirstea said she was surprised that it seemed to take so long for anyone to react to the injury.   I think everyone froze. No one was having any reaction,  she said.  I called for help, but no one was coming.   I think for a long time it was me, her husband and my physio. My physio jumped and he was there. I was trying but, of course, I felt useless. When she was screaming so loud, it was a very uncomfortable moment. I felt a little bit useless. I wish I could have done more. Slideshow (5 Images) It felt, like, so long. I don't know, there are sports where you see something's happening, you see straightaway the help. Like I know football, boxing, all the others, it's straightaway.  It took a while. So, of course, you wonder what would have happened if it was a heart issue or something like this.   I think someone has to take the video and actually time and see how long it took for people to get there. Because for me, I think she was too long on the ground. I mean, I was there for 10, 15 minutes, then I left and the stretcher was not there yet.  The All England Club responded by tweeting:  The first response to Court 17 was within 1 minute, by a qualified ambulance technician.  The player was kept on court while pain relief was given. She was then transferred directly to an ambulance and taken under emergency conditions to a hospital.  Mattek-Sands, who suffered a serious ligament injury to the same knee four years ago, has won five grand slam doubles titles with Czech Lucie Safarova, who was crying courtside during the incident, and if she had won at Wimbledon would have held all four at the same time.

At a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, the bank raised the overnight deposit rate to 18.75 percent from 16.75 percent and its overnight lending rate to 19.75 from 17.75 percent, it said in a statement, after hiking them by 200 points each at the last policy-setting meeting in May. Egypt floated its currency in November, and since then its pound has roughly halved in value. As the currency's value dropped, inflation surged. Although the core rate slipped in May, it remains almost 30 percent year-on-year. The central bank raised interest by 300 basis points after the currency floatation, which helped Egypt clinch a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program tied to ambitious reforms such as tax hikes and subsidy cuts. The IMF has said lowering inflation is key to keeping its economic reform program on track and that raising key interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. Ongoing reforms tied to the IMF loan program had increased risks for inflation, which the bank aims to reduce to 13 percent by end-2018, the bank said.  Higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017, as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressure,  it said. Nine out of 10 economists polled by Reuters on Monday predicted the bank would leave its key interest rates unchanged. Hany Farahat, senior economist at CI Capital, was the sole dissenter. He told Reuters on Thursday following the hike announcement that he did not expect it to be effective in combating inflation.  We expected a rate hike despite our view that it will not reduce inflation. The central bank had no choice as it followed a very steep fuel price hike, which the finance ministry said would add 4 percent to inflation,  he said.  Impact from the hike will be diluted as bank are now reluctant to pass on the rate increases on to their deposit and savings rates as a way of limiting costs. Accordingly, this step will not absorb additional liquidity from the system.  Egypt's economic growth has deteriorated since a 2011 uprising drove tourists and foreign investors away, draining foreign reserves and putting pressure on President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who has to maintain support amid tough economic reforms that have sent inflation shooting up. The government last week hiked fuel prices by up to 50 percent for the second time since November in another step to narrow its budget deficit. The hike would add 3 to 4.5 percentage points to inflation, Deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kojak told Reuters on Monday. Electricity Minister Mohamed Shaker said on Thursday Egypt will hike electricity prices by up to 42 percent this fiscal year for households as of Aug. 1 but keep energy subsidies in place three years longer than expected.

Alarmed by North Korea's latest missile tests and claims that its newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) can carry a large nuclear warhead, Ward believes it is time to refurbish the tunnels as civilian shelters in case of a North Korean attack.  We've had wake-up calls before but what happened on July 3 is shaking us out of bed,  said Ward, referring to Pyongyang's latest missile test. North Korea's state media said the missile reached an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles), and some Western experts said that meant it might have a range of more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles), which would put Hawaii and Alaska within striking distance. Americans from the Alaskan tundra to the tropics of Hawaii have had years to contemplate North Korea's accelerating missile program, which has generated both angst and shrugs given that the reclusive government's true capabilities and intentions remain unknown. Ward, a Republican in a Democratic-majority state, said he supports reviving state legislation that would reopen the bunkers built by the U.S. military even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that prompted U.S. entry into World War Two. The tunnels are among many military bunkers and batteries carved into Oahu as part of a buildup that began after Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1898 and continued through World War Two. If Hawaiians have a stronger sense of vulnerability stemming from Pearl Harbor, then some Alaskan seem largely unperturbed. Doyle Holmes, a retired U.S. Navy pilot and hardware store owner who lives about 50 miles (80 km) north of Anchorage, sums up his advice to fellow Alaskans this way:  Go back to sleep and don't keep worrying about it.  Holmes, 79, a Republican Party activist who retired in March from the Alaska State Defense Force, said his attitude is rooted in his abiding faith in the U.S. military's ability to counter any attempt by North Korea to strike American soil. An overview of Diamond Head crater seen from the National Guard command center in Diamond Head Crater in Honolulu, Hawaii, July 6, 2017.Hugh Gentry It would be self-annihilation if they launch a missile at the United States,  Holmes said.  I think we are going to be OK. I went through the nuclear fallout classes and the bomb shelter stuff in the 1950s and 1960s,  he said, referring to U.S. preparations for a potential Cold War-era Soviet attack that never came. Last week the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee proposed $8.5 billion of funding for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland, regional and space missile defenses. Some of this would pay for 28 missile interceptors to augment 32 already at a base in Fort Greely, Alaska, a Hill staffer said. The department already had plans to place 40 interceptors at the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) battery by the end of 2017. Slideshow (9 Images)Some experts on Northeast Asian political and security issues believe political leaders and the media have been too quick to qualify North Korea as a nuclear power, questioning whether it can genuinely delivery a functional nuclear warhead with accuracy or whether North Korea would risk certain U.S. retaliation. But Denny Roy, a senior fellow with the East-West Center think tank in Honolulu, said the public discourse had definitely changed with the latest episode.  The milestone is that Americans seem to believe that North Korea can hit the U.S. homeland, whereas up until now it was all theoretical and potential,  Roy said. Hawaiians are mindful that the islands could make an enticing target given their large concentration of U.S. military power, including the Pacific Command responsible for U.S. forces in Asia.  I'm not building a bunker yet, but we definitely have to stay vigilant,  said Reece Bonham, 24, a retail manager in the city of Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Caelen McHale, 21, a University of Hawaii business management major, was skeptical of North Korea's claims and confident in U.S. military power, but still worried how the United States might respond.  Our administration is scarier than North Korea's,  she said.

The world's largest soupmaker has been reporting weak sales as demand for packaged foods in the United States has taken a hit as consumers increasingly prefer healthier foods, pushing companies to invest in organic and fresh-food businesses. Campbell, which also sells Pepperidge Farm snacks and Prego pasta sauce, created its own fresh-food unit in 2015 to sell carrots, carrot ingredients, refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, but the business has been struggling. The soupmaker said in May it would partner with Chef'd and invest $10 million in the meal-kit company, stepping up its efforts to provide healthier foods. Pacific Foods, which would be part of Campbell's Americas simple meals and beverages business, had generated about $218 million in net sales in the 12 months ended May 31, Campbell said. Sales in this unit, Campbell's largest by revenue, dipped 2 percent in the third quarter ended April 30, partly hurt by weak demand for condensed soups and broths as well as V8 vegetable juices. Privately-owned Pacific Foods also makes organic sauces and offers non-dairy beverages, dips, meals and sides. Campbell said it plans to fund the deal through a combination of short- and long-term debt.

Schneider,Christopher A. Grimes,Julie A. Burke,Sandro Scenga,Fitch Downgrades Allied World's Ratings; Outlook Stable,Credit / Debt Ratings,Americas,Company News,Insurance (TRBC),Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),Corporate Events,Insurance (Legacy),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Property and Casualty Insurance (TRBC),United States","sector":"","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the ratings for Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd (Allied World) as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. The Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of the insurance subsidiaries are downgraded to 'A' from 'A+'. Today's rating action follows the close of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited's (Fairfax) purchase of Allied World. The ratings have been removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned a Stable Outlook. A complete list of rating actions follows at end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The one-notch downgrade primarily reflects Fitch's view that Fairfax's credit quality is inconsistent with Allied World's former ratings and that the ownership structure is considered a credit negative. Fitch believes that Allied World will likely maintain its strong operating franchise in specialty primary insurance lines going forward, and reinsurance operations will benefit from the combined size and scale of Fairfax's existing Odyssey Re reinsurance business. Fitch expects Fairfax to offer reasonable support and for Allied World to continue managing its insurance underwriting operations generally independent of Fairfax. Allied World is considered to be a 'Very Important' subsidiary of Fairfax and will likely be considered 'Core' in the next 1-2 years with more seasoning as part of Fairfax's operations. The downgrade also reflects Fitch's expectation that Allied World's investment portfolio will be centrally managed by Fairfax toward a higher-risk asset allocation in the future. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Deterioration in Fairfax's credit profile; --Deterioration in (re)insurance sector fundamentals that Fitch viewed as weakening Allied World's competitive position, operating profile or overall profitability; --Sustained combined ratio above 103% or operating ratio above 95%; --Financial leverage in excess of 25% or fixed charge coverage ratios in the low single digits for a period of consecutive years; --Catastrophe loss experience that greatly exceeds the company's probable maximum loss estimates. Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improvement in Fairfax's credit profile while maintaining underwriting results and returns on capital in line with higher-rated property/casualty (re)insurer peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded and removed from Negative Watch the following ratings: Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd --IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --$300 million 5.50% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; --$500 million 4.35% senior notes due Oct. 29, 2025 to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc. Allied World National Assurance Company Allied World Insurance Company --IFS to 'A' from 'A+'.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

North Korea's launch this week of what it said was a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile dramatically raised the stakes in the long-running battle to contain the isolated country's nuclear weapons programme.  North Korea now constitutes a new level of threat to Japan and a clear provocation to Japan and also to the international community,  said Norio Maruyama, Japanese foreign ministry spokesman, after a meeting of the three countries' leaders. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-In agreed at the meeting to cooperate closely to encourage China to  play an even greater role  in containing its southern neighbour.  We had very vivid conversation on the subject and the role of China was very important  during the 75-minute meeting, Maruyama said, adding that Japan was closely monitoring Chinese companies it suspected of having links to North Korea's weapons programme.  Abe conveyed Japan's appreciation for the sanctions the U.S. decided to impose on Chinese organisations,  he said.  The Japanese government has been monitoring the movements of Chinese companies with deep ties to North Korea and responding appropriately  by imposing asset freezes. Asked whether any military action was discussed, he said:  There is no discussion about the specificity of other measures we could take .

Last month DeVos pressed pause on the rules, due to take effect on July 1, saying they needed to be reset. Massachusetts, 17 other states and the District of Columbia said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. the department broke federal law in announcing the delay with limited public notice and opportunity to comment. DeVos, a Republican, has said accelerating the debt cancellation process would put taxpayers on the hook for significant costs, and a delay is needed while current litigation in California over the rules works through the legal system.  With this ideologically driven suit, the state attorneys general are saying to regulate first, and ask the legal questions later,  said Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill in a statement, adding the rules were adopted  through a heavily politicized process.  Consumer groups Public Citizen and Project on Predatory Student Lending sued on Thursday to lift the delay as well. The rules were finalized in the last days of the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat who overhauled federal student lending.

Dixon Machado hit his first major league homer, Anibal Sanchez collected his first victory of the season, and the Tigers defeated the San Francisco Giants 6-2 on Thursday afternoon at Comerica Park. The Tigers came into the game just a half-game ahead of the last-place Chicago White Sox in the American League Central Division standings. Machado's two-run homer off Giants emergency starter Chris Stratton highlighted a three-run second inning for the Tigers (38-46), who finished off a 5-4 homestand.  The best thing is I knew it right away so I could enjoy it,  said Machado, the team's utility infielder.  It feels good to help the team win, that's the best part. I was looking to hit the ball hard and try to bring that run in. He left it up and I just swung and got it.  Machado is batting .314 while appearing in 33 of the team's 84 games. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at TigersSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch It's really hard, more mentally than anything else,  Machado said of his backup duties.  Of course, I run every day and you do your work in the weight room and all that but it's more mentally. You just need to believe in yourself.  Alex Presley had two hits and drove in two runs and Nicholas Castellanos added two hits, including his American League-leading sixth triple, with a run scored and an RBI. Sanchez (1-0), who was making his 15th appearance this season, recorded his first victory since Aug. 23 of last season against Minnesota. He limited the Giants to two runs on five hits and struck out a season-high eight over six innings.  Earlier this year, I was in the bullpen. The transition wasn't easy for me but right now I'm in a pretty good position in the rotation,  said Sanchez, who was making his fourth start since a stint at Triple-A Toledo.  I want to do a good job any time I take the ball. I want to help the team. I didn't early in the season.  The Giants' scheduled starter, Johnny Cueto, was a late scratch because of an inner ear infection. Stratton (0-2) made his first major league start in his place and lasted 6 2/3 innings, allowing five runs on six hits while walking five. The right-hander had made nine relief appearances for the Giants over the past two seasons.  I'm sure the pitch he'd like to have back is to the young kid that hit the home run,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  He's a fastball hitter, (Stratton) threw that in his wheelhouse and it did some damage there or else it's a closer ballgame. But he settled down and got us deep into the game.  Cueto had been feeling ill in recent days, according to Bochy.  Johnny was actually prepping to get ready for the game and he got dizzy with his inner ear infection, so we weren't comfortable putting him out there in that situation,  Bochy said. Joe Panik had an RBI triple and also scored for the Giants (34-53), who had won seven of their previous eight games. Miguel Cabrera's RBI single in the first put the Tigers in front. Castellanos sparked a three-run second with his leadoff triple. Presley's single knocked him in and, one out later, Machado blasted a 1-1 pitch into the left-field stands. Presley had another run-scoring single in the third inning to make it 5-0. The Giants broke through in the sixth on Panik's RBI triple and Hunter Pence's run-scoring groundout. Castellanos' RBI single in the eighth off Kyle Crick completed the scoring. NOTES: Detroit LHP Daniel Norris was placed on the 10-day disabled list on Thursday with a left groin strain. He has allowed five earned runs in each of his last three outings. LHP Blaine Hardy was recalled from Triple-A Toledo to take his roster spot. ... Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner was rocked for nine runs, including four homers, in a Class A rehab start for San Jose on Wednesday. Bumgarner, who pitched four innings, is scheduled to have another rehab start on Monday with the possibility of returning to the Giants next weekend. ... Tigers DH Victor Martinez, who has 1,999 career hits, got the day off. ... Despite the loss, San Francisco finished its road trip with a 4-2 record. It's the Giants' first winning road trip since they went 3-2 at Oakland and Arizona a year ago on June 29-July 3.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-giants-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED76OQJWIE"},

Last month DeVos pressed pause on the rules, due to take effect on July 1, saying they needed to be reset. Massachusetts, 17 other states and the District of Columbia said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.   the department broke federal law in announcing the delay with limited public notice and opportunity to comment.   DeVos, a Republican, has said accelerating the debt cancellation process would put taxpayers on the hook for significant costs, and a delay is needed while current litigation in California over the rules works through the legal system.  With this ideologically driven suit, the state attorneys general are saying to regulate first, and ask the legal questions later,  said Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill in a statement, adding the rules were adopted  through a heavily politicized process.   Consumer groups Public Citizen and Project on Predatory Student Lending sued on Thursday to lift the delay as well.  The rules were finalized in the last days of the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat who overhauled federal student lending.

Most-active CME August live cattle        knocked out Wednesday's session low early in Thursday's session but found downside support near its 100-day moving average and then bounced higher. The contract settled up 1.400 cents at 114.950 cents per pound, the biggest daily gains in 1-1/2 weeks.     Cattle futures declined for most of June and some investors were bargain hunting, traders said.     Cash cattle traded lightly at $117 in Kansas and $118 in Nebraska, feedlot sources said. That was flat to down $2 from last week and the high end of those trades was seen as a modest improvement from average sales of $117.70 per cwt on Wednesday at the online Fed Cattle Exchange (FCE) auction.      The FCE didn't trade much at all yesterday, and what little was done was at $117; $118 is better and August (futures) are cheap,  Brugler Marketing and Management President Alan Brugler said by telephone.     CME August feeder cattle futures        finished 2.400 cents higher at 144.625 cents per pound.     CME lean hog futures         were flat to widely mixed as investors continued to build positions in deferred contract months or roll out of nearby contracts. Most-active August hog futures        fell 1.925 cents to 82.650 cents per pound as traders locked in profits after the contract hit a lifetime high on Wednesday.     CME July hog futures        were down 0.575 cent to 91.475 cents per pound, and the contract was nearly at parity with the CME index of the cash hog market        of 91.930 cents per pound.     The lean hog index traded at a premium to futures for weeks, prompting investors to buy July hog futures in anticipation that futures would eventually converge with the higher cash sales.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture said prices for hogs in the top market of Iowa and southern Minnesota were up 30 cents to $87.77 per cwt.              Prices for wholesale pork and beef both were lower, according to the agency.

Four, according to the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or five, according to the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA).  The debate is part of a lawsuit that is trying to exempt Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds from having to hold 5% of their deals under risk-retention rules that are part of the Dodd-Frank Act.   The LSTA sued the Fed and SEC in 2014 to try to remove the 5% holding requirement for CLOs, arguing that a transfer definition in the rule did not apply. The LSTA also took issue with the regulators’ definition of credit risk.  CLOs are the largest buyer of leveraged loans and the need to hold 5% of the funds could lead to fewer deals and ultimately cut funding to companies. Critics of the holding requirement are also concerned that smaller managers may not have the capital to buy the required retention. This could lead to consolidation and further concentrate loan ownership.  The risk-retention lawsuit largely centers on one word in the rule, “transfer,” and who is the transferee and who is the transferor. Both parties have turned to dueling dictionaries to support their arguments.  In a June 7 court filing, regulators said that CLO managers control the selection of the loans they purchase and transfer them into a special purpose entity when selected, and turned to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law, the Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Finance, Investment and Banking and others to support their definition of transfer. Regulators included Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law’s definition in a footnote: “The noun transfer, to which the verb refers, is defined as ‘1: a conveyance of a right, title, or interest in real or personal property from one person or entity to another 2: a passing of something from one to another.’” The LSTA argues that CLO managers do not “transfer” assets. The trade group said in an April filing that risk retention does not apply because a CLO manager never owns or controls the loans that are sold to the funds, and instead acts on behalf of the CLO to facilitate its purchase of the loans. If a company employee buys something from Amazon on behalf of its employer, Amazon is the seller or transferor, not the employee. The same principle applies to the CLO market, according to Elliot Ganz, general counsel at the LSTA. If a manager buys a loan from a bank on behalf of a CLO, the bank is the seller or transferor, not the manager, he said.   “Every financial transaction has a transferee and the transferor, and everyone concedes the CLO is the transferee,” Ganz said. “Since the manager is acting on behalf of the CLO, as its agent, it is acting as the transferee not transferor.”  The LSTA cited its five dictionaries in the April filing as Black’s Law Dictionary, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, The New Oxford American Dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary and Random House Webster’s College Dictionary. A Federal Reserve spokesperson did not return a telephone call seeking comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

Private employers added 158,000 jobs in June, the ADP National Employment Report showed, coming in below the estimated gain of 185,000 and suggesting cooling in the U.S. labor market as it nears full employment. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims rose for the third straight week, climbing to 248,000 and topping the 243,000 expected.  While the data still indicates a tight labor market, the reports hint at a soft monthly nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes hiring in both the public and private sectors.  The softer data comes on the heels of Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting, which showed policymakers were increasingly split on the inflation outlook and how it might affect the pace of interest rate increases.  Those two factors helped push yields on U.S. Treasuries US10YT=RR higher and dampened the attractiveness of equities.  ADP came in pretty soft, people got a little nervous there,  said Anthony Conroy, president of Abel Noser in New York.

Tesla's shares have fallen about 13 percent this week, wiping off nearly $8 billion from the company's market capitalization, following the carmaker's lower-than-expected deliveries and rising competition in the electric car market. Thursday's 5 percent drop puts the stock on course for its worst weekly performance since February last year. The steep fall also knocked the company off its perch as the most valuable U.S. carmaker, with General Motors (GM.N) reclaiming the spot on Thursday.  At current levels, GM has a market capitalization of $52.71 billion, while Tesla was valued at about $51.8 billion.  Tesla on Monday reported lower-than-expected delivery numbers, citing a  severe  shortfall of new battery packs.

Zhejiang Geely Holding Group-owned [GEELY.UL] Volvo said on Wednesday all car models it launches after 2019 will be electric or hybrids. In the tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the seat belt in Tesla's Model S was not effective and could lead to the driver's head striking the steering wheel hard through the air bag. Ford's Lincoln Continental, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp's Avalon received the highest rating overall, the agency said on Thursday. Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second-highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email. The company said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested.

Last month DeVos pressed pause on the rules, due to take effect on July 1, saying they needed to be reset. Massachusetts, 17 other states and the District of Columbia said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.   the department broke federal law in announcing the delay with limited public notice and opportunity to comment.   DeVos, a Republican, has said accelerating the debt cancellation process would put taxpayers on the hook for significant costs, and a delay is needed while current litigation in California over the rules works through the legal system.  With this ideologically driven suit, the state attorneys general are saying to regulate first, and ask the legal questions later,  said Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill in a statement, adding the rules were adopted  through a heavily politicized process.   Consumer groups Public Citizen and Project on Predatory Student Lending sued on Thursday to lift the delay as well.  The rules were finalized in the last days of the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat who overhauled federal student lending.  After Corinthian, a for-profit chain, collapsed in 2015 amid government investigations into its post-graduation employment rates, the administration began drafting rules to help students caught with outstanding loans they had taken out for Corinthian tuition. Wanting to keep students from getting loans they could not repay, Obama specifically targeted for-profit, career colleges that promise students they will find jobs after graduating and can charge high tuition.  The attorneys general for California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, all Democrats, also signed onto Thursday's lawsuit. They said the department and DeVos were using the pending litigation as  a mere pretext  to repeal the rules and replace them with one that  will remove or dilute student rights and protections.” The $1.4 trillion student-loan industry became a hot-button issue in last year's presidential campaign. Democrats sought to preserve Obama's reforms, while Republicans such as then-candidate President Donald Trump said the government should  get out of the business  of student lending.

A U.S. Appeals court in May granted a 60-day abeyance in the appeal filed by the administration of Democratic former President Barack Obama. The pause ends next week. Last year a U.S. district judge invalidated the government's designation of MetLife as  systemically important,  a label signifying MetLife could devastate the financial system if it failed and triggering stricter oversight. The Obama administration immediately appealed, and a panel of three judges heard arguments in the case last October. Republican President Donald Trump, however, has expressed skepticism about designations and the council of regulatory heads that assigns the labels. Both were created through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Given the Trump administration's drive to strip down regulation and its criticism of Dodd-Frank, many expect it to change the government's stance in the appeal. MetLife, in its filing, said the court should wait to rule until the administration finishes its review of designations, expected in October.  Because the forthcoming report will reflect the new administration’s assessment of agency procedures that are at the very heart of this appeal, the report may prompt the government to change its positions on one or more issues in this appeal or to abandon the appeal altogether,  wrote attorney Eugene Scalia, representing the company, the largest U.S. life insurer.  At a minimum, the report may materially inform this court’s consideration of the issues on appeal.  Since his January inauguration, Trump has rolled back  regulation, creating major waves in the legal system.  In its filing, MetLife cited four cases involving the Environmental Protection Agency that were put on pause while the administration reviews related regulations. The Labor Department sought to delay a case involving a new retirement-advice rule, which a judge denied, and the Education Department recently suspended a student-loan rule partly because of a pending lawsuit. MetLife was designated in 2014 but is not considered systemically important during the appeal.  Dodd-Frank established labeling nonbank companies as  too big to fail  in response to the $182 billion government bailout that insurer American International Group (AIG.N) received during the 2008 financial crisis.

The parliament has limited influence on Turkey's decades-old pursuit of EU membership, now in limbo after bitter exchanges between Ankara and some European countries, but the decision highlighted the gulf which has grown between the two sides. EU leaders have been critical of Erdogan and his behavior toward opponents, both before and after an abortive military coup against him last July. A year-long crackdown since the failed coup and the sweeping new powers which Erdogan won in a tightly fought referendum in April have raised concerns among Turkey's Western allies. Erdogan says both the crackdown and the increased presidential powers are needed to help tackle serious challenges to Turkey's security both at home and beyond its borders. The resolution passed by parliament in Strasbourg  calls on the Commission and the member states... to formally suspend the accession negotiations with Turkey without delay if the constitutional reform package is implemented unchanged.  Related CoverageTurkey still wants to join EU, but bloc is confused: Turkish PMEU's Hahn says Turkey must respect rule of lawSome constitutional changes approved in April have already been implemented - Erdogan has been able to return to lead the ruling AK Party, and members of a top judicial body have been changed. Other steps, such as scrapping the post of prime minister, are due to take place within two years. Opposition parties and human rights groups say the changes threaten judicial independence and push Turkey toward one-man rule. The EU has also expressed concern, although many in the European Parliament believe the bloc has not gone far enough.  The current strategy of the European Commission and EU leaders seems to wait silently for things to improve in Turkey,  said the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Turkey, Kati Piri, criticizing a stance which she said was  feeding President Erdogan’s authoritarianism .  False Claims  FILE PHOTO: A European Union (L) and Turkish flag fly outside a hotel in Istanbul, Turkey, May 4, 2016.Murad Sezer/File PhotoTurkey's EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik said Ankara regarded Thursday's vote in Strasbourg as invalid, while the foreign ministry was similarly dismissive.  This decision, which is based on false claims and allegations, is trampling the reputation of the institution in question,  the ministry said in a statement, referring to the European Parliament.  This decision is of no value for us.  Thursday's vote came as EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn visited Istanbul for talks with Celik and other Turkish ministers.  As a European official I have to respect the decision of a democratic body,  Hahn told reporters, adding that he had raised the issue of the rule of law during his talks in Ankara. He also raised the case of 12 rights activists detained on Wednesday, but said he had not received a satisfactory reply. Hahn said Turkey has the right to defend its institutions in the wake of last year's failed coup, but added:  I want to be very clear that we are very worried about the reaction, very concerned about the large number of imprisoned journalists and academics.   I really want to move forward in such an important strategic relationship. It depends on Turkey's willingness, and (taking) steps on the rule of law and fundamental rights.  Despite their concerns over Turkey, EU leaders do not want to undermine an agreement struck last year whereby Ankara effectively stopped migrants reaching Greece from Turkish shores, thereby easing a crisis that had threatened EU unity. In an interview on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told Reuters that Turkey was not responsible for the escalation of tensions between the two sides.  Europe displaying inappropriate behavior toward Turkey is not a situation we can accept. Being against our President Erdogan is also not a rational stance from Europe. Europe must decide: ... Do they really want to enlarge?  Kurtulmus said.

In a letter to Trump dated on Thursday and posted on his Twitter account, Walter Shaub said he would step down from the ethics watchdog effective July 19 and praised his staff for their commitment to laws and ethical principles over private interests.      Shaub has sounded many alarms over the Trump administration's business entanglements. He urged Trump to divest from his business empire rather than turn management of it over to his sons, and chastised the White House for not disciplining presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway after she endorsed a fashion line sold by Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter. Shaub said in an interview with the Washington Post published Thursday that he was not pressured to leave, but felt that he could not achieve more in the ethics office under the Trump administration. Democratic lawmakers lauded Shaub's service. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said he looked forward to examining Republican Trump's nominee to replace Shaub. Schumer said he hoped the successor would prevent lobbyists and private interests from  rigging the system against working families under the cover of darkness.  Undated handout photo of Walter Shaub.U.S. Office of Government Ethics/HandoutElijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Republican chairman of the committee to invite Shaub to testify to the panel about necessary ethical reforms.

Chaffetz rebuked Shaub in a January letter for making public statements about Trump's finances. Shaub will next head the Ethics Practice at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based nonpartisan group dedicated to democratic reform, said Larry Noble, the group's general counsel.  Noble said that the Center learned of Shaub's interest in leaving his government job in the last two weeks and seized the chance to hire him. Shaub's work at the Campaign Legal Center will involve examining deficiencies in existing ethics laws and developing ways to strengthen them, both at the Office of Government Ethics and in the realm of congressional ethics, Noble said.

That savings, combined with other measures to generate extraordinary revenues, should allow the government to revise its spending freeze later this month without jeopardizing its budget target, the source said. The government currently takes about three months to stop paying salaries and benefits after a pensioner or employee dies. The decree, which could be published as soon as next week, would allow banks to send that money back to the government. Authorities have been scrambling to meet this year's budget target without resorting to tax hikes. Years of spending increases cost the country its investment-grade credit rating in 2015, and policymakers are trying to restore market confidence. The government also has announced other budget measures, including a bill allowing the Treasury to appropriate resources from unredeemed judicial debts and a program to renegotiate tax debts, both of which could help generate 13.6 billion reais more in revenues than originally forecast. The government must update its budget estimates for this year by July 22. Economists expect the extraordinary revenues to allow authorities to reduce this year's spending freeze from 39 billion reais currently. Piecemeal budget measures have become more important as a political crisis has made it harder for President Michel Temer to enact his top economic priority in Congress, his proposal to revamp the country's pension system. The plan, which investors and many in government have called crucial to balance the budget in the long-run, could fail to pass before next year's elections, legislators have said. Economists expect a budget deficit of 142 billion reais for the central government this year, slightly larger than a target of 139 billion reais, according to a Finance Ministry survey. The source reiterated that the goal will not be changed  by any means  and that tax increases could be implemented if necessary, despite weak economic growth. Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said earlier on Thursday the government was still forecasting growth of 0.5 percent this year. Among the tax hikes under consideration is an import tax increase on fuels, the source said.

You probably don't know their names yet. But you soon might - they're the top boys' and girls' seeds in the junior championships that begin at Wimbledon on Saturday.  Many of the top players won junior titles, including Roger Federer, whose boys' crown in 1998 at the age of 16 was a prelude to seven men's titles so far at the All England Club. Bjorn Borg also did the double, as did Pat Cash. Fellow champion Stefan Edberg won all four junior titles in 1983. Indeed, scattered through the junior record books across the four majors are some of the recent grand slam champions - Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka, Marin Cilic - as well top 20 players such as Nick Kyrgios, Alexander Zverev and Grigor Dimitrov.  Winning nine years ago was one of my greatest memories that I have ever had,  Dimitrov said on Thursday of his Wimbledon junior title. His advice to the faces of the future?  I think as soon as you get out here on the court ... try to create your own person, and this is because those kind of moments, I think those years in your career, define a little bit how you're going to be and who you want to be,  he said. Of course, a junior title as a teenager is no guarantee of the riches and glory of the senior tour. Many never became household names - and with the continued dominance of a handful of top players on the men's side they may never break through.     Some are already making their way, though. Last year's boys' champion, Denis Shapovalov, 18, is ranked 164 and played for Canada in the Davis Cup - gaining some notoriety for accidentally striking the umpire with a ball smashed in anger against Britain. He lost as a wildcard to Poland's Jerzy Janowicz in the first round of this year's Wimbledon main draw.  Last year's girls' winner, Anastasia Potapova, ranked 300 in the world, retired in her main draw first round this year. Past Wimbledon girls' winners were facing off over the net in the doubles on Thursday -- Laura Robson and Jelena Ostapenko -- with Robson and partner Jocelyn Rae coming out victorious. Latvia's Ostapenko, 20, won in 2014 and last month scooped her first grand slam, on the Paris clay. Britain's Robson, 23, won in 2008 and reached a career high of ranking of 27 in 2013 but has since struggled for form after wrist injuries. Boys' top seed Moutet, 18, is already ranked 341 after playing in lower level tournaments, mostly in his native France, and reached the second round in the main draw doubles at this year's French Open. On the girls' side, Day, 17, will be looking to add the Wimbledon title to last year's junior U.S. Open crown as a taster for main tour rewards. Dimitrov knows how that feels.  I won Wimbledon nine years ago. As a junior, though. Well, my goal is to win Wimbledon now,  he said.

That savings, combined with other measures to generate extraordinary revenues, should allow the government to revise its spending freeze later this month without jeopardizing its budget target, the source said. The government currently takes about three months to stop paying salaries and benefits after a pensioner or employee dies. The decree, which could be published as soon as next week, would allow banks to send that money back to the government. Authorities have been scrambling to meet this year's budget target without resorting to tax hikes. Years of spending increases cost the country its investment-grade credit rating in 2015, and policymakers are trying to restore market confidence. The government also has announced other budget measures, including a bill allowing the Treasury to appropriate resources from unredeemed judicial debts and a program to renegotiate tax debts, both of which could help generate 13.6 billion reais more in revenues than originally forecast. The government must update its budget estimates for this year by July 22. Economists expect the extraordinary revenues to allow authorities to reduce this year's spending freeze from 39 billion reais currently. Piecemeal budget measures have become more important as a political crisis has made it harder for President Michel Temer to enact his top economic priority in Congress, his proposal to revamp the country's pension system. The plan, which investors and many in government have called crucial to balance the budget in the long-run, could fail to pass before next year's elections, legislators have said. Economists expect a budget deficit of 142 billion reais for the central government this year, slightly larger than a target of 139 billion reais, according to a Finance Ministry survey. The source reiterated that the goal will not be changed  by any means  and that tax increases could be implemented if necessary, despite weak economic growth. Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said earlier on Thursday the government was still forecasting growth of 0.5 percent this year. Among the tax hikes under consideration is an import tax increase on fuels, the source said.

While the German, who reached last year's final, did eventually suppress the Belgian's unorthodox game to win 7-5 7-5, she again showed signs of the vulnerability that has dogged her in 2017.  Having claimed the Australian and U.S. Open crowns last year, Kerber has not won a single title this season and suffered an ignominious first-round exit from the French Open in May.  For large parts of Thursday's encounter on Court One, she struggled against Flipkens, who tried everything in her power to upset the world number one.  Once again Kerber's serve and groundstrokes seemed to lack the potency they possessed last year, which appeared to encourage Flipkens to pile on the pressure in the evening gloom.   Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 6, 2017   Germany’s Angelique Kerber in action during her second round match against Belgium’s Kirsten FlipkensTony O'BrienAt times in the first set Kerber found Flipkens' game unfathomable as the Belgian tried her luck with a number of perfectly weighted drop shots and low slices, while frequently charging the net in an effort to upset the German baseliner.  Slideshow (3 Images)The pair exchanged four successive breaks of serve before Kerber regained her composure to hold and then broke Flipkens for the third straight time to reassert her authority before taking the first set. It was another even battle in the second as the players exchanged breaks before Kerber struck decisively in the 11th game and then served out to win in one hour 44 minutes.  I think it was not an easy match ... Kirsten is always tough to play because she plays good on grass with the slice,  Kerber told reporters.   I couldn't find my rhythm in the first few games, but then I was trying to move good and playing the ball back. It was for sure maybe not the best tennis that I played, but I was trying to fight again for every point, and I think that was the key at the end.

Mladenovic was beaten 2-6 6-4 6-4 by unheralded American Alison Riske, but she insisted her main concern had been getting off Court 18 in one piece.  Honestly, the feeling is that I couldn't care less if I lost the match today, I just want to be healthy. I'm just so blessed and happy that I am not injured today, because we saw worse today.  The French woman's comments came just two hours after American Bethanie Mattek-Sands had been carried off a different court on a stretcher, screaming in pain with a serious knee injury. Mladenovic said she and Riske had both asked to not play on the court after the first two games.  It's quite unique with your opponent, after two games, you both agree on stopping playing in a slam,  she said.  You asking the referee to tell you what's the rule if both players don't want to keep on playing. And the answer is that they just can't do anything, unfortunately, and you have to keep on playing.  I think you can all pretty much see. First of all, I don't know, the color of the court, the fact that there's no more grass, the fact that the baseline where we are running, it's very slippery.  There's no grass. I don't know how to describe it. It's not even clay. It's not flat. I mean, I don't know. So it is tough to put your strong footwork. You kind of have to run light and be careful, I don't know, not to push or press too much, too hard, which is strange to play on. I'm just honestly very happy and blessed that I didn't injure myself that much.  The All England Club confirmed that Court 18 had been checked by tournament officials, including head groundsman Neil Stubley, during the match and was  playable as normal .  The court preparation has been to exactly the same meticulous standard as in previous years,  a statement said.  Grass is a natural surface and it is usual for the baselines to start to be showing signs of wear and tear four days into the Championships.  It said moisture readings, taken every morning, showed nothing unusual despite the hot weather.  We will continue to monitor these readings and adjust our care plan for the grass appropriately.  Mattek-Sands's conqueror, Sorana Cirstea, said Court 17 had been a little slippery, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We all know grass, it's quite dangerous sometimes,  she told reporters.  Especially as you get through the days, it's less grass and more sand or whatever.  I think all of us, we know when we move -- I also had two quite tough balls where I almost fell over. So we all know grass is a little bit more dangerous than hard court or clay.  Mladenovic said the condition of the courts was a topic of conversation in the locker rooms.  I don't want to call it negligence or anything, but yeah, I just hope nobody gets injured. That's the thing. That's a tricky feeling.  Lots of courts ... I am in the ladies member locker room, so I don't meet many players. But the ones I talk to, they -- I don't know in which court (Agnieszka) Radwanska played, but she said it was horrible, as well.

Oil has not sustained gains for more than a couple of weeks as investors have grown more worried about the stubborn global crude glut. U.S. crude stocks fell 6.3 million barrels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, citing stronger refining activity and reduced imports. That was much more than the draw of about 2.3 million barrels analysts had forecast, and it took total crude inventories to 502.9 million barrels, the lowest since January. Crude prices gave back gains in the early afternoon. After hitting a high of $46.53 a barrel, U.S. futures settled up 39 cents to $45.52 a barrel. Brent futures hit a high of $49.18 a barrel after the inventory figures were released, but settled up 32 cents to $48.11 a barrel.  There's a lot of bearishness out there now,  said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  The market is still believing supplies are not going to be in balance globally.   Investors believe the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will need to make further output cuts to offset thriving shale production in the United States.  U.S. gasoline stocks dropped 3.7 million barrels in the most recent week, far exceeding the expected drop of 1.1 million barrels. Still, gasoline inventories remain about 6 percent above seasonal averages, so investors will watch for July data to see if demand is strong enough to whittle down stocks. The price of oil has tumbled from one-month highs just below $50 on increased production from OPEC, even as the group has pledged to cut output.  A number of investment banks in the last two weeks have reduced price outlooks, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch cutting its average Brent forecasts to $50 this year and $52 per barrel in 2018, from $54 and $56 before. [nL1N1JR09A Bernstein Research reduced its average Brent forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to $50 per barrel, from $60 and $70 previously. Saxo Bank said oil prices could rise toward $55 in coming months, but it expected lower prices at year-end and into 2018.

The company said it would incur a pre-tax charge of about $20 million in the second quarter to write off the drug's value. Endo's shares fell as much as 3 percent.  The FDA called last month for the drug to be withdrawn after an advisory committee concluded in March that the benefit of the drug no longer outweighed the risk. It was the first time the agency had called for the removal of an opioid for public health reasons. That news sent the company's shares down 12 percent to $12.10. On Thursday the shares fell to $11.05. Opana ER was approved in 2006. A reformulated version designed to deter abuse was introduced in 2012. The advisory panel concluded that while the rate of nasal abuse fell, rates of intravenous abuse rose. Sales of Opana ER were $159 million in 2016, less than 5 percent of Endo's overall revenue.  The withdrawal comes amid a nationwide opioid abuse epidemic that the FDA has vowed to combat. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has made it a top priority for the agency. He has said the agency will continue to  take regulatory steps  in situations where it believes the risks outweigh the benefits. Opioids killed more than 33,000 people in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About half those deaths involved a prescription painkiller. A growing body of litigation is piling up against manufacturers of opioid painkillers over claims the drugmakers, including Endo, misrepresented the risks of addiction, overdose and abuse associated with these medicines.

Four, according to the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or five, according to the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA).  The debate is part of a lawsuit that is trying to exempt Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds from having to hold 5% of their deals under risk-retention rules that are part of the Dodd-Frank Act.   The LSTA sued the Fed and SEC in 2014 to try to remove the 5% holding requirement for CLOs, arguing that a transfer definition in the rule did not apply. The LSTA also took issue with the regulators’ definition of credit risk.  CLOs are the largest buyer of leveraged loans and the need to hold 5% of the funds could lead to fewer deals and ultimately cut funding to companies. Critics of the holding requirement are also concerned that smaller managers may not have the capital to buy the required retention. This could lead to consolidation and further concentrate loan ownership.  The risk-retention lawsuit largely centers on one word in the rule, “transfer,” and who is the transferee and who is the transferor. Both parties have turned to dueling dictionaries to support their arguments.  In a June 7 court filing, regulators said that CLO managers control the selection of the loans they purchase and transfer them into a special purpose entity when selected, and turned to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law, the Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Finance, Investment and Banking and others to support their definition of transfer. Regulators included Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law’s definition in a footnote: “The noun transfer, to which the verb refers, is defined as ‘1: a conveyance of a right, title, or interest in real or personal property from one person or entity to another 2: a passing of something from one to another.’” The LSTA argues that CLO managers do not “transfer” assets. The trade group said in an April filing that risk retention does not apply because a CLO manager never owns or controls the loans that are sold to the funds, and instead acts on behalf of the CLO to facilitate its purchase of the loans. If a company employee buys something from Amazon on behalf of its employer, Amazon is the seller or transferor, not the employee. The same principle applies to the CLO market, according to Elliot Ganz, general counsel at the LSTA. If a manager buys a loan from a bank on behalf of a CLO, the bank is the seller or transferor, not the manager, he said.   “Every financial transaction has a transferee and the transferor, and everyone concedes the CLO is the transferee,” Ganz said. “Since the manager is acting on behalf of the CLO, as its agent, it is acting as the transferee not transferor.”  The LSTA cited its five dictionaries in the April filing as Black’s Law Dictionary, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, The New Oxford American Dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary and Random House Webster’s College Dictionary.

(Reuters) - People injured by Takata Corp's defective air bags were given an official role in the bankruptcy of its U.S. unit on Thursday, allowing them to challenge restructuring plans that plaintiffs' lawyers have criticized as protective of automakers. A seven-member official committee will represent economic loss and personal injury or tort claimants, David Buchbinder, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, told a meeting of creditors of Takata's U.S. business. Official committees receive funds from a debtor to hire professionals who can carry out investigations and test financial assumptions.     William Weintraub, a lawyer with Goodwin Procter who is not involved in the Takata case, said he expected the committee  to be active and to make sure that the claims of the car manufacturers are not treated preferentially and that tort victims are fairly compensated.   A second five-member committee of suppliers and vendors was also appointed, according to Buchbinder. Takata filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United States last month, facing billions of dollars in liabilities from recalls and lawsuits stemming from its air bags.  The inflator compound used in the bags becomes volatile with age, causing the devices to inflate with too much force. The air bags have been linked to 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and hundreds of injuries.    One person appointed to the personal injury committee, Adrian Antonio Pielago, allegedly suffered a major neck laceration and nerve damage last year in an accident involving a Takata air bag, according to court records. Takata is finalizing a $1.6 billion sale of most of its business to Michigan-based Key Safety Systems, owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS). The deal is meant to save 14,000 jobs, provide a stable supply of replacement air bags and finance a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. government.    Personal injury lawyers said at a bankruptcy hearing last month that Takata was deferring too much to automakers, which claim they are owed billions of dollars in recall costs. Lawyers for Takata's U.S. business said the automakers provided financing to Takata and received protections in return. The company has set aside $125 million for injury claims, but lawyers for injured drivers said it may not be enough because millions of air bags have yet to be recalled. The lawyers say more money could come from Takata's insurance, as well as from its sale to Key Safety. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/takata-bankruptcy-usa-idUSL1N1JX1UL"},

Oil has not sustained gains for more than a couple of weeks as investors have grown more worried about the stubborn global crude glut. U.S. crude stocks fell 6.3 million barrels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, citing stronger refining activity and reduced imports. That was much more than the draw of about 2.3 million barrels analysts had forecast, and it took total crude inventories to 502.9 million barrels, the lowest since January. Crude prices gave back gains in the early afternoon. After hitting a high of $46.53 a barrel, U.S. futures settled up 39 cents to $45.52 a barrel. Brent futures hit a high of $49.18 a barrel after the inventory figures were released, but settled up 32 cents to $48.11 a barrel.  There's a lot of bearishness out there now,  said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  The market is still believing supplies are not going to be in balance globally.   Investors believe the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will need to make further output cuts to offset thriving shale production in the United States.  U.S. gasoline stocks dropped 3.7 million barrels in the most recent week, far exceeding the expected drop of 1.1 million barrels. Still, gasoline inventories remain about 6 percent above seasonal averages, so investors will watch for July data to see if demand is strong enough to whittle down stocks. The price of oil has tumbled from one-month highs just below $50 on increased production from OPEC, even as the group has pledged to cut output.  A number of investment banks in the last two weeks have reduced price outlooks, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch cutting its average Brent forecasts to $50 this year and $52 per barrel in 2018, from $54 and $56 before. [nL1N1JR09A Bernstein Research reduced its average Brent forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to $50 per barrel, from $60 and $70 previously. Saxo Bank said oil prices could rise toward $55 in coming months, but it expected lower prices at year-end and into 2018.

The company said it would incur a pre-tax charge of about $20 million in the second quarter to write off the drug's value. Endo's shares fell as much as 3 percent.  The FDA called last month for the drug to be withdrawn after an advisory committee concluded in March that the benefit of the drug no longer outweighed the risk. It was the first time the agency had called for the removal of an opioid for public health reasons. That news sent the company's shares down 12 percent to $12.10. On Thursday the shares fell to $11.05. Opana ER was approved in 2006. A reformulated version designed to deter abuse was introduced in 2012. The advisory panel concluded that while the rate of nasal abuse fell, rates of intravenous abuse rose. Sales of Opana ER were $159 million in 2016, less than 5 percent of Endo's overall revenue.  The withdrawal comes amid a nationwide opioid abuse epidemic that the FDA has vowed to combat. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has made it a top priority for the agency. He has said the agency will continue to  take regulatory steps  in situations where it believes the risks outweigh the benefits. Opioids killed more than 33,000 people in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About half those deaths involved a prescription painkiller. A growing body of litigation is piling up against manufacturers of opioid painkillers over claims the drugmakers, including Endo, misrepresented the risks of addiction, overdose and abuse associated with these medicines.

Tahoe's Canada-listed shares ended down 33.2 percent at C$7.19 as the company said the suspension of operations at its flagship Escobal silver mine meant it could no longer confirm its previously issued 2017 outlook. Several banks cut their target prices and recommendations on the stock. It is not clear how long the mine will be closed, as the company takes legal steps to have the license reinstated while the case is heard.  If it's shut down for three months, then 30 percent is probably a bit of an overreaction,  said Ian Scott, an equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management.  If you're down for a year or longer, then maybe it's a bit more onside.  Scott said that lingering housing concerns weighed on banking stocks that should have otherwise benefited more from a broad rise on global bond yields. Home sales in the red-hot Toronto market fell for the third consecutive month in June, while more owners put their properties up for sale as they worried a rapid acceleration in prices had peaked, data showed.  As long as those housing concerns still linger and as long as oil isn't acting properly, you could see the TSX trading lower,  Scott said. Energy stocks ended off 0.7 percent, as an oil rally faded despite a sharper-than-expected decline in U.S. crude oil and gasoline stocks. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index ended down 75.24 points, or 0.50 percent, at 15,077.88, its fourth down day in five. Nine of its 10 main sectors fell, with telecoms notching a slight gain. Decliners outnumbered advancers by almost 4-to-1 overall. Air Canada jumped 10.7 percent to C$19.20 after the airline said it expected its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment and aircraft rent to  significantly exceed  analysts' expectations. Smaller rival Westjet Airlines Ltd added 3.1 percent to C$24.27. Alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc fell 5.9 percent to C$15.89 and rival Street Capital Group Inc lost 9.8 percent to C$1.20 after a financial regulator said it planned to clamp down on risky lending, six months after a Reuters investigation revealed that regulated mortgage providers were teaming up with unregulated rivals to circumvent rules limiting how much they can lend against a property.

The photo, found in the U.S. National Archives by retired U.S. Treasury Agent Les Kinney and the subject of a new History Channel documentary titled,  Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence,  shows what appears to be a Caucasian woman sitting on a dock in the Marshall Islands. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan were last seen taking off in her twin-engine Lockheed Electra on July 2, 1937, from Papua New Guinea en route to tiny Howland Island, some 2,500 miles away in the central Pacific. Radio contact with her plane was lost hours later after 39-year-old Earhart reported running low on fuel. A massive air-and-sea search, the most extensive such U.S. operation at that time, was unsuccessful. Earhart's plane was presumed to have gone down, but it has never been known whether she survived, and if so, for how long.     In the two-hour documentary, which airs on Sunday, researchers say body image comparisons between the photographed woman and Earhart make the match  very likely.  They hypothesize that Earhart veered away from Howland Island, crash-landed on the Marshall Islands and was then taken captive by Japanese forces.

He added, however, that after Kinney made the case for why he thought the photograph showed Earhart, he was  instantly intrigued.      Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), on the other hand, said there is no evidence the person in the photograph is Earhart.

The bones' dimensions match Earhart's build, likely revealing she died there as a castaway.  I could show you a dozen pictures of Amelia Earhart in the last days of her world flight,  said Gillespie.  Her hair's shorter than that. It's not down on her collar. It's shorter,  he said,  and that doesn't look like Fred Noonan.   We knew there were going to be people questioning its validity, especially other people who have spent their lives or their careers trying to find more information on Amelia Earhart,  Tarpinian said.  We think we have real evidence and we stand behind it.

Legislatures in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin remain in disagreement about how to close ongoing budget gaps in their states or fund new budget initiatives.  We always have some states that go into the new fiscal year without budgets, but the number is a bit high this year,  said Eric Kim, a director at Fitch Ratings.  Weak revenues complicated budget negotiations in several states, while idiosyncratic issues pushed others beyond their June 30 deadlines.  The Illinois House was poised to take final budget action on Thursday by attempting to override the governor's vetoes of a $36 billion spending plan and $5 billion tax hike approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature over the Fourth of July holiday weekend. A hazardous materials situation in the state Capitol in Springfield delayed the House session, but officials determined the substance was harmless and lawmakers were returning.  If enacted, the budget would mark Illinois' first complete budget since 2015. No other U.S. state has lacked a budget for that long. Thirty-three of the 50 U.S. states reported revenues that came in below projections in fiscal year 2017, the highest number of states since the recession decimated budgets in 2010, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Connecticut and Pennsylvania have the most challenging revenue situations, according to Fitch, as lower-than-anticipated tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them.  Massachusetts, also amid a revenue shortfall, enacted a one-month interim budget for July to provide additional time to negotiate a full-year budget. Wisconsin legislators are working to close a transportation funding shortfall.  Oregon's budget process includes multiple bills, most of which have been approved. But the legislature is still debating several measures, including changes to hiring practices. Rhode Island had appeared ready to finalize a budget by June 30, but late last week the state Senate amended a House proposal to phase out an automobile tax, causing the House to halt the budget process.  Many states retain the authority to make debt service payments without enacted budgets. Over the holiday weekend, several states came to last-minute budget agreements.  New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, while governors of Washington state and Alaska signed new operating budgets late last week, hours before deadlines that would have triggered partial government shutdowns.

While Edmond Mulet, head of the joint United Nations and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry, did not name any countries, diplomats said Russia regularly pressured the investigators.  We do receive, unfortunately, direct and indirect messages all the time, from many sides, telling us how to do our work,  Mulet told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council.  Related CoverageFrance, Russia discuss Syria, sidestep differences on chemical weapons Some of those messages are very clearly saying if we don't do our work according to them ... they will not accept the conclusions,  he said.  I appeal to all ... let us perform our work in an impartial, independent and professional manner,  he said, adding the results would be presented in October. Syrian-ally Russia has publicly questioned the work of the inquiry, which was created by the Security Council in 2015, and said the findings cannot be used to take U.N. action and that the Syrian government should investigate the accusations. The inquiry has so far blamed Syrian government forces for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and Islamic State militants used mustard gas in 2015. In response to those findings Western powers tried to impose U.N. sanctions on Syria in February but this effort was blocked by Russia and China. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. Investigators are currently looking at two cases - the exposure of two Syrian women to sulfur mustard in an apparent attack in Um Hosh, Aleppo last September and a deadly April 4 sarin attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun that prompted the United States to launch missile strikes on a Syrian air base. In both cases an OPCW fact finding mission has already determined that chemical weapons were used. Western governments have blamed the Syrian government for the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which killed dozens of people. Syria has denied any involvement. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States.

France appears to be broadly aligning its foreign policy with the U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia and avoiding a head-on clash with Moscow over Syria. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who held six hours of talks primarily on Syria with Russian officials in Moscow two weeks ago, continued his push for closer co-operation, when he met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov again in Paris on Thursday.  With the two countries previously publicly at odds over the issue of chemical weapons, Le Drian now hopes to convince Russia to enforce a 2013 Security Council resolution to prevent their use in Syria. He also wants to win concessions from Russia to improve the humanitarian situation in a country where hundreds of thousands are besieged and millions displaced after six years of civil war. Le Drian has not said what incentives Paris could offer Russia in return beyond closer security cooperation.   Terrorism is our number one enemy and to fight it we have to put everything else aside,  Lavrov, whose country supports the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, said in a joint statement.  Le Drian echoed those comments saying terrorism was their common enemy.  Standing alongside Lavrov, he said that France, which has backed opposition groups fighting Assad, had set a red line on the use of chemical weapons in the country. He shied away from criticizing Russia.   We are both opposed to the use of chemical weapons and what's at stake is to be able to dismantle the regime's chemical weapons' stocks,  Le Drian said, refusing to take questions from reporters. Lavrov himself made no mention of chemical weapons. French intelligence agencies have accused Assad's  government of carrying out a chemical weapons attack in April, something that both Syrian and Russian officials have dismissed. Paris said on Friday that findings by a fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) that showed sarin or a sarin-like substance had been used proved this. Russia said the report was based on doubtful evidence.

At a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, the bank raised the overnight deposit rate to 18.75 percent from 16.75 percent and its overnight lending rate to 19.75 from 17.75 percent, it said in a statement, after hiking them by 200 points each at the last policy-setting meeting in May. Egypt floated its currency in November, and since then its pound has roughly halved in value. As the currency's value dropped, inflation surged. Although the core rate slipped in May, it remains almost 30 percent year-on-year. The central bank raised interest by 300 basis points after the currency floatation, which helped Egypt clinch a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program tied to ambitious reforms such as tax hikes and subsidy cuts. The IMF has said lowering inflation is key to keeping its economic reform program on track and that raising key interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. Ongoing reforms tied to the IMF loan program had increased risks for inflation, which the bank aims to reduce to 13 percent by end-2018, the bank said.  Higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017, as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressure,  it said. Nine out of 10 economists polled by Reuters on Monday predicted the bank would leave its key interest rates unchanged. Hany Farahat, senior economist at CI Capital, was the sole dissenter. He told Reuters on Thursday following the hike announcement that he did not expect it to be effective in combating inflation.  We expected a rate hike despite our view that it will not reduce inflation. The central bank had no choice as it followed a very steep fuel price hike, which the finance ministry said would add 4 percent to inflation,  he said.  Impact from the hike will be diluted as bank are now reluctant to pass on the rate increases on to their deposit and savings rates as a way of limiting costs. Accordingly, this step will not absorb additional liquidity from the system.  Egypt's economic growth has deteriorated since a 2011 uprising drove tourists and foreign investors away, draining foreign reserves and putting pressure on President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who has to maintain support amid tough economic reforms that have sent inflation shooting up. The government last week hiked fuel prices by up to 50 percent for the second time since November in another step to narrow its budget deficit. The hike would add 3 to 4.5 percentage points to inflation, Deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kojak told Reuters on Monday. Electricity Minister Mohamed Shaker said on Thursday Egypt will hike electricity prices by up to 42 percent this fiscal year for households as of Aug. 1 but keep energy subsidies in place three years longer than expected.

In his second trip to Europe as president and shortly before leaving for a potentially fractious G20 meeting in Germany, Trump sought to ease the nerves of U.S. allies after failing in May to endorse the principle of collective defense enshrined in Article Five of the NATO treaty.  As a presidential candidate Trump called NATO obsolete, but he has since changed his position on the alliance's relevance. The president also had tough words for Russia on Thursday, though he did not fully endorse allegations, backed by U.S. intelligence agencies, that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election that he won. Trump meets President Vladimir Putin for the first time face-to-face on Friday in Hamburg, the site of the G20 summit.  We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes including Syria and Iran, and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and the defense of civilization itself,  he said.  The Kremlin said Russia was not guilty of any destabilizing activity. The brief visit to Warsaw, which included a meeting with  regional heads of state, was billed by the White House as an effort to patch up relations with European allies after a tense NATO summit in May. Trump was received by enthusiastic crowds on a central Warsaw square - some 15,000 people according to police estimates - many arriving on busses arranged by parliamentary deputies of the ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party.

Some wore t-shirts with American flag colors and many chanted the president's name. Trump reiterated his criticism of low defense spending levels by many European nations and praised Poland for meeting the alliance's target of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense.  To those who would criticize our tough stance, I would point out that the United States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment,  he said to applause. Article Five of NATO's 1949 founding charter states that an attack on any member is an attack on all, and allies must render assistance, military if need be.

After Mexico's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate last month for the seventh consecutive time, to a more than eight-year high, the market has tilted toward bets that it is  done hiking.     Investors have begun to price in rate cuts as soon as next May, but the minutes did not provide any clear sign that policymakers were thinking about when they could begin to reduce borrowing costs.     Meanwhile, Brazil's stocks and currency slipped on lingering concerns over a political crisis, but shares of power utilities rallied due to a planned regulatory overhaul of the sector.     Demand for Brazilian assets has fizzled in recent months as traders fear a corruption scandal could delay implementation of President Michel Temer's ambitious agenda, which is seen as critical to fuel long-term economic growth.     The Brazilian real dipped about 0.2 percent while other Latin American currencies were mostly flat. The Colombian peso, however, strengthened 0.3 percent, tracking rising crude oil futures.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index fell more than 1 percent, weighed down by blue-chips such as lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and beverage producer Ambev SA . Shares of miner Vale SA also fell on  lower iron ore prices.     The index's losses were limited by a rally in shares of power utilities after the government announced that plans to overhaul power sector rules could lead to higher rates and lower taxes.     Shares of state-controlled utility Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, which would benefit directly from the revamp, soared nearly 10 percent.

Legislatures in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin remain in disagreement about how to close ongoing budget gaps in their states or fund new budget initiatives.  We always have some states that go into the new fiscal year without budgets, but the number is a bit high this year,  said Eric Kim, a director at Fitch Ratings.  Weak revenues complicated budget negotiations in several states, while idiosyncratic issues pushed others beyond their June 30 deadlines.  The Illinois House was poised to take final budget action on Thursday by attempting to override the governor's vetoes of a $36 billion spending plan and $5 billion tax hike approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature over the Fourth of July holiday weekend. A hazardous materials situation in the state Capitol in Springfield delayed the House session, but officials determined the substance was harmless and lawmakers were returning.  If enacted, the budget would mark Illinois' first complete budget since 2015. No other U.S. state has lacked a budget for that long. Thirty-three of the 50 U.S. states reported revenues that came in below projections in fiscal year 2017, the highest number of states since the recession decimated budgets in 2010, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Connecticut and Pennsylvania have the most challenging revenue situations, according to Fitch, as lower-than-anticipated tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them.  Massachusetts, also amid a revenue shortfall, enacted a one-month interim budget for July to provide additional time to negotiate a full-year budget. Wisconsin legislators are working to close a transportation funding shortfall.  Oregon's budget process includes multiple bills, most of which have been approved. But the legislature is still debating several measures, including changes to hiring practices. Rhode Island had appeared ready to finalize a budget by June 30, but late last week the state Senate amended a House proposal to phase out an automobile tax, causing the House to halt the budget process.  Many states retain the authority to make debt service payments without enacted budgets. Over the holiday weekend, several states came to last-minute budget agreements.  New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, while governors of Washington state and Alaska signed new operating budgets late last week, hours before deadlines that would have triggered partial government shutdowns.

In his second trip to Europe as president and shortly before leaving for a potentially fractious G20 meeting in Germany, Trump sought to ease the nerves of U.S. allies after failing in May to endorse the principle of collective defense enshrined in Article Five of the NATO treaty.  As a presidential candidate Trump called NATO obsolete, but he has since changed his position on the alliance's relevance. The president also had tough words for Russia on Thursday, though he did not fully endorse allegations, backed by U.S. intelligence agencies, that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election that he won. Trump meets President Vladimir Putin for the first time face-to-face on Friday in Hamburg, the site of the G20 summit.  We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes including Syria and Iran, and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and the defense of civilization itself,  he said.  The Kremlin said Russia was not guilty of any destabilizing activity. The brief visit to Warsaw, which included a meeting with  regional heads of state, was billed by the White House as an effort to patch up relations with European allies after a tense NATO summit in May. Trump was received by enthusiastic crowds on a central Warsaw square - some 15,000 people according to police estimates - many arriving on busses arranged by parliamentary deputies of the ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party.

Some wore t-shirts with American flag colors and many chanted the president's name. Trump reiterated his criticism of low defense spending levels by many European nations and praised Poland for meeting the alliance's target of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense.  To those who would criticize our tough stance, I would point out that the United States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment,  he said to applause. Article Five of NATO's 1949 founding charter states that an attack on any member is an attack on all, and allies must render assistance, military if need be. The stopover was a major diplomatic coup for Poland's conservative government, which has faced mounting criticism from Brussels over its democratic record and a refusal to accept migrants fleeing war in the Middle East.

At 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2969 to the greenback, or 77.11 U.S. cents, down 0.1 percent.     Losses for equity markets weighed on Canada's currency, said David Bradley, director of foreign exchange trading at Scotiabank.     Canada's commodity-linked currency tends to underperform when risk appetite falls.     U.S. stocks retreated after a round of disappointing labor market data clashed with the prospect of a more hawkish Federal Reserve, while rising tensions in the Korean peninsula provided additional pressure.                  U.S. crude oil futures        settled 39 cents higher at $45.52 a barrel after a sharper-than-expected decline in crude oil and gasoline stocks, but were off the day's highs.     Oil is one of Canada's major exports.     Canada's exports and imports both hit record highs in May, reflecting continued economic strength ahead of a highly anticipated interest rate decision next week.                  Expectations for a rate increase have been rising since top Bank of Canada officials asserted in June that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts had done their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices.                  Investors are  probably squaring up  their positions in the Canadian dollar ahead of Friday's jobs data, Bradley said.     The June employment report will be the last major piece of domestic data before the rate announcement.       The currency traded in a range of C$1.2924 to C$1.2984. It touched on Tuesday its strongest since September at C$1.2912.     Still, foreign exchange strategists expect the loonie to weaken over the coming months as the recent rally driven by expectations for higher rates runs out of steam and lower oil prices weigh.                  Separate domestic data showed that the value of Canadian building permits issued in May jumped 8.9 percent on plans for more construction of residential buildings, particularly in the red-hot market of Ontario.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds, pressured by the prospect of hawkish global central bank policy.                  The two-year            fell 2 Canadian cents to yield 1.142 percent and the 10-year             declined 36 Canadian cents to yield 1.834 percent.     The two-year yield touched its highest since September 2014 at 1.159 percent.

Ireland has engaged on a major lobbying campaign during the past year to try to convince companies with large bases in the United Kingdom to consider moving some of their staff to Ireland to maintain access to the European Union's single market. The head of Frankfurt's campaign to promote the city to banks since Britain voted to leave the EU told Reuters in May  he expected the five largest U.S. investment banks to move staff to more than one EU location with around 1,000 going to Frankfurt and possibly more to Dublin.

The attack occurred in al-Awamiya, located in the oil-producing Eastern Province, a flashpoint between the Sunni Muslim government and minority Shi'ites complaining of discrimination. A rocket-propelled grenade attack in the same old part of the city, al-Musawara, killed a soldier and wounded three others two days ago. Saudi authorities have been bulldozing al-Musawara, a small part of the town with narrow streets which date back more than 200 years, to make way for a new project. Local officials say wanted militants believed to be behind attacks on security forces have been using the narrow streets to escape arrest. Saudi Shi'ites complain of discrimination by the government, a charge that authorities deny, and have carried out protests for more rights for the last several years. Demonstrations and attacks have both become more frequent since Nimr al-Nimr, a Shi'ite cleric convicted of involvement in violence, was executed a year ago.

Regulators are looking to rein in risky lending amid fears of housing bubbles in the cities of Toronto and Vancouver and are concerned that the loans, which enable desperate homebuyers to borrow up to 90 percent of a property's value, could turn bad if prices begin to retreat. Problems at lender Home Capital Group, which has seen depositors withdraw 95 percent of funds from high-interest savings accounts, have exacerbated concerns about whether mortgage underwriting standards in Canada are stringent enough. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) on Thursday said it is considering  expressly prohibiting co-lending arrangements that are designed, or appear to be designed, to circumvent regulatory requirements.  It is asking for feedback from interested parties and the wider public before Aug. 17, and said it will finalize the guidelines and set an effective date for implementation later in 2017. Reuters reported in January that regulated mortgage providers were teaming up with unregulated rivals called Mortgage Investment Corporations (MICs), which pool money from wealthy individuals, to get around rules limiting how much mortgage providers can lend against a property. In an interview with Reuters in February, Carolyn Rogers, assistant superintendent at OSFI, warned lenders against such activity. The government does not track bundling, and the practice is sometimes carried out in a discreet fashion, with lenders working directly with the MICs or referring mortgage brokers to them to work out a loan with a borrower. But Finance Ministry data shows that the share of unregulated lenders had shot to 12.5 percent of Canada's C$1.6 trillion mortgage market in 2015, up from 6.6 percent in 2007. Home Capital Group, which last month agreed to a C$2 billion loan from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, and Equitable Group, are two listed mortgage providers that have told Reuters they participate in bundled lending. Equitable's Chief Executive Andrew Moor said in an interview on Thursday that 10 percent of the company's new mortgage originations involved co-lending arrangements, which he said were used as a  risk management tool.  Moor said he did not expect all that business to be lost and expects homebuyers will find another way to make a downpayment.  People may be forced to sell an asset they otherwise wouldn't choose to sell to come up with a bigger downpayment. It's hard to know what impact it will have on our business but it's not in double-digits,  he said. Moor said he would consult with OSFI but was expecting the proposal will be implemented.  A lot of these changes seem to be unfavorable for people that are self-employed or new to Canada who might otherwise have a challenge getting a mortgage. The other consequences of actions like this need to be understood,  he added. In an emailed statement, Home Capital said it had discontinued its bundle program, through which it referred clients to approved secondary lenders, earlier this year. Shares in Home Capital closed down 5.9 percent while Equitable closed down 0.3 percent. Another alternative lender, Street Capital, closed down 9.8 percent. Latest Measures by Govt Bundled or co-lending agreements with an unregulated entity can enable lenders to offer combined mortgages worth up to 90 percent of a property's value. Under federal rules, regulated lenders in Canada are not allowed to lend more than 65 percent of the value of a home to borrowers with bad or nonexistent credit records. They also cannot lend more than 80 percent of a property's value - even to borrowers with solid credit - without obtaining government-backed insurance. Under rules rolled out last October, that insurance requires the banks to run income stress tests on borrowers. Canadian authorities have said bundling represents a small portion of the mortgage market. However, mortgage brokers say the arrangements have proliferated as Canadian regulators tighten lending standards to shield borrowers in case a decade-long housing boom goes bust. The regulator also proposed rules on Thursday requiring a stress test for all uninsured mortgages and that the maximum amounts lent out against a property's value are adjusted for local market conditions. The proposals are the latest in a series of measures implemented by Canadian authorities over the past 12 months amid concerns about housing market bubbles. The Ontario government introduced measures in April to try to cool the housing market in Toronto, including a foreign buyers tax.

Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims rose for the third straight week, climbing to 248,000 and topping the 243,000 expected.  While the data still indicates a tight labor market, the reports hint at a soft monthly nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes hiring in both the public and private sectors.  The softer data comes on the heels of Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting, which showed policymakers were increasingly split on the inflation outlook and how it might affect the pace of interest rate increases.  Those two factors helped push yields on U.S. Treasuries US10YT=RR higher and dampened the attractiveness of equities.

Iraqi forces backed by the United States have pushed Islamic State into a 250-square-metre strip of territory along the Tigris River, prompting fighters to ramp up suicide bomb attacks, commanders said. More than eight months of warfare have displaced 900,000 residents - about half the city's pre-war population - and killed thousands of civilians. The destruction is far greater than expected and is likely to cost billions of dollars to fix, according to the United Nations. Images taken a week before the offensive began on June 18 showed damage to 2,589 structures with 153 destroyed. The Iraqi military and the U.S.-led coalition backing it pounded the city for months with air strikes and artillery before the onset of the ground offensive in October. Islamic State also may have destroyed some buildings. Five days later, as bombardment intensified, another 1,451 buildings had been damaged, including 43 more destroyed homes, according to the imagery documented by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. Destroyed building and cars in the Old City.Alaa Al-MarjaniIn the first 12 days of fighting inside the Old City, in which Islamic State deployed dozens of suicide bombers, a further 1,496 structures were damaged, with 294 more destroyed. More damage is expected before the fighting ends. Islamic State rigged the historic Grand al-Nuri Mosque with explosives and razed it to the ground a week ago. The Old City along with 17 July district and areas around Mosul airport are the most heavily affected parts of the city, the U.N. has said. In some of the most damaged areas of the Old City, such as Ammu Baqqal, Bab al-Tub and the Bazaar, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage. A statement with the maps called the analysis preliminary and said it had not been validated in the field. The dense construction of that part of the city, it said, meant the destruction might be underestimated. The cash-strapped Baghdad government is expected to appeal to international donors to help rebuild Mosul. The U.N. is working with local authorities on plans to rebuild health, water and energy infrastructure.

I cannot say I have finished and not know what the market access for beef and ethanol will be like,  said Ronaldo Costa Filho, Brazil's chief negotiator in the talks. The EU and Japan on Thursday reached a  political agreement  on a free trade deal, and officials insisted the key snags have been overcome for the deal to go into effect early in 2019. A deal with the EU would be Mercosur's first large trade deal, though the bloc scheduled talks with other countries. The EU has eyes on access to public contracts, with the market in Brazil alone worth nearly 150 billion euros ($170 billion), though in return Mercosur will want access to EU agricultural markets such as beef and sugar and derivatives such as ethanol.  Ethanol is essential. I cannot go back home and say 'tough luck',  Costa-Filho told a press briefing in Brussels. With Britain leaving the European Union and not benefiting from the deal, Costa-Filho added that Mercosur's door was  wide open  for Britain to seek a separate deal with the South-American bloc.

Those signs were also evident in another report on Thursday showing growth in services industry employment slowing in June even as the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, continued to expand at a healthy clip.  The moderation in job gains likely reflects difficulties by employers finding suitable workers amid an unemployment rate  that is at a 16-year low. Even so, the labor market remains strong and tightening conditions could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year.   The slowdown in hiring, in our view, is a function of the difficulty in hiring workers,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  Companies remain very reluctant to lay off workers and this is a continued sign of the tightness of the labor market.    The ADP National Employment Report showed private sector payrolls increased by 158,000 jobs last month, stepping down from the 230,000 positions created in May and below economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000. The report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.  While the ADP report has a spotty record predicting non-farm payrolls, June's modest job gains together with the modest rise in first-time applications for jobless benefits and cooling services sector employment pose a downside risk to the government's June jobs report. According to a Reuters survey of economists, non-farm payrolls likely increased by 179,000 last month after May's 138,000 gain. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.3 percent.  Related CoverageU.S. service sector growth accelerates in June: ISMThe dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the data as did prices for U.S. Treasuries. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended July 1. It was the third straight weekly increase in claims. Tight Labor Market The rise in claims last week likely reflected automakers' closing of assembly plants for the annual summer retooling. Still, it was the 122nd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.  FILE PHOTO - A man holds his briefcase while waiting in line during a job fair in Melville, New York July 19, 2012.Shannon StapletonThat is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low. Unadjusted claims for Michigan, a hub for auto production,  increased 1,159 last week. Automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling at the start of July, which tends to push up claims. Applications are likely to remain elevated as some companies like General Motors embark on extended summer shutdowns to deal will slower sales, which have led to an inventory bloat. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported on Monday that auto sales fell in June for a fourth straight month. Even before the annual summer plant closures, automakers have been laying off workers in response to the softening demand. Slideshow (2 Images) As the recovery has progressed and pent-up demand for autos has likely been filled, the high levels of existing inventories and softening demand are likely to lead some automakers to shut down for longer than the normal one to two weeks,  said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. A third report from the Institute for Supply Management showed its non-manufacturing sector index rose half a point to a reading of 57.4 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sector. Industries reported an increase in new orders, but said employment growth had slowed.     The construction industry described the labor market as continuing to be  constrained,  and said low unemployment in most regions was  making hiring difficult on all phases of the construction supply chain.   The services sector strength was also echoed by another survey on Thursday. The IHS Markit's services sector activity index rose to a reading of 54.2 last month from 53.6 in May, marking a third month of accelerated growth in activity. A report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit fell 2.3 percent to $46.5 billion in May. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit narrowed to $62.8 billion from $63.8 billion in April. Real goods exports surged to an all-time high in May, propelled by record high petroleum exports. Still, the real trade deficit averaged $63.3 billion in April and May, above the first quarter's average of $62.2 billion. That suggests trade will be a drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter after contributing 0.23 percentage point to the economy's 1.4 percent annualized growth pace in the first three months of the year. The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered its second-quarter GDP forecast to a 2.7 percent rate from 3.0 percent earlier.

A high-octane clash between Del Potro and three-times champion Novak Djokovic looked likely in the third round, stoking memories of their epic 2013 semi-final, but Latvian Gulbis had other ideas. He won 6-4 6-4 7-6(3). The 28-year-old Latvian has struggled with wrist and shoulder injuries since reaching the 2014 French Open semi-finals, losing to Djokovic, and dropped to 589 in the world rankings on Monday. Arriving at Wimbledon on a protected ranking of 99, Gulbis had won only two matches all year at any level. But he backed up his first-round win over Victor Estrella Burgos, in which he dropped four games, with a superb performance against 29th seed Del Potro, another player plagued by injuries in recent years. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 6, 2017   Argentina’s Juan Martin Del Potro waves as he walks off court after losing his second round match against Latvia’s Ernests GulbisToby Melville It's very satisfying. I found out yesterday that it was my first win in 13 months at Tour level in a main draw,  said Gulbis.  I won one Challenger (level) match and I won one qualifier in Rotterdam. It's been a long time.  Del Potro was not surprised by Gulbis' level. Slideshow (2 Images) Last year I was 1,000 in the world and nobody believed in that ranking either,  the former U.S. Open champion, who has battled back from several wrist surgeries, said.  I know how good Ernests is on grass, and if he has a good day he can beat all the guys.  Gulbis said he was relishing taking on Serbian second seed Djokovic, who has won three Wimbledon titles.  I had nothing to lose today and I'm going to have even less to lose next match. Maybe I'll play even better,  he said.

Researchers found that young women were nearly six times more likely to have irregular menstrual cycles after a concussion, compared to young women who were treated for non-head-related injuries. After a concussion, women should talk to their healthcare providers about the increased risk, said senior author Anthony Kontos, of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Medicine Concussion Program. It's important, he added,  for care providers to be concerned about menstrual patterns and encouraging women to track that after their injury.  Irregular menstrual cycles may disrupt the body's hormones and lead to delayed body development in young women, Kontos told Reuters Health. Hormone disruption can also lead to poor bone health. Concussions result from a hit or blow to the head that causes the brain to move back and forth or twist inside a person's skull, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  A study last year by the Seattle Sports Concussion Research Collaborative estimated that up to 1.9 million children in the U.S. experience a sports-related concussion each year. Girls are also known to have a more difficult concussion recovery than buys, Kontos and his colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics. Hormone disorders are known to occur after traumatic brain injuries, they add. Some research has suggested menstrual disorders are more common after those types of injuries, too. For the new study, the researchers recruited 68 girls and women, ages 12 to 21, who were recovering from concussions. The participants received a text message every Sunday night for about four months linking to a survey that asked about their menstrual cycle. They were asked about bleeding, new injuries, possibly pregnancies and birth control. Sixty-one young women with non-head-related injuries were also surveyed every week. About 24 percent of concussion patients had at least two abnormal menstrual cycles during follow-up, compared to 5 percent of patients with other types of injuries. Kontos said concussions might increase the risk of irregular menstrual cycles by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, a group of hormone-emitting glands that often act in concert. Dr. Jeffrey Bazarian, an emergency physician and brain injury expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, told Reuters Health a concussion could interfere with the pituitary gland in the center of the brain.  It’s possible that this also happens to males and the question is how does it effect them,  said Bazarian, who was not involved in the new study. The researchers can't yet explain their findings, however. Nor can the study prove concussions actually cause abnormal menstruation. Kontos also said it's unclear whether the increased risk of abnormal menstrual patterns lasts beyond four months.  We don’t know beyond that,  he said.  It’s one of the studies we’d like to do.

Diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus have failed since the island was riven in a 1974 Turkish army invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.  But factors such as discovery of gas in the area could increase pressure - domestic and international - for a deal. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres flew into the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana, where Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci have been meeting. He was due to leave for the G20 summit on Friday morning, opening only a narrow window for what might be a  final push .  The day is almost over. Let’s see what the night will bring,  Akinci told reporters as the leaders moved to a working dinner, which is expected to be followed by more talks.  Negotiations are continuing, and I want to say one thing; cool-headedness and patience is required,  Anastasiades said. Related CoverageU.S. backs effort to reach Cyprus reunification deal: White HouseGreek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said the Greek side had done all it could to find a solution, rescuing the talks from collapsing three times.  It’s a very difficult exercise,  he said. Earlier in the day, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence rang the rival Cypriot leaders to underscore U.S. support, the White House said in a statement.  The Vice President urged President Anastasiades and Mr. Akinci to seize this historic opportunity to reunify the island and expressed his confidence in both leaders' ability to secure a settlement that would reunify Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation,  the statement said. Recent major gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean have refocused attempts to end the conflict, partly because the basin could hold sufficient to wean Europe off reliance on Russian gas, but also because of overlapping territorial claims.  Guarantor Rights Greek Cypriots recently indicated they would go ahead with plans for gas exploration, despite opposition from Turkey. One diplomatic source said Turkey might be willing to rethink its role on guarantor rights. Turkey, Greece and Britain are guarantor powers of Cyprus in an independence treaty which granted the former colony independence in 1960.  That treaty gives them intervention rights to restore constitutional order. Turkey has about 30,000 troops in northern Cyprus, a holdover from the 1974 invasion. One diplomat at the talks said that while there were signs Turkey might be willing to reconsider its intervention rights, it did not appear to waver on the residual presence of Turkish troops on the island after a settlement, a sticking point for the Greek side which wants assurances of their full withdrawal. A  sunset  clause for a full withdrawal of Turkish troops or a further review of whether they are required in Cyprus after a given period of time would be the key bargaining issues, this diplomat said. Greek Cypriots had previously objected to Turkish Cypriot demands for a rotating presidency, but another source said they had indicated readiness to discuss such an arrangement under conditions.  Any agreement would have to go to separate referendums in the Greek and Turkish parts of the island, which each have their deeply-rooted sensitivities born of past communal conflicts.  Negotiators must agree what powers would be held by two probably largely autonomous zones and which would be ceded to any central administration.

German defense officials have said they want a low-risk heavy-lift helicopter that already exists, which means the likely supplier will be one of two U.S. firms - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) with its CH-53K, or Boeing Co (BA.N) with its CH-47 Chinook. Airbus on Wednesday said choosing German firms to manage and service the new helicopters would secure German jobs, speed certification and ensure German sovereignty. Any other decision would harm the German helicopter industry, it said. A spokesman for the ministry said Germany had no “buy German” requirement for helicopters, only key technologies such as encryption.  Competition is a very important factor in this case,  he said.  There won't be any free passes for anyone.  Airbus, MTU Aero Engines and six other firms on Wednesday announced at a helicopter conference in northern Germany that they had signed a partnership agreement to push for a big German role in managing the new helicopter. Airbus, which currently services nearly all German military aircraft, and the other companies, urged Berlin to award separate contracts for buying and servicing the helicopters. The defense ministry said it would decide this summer how to structure the deal and a  request for proposals  would likely go out to industry next year. But it said its general preference would be to deal with one lead contractor. A second source said the decision was expected this month, but it could become a political football ahead of the Sept. 24 national election, given the jobs at stake. Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky helicopter unit said it was finalizing  exclusive relationships  with several German companies, but did not name them. Nathalie Previte, vice president of strategy and business development for Sikorsky, said the company's goal was to sign agreements with German firms that would be  strategic partners in the areas of sustainment and aircraft content.  Boeing already has close ties to over 100 companies in Germany as part of its global commercial and military supply chain, and those could grow if Boeing wins the competition, David Koopersmith, who heads Boeing's vertical lift programs, told Reuters at the conference. Boeing last month awarded German firm COTESA GmbH a five-year contract to manufacture key components for the Chinook heavy-lift helicopter. Melanie Wolf, a spokeswoman for MTU, said her company wanted to support the German aerospace industry.  We want to maintain technology competencies in Germany, but for that we need German industry and orders for that industry,  Wolf said.

The American also suggested the calendar should feature an updated 'Asian Tour' grouping the key races in the region -- Japan, Singapore, China and other venues to be determined such as Thailand.  The grand prix in Shanghai is already well established, but we should explore the possibility of a race in another major city, such as Beijing, or a street race in a city like Wuxi, a place that’s growing ambitiously and enormously,  Brown wrote on a Linkedin Pulse blog.  I also think the Shanghai Grand Prix, which is held at one of the most impressive and opulent bespoke racetracks in the world, characterizes Formula One as being very exclusive and expensive.  Whereas I feel that a Chinese city race would underscore the new values that we want the sport to inhabit – that it’s for the people, that it has a real energy, that it represents a fantastic way for brands to present themselves...,  he continued. Formula's One new owners Liberty Media see China as a key growth area and this week announced a partnership with sports marketing agency Lagardere to secure strategic partners. The current calendar features China, Japan and Singapore with Malaysia departing after this season. The Chinese and Singapore races are subject to the finalizing of contracts, however. Plans for Thailand to host a Formula One night race in 2015 foundered, after an agreement in principle, when a law was introduced banning racing in the historic area of Bangkok.  Brown also suggested the start times of some traditional races could be tweaked for an Asian audience, just as many of the long-haul races are scheduled for the European early afternoon.  One of the criticisms I hear from fans in places like China and Japan is that the races are always shown in the middle of the night (if at all), so the sport tends only really to gather a hardcore and dedicated fan base,  he said.

German defense officials have said they want a low-risk heavy-lift helicopter that already exists, which means the likely supplier will be one of two U.S. firms - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) with its CH-53K, or Boeing Co (BA.N) with its CH-47 Chinook. Airbus on Wednesday said choosing German firms to manage and service the new helicopters would secure German jobs, speed certification and ensure German sovereignty. Any other decision would harm the German helicopter industry, it said. A spokesman for the ministry said Germany had no “buy German” requirement for helicopters, only key technologies such as encryption.  Competition is a very important factor in this case,  he said.  There won't be any free passes for anyone.  Airbus, MTU Aero Engines and six other firms on Wednesday announced at a helicopter conference in northern Germany that they had signed a partnership agreement to push for a big German role in managing the new helicopter. Airbus, which currently services nearly all German military aircraft, and the other companies, urged Berlin to award separate contracts for buying and servicing the helicopters. The defense ministry said it would decide this summer how to structure the deal and a  request for proposals  would likely go out to industry next year. But it said its general preference would be to deal with one lead contractor. A second source said the decision was expected this month, but it could become a political football ahead of the Sept. 24 national election, given the jobs at stake. Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky helicopter unit said it was finalizing  exclusive relationships  with several German companies, but did not name them. Nathalie Previte, vice president of strategy and business development for Sikorsky, said the company's goal was to sign agreements with German firms that would be  strategic partners in the areas of sustainment and aircraft content.  Boeing already has close ties to over 100 companies in Germany as part of its global commercial and military supply chain, and those could grow if Boeing wins the competition, David Koopersmith, who heads Boeing's vertical lift programs, told Reuters at the conference. Boeing last month awarded German firm COTESA GmbH a five-year contract to manufacture key components for the Chinook heavy-lift helicopter. Melanie Wolf, a spokeswoman for MTU, said her company wanted to support the German aerospace industry.  We want to maintain technology competencies in Germany, but for that we need German industry and orders for that industry,  Wolf said.

The order is the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump to make it easier to drill and mine on federal land, which Zinke said is a source of income for the government. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is supposed to take 30 days to review applications for permits to drill but Zinke said the average time for processing in 2016 was 257 days.  I'm directing the BLM to conduct quarterly lease sales and address these permitting issues,  Zinke said in a statement.  We are also looking at opportunities to bring support to our front line offices who are facing the brunt of this workload.  There were 2,802 permit applications pending as of Jan. 31, with three quarters of them filed in five field offices in Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota and New Mexico. On a call with reporters, Zinke did not say how long this streamlining process would take.  This is not going to be done overnight. What we don’t want is unintended consequences,  he said. Environmental groups criticized the announcement and said that companies have already leased vast amounts of public lands but have held off on drilling due to record low oil prices.  With historically low gas prices, these companies aren’t using millions of acres of leases they already have, so there’s no reason to hand over even more,” said Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project. The group pointed to Interior Department data that showed that oil production on federal land increased by 77 percent between 2008 and 2015. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, a lobby group for independent drillers, welcomed the announcement, which came a week after Zinke met with its president, Barry Russell.  Reinstating quarterly lease sales is vital as independent producers consider future American energy opportunities on federal lands,  said Dan Naatz, the group's head of government relations.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-permit-idUSL1N1JX1NB"},

In addition, Fitch has upgraded Quechan's approximately $30 million in outstanding tribal economic development bonds (TED bonds) to 'BB-/RR2' and approximately $30 million in governmental project bonds (general obligation bonds) to 'B/RR4'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Positive. The tribe also has a credit facility that ranks pari passu to the TED bonds, which Fitch does not rate, that is comprised of a $102 million term loan and a $5 million revolver. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's upgrade of Quechan's IDR to 'B' reflects the tribe's prudent financial policies, consistent deleveraging, and more stable operating profile. Quechan has experienced material deleveraging over the last five years, driven primarily by debt paydown vis-a-vis the heavy amortization of the term loan. Quechan's casino enterprise's debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/debt service ratios for the latest 12-month (LTM) period ending March 31, 2017 are 2.3x and 2.1x, respectively, or 3.0x and 1.9x when including the tribe's GO bonds. This is an improvement from leverage and coverage, including the GO bonds, of 4.2x and 1.5x, respectively, at the end of FY2014 (FY ends Dec. 31). Going forward, Fitch believes a relatively stable operating environment and the adjustment of per capita distributions will allow for a build-up of tribal cash reserves, consistent with the tribe's stated financial policies. Fitch projects leverage inclusive of all tribal debt declining to low-2xs by the end of 2019, despite our projection of flat revenue growth after 2017. The operating environment in the Yuma, AZ metropolitan statistical area (MSA) remains challenging, though unemployment has been slowly declining. Quechan's term loan amortizes by $11 million in FY2017 with a bullet maturity in FY2018. The TED bond and GO bonds amortize by roughly $2 million per year beginning FY2017 and FY2018, respectively. The GO bonds become callable on Dec. 1, 2017 at 102% and a comprehensive refinancing of the term loan and GO bonds could increase free cash flow through reduced annual debt service. In addition, Fitch forecasts improved EBITDA generation through the forecast period as a result of the tribe's adjusted revenue share payments to the state of California. The tribe has experienced leadership turnover during the past two years with new Presidents, Vice Presidents and tribal council members. Despite the turnover, the new leadership remains committed to continuing the previous leadership's prudent fiscal policies regarding liquidity and government spending. Fitch will continue to monitor the tribal council's policies and the potential for political turnover is reflected in the current IDR. Fitch expects unrestricted cash levels at the tribal government to increase in 2017 aided by the recent adjustment of per capita payments. The tribe intends to maintain its' cash balances at an amount that will cover 25% of annual expenditures. Fitch views the build-up of tribal reserves as a positive credit factor. TRANSACTION RATINGS Fitch views prospects for the TED bonds in terms of probability of default and recovery in case of default as distinctly better relative to the GO bonds. This is because the TED bonds are backed by casino revenues, whereas the GO bonds are not. The revenue pledge is strengthened by a trustee-controlled flow of funds that ensures the bond debt service is paid prior to any tribal distribution. The flow of funds is sprung if coverage falls below 1.65x. As of March 31, 2017, coverage of debt service was at 2.1x. This mechanism allows Fitch to partially segregate the credit risk of the casino operations from the tribe, which has a weaker credit profile. (There are no cross default provisions between casino revenue backed debt and the GO bonds). However, the tribal credit profile is still heavily factored into the TED bond ratings, since significant distress on the tribal side may potentially force the TED bondholders or lenders to make concessions to allow the tribe to maintain adequate liquidity and critical governmental services. The tribe does maintain a debt service reserve fund for the benefit of the GO bonds. DERIVATION SUMMARY Quechan's 'B' IDR reflects a moderate leverage profile, relatively stable operating trends, and the tribe's maintenance of prudent fiscal policies. Steady cash flow generation at the casino enterprise level has allowed for meaningful debt paydown since 2013. The adjustment of per capita payments in 2017 with the intention to build up tribal cash reserves to cover 25% of annual expenditures is also favorable for the credit profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --1% revenue growth in 2017 due to a strong first quarter, with flat growth thereafter; --EBITDA margins grow slightly in 2017 after realizing full-year benefit of the change in revenue share payments to the state of California; --Tribal distribution levels consistent with the past few years and relatively low amounts of casino capital expenditures; --The tribe refinances its credit facility and GO bonds by the end of 2017. Cash balances build at the tribal level after per capita payments are adjusted in 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Positive rating action could be considered if the tribe maintains leverage below 2x; if tribal cash reserves increase and are maintained through-the-cycle at the tribe's stated goal of providing for 25% of annual governmental expenditures; and Yuma area's economic conditions continue to improve or remain stable. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Casino level debt/EBITDA increasing and remaining above 3x and 3.5 including the GO bonds; --A substantial decrease in tribal reserves or a change of financial policies to maintain lower cash reserves; --The tribe failing to maintain prudent fiscal management policies (i.e. adjusting governmental spending to match casino distributions and other revenue sources). CRITERIA VARIATION Fitch utilizes the 'Recovery Ratings and Notching Criteria for Non-Financial Corporate Issuers' criteria to derive Quechan's transaction specific ratings. Fitch is identifying a variation of this criteria substantiated by the unique recovery prospects for the GO bonds, in which the GO bonds are adjusted to be on par with the IDR. LIQUIDITY Liquidity is adequate with the unrestricted cash at the tribal level commensurate with the size of the tribe and its governmental budget, though this is set to improve over the next few years. Available liquidity on the casino side is minimal but adequate for operating needs when taking into account the healthy free cash flow (FCF) at the casino enterprise before distributions to the tribe, as well as the credit facility covenants that limit tribal distributions based on cash flow. Quechan's nearest maturity is in 2018 for the term loan, which Fitch expects to be refinanced. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has taken the following rating actions: Quechan Indian Tribe --Long-Term IDR upgraded to 'B' from 'B-'; Outlook revised to Stable from Positive; --Tribal economic development bonds upgraded to 'BB-/RR2' from 'B+/RR2'; --Governmental project bonds upgraded to 'B/RR4' from 'B-/RR4'.

The government rescinded the contract for the proposed 1,134-kilometer (705-mile) pipeline in January after the consortium led by Odebrecht missed a financing deadline amid a growing graft scandal. Proinversion director Alvaro Quijandria said the project's design might change following a feasibility study under way now based on the original plan. The next operator will have the option of buying the assets that the Odebrecht consortium had invested in the project, the value of which will be determined by an audit that has not yet started, said Quijandria. The Odebrecht consortium said the pipeline was about a third finished when work on it stopped in mid 2016. Peruvian builder Grana y Montero , Odebrecht's junior partner on the project, has said that the consortium invested about $2 billion in the project. Odebrecht once played a large role in building Peru's public work projects but the company has been barred from bidding on new contracts since acknowledging late last year that it distributed millions of dollars in bribes across Latin America.  We think we can diversify the origin of investments a bit,  Quijandria said on the sidelines of an auction for a project to dredge and maintain a navigable waterway in the Amazon. The $95 million waterway project was awarded to a consortium formed by a subsidiary of China's state-run Power Construction Corporation of China and Peruvian builder Construccion y Administracion SA.

The DA, the political home of many white South Africans, accused Bell Pottinger of working to  divide and conquer the South African public by exploiting racial tensions in a bid to keep Jacob Zuma and the ANC in power.  The basis of its allegations were leaked emails that suggested Bell Pottinger worked with Duduzane Zuma to create a  narrative that grabs the attention of the grassroots population .

The order is the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump to make it easier to drill and mine on federal land, which Zinke said is a source of income for the government. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is supposed to take 30 days to review applications for permits to drill but Zinke said the average time for processing in 2016 was 257 days.  I'm directing the BLM to conduct quarterly lease sales and address these permitting issues,  Zinke said in a statement.  We are also looking at opportunities to bring support to our front line offices who are facing the brunt of this workload.  There were 2,802 permit applications pending as of Jan. 31, with three quarters of them filed in five field offices in Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota and New Mexico. On a call with reporters, Zinke did not say how long this streamlining process would take.  This is not going to be done overnight. What we don’t want is unintended consequences,  he said. Environmental groups criticized the announcement and said that companies have already leased vast amounts of public lands but have held off on drilling due to record low oil prices.  With historically low gas prices, these companies aren’t using millions of acres of leases they already have, so there’s no reason to hand over even more,” said Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project. The group pointed to Interior Department data that showed that oil production on federal land increased by 77 percent between 2008 and 2015. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, a lobby group for independent drillers, welcomed the announcement, which came a week after Zinke met with its president, Barry Russell.  Reinstating quarterly lease sales is vital as independent producers consider future American energy opportunities on federal lands,  said Dan Naatz, the group's head of government relations.

In a meeting in June, euro zone finance ministers reached a political deal to disburse 8.5 billion euros of new financial aid to Athens.

I am very convinced that smallish issues will be cleared up by tomorrow afternoon,  a euro zone official said on Thursday.

I'm quite sure that outstanding measures will be judged as having been fulfilled,  the official added. The big outstanding snag was a case involving three former privatization officials from Italy, Spain and Slovakia, who had been charged in Greece with breaches of duty during the sale in 2015 of state properties. Euro zone finance ministers said Athens should grant immunity to the three before fresh loans could be unblocked. Greece dropped the charges against them last week. Euro zone finance ministers will gather on Monday in Brussels for a regular meeting where Greece is not on the agenda, suggesting that pending issues will be solved before the meeting.

The grand prix in Shanghai is already well established, but we should explore the possibility of a race in another major city, such as Beijing, or a street race in a city like Wuxi, a place that’s growing ambitiously and enormously,  Brown wrote on a Linkedin Pulse blog.  I also think the Shanghai Grand Prix, which is held at one of the most impressive and opulent bespoke racetracks in the world, characterizes Formula One as being very exclusive and expensive.  Whereas I feel that a Chinese city race would underscore the new values that we want the sport to inhabit – that it’s for the people, that it has a real energy, that it represents a fantastic way for brands to present themselves...,  he continued. Formula's One new owners Liberty Media see China as a key growth area and this week announced a partnership with sports marketing agency Lagardere to secure strategic partners. The current calendar features China, Japan and Singapore with Malaysia departing after this season. The Chinese and Singapore races are subject to the finalizing of contracts, however. Plans for Thailand to host a Formula One night race in 2015 foundered, after an agreement in principle, when a law was introduced banning racing in the historic area of Bangkok.  Brown also suggested the start times of some traditional races could be tweaked for an Asian audience, just as many of the long-haul races are scheduled for the European early afternoon.  One of the criticisms I hear from fans in places like China and Japan is that the races are always shown in the middle of the night (if at all), so the sport tends only really to gather a hardcore and dedicated fan base,  he said.  Perhaps we need to look at some of the timings of some of the conventional races, and see where there are opportunities to perhaps tweak the schedules so as to create a window of opportunity for our fans in Asia.

Sri Lanka in January last year proposed plans for a new constitution aimed at devolving power and preventing the kind of ethnic tensions that led to the long civil war that ended in 2009 and to strengthen democracy, promote reconciliation and establish a political culture that respects the rule of law. The 1977 constitution, which experts say has given more power to the federal government, is blamed for the civil war which killed more than 100,000 people. The Sirisena administration's move has been welcomed by the international community, who have softened their demands for a tough United Nations-led war crime probe over alleged abuses during the civil war.  But the island nation's Buddhist leaders are opposed to introducing a new constitution, for fear it may reduce their influence among the population of 21 million, about 70 percent of whom are Buddhist.  The president said respected (Buddhist) clergies will be educated, and their opinions and suggestions also will be considered in the event of drafting a new constitution,  President's media office said in a statement after a meeting with the highest Buddhist officials. More than 75 leading monks on Tuesday unanimously declared that there was no need for a new constitution or for any constitutional amendments now, local media reported.  Some opposition members have alleged that the new constitution has been drafted to please some Western nations and to dilute the influence of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The government has rejected such accusations. Rajitha Senaratne, the government spokesman, on Wednesday said President Sirisena was given a mandate for a new constitution at the January 2015 presidential poll.  The monks are totally misinformed,  he told a weekly cabinet press conference.

It's still not my natural surface,  Thiem told Reuters after his win.  But, of course, these victories give me a lot of confidence, also on this surface. For the first time in the third round of Wimbledon is also pretty special,  he added.

Greece needs new loans under its current 86 billion euro ($98 billion) bailout program, the third since 2010, to pay debt due this month. In a meeting in June, euro zone finance ministers reached a political deal to disburse 8.5 billion euros of new financial aid to Athens. But the actual disbursement was linked to some conditions that needed to be fulfilled by Greece.  I am very convinced that smallish issues will be cleared up by tomorrow afternoon,  a euro zone official said on Thursday. On Friday the board of directors of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone bailout fund, will hold a conference call where they are expected to give their green light to the release of funds, the official said.  I'm quite sure that outstanding measures will be judged as having been fulfilled,  the official added. The big outstanding snag was a case involving three former privatization officials from Italy, Spain and Slovakia, who had been charged in Greece with breaches of duty during the sale in 2015 of state properties. Euro zone finance ministers said Athens should grant immunity to the three before fresh loans could be unblocked. Greece dropped the charges against them last week. Euro zone finance ministers will gather on Monday in Brussels for a regular meeting where Greece is not on the agenda, suggesting that pending issues will be solved before the meeting.

Philando Castile, 32, was shot five times during a traffic stop last July in a St. Paul suburb. The incident triggered local protests and fueled debate across the country over the appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. The shooting drew national attention after Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car, live-streamed the bloody aftermath on social media. Dayton, a Democrat, proposed honoring Castile at a news conference on the anniversary of his death.  I abhor the incident that occurred, the tragedy that occurred, befell Mr. Castile,  said Dayton, who was flanked by members of Castile's family.  It's one of the most traumatic, if not the most traumatic events that's happened in my six-and-a-half years.  A Minnesota jury last month declared St. Anthony Police officer Jeronimo Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter. After that, Castile's family reached a $3 million settlement with the city of St. Anthony. Dayton said Minnesota needed to do more to improve police relationships with the community. He also named Castile's uncle, Clarence Castile, to the state's Peace Officer Standards and Training Board.  Dayton's naming recommendation needs approval by the Peace Officer Standards and Training Board to take effect. The board's executive director, Nate Gove, could not immediately be reached for comment. Leaders of groups representing Minnesota police officers could not immediately be reached for comment. The training fund was approved by state lawmakers earlier this year to train police officers working in racially diverse communities.

The metal remained hemmed into a narrow range ahead of key U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday.

Analysts said traders were still grappling with hawkish comments from the heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England last week, which would be negative for safe-haven government bonds.      Those concerns, along with the rising oil prices and traders anticipating that the Fed will begin unwinding its bond holdings later this year, led traders to sell Treasuries even as U.S. June private payrolls data disappointed expectations.       All central banks seem to be more ready to row in the same direction at this point, towards tighter monetary policy,  said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.     Longer-dated yields were last rising the most, with 30-year yields up about five basis points from Wednesday's closing level and set to post their biggest one-day rise in more than two months. Those yields hit a six-week high of 2.923 percent .      Benchmark 10-year yields touched a nearly eight-week high of 2.391 percent before easing from that peak to last stand at 2.373 percent.      While shorter-dated yields were not up as much as long-dated yields, they still hit peaks in early trading with two-year yields hitting a more than eight-year high of 1.435 percent and three-year yields touching a roughly 3-1/2-month high of 1.617 percent.      Minutes from the Fed's June meeting on Wednesday showed that several officials wanted to announce a start to the process of reducing the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities by the end of August but others wanted to wait until later in the year.      Most people would say it's pretty clear the Fed is going to start this whole unwinding of the balance sheet,  said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.  That’s not good news by itself for long-end Treasuries.       U.S. five-year Treasury yields hit a more than three-month high of 1.968 percent while seven-year yields  hit an eight-week high of 2.228 percent.      Analysts said rising oil prices also sent longer-dated yields higher, although yields eased off their highs as oil prices pared gains.

No injuries were reported, no one was arrested and no one was suspected of any crime, officials said. The Massachusetts State Police bomb squad and federal law enforcement officials spent several hours searching the large box truck, with a gate to the base closed and parts of the base evacuated as the search went on.  Given the times we live in, we operate in an abundance of caution,  Massachusetts State Police Major Fran Leahy told a news conference after the site was cleared.

Some shipping materials from the vehicle were taken to the State Police crime lab for further study, Leahy said. The truck was transporting the possessions of a base staffer who had recently moved into a new job, officials said. About 10,000 people, including military staff and civilians, work at the 846-acre (342-hectare) site in Bedford, Massachusetts, which is about 15 miles (24 km) northwest of Boston and houses units overseeing acquisitions, cyber security and some nuclear operations.

People with at least three unfavorable health stats from a list that includes large waist size, high blood pressure or triglycerides, high blood sugar or low “good” cholesterol are said to have metabolic syndrome, and are at increased risk of going on to develop diabetes, heart disease or both. But researchers found that when generally healthy people did strength-building exercise for less than an hour a week they had 29 percent lower odds of developing metabolic syndrome than their peers who did no resistance exercise. “You already get health benefits with even a low amount of resistance exercise per week, which is good news for people with a very busy lifestyle,” said lead author Esmee Bakker of Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.  An estimated one-third of U.S. adults have metabolic syndrome, the authors write in Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Although previous studies have reported how aerobic exercise, such as running, walking and swimming, reduce metabolic syndrome, few studies have looked at resistance exercise alone. The U.S. government’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggest that adults should do “muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week” and aerobic exercise 150 or more minutes each week. “A modest amount of resistance exercise, such as two 30-minute sessions per week, has beneficial effects,” Bakker told Reuters Health by email. “We think that resistance exercise, in addition to aerobic exercise, should be included in standard medical recommendations to prevent metabolic syndrome.” Bakker and colleagues analyzed data on more than 7,400 people who participated in medical examinations at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas, between 1987 and 2006. They ranged in age from mid-30s to mid-50s at the time of their examinations. The research team found that 1,147 participants, or 15 percent, had developed metabolic syndrome during the follow-up period. Meeting the resistance exercise guideline of two or more days per week reduced risk of metabolic syndrome by 17 percent overall, compared to doing no resistance exercise. Those who met both aerobic and resistance training guidelines had a 25 percent lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome. “This result was independent of other healthy behaviors, such as not smoking,” Bakker said. “It also made little difference if people did resistance exercise only on weekends or spread throughout the week.” Bakker and colleagues plan to study the effect of resistance training on other health outcomes, such as the heart health benefits of a one-year resistance exercise training program. They also want to examine the long-term effects of different types and intensities of strength training on metabolic syndrome. “The real next step is to see how we can get people to exercise,” said Paul Thompson of the University of Connecticut in Hartford, who wasn’t involved with the study. “We can talk about the right dose and intensity, but it’s clear that in most studies, doing something is better than nothing,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Most people do nothing, and the key is to get them to do anything.” One limitation of the study is that it relies on self-reported survey data, which could bias the results. Thompson also cautions that some patients of the Dallas clinic are relatively more affluent than the rest of the country, so the results might not apply more generally. “The increasing American girth has increased metabolic syndrome, which leads to insulin resistance and makes it harder for insulin to work,” he noted.  Thompson is studying how exercise affects people who have a tendency toward metabolic syndrome and ways they can work against a genetic disposition toward diabetes and hypertension, for example. “Everybody should have some exercise,” he said. “Play with the dog or grandkids, do yard work or go for a walk. Just do something for 30 minutes every day.” SOURCE: mayocl.in/2sKzwK5 Mayo Clinic Proceedings, online June 14, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-metabolicsyndrome-resistance-f-idUSKBN19R2RJ"},

Trump,Scott Pruitt,USA,ENVIRONMENT/LAWSUIT,PESTICIDE,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six state prosecutors are seeking to join a lawsuit to force the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos from use on U.S.-grown fruits and vegetables, according to court papers filed on Thursday. Democratic attorneys general for New York, Maryland, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia filed a motion to intervene in a case environmental and social advocacy groups brought in a federal appeals court on June 5. It challenges EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's March 29 decision not to ban chlorpyrifos from U.S. foods. The action by the prosecutors adds momentum to a push by environmental groups to broadly oppose Pruitt and U.S. President Donald Trump in their stated aim to loosen U.S. environmental regulations.  It is EPA's responsibility to protect Americans from unsafe chlorpyrifos residues on food because of the potential neurodevelopmental and other adverse health effects caused by exposure,  the prosecutors wrote in their filing.  Citizens of the proposed state intervenors consume foods grown throughout the United States and the world that contain chlorpyrifos residues.  The EPA has previously said chlorpyrifos, which is sold under a range of brandnames, did not meet safety standards laid out by a 1938 U.S. law, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. An EPA spokesman declined to comment on Thursday's filing. The prosecutors' move is the latest in a series of administrative and courtroom actions against the pesticide that began long before Trump took office. In 2007, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to revoke its tolerance of chlorpyrifos residues on food. Over the next nine years, the groups obtained a series of court decisions forcing action by the EPA, which said in 2015 it was  unable to conclude that the risk from aggregate exposure  to the pesticide was safe. Environmental groups have argued humans are exposed to harmful elements in chlorpyrifos not only by eating food containing residues of the pesticide, but also by drinking water contaminated by it. The EPA issued two proposals to ban chlorpyrifos but never produced a final rule, despite being ordered by a court on two separate occasions to take final action on the matter. Pruitt's March administrative order reversed the agency's moves to ban the pesticide, denying the 2007 petition for the ban. The case is League of United Latin American Citizens v.

Related CoverageCycling - Team Sky are getting a free ride on the Tour, says LeMondKittel and Greipel are now tied for Tour stage wins, but Kittel has been looking in ominous form on this Tour and he will be the favourite again for Friday's seventh stage that takes the peloton over 213.5 km through the vineyards from Troyes to Nuits Saint-Georges.  I'm proud of my team, they did a great job because it was a very different finish to Liege,  Kittel said after the 216km ride from Vesoul.  The last kilometre was a little bit freestyle, but I had a good wheel to follow in Demare, and then I had to go on my own from 250m. I feel good at the moment, and for sure I have (the green jersey) in my focus.  In the points classification, Kittel trails Demare (FDJ) by 27 points, after Peter Sagan, who was targeting a sixth consecutive green jersey, was kicked out of the race for sending Mark Cavendish crashing in the finale of the fourth stage. Sagan's team, Bora-Hansgrohe, appealed before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but sport's highest court rejected their request of having the world champion reinstated. Race leader Chris Froome finished safely in the pack to retain the yellow jersey, 12 seconds ahead of his Sky team mate Geraint Thomas with Italian Fabio Aru (Astana).

RBI was due to sell a 15 percent stake in an initial public offering to fulfil a commitment to the Polish regulator, KNF, which demands lenders are listed to ensure better transparency and safety of Poland's banking sector. Raiffeisen pushed last month for the listing to be postponed, arguing there was insufficient demand for a stake in a bank that is forced to set a large amount of capital aside for a portfolio of mortgages denominated in Swiss francs. It also wanted more time for a cost-cutting programme to take effect. But the regulator stuck by its demand that the listing take place, having already granted Raiffeisen a one-year extension last year.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG decided today to suspend the initial public offering of its subsidiary Raiffeisen Bank Polska S.A.,  RBI said in a statement, confirming a Reuters report earlier on Thursday that there were too few buyers.  This was due to an insufficient level of interest in the offer on terms that meet the parameters of RBI's commitment to the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority to float shares of Raiffeisen Bank Polska on the Warsaw Stock Exchange,  it added. The IPO prospectus for Raiffeisen Bank Polska (IPO-RBP.WA), known as Polbank, lists a number of reasons why the listing could be scrapped, including insufficient demand for the shares and an unsatisfactory price. Raiffeisen's chief executive had previously questioned how much demand there would be for the stake. But a Raiffeisen spokeswoman said the bank had attempted the listing in good faith.  We took this IPO very seriously. We spoke to more than 100 investors. We sent more than 350 research reports. We carried out a very detailed investor analysis beforehand. And we completed roadshows in Paris and Warsaw,  the spokeswoman said. Raiffeisen said it was in talks with KNF on the next steps.  RBI has filed a supplement to the issue prospectus, which is still subject to the approval of the Polish regulator. RBI is in discussions with the Polish regulator on how to proceed,  it said. The stake is worth around 950 million zloty  ($256 million) at book value, but investors have demanded a hefty discount due to the bank's low profitability and the mortgage portfolio.  There is a small subscription for 0.6 (to book value). The IPO will likely be suspended or cancelled,  one source said in the afternoon on Thursday, the day on which book-building had been due to close. $1 = 3.7084 zlotys Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko, Marcin Goclowski and Anna Koper in Warsaw and Francois Murphy in Vienna; additional reporting by Francois Murphy in VIENNA; editing by Alexander Smith and David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/raiffeisen-intl-poland-ipo-idUSL8N1JX5KD"},

He's not the only one (who will attack),  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 89 and 90.      Don't judge the first mountain stage. Especially in the first week of racing after four, five, six days, your body has like an adjustment period and some people in the fourth or fifth day have a little low and they come back.      Quintana and Contador lost a little bit of time, Bardet was ready very well though. The hope is that you have riders still very close to him (when the race hits the decisive stages),  he explained.      There is no big time trial for Chris to get that distance so it will open the race a little bit more.      There is always the possibility, however, that Froome will hammer his rivals with one big blow like he did in the ascent to La Pierre Saint Martin in 2015.      Unless there is a one knockout day then it will still be open,  the American said.     I still think it's going to be a good Tour.

Iraqi forces pushing towards the al-Maydan and al-Shareen districts in the northern Iraqi city broke the militants' defenses and have reached within 200 meters (yards) of the riverbank. But they encountered stiff resistance from an estimated few hundred militants lodged among thousands of civilians in the Old City's maze of alleyways, particularly from foreign suicide bombers, Iraqi commanders said. The military has predicted final victory this week after a grinding eight-month assault to oust Islamic State from the once two-million-strong city. Mosul is by far the largest city ruled by Islamic State. It was here, three years ago, that the group declared the founding of its  caliphate  over parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria. Lieutenant General Sami Aridhi of the elite counter-terrorism service said Islamic State fighters were increasingly detonating explosives among civilians fleeing towards security forces and had even resorted to using women suicide bombers.  They have begun to wait for the troops to reach them and then blow themselves up. They can't do any more than that,  he told state television.  They surge forward just to obstruct the troops, not to hold land or retain any other positions because, God willing, their end is clear to everyone and they are convinced that this is their end,  he said. Once Mosul has gone, Islamic State's territory in Iraq will be limited to areas west and south of the city where some tens of thousands of civilians live, and it is expected to keep up asymmetric attacks across the country. Smoke rises from an air strike during fighting with Islamic State militants in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 6, 2017.Ahmed SaadLast 250 Square Meters Iraqi forces have reduced the territory under Islamic State control to 250 square meters, a senior official in the international coalition supporting Iraqi forces told Reuters.  It has been a tough fight but we anticipated that right throughout this campaign because you’re looking at a dispersed, disintegrated and demoralized enemy in those last pockets of Mosul,  said New Zealand Army Brigadier Hugh McAslan. Slideshow (6 Images) Throughout the last couple of weeks, we've seen exploitation of the population and an increase of atrocities against the local population as they look to flee a cruel and brutal occupation.  Air strikes continued to rain down just beyond the frontline on Thursday, and wounded soldiers, some displaying blast wounds, were evacuated. Civilians interviewed on state TV said they had fled al-Maydan district, which is one of a handful of districts along the riverbank still in Islamic State hands. McAslan said it was increasingly difficult to distinguish between fighters and local residents, whom Islamic State had coerced into taking up arms. Prime Minister Haider Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque. Months of grinding urban warfare have displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul, while Iraq's Kurdish leader said on Thursday in a Reuters interview that the Baghdad government had failed to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan.

The meeting of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue will take place in Washington on July 19, and will be the first covering economic and trade issues in a new format for U.S.-China dialogue agreed after a summit between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in April. Trump pledged repeatedly during his election campaign to take a tough stance on Chinese trade practices deemed unfair to the United States, but his rhetoric softened after a friendlier-than-expected summit with Xi. Shortly after their meeting, Trump said he had told Xi that China would get a better trade deal if it worked to rein in North Korea, whose nuclear and missile programs have become an increasing threat to the United States. Lately though, Trump, who is to meet Xi again on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg this week, has appeared increasingly frustrated that China - North Korea's neighbor and main trading partner - has not taken stronger action. North Korea said it tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday and experts said it appeared to be of a type capable of hitting all of Alaska, prompting renewed U.S. calls for global diplomatic action. The United States has said it will propose new United Nations sanctions in response to the test, but it is unclear whether China and Russia will support these. Unlike Washington, neither Moscow nor Beijing have described the missile used in the test as an ICBM.

Democratic attorneys general for New York, Maryland, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia filed a motion to intervene in a case environmental and social advocacy groups brought in a federal appeals court on June 5. It challenges EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's March 29 decision not to ban chlorpyrifos from U.S. foods.  The action by the prosecutors adds momentum to a push by environmental groups to broadly oppose Pruitt and U.S. President Donald Trump in their stated aim to loosen U.S. environmental regulations.   It is EPA's responsibility to protect Americans from unsafe chlorpyrifos residues on food because of the potential neurodevelopmental and other adverse health effects caused by exposure,  the prosecutors wrote in their filing.  Citizens of the proposed state intervenors consume foods grown throughout the United States and the world that contain chlorpyrifos residues.  The EPA has previously said chlorpyrifos, which is sold under a range of brand names, did not meet safety standards laid out by a 1938 U.S. law, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. An EPA spokesman declined to comment on Thursday's filing. The prosecutors' move is the latest in a series of administrative and courtroom actions against the pesticide that began long before Trump took office.  In 2007, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to revoke its tolerance of chlorpyrifos residues on food. Over the next nine years, the groups obtained a series of court decisions forcing action by the EPA, which said in 2015 it was  unable to conclude that the risk from aggregate exposure  to the pesticide was safe. Environmental groups have argued humans are exposed to harmful elements in chlorpyrifos not only by eating food containing residues of the pesticide, but also by drinking water contaminated by it.  The EPA issued two proposals to ban chlorpyrifos but never produced a final rule, despite being ordered by a court on two separate occasions to take final action on the matter. Pruitt's March administrative order reversed the agency's moves to ban the pesticide, denying the 2007 petition for the ban. The case is League of United Latin American Citizens v. Scott Pruitt, U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, 17-71636.

The media baron’s Liberty Interactive is taking full control of HSN in a $2.1 billion deal. Bringing the cable retailer under the same corporate umbrella as his QVC unit makes sense, and investors should end up with something more valuable than a tracking stock. But a complex share swap won’t solve the problems plaguing the two networks. Malone has picked a good time to pounce, tactically. HSN’s stock had fallen by more than 50 percent in the two years through Wednesday, lowering the acquisition cost and making the 29 percent premium attractive to the target’s investors. Liberty is paying the premium to holders of the 62 percent it doesn’t already own, which amounts to roughly $300 million. Even if management achieves only half its targeted $100 million in cost savings, once taxed at 35 percent and capitalized they will more than pay for the deal. Investors seem skeptical of those synergies. QVC A shares, the tracking stock for Liberty Interactive’s cable and online-commerce operations, were down a little more than half a percent on Thursday. The company plans to operate the networks separately, so most of those projected savings may have to come from renegotiating contracts with cable companies. It helps that Malone’s Liberty Broadband is the largest shareholder in the country’s second-largest cable outfit, Charter Communications, but the ability to renegotiate is a guessing game. The deal follows on the heels of Liberty Interactive’s April acquisition of Alaska-based telecom company General Communication. If that’s completed as expected later this year, it will replace the QVC tracking stock with one backed by its assets, making it eligible for inclusion in stock indexes and, hopefully, get a higher multiple from investors. The company will need all the help it can get. Both QVC and HSN face pressure from the changes in shopping habits driven by Amazon and other e-commerce players. Revenue at Liberty Interactive and smaller HSN have effectively flatlined for the past three years, and their profit fell by 26 percent and 30 percent, respectively, last year. Home shopping’s share of the overall U.S. retail market has fallen a quarter since 2011, according to data from Euromonitor. Those facts are likely to be stubbornly resistant to Malone’s complex corporate maneuvering.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Benchmark Treasury yields touched nearly eight-week highs on the prospect of hawkish global central bank policy and as rising oil prices suggested inflationary pressures. Treasury yields helped push Wall Street stocks lower in a holiday week ahead of the second-quarter earnings reporting season. “More than anything you’ve had a fairly good-sized move up on the 10-year Treasury (yield) over a short period. Investors are on a very short term reacting to where yields are at this moment compared with only a week ago,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. Investors also worried that corporate earnings reports would not  surprise as positively as they did in the first quarter,  according to Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, NC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.71 points, or 0.44 percent, to 21,383.46, the S&P; 500 lost 14.63 points, or 0.60 percent, to 2,417.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.22 points, or 0.62 percent, to 6,112.64. Europe's Stoxx 600 index touched its lowest point since April 21 and ended down 0.7 percent MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.38 percent. Some investors were uneasy about geopolitical issues and turned their focus to a summit of G20 nations after this week's test of a long-range missile by North Korea. The dollar pulled back after weaker-than-expected U.S. private jobs data affirmed expectations for a gradual pace for U.S. interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. \ The euro, which hit a session high versus the dollar in late afternoon trading, gained on Thursday after ECB minutes showed that policymakers discussed taking out an  easing bias  at their June 7-8 meeting. The dollar index fell 0.5 percent, with the euro up 0.61 percent to $1.1421. Benchmark 10-year notes was last down 11/32 in price to yield 2.3713 percent, from 2.334 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond was down 31/32 in price to yield 2.9016 percent, from 2.855 percent late on Wednesday.  You’re seeing some liquidation as people are trying to wrap their heads around what the central banks have in mind,  said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. Commodity markets continued to swing. Oil futures rose, making up some of the previous session's losses after U.S. data showed crude oil and gasoline stocks dropped more than expected, yet more analysts cut price forecasts. U.S. crude rose 0.44 percent to $45.33 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.95, up 0.33 percent on the day. Gold pared losses and was last down 0.2 percent at $1,223.87 an ounce. South Africa's rand was down 0.3 percent and Turkey's lira fell 0.4 percent in their second consecutive day of declines. The rand extended Wednesday's 1.6 percent drop driven by proposals to nationalize South Africa's central bank and expropriate land without compensation.

While the data still indicated a tight labor market, the reports hint at a soft monthly nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes hiring in both the public and private sectors. The softer data followed minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting released on Wednesday showing policymakers were increasingly split on the inflation outlook and how it might affect the pace of interest rate increases. Those two factors helped push yields on U.S. Treasuries higher and dampened the attractiveness of equities.  More than anything you’ve had a fairly good-sized move up on the 10-year Treasury (yield) over a short period,  said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.  Investors are on a very short term reacting to where yields are at this moment compared with only a week ago.  Geopolitical tensions also weighed on sentiment, with U.S. President Donald Trump vowing on Thursday to confront North Korea  very strongly  following its latest missile test and urging nations to show Pyongyang that there would be consequences for its weapons program. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 102.13 points, or 0.48 percent, to 21,376.04, the S&P; 500 lost 15.13 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,417.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 39.96 points, or 0.65 percent, to 6,110.90. Shares of Tesla dropped 5.84 percent after the luxury electric carmaker's Model S did not receive the top score in certain tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. General Electric lost 3.97 percent as the worst performer on the Dow after the European Commission accused the company of providing misleading information during a merger deal. L Brands plunged 13.93 percent, the worst performer on the S&P; 500, after the Victoria's Secret owner's June sales came in below expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.35-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The decision means Airbus (AIR.PA) will have to try to resell or reallocate the 283-seat jets at a time when demand for big planes is softening, and could cost Airbus $60-80 million to rip out and replace interiors designed to fit the airline's plush brand.  Smart players are not going to rush in, because other cancellations or deferrals may come,  said veteran aircraft financier Bertrand Grabowski, former board member at DVB Bank. The cancellation follows concerns about delays and quality problems on cabin equipment for the A350, but also comes at a time when Qatar is entering the second month of a crisis caused by a ban on Qatar's use of the airspace of four Arab nations.     Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said earlier any delays were the planemaker's responsibility.  We are asking Airbus to deliver it faster,  he told a Dublin news conference.  The delay is from Airbus.      An Airbus spokesman said the cancellations were related to  known supply chain issues . Asked what would happen to the undelivered A350-900 jets, he said:  They will be reallocated . Qatar Airways has a reputation for being demanding when  reviewing aircraft for quality defects before delivery.  However, some analysts have said the Gulf political crisis may give the airline a further incentive to slow deliveries, compounding the impact of relatively weak oil prices.

Fightback vs Boeing The Qatar setback extends a torrid week for Airbus as it tries to bounce back against a resurgent Boeing (BA.N) and shake off an internal row over a shake-up in its sales organization. The surprise decision to have the sales team report to Chief Executive Tom Enders and by-pass airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, first reported by Reuters, raised hackles internally and prompted concerns about a power battle. Enders on Wednesday defended the decision, saying it was about freeing his no.2 to focus on core operations. The Airbus sales force has been urged not to dwell on the reorganization and to push back  aggressively  against Boeing which won the Paris Airshow for the first time in five years. Sales chief John Leahy, who plans to retire this year, has also warned staff that Airbus faces a stronger and  much more aggressive  competitor, people familiar with the matter said. Airbus took 248 orders between January and June, or 203 after cancellations. As of June 27, Boeing had notched up 407 orders this year, or 361 after cancellations.     On Wednesday, China signed a deal to buy 140 Airbus jets. Leahy, who will report to Enders for a few months before handing to his designated successor Kiran Rao, also delivered an internal tribute to Bregier, saying  he helped us win .

The opinion, written by Judge Joan Kessler for a panel that also included Judges Kitty Brennan and William Brash, upholds a jury award of $16.5 million to Ascaris Mayo and her husband, Antonio, Mayo lost all of her limbs to a septic infection that, according to the jury, her emergency room doctor and physician’s assistant diagnosed but failed to warn her about.  The appeals court could have concluded just that the state’s 15-year-old damages cap was unconstitutional as it applied to the Mayos, who have suffered grievously from – and responded courageously to – shortcomings in the health care Ascaris received. (That is, in fact, how Judge Brash said he would have decided the case.)  But the majority looked back at the Wisconsin legislature’s justifications for the damages cap, which was enacted in 2005, after the state Supreme Court struck down a previous $350,000 cap as unconstitutional. The appeals court found insufficient evidence that the $750,000 cap has accomplished what lawmakers intended. So even under the lenient rational basis standard of review, the majority said, there’s simply no good policy justification for a law that effectively punishes the most severely injured patients in Wisconsin.  That analysis, of course, contradicts conventional tort reform wisdom, which holds that capping medical malpractice damages will ultimately improve health care by insulating doctors and lowering costs associated with “defensive” treatment. Just last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to cap damages for pain and suffering at just $250,000 in cases involving healthcare provided or subsidized by the federal government.  The rationale for such caps, as the Wisconsin decision explained, is multipronged. Limiting exposure to malpractice damages awards is supposed to improve access to health care by encouraging doctors to stay in the state. Caps presumably provide predictability, reducing insurance risk and allowing insurers to charge lower malpractice premiums. And patients supposedly benefit because doctors aren’t frightened into ordering unnecessary tests and procedures merely to protect themselves from frivolous malpractice claims.  The Wisconsin legislature specified those goals when it enacted the $750,000 cap, citing a plethora of studies suggesting the restriction would resolve a purported crisis in medical malpractice litigation. Appellate briefs in the Mayo case from the Wisconsin Patients Compensation Fund (a trust that pay settlements and judgments exceeding defendants’ primary malpractice insurance limits) and the state’s hospitals and physicians argued that the cap has accomplished exactly what lawmakers intended.  The appellate majority disagreed. “The record before us does not support a finding that the legislative objectives … are promoted in any way because the amount of the noneconomic damages cap is $750,000,” the court said. There is “no demonstrably consistent” proof that doctors are likelier to continue practicing in states with damages caps, the opinion said. In fact, according to the opinion, “Data demonstrates that many states with no caps on noneconomic damages actually have higher physician retention rates than Wisconsin.”  Data also indicate, according to the opinion, that non-economic damages caps “may actually increase the risk to patient safety,” rather than improving care by obviating “defensive” medicine. Besides, the majority said, medical professionals in Wisconsin already know they’re exposed only to the limits of their insurance coverage, since the state fund covers judgments exceeding the limits of their insurance. “This lack of uninsured personal liability would logically appear to remove any incentive to practice ‘defensive medicine,’” the appeals court said. “The evidence in the record does not rationally support the conclusion that the cap reduces defensive medicine costs.”  Moreover, the opinion suggested, there’s just no indication of an ongoing medical malpractice crisis in Wisconsin. After a 2013 uptick in malpractice suits, attributable to a spate of claims against a pediatrician accused of sexually abusing patients, there were only 84 cases filed in state court in 2014, according to an amicus brief in the Mayo case from the Wisconsin Association for Justice. The amicus brief pointed out that in 2014, Florida’s Supreme Court struck down a similar damages cap in McCall v. United States, after concluding that if there was ever a tidal wave of malpractice litigation, it has subsided.  The message of both the 2014 Florida decision and Tuesday’s ruling from Wisconsin is that damages caps place the burden of solving a probably illusory problem on the already bowed shoulders of horrendously injured patients – those so severely injured that judges and juries believe they deserve hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation for their pain and suffering. I sure hope the U.S. Senate considers these decisions before it votes on the House bill to cap malpractice damages.  I left phone messages for the Mayos’ lawyer, Daniel Rottier of Habush Habush & Rottier, and the fund’s lawyer, Roisin Bell of Bell Giftos St. John, but didn’t hear back.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-medmal-idUSKBN19R2NK"},

He pinned his Czech opponent behind the baseline with unerring groundstrokes off both wings, moving him from side to side in the 30 Celsius heat and forcing error after error. Pavlasek was playing his childhood hero and the 22-year-old, ranked 136, appeared overawed by the occasion. He rarely tested the 12-time grand slam champion.

The Serbian player, a former world number one, said he did not know what McEnroe was basing his remarks on but added that he respected the former champion's opinion.  McEnroe said this week that Djokovic  had some off-court issues with the family , adding:  That's going to throw you. If you're distracted you're not the same player.  The three-time Wimbledon champion likened the problems of Djokovic -- who has surrendered two grand slam titles this year and slipped to fourth in the world -- to those of Woods, whose marriage collapsed after he admitted to adultery.  The person that comes to mind immediately with Novak is golfer Tiger Woods,  McEnroe, 58, told the BBC.  He had the issues with his wife, he seemed to go completely off the rails and has never been even close to the same player.

He's very well known for his, you know, kind of bold comments and not really caring too much about being politically correct but saying whatever is on his mind,  Djokovic added.

Closely-watched French hypermarket sales returned to positive territory for the first time since the third quarter 2015, while the rest of Europe, notably Italy and Spain had robust sales, and Carrefour kept its 2017 sales growth outlook. Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon told analysts Carrefour still eyed 3-5 percent sales growth at constant  exchange rates for full-year 2017.  He said he would comment on the consensus of analysts for the group's 2017 operating profit only on Aug. 30, when the French retailer announces its first-half results. The consensus currently stands at 2.49 billion euros. Second-quarter group sales reached 21.759 billion euros  ($24.82 billion), above the average of analysts' estimates of 21.5 billion euros.  Stripping out fuel, currency and calendar effects, revenue grew 2.8 percent year-on-year, an acceleration from 1.4 percent growth in the first quarter. Alexandre Bompard, the former boss of French retailer Fnac Darty (FNAC.PA), is taking the top seat at Carrefour on July 18, replacing Plassat who has been at the helm since 2012. Investors want Carrefour's new CEO to boost the performance of the French hypermarkets, a task in which others have struggled or failed, and to catch up in the digitalization of retail, notably after Amazon's (AMZN.O) $13.7 billion bid to buy Whole Foods Market (WFM.O) sent shockwaves across global food retailers. Since taking the reins in June 2012, Plassat has led a recovery focused on price cuts, accelerating expansion into convenience shops and renovating stores. Under Plassat Carrefour has made progress in most of Europe and in Brazil but it suffered a drop in group profit last year, pulled down by a tough French market, where its hypermarkets face competition from online rivals and aggressive price discounting from those such as unlisted Leclerc.  In France, where Carrefour makes 47 percent of its sales, like-for-like revenue rose 1.9 percent in the quarter, an acceleration from 0.5 percent growth in the first quarter. Sales at French hypermarkets alone rose 0.5 percent after a 1.6 percent decline in the first quarter while supermarkets and convenience stores also had a good performance. Sivignon said the performance of the French hypermarkets was   in a challenging environment, adding it reflected price cuts and warm weather conditions in June. Because Carrefour plans to list its Brazil business on July 20, it is not allowed to disclose figures for Brazil, its second-largest market after France. The group is reporting all emerging markets  as rest of the world  with no details given by country.. That segment had like-for-like sales growth of 3.4 percent in the second quarter against 3.1 percent in the first.

Several major companies, along with Russia's biggest oil firm and Ukrainian banks, were hit by a virus on June 27 that crippled computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at factories. Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Dettol and Lysol disinfectants, Nurofen tablets and Durex condoms, said it estimated like-for-like revenue in the second quarter would fall 2 percent from a year earlier because of the attack, which hit three days before the quarter ended. The virus hit output at many of the company's more than 60 factories and hurt a global supply chain by affecting systems that manage orders, billing and shipping. Excluding that impact, and tax changes in India that hurt sales to a lesser extent, second-quarter sales would have been flat, the company said.    Reckitt's shares fell as much as 3.2 percent on Thursday to their lowest since May 19. They closed 1.5 percent lower.  The cyber blindside came at a bad time for Reckitt Benckiser after its weakest performance in 15 years in the first quarter, when a collapse of its business in South Korea and a failed Scholl product innovation left sales unchanged..  Reckitt Benckiser has described 2017 as a  tale of two halves , saying the second half would improve as comparisons with the year-earlier period get easier. But it said on Thursday that like-for-like annual sales would now only increase 2 percent, instead of 3 percent. The company did not provide more financial details, but based on last year's sales figures, a 1 percent cut to the full-year forecast would be worth about 100 million pounds.  Investec analysts cut their full-year estimates for sales by 111 million pounds and earnings per share by 1.5 percent, citing disruption to production, order handling and logistics and pressure on margins from the need to upgrade systems and recover data.  They said the new forecast implied a need to deliver 4 to 5 percent growth in the core business in the second half of the year,  which we think will be tough . Another analyst, who declined to be identified, said Reckitt was likely already on track to miss its full-year target, and described the cyber attack as  a handy way to adjust expectations in a way that puts the blame on 'one-ff' factors.  FILE PHOTO -  Products made by Reckitt Benckiser stand on a shelf in a store in Brighton southern England, July 21, 2010.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoReckitt has a reputation for acquiring businesses and boosting sales by launching new products. But several sluggish quarters and last month's acquisition of baby formula maker Mead Johnson have raised questions about its strategy.  We remain negative on the acquisition of Mead Johnson from a strategic, operational and financial point of view whereas organically we see signs of innovation fatigue meaning that there isn't anything obvious to offset the slowdown of the failed Scholl Express Pedi innovation,  said analysts at RBC, affirming their  underperform  rating. Prior to the takeover, Mead Johnson's shares had fallen by a third over two years, as it lost market share in China due to increased competition and changing consumer habits. Around the World in 45 Minutes Security experts say the NotPetya virus hit a popular accounting software used in Ukraine, which is likely where multinationals, including A.P. Moeller Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), Mondelez International (MDLZ.O) and Reckitt were first infected before it spread globally through their networks. Maersk on Thursday said container shipments would be back to normal by early next week. It did not detail any financial impact. Reckitt could not confirm the virus's starting point - only that it spread around the world in just 45 minutes. A company spokeswoman said there was no evidence to suggest Reckitt had any particular vulnerability in its system.       Reckitt employees were able to conduct some business through phones and other personal devices during the disruption, but not manufacturing. Reckitt said some revenue lost would be made up in the current third quarter, which runs through September.   However, the continued production difficulties in some factories mean that we also expect to lose some further revenue permanently,  it said. The spokeswoman said she anticipated that all factories would be running at some level by the end of the week. Reckitt plans to do a full study of its IT processes, but did not detail any impact to profits. It said generally that its operating margin continued to make satisfactory progress.  The virus did not hurt Mead Johnson, which Reckitt acquired for nearly $17 billion, its biggest deal ever.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper (CP) outstanding fell $26.9 billion to $946.8 billion in the week ended July 5.

Earlier in the day the anti-graft unit head Busisiwe Mkhwebane, whose official title is Public Protector, stood by her bid to force the central bank to target growth rather than inflation. Mkhwebane set off a political row last month when she said the South African Reserve Bank's mandate should focus on growth and not on inflation and the currency, rattling investors and the rand. The central bank has filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation, which is also opposed by parliament and now officially by the Treasury. In an affidavit published on the Treasury website, Gigaba said that the Public Protector's recommendations violated several provisions of the constitution and that she should have consulted the finance minister before making the proposal.  There is no basis to the conclusion that the Reserve Bank should not play the role of protecting the value of the currency,  Gigaba said. Earlier on Thursday the Public Protector's spokeswoman Cleopatra Mosana said Mkhwebane had filed a notice opposing the challenges to her recommendation.  The Public Protector is empowered, by the constitution, to take appropriate remedial action with regard to any improper conduct in the state affairs or conduct, or conduct in the state affairs which may result in any impropriety or prejudice,  Mosana said. Gigaba and opponents of the proposal say Mkhwebane was exceeding her mandate in making the recommendation. Critics say that Mkhwebane's role is to confront maladministration, not make central bank policy. Analysts say it is unclear what prompted Mkhwebane's recommendation and that it would be up to the courts to decide whether her mandate extends to the central bank. The row over the central bank has highlighted divisions in the tripartite political alliance of the ruling ANC, the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party (SACP) over the role of the reserve bank. Both the ANC and the SACP are opposed to altering the mandate the central bank. Cosatu, however, has backed calls for changes saying the bank is not acting in the interests of South Africa's poor majority. Investors were further unsettled this week after the ruling African National Congress proposed at its policy conference to nationalise the reserve bank. Ratings agencies have warned that South Africa risked further downgrades if the independence of institutions such as the central bank was undermined. A cabinet reshuffle in March saw a respected finance minister fired, leading to South Africa credit rating being downgraded to  junk  by S&P; Global ratings and Fitch. Central bank's deputy governor Kuben Naidoo on Thursday acknowledged that inflation targeting was imperfect but said it was the best policy for now.  Inflation targeting has its flaws but I think it's the least bad option for South Africa in the present environment given our economic circumstances,  Naidoo told a public lecture. Deputy Finance Minister Sfiso Buthelezi said last week there was a need to debate whether the central bank's inflation targeting range of 3 to 6 percent was still appropriate, as the country battles with its first recession in eight years.  Perhaps it's a good (inflation targeting) band, but we set this 3 to 6 percent under different economic conditions, is it still relevant now? Is it a policy for all seasons?  Buthelezi said. South Africa's headline consumer inflation rose slightly more than expected to 5.4 percent year-on-year in May from 5.3 percent in April, data showed. The rand held near seven-week lows on Thursday, while government bonds also weakened.

Several major companies, along with Russia's biggest oil firm and Ukrainian banks, were hit by a virus on June 27 that crippled computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at factories. Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Dettol and Lysol disinfectants, Nurofen tablets and Durex condoms, said it estimated like-for-like revenue in the second quarter would fall 2 percent from a year earlier because of the attack, which hit three days before the quarter ended. The virus hit output at many of the company's more than 60 factories and hurt a global supply chain by affecting systems that manage orders, billing and shipping. Excluding that impact, and tax changes in India that hurt sales to a lesser extent, second-quarter sales would have been flat, the company said.    Reckitt's shares fell as much as 3.2 percent on Thursday to their lowest since May 19. They closed 1.5 percent lower.  The cyber blindside came at a bad time for Reckitt Benckiser after its weakest performance in 15 years in the first quarter, when a collapse of its business in South Korea and a failed Scholl product innovation left sales unchanged..  Reckitt Benckiser has described 2017 as a  tale of two halves , saying the second half would improve as comparisons with the year-earlier period get easier. But it said on Thursday that like-for-like annual sales would now only increase 2 percent, instead of 3 percent. The company did not provide more financial details, but based on last year's sales figures, a 1 percent cut to the full-year forecast would be worth about 100 million pounds.  Investec analysts cut their full-year estimates for sales by 111 million pounds and earnings per share by 1.5 percent, citing disruption to production, order handling and logistics and pressure on margins from the need to upgrade systems and recover data.  They said the new forecast implied a need to deliver 4 to 5 percent growth in the core business in the second half of the year,  which we think will be tough . Another analyst, who declined to be identified, said Reckitt was likely already on track to miss its full-year target, and described the cyber attack as  a handy way to adjust expectations in a way that puts the blame on 'one-ff' factors.  FILE PHOTO -  Products made by Reckitt Benckiser stand on a shelf in a store in Brighton southern England, July 21, 2010.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoReckitt has a reputation for acquiring businesses and boosting sales by launching new products. But several sluggish quarters and last month's acquisition of baby formula maker Mead Johnson have raised questions about its strategy.  We remain negative on the acquisition of Mead Johnson from a strategic, operational and financial point of view whereas organically we see signs of innovation fatigue meaning that there isn't anything obvious to offset the slowdown of the failed Scholl Express Pedi innovation,  said analysts at RBC, affirming their  underperform  rating. Prior to the takeover, Mead Johnson's shares had fallen by a third over two years, as it lost market share in China due to increased competition and changing consumer habits. Around the World in 45 Minutes Security experts say the NotPetya virus hit a popular accounting software used in Ukraine, which is likely where multinationals, including A.P. Moeller Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), Mondelez International (MDLZ.O) and Reckitt were first infected before it spread globally through their networks. Maersk on Thursday said container shipments would be back to normal by early next week. It did not detail any financial impact. Reckitt could not confirm the virus's starting point - only that it spread around the world in just 45 minutes. A company spokeswoman said there was no evidence to suggest Reckitt had any particular vulnerability in its system.       Reckitt employees were able to conduct some business through phones and other personal devices during the disruption, but not manufacturing. Reckitt said some revenue lost would be made up in the current third quarter, which runs through September.   However, the continued production difficulties in some factories mean that we also expect to lose some further revenue permanently,  it said. The spokeswoman said she anticipated that all factories would be running at some level by the end of the week. Reckitt plans to do a full study of its IT processes, but did not detail any impact to profits. It said generally that its operating margin continued to make satisfactory progress.  The virus did not hurt Mead Johnson, which Reckitt acquired for nearly $17 billion, its biggest deal ever.

The program aims to improve customer service by training baristas and providing them technical support. About 62 percent of the employees surveyed said their ability to deliver the best customer service has decreased in the past three months due to understaffing. The customer re-engagement program, the first major initiative by CEO Kevin Johnson who took over in April, sought to address teething issues the company faced following the launch of its mobile ordering and payment technology. Baristas at the company's busiest cafes had difficulty keeping up with mobile orders, creating bottlenecks at drink delivery stations and leading some walk-in customers to walk out, with the company facing customer backlash on social media.  [Mobile ordering has] added to the work load immensely, and yet again, there aren't even enough people scheduled to share the workload,  a Starbucks partner who declined to be named told Coworker.org. The survey results come at a time when Starbucks is struggling to boost traffic. Visits to its U.S. stores have fallen for two quarters in a row, which Johnson blamed on operational challenges related to the mobile ordering upgrade.

Escaping wars and poverty, more than 360,000 refugees and migrants arrived on European shores across the Mediterranean last year. More than 85,000 have reached Italy so far this year. The European Commission fears that NGOs running rescue services off the Libyan coast are providing a  pull factor , encouraging migrants to risk their lives in flimsy dinghies in the hope of being picked up and then ferried over to Italy. Meeting in the Estonian capital Tallinn, the interior ministers agreed to beef up the Libyan coastguard, step up deportations of failed asylum-seekers and fund African countries from which people are fleeing poverty to find work in Europe.  Of course, we have to help Italy overcome this crisis and all countries have to make efforts to that end,  said Estonian Interior Minister Andres Anvelt, whose country holds the EU's rotating six-month presidency.  We have to establish a very clear return policy and deal with the reasons for the migration crisis at their source, that is, in the countries of the refugees’ origin,  he said. Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti said NGOs were conducting about 34 percent of the rescue operations and so should work closely with the Libyan coastguard in their waters.  These are civil operations and therefore need to be coordinated (with the coastguard) just as much as they need to liaise with the judicial authorities and the police regarding actions and investigations against (people) smugglers,  he said. Suffering However, NGOs have accused Libya's coastguard of rights abuses and say giving it greater responsibility will lead to more deaths at sea. Oxfam expressed concern that the EU's plans would  only increase the suffering of people on the move .  European governments should be supporting search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, and generally treating migrants in a more fair, transparent and legal manner,  it said in a statement. On Tuesday the European Commission offered Italy more funding to deal with Mediterranean migrants and said Italy would draw up a code of conduct for NGOs running rescue operations. Minniti said Italy would work quickly on the code of conduct. At a separate conference in Rome on Thursday, Italy's Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano stressed the importance of strengthening Libya's southern borders to discourage migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.  We have to stop the migrants getting to Libya and to do that we have to help the countries further south,  he said, comparing people traffickers who ferry the migrants toward Italy as  the biggest travel agency in the world .

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo in November opened the 400-bed center in the city's Porte de la Chapelle district, but the minister said many migrants were arriving in the capital every week.  It's always the same problem,  the minister, Gerard Collomb, told CNEWS.  First off you say 'I'm going to open a center for 500 people' and next thing you know you have 3,000 or 4,000 people and you're left having to sort the problem out.  European Union member-states are at odds over how to tackle the migrant crisis, with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war and poverty in countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan reaching Europe each year. Large numbers travel to France, often hoping to use its northern port of Calais as a launching pad from which to reach Britain. President Emmanuel Macron, elected in May, has instructed his interior minister to cut sharply the time required for processing asylum requests and Collomb has said illegal migrants should be repatriated swiftly.   The situation as it is can not carry on,  Collomb said. Hidalgo meanwhile, speaking at the Porte de la Chapelle center, urged the centrist government to draw up new legislation aimed at ensuring migrants are shown more humanity on their arrival in France.  The legislation, she said, should include a fund to help local authorities assist migrants. Collomb in late June ruled out a new reception center in Calais, to replace the squalid 'Jungle' camp bulldozed by the authorities last year, saying such centers were a magnet for migrants.

Cancer accounted for 180 deaths per 100,000 persons in rural areas annually compared with 158 deaths in urban areas, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released on Thursday.  Rural areas, however, reported fewer new cancer cases at 442 per 100,000 persons compared with 457 cases in urban areas.  But for cancers that are often associated with tobacco use such as lung or those that can be diagnosed through early screenings, including colorectal and cervical, the rate of incidence is higher in rural areas, the report said.   While geography alone can't predict your risk of cancer, it can impact prevention, diagnosis and treatment opportunities – and that's a significant public health problem,  said acting CDC Director Anne Schuchat. More than 46 million Americans, or 15 percent of the country's population, live in rural areas, and face numerous health disparities compared to their urban counterparts, according to the CDC.

To preserve the army's image and prevent any rumors that may be malicious, we ask the relevant leadership and judiciary to open a transparent investigation into ... the causes that led to the deaths,  minister Ayman Choucair said in a statement sent to Reuters by his office.     New York-based Human Rights Watch on Wednesday demanded an independent inquiry into the deaths and said anyone responsible for wrongdoing should be held to account. The Lebanese Center for Human Rights said torture had led to the deaths of at least four detainees. The Syrian National Coalition, a Turkey-based political opposition group, said that 10 people had died in custody and that 19 others had died in the raid in refugee camps around Arsal town. A military source denied these allegations. The army said that five suicide attackers had blown themselves up while attacking soldiers during last week's raid, and one civilian was killed. A military statement on Wednesday said authorities released 15 Syrian detainees and referred 85 others to the main security agency after interrogations. The Lebanese army is the fifth-biggest recipient of U.S. military assistance, and has also received support from Britain.  The aid is part of efforts to bolster Lebanon against a threat from militants groups at the Syrian border.  A British embassy spokesperson told Reuters the country was in the  frontline of the crisis in Syria and faces a high threat from terrorism .   We monitor allegations of human rights abuses closely through our local contacts and encourage the Lebanese Armed Forces to engage with these in an open and transparent way,  embassy spokesperson said.

They are scattered across Lebanon mostly in informal tented settlements where many live in severe poverty, facing the risk of arrest due to restrictions on legal residence and work. The army says it regularly stages operations targeting Islamic State and former al Qaeda-linked militants in the mountainous border region near Arsal.  A number of attacks in Lebanon in recent years have been linked to the war in neighboring Syria, where Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah is fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad.

The question of which warplanes Bulgaria should buy has been bounced around successive governments for more than a decade as it seeks to modernize its fleet and improve its compliance with NATO standards. Bulgaria joined the alliance in 2004. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov signaled last month that the talks would soon begin despite his criticism of Bulgaria's previous interim government for announcing them. Borissov has said the interim government exceeded its mandate and should not have made the call on a deal worth an estimated 1.5 billion levs ($858 million). Defence Minister Krassimir Karakachanov said the center-right government would now only make a decision on starting the talks after a parliamentary commission concludes its investigation into the action of the interim administration.  There will be no negotiations for (buying) new aircraft until the parliamentary commission makes a statement,  said Karakachanov, who is also a deputy prime minister.

Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers' knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share.  Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain's Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot.  The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,  he said.  It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren't as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.  Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Prestige Machines Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals.  Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016.  That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker's joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew's products, is less than half the price.

Picture taken October 27, 2011.Michael Buholzer/File PhotoBoth companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company's most important strategic investment for a decade.  We are now basically head to head with Stryker,  he said in an interview.  I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it's Stryker or us.   Cost-Effectiveness Question Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017.  As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,  Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June.  Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven't been specific about.  Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J; is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France's Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew's Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations.  Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up.  Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results.  I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.

The discovery of this ship - one of the most important that navigated in our seas during colonial times - begins a new chapter in the cultural and scientific history, not only of Colombia, but of the entire world,  Santos said on national television from Cartagena.   Questions about navigation, world trade, about colonial costs, will be answered.   The government will accept further offers to recover the ship and its treasure, Santos said.

They urged the nationalist Orban to halt the campaign.  Please make sure this bad dream ends as soon as possible,  Andras Heisler, chairman of the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz), said in an emailed statement. Orban's spokesman said the campaign had nothing to do with anti-Semitism but rather sought only to counter what he called Soros's attempts to unduly change immigration policies in Hungary. Orban has locked horns with fellow European Union members in the west of the bloc over his opposition to immigration and liberal values and has criticized Soros - a major supporter of democracy and human rights causes - in increasingly sharp tones. Orban, who faces elections next year, long proclaimed zero tolerance for anti-Semitism though has more recently risked angering Israel and Jews with remarks apparently meant to court far right voters. His government has conducted a  national consultation  on issues of foreign influence and mass immigration, asking people if they were open to allowing either. Voters who responded rejected both and Orban launched a massive follow-up campaign. The campaign focuses on Soros, 86, a Hungarian Jew who emigrated after World War Two, made a fortune in the United States and has long been heavily involved with groups promoting liberal democratic and open-border values in post-Communist eastern Europe, a cause at odds with Orban's world view. Billboards around Hungary and full-page ads in media across the central European country depict Soros grinning contentedly against a blue background with the inscription:  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh.  Some Soros billboards have been defaced with the words  stinking Jew  in magic marker. Around 100,000 Jews live in Hungary.  Imagery from World War Two   This campaign, while not openly anti-Semitic, clearly has the potential to ignite uncontrolled emotions, including anti-Semitism,  the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Congregations (Mazsihisz) said in an emailed statement. The campaign uses  imagery that evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War showing 'the laughing Jew',  Human Rights Watch campaigner Lydia Gall told Reuters.  The campaign encourages anti-Semitism.  Soros, who rarely addresses personal attacks against him, was not immediately available for comment through a spokesman. Soros has called Orban's rule a  mafia regime  and has funded groups in Hungary that promote democratic transparency, human rights and a positive approach to immigration. Orban's government fortified Hungary's southern border in 2015 against a large influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa into the EU that year and has rejected a quota scheme agreed by EU leaders to distribute migrants among member states.  Heisler said Orban was using Soros as a scapegoat and that carried serious risks.  Graffiti has appeared on the posters on the streets of Budapest and other cities reminding us of a dark era in Hungary's history, but the invisible social damage is probably already worse than that,  Heisler wrote. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said Orban met with Jewish organizations on Thursday and told them the billboard campaign was only calling attention to what he said was Soros's undue interference in Budapest's migration policies.  The campaign has nothing to do with the heritage of George Soros or anyone else,  Kovacs said. Orban, who expects a visit from Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu later this month, said last week he expected confrontations over anti-Semitism.  Let us be vigilant: our opponents use the anti-Semitism card. We reject that,  he told an event of his Fidesz party.  Those who charge us with anti-Semitism bring tens of thousands of anti-Semites into Europe through migration. So our migrant policies serve the interests of European Jewish communities even if they don't stand up for their own interests, and quietly tolerate the unfair attacks that Hungarians receive as they protect them too.

It is now among a small handful of states that have not enacted a fiscal 2018 budget.  S&P; also placed Pennsylvania's A-plus appropriation rating, single-A departmental appropriation rating and A-minus moral obligation rating on watch with negative implications. The company said it would consider removing Pennsylvania's ratings from CreditWatch if state lawmakers negotiate a balanced budget within 90 days. If Pennsylvania enacts a budget that relies on  optimistic assumptions  or one-time revenue sources, S&P; said it would probably lower the rating.

The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 158,000 jobs in June, below the estimated addition of 185,000, suggesting some cooling in the labor market as it nears full employment. The report acts as a precursor to monthly nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both the public and private sectors.  The market moves significantly on the jobs report. We are expecting to see a little bit of a rebound from last month, but again we didn't get that in the ADP number today which was also expected to be stronger than what it was,  said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims rose for the third straight week, with claims climbing to 248,000, above the 243,000 expected. Bell said ongoing geopolitical worries around North Korea were also adding to the pressure. The United States said it was ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea's nuclear missile program after the country test launched a ballistic missile that could hit Alaska.

UnitedHealth was the biggest drag on the Dow. Traders are also grappling with comments from some central bankers, who have signalled that they are close to slowing down ultra loose monetary policies, which have supported stocks and bonds. Those concerns, along with an anticipation that the Federal Reserve will begin unwinding its bond holdings later this year, led to a sell off in bonds, with benchmark yields touching nearly eight-week highs. Shares of Tesla fell 4.4 percent after the luxury electric carmaker's Model S did not get the top score in certain tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

British employers have started to push harder for a Brexit deal that causes as little disruption as possible after voters failed to back Prime Minister Theresa May's tough approach to divorce negotiations with the EU in an election last month.  The result, which cost May her majority in parliament, has reopened the debate about how Britain should leave the EU.  Instead of a cliff edge, the UK needs a bridge to the new EU deal,  Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director-general, was due to say in a lecture at the London School of Economics.  Even with the greatest possible goodwill on both sides, it's impossible to imagine the detail will be clear by the end of March 2019,  she said. Many firms are worried about losing some of their access to markets in the EU and facing barriers to hiring workers once Britain leaves the bloc in less than two years' time.  This is a time to be realistic,  Fairbairn said.  Our proposal is for the UK to seek to stay in the single market and a customs union until a final deal is in force.   Fairbairn said the CBI's proposal would mean that firms would only need to cope with one transition, not two, which should be  limited  in duration. The possibility of disruption had already caused a major European engineering and electronics firm to shelve its plans to build an innovation center in Britain, she said. Fairbairn did not discuss what Britain would need to do in order to remain temporarily in the single market, but it would probably mean continuing to allow free entry to EU migrant workers and observing rulings of the European Court of Justice. Brexit supporters focused on the need for immigration controls and to break free of the ECJ ahead of last year's referendum, and one pro-Leave campaigner said the CBI proposal threatened to override the decision of voters.  The big business lobby would prefer to ignore the mandate from the referendum of taking back control of our laws, borders, money and trade, and instead attempt to keep the UK in the EU by the back door,  said Gisela Stuart, a former Labour Party lawmaker.  Committing to stay in the EU’s single market and customs union during a transition period would only serve to tie our hands in the negotiations, and make it more likely that the EU gives us a bad deal,  she said.However, signs are growing that Britain will try to avoid an abrupt exit from the EU. Finance minister Philip Hammond has renewed his calls for a  transition period that protects supply chains spanning the English Channel. Britain's Brexit minister, David Davis, has said a transitional arrangement could last one or two years. Neither has discussed whether Britain would remain a member of the single market during any transition.

The question of which warplanes Bulgaria should buy has been bounced around successive governments for more than a decade as it seeks to modernize its fleet and improve its compliance with NATO standards. Bulgaria joined the alliance in 2004. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov signaled last month that the talks would soon begin despite his criticism of Bulgaria's previous interim government for announcing them. Borissov has said the interim government exceeded its mandate and should not have made the call on a deal worth an estimated 1.5 billion levs ($858 million). Defence Minister Krassimir Karakachanov said the center-right government would now only make a decision on starting the talks after a parliamentary commission concludes its investigation into the action of the interim administration.  There will be no negotiations for (buying) new aircraft until the parliamentary commission makes a statement,  said Karakachanov, who is also a deputy prime minister.  Parliament stands above the government. If there are no (other) recommendations, we will work on the current project.  The interim government ranked Sweden's offer as the most favorable, followed by Italy's proposal for second-hand Eurofighter Typhoons.  An offer by Portugal to sell secondhand U.S. F-16s was not rated - a decision that prompted Borissov's ruling GERB party to set up the commission which will also check whether  President Rumen Radev influenced the process.  Radev, who appointed the interim government after Borissov's previous government resigned late last year, called the commission  a tribunal for political influence  and stressed that military experts had made the decision in favor of the Gripen aircraft. Bulgaria has said it wants to seal a deal by the end of 2017 to acquire eight new or secondhand fighter jets.

The ICC indicted Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir in 2008 over the deaths and persecution of ethnic groups in Sudan's Darfur province between 2003 and 2008. But he has continued to travel internationally, visiting Jordan as recently as March. The first part of Thursday's ICC ruling was expected as the war crimes court has consistently rejected arguments put forward by the South African government, namely that it could not arrest Bashir because visiting heads of state at the African Union Summit held in the country enjoyed diplomatic immunity.  ICC judges said that heads of state or government clearly fall under the court's jurisdiction and cannot be exempted at home or abroad, echoing the conclusion of a South African domestic court. The second stage of the ruling was surprising as it was the first time the ICC found one of its members had defied its rules, yet took no action by reporting South Africa to the U.N. Security Council or ICC member states for possible censure.  The decision is something of an indictment of the U.N. Security Council and the (ICC's) Assembly of State Parties,” ICC expert and legal scholar Mark Kersten told Reuters. Presiding Judge Cuno Tarfusser, reading a summary of the ruling, noted that past referrals of countries to the Security Council for noncompliance were  futile  in terms of leading to further action and also  not an effective way to obtain cooperation  with the ICC. Bashir Denies Wrongdoing Bashir denies wrongdoing and has rejected ICC jurisdiction. It was the Security Council itself that referred Sudan's case to the ICC in 2005.  It is shocking that other (ICC member states) such as Jordan are also failing in their obligations to arrest Bashir, and this decision makes it clear they do so in flagrant violation of international law,  Amnesty International said in a statement. Judge Cuno Tarfusser issues a ruling on South Africa's failure to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during a three-day visit in June 2015, during a session of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, July 6, 2017.Evert Elzinga/PoolThe ICC's decision not to refer South Africa might also be intended in part to dissuade it from pulling out of the court. In February, the African Union called for member states to leave the ICC over a perceived bias by prosecutors in focusing on African conflicts. Kenya, Namibia, Burundi and South Africa have threatened to ditch the ICC and Pretoria began the formal withdrawal process last year before being blocked by a domestic court for not getting parliament's approval first before pulling out.  I believe (Thursday's) ruling will raise the costs of withdrawal for South African President Jacob Zuma,  Kersten said.  In The Hague, South African Ambassador Bruce Koloane said that for the time being  (we are) still a member effectively of the ICC, we still have to honor all our obligations”.  In South Africa, opinions on what to do next were divided. Pretoria's foreign affairs department said the government would study the ruling  and its implications and seek legal opinion on available options . Siphosezwe Masango, who chairs parliament's international relations committee, said he remained convinced South Africa was right not to arrest Bashir,  a sitting head of state . Pretoria's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said the ICC ruling was an indictment of Zuma's ANC government, noting it had upheld the domestic court's position.  The ANC seems intent on relegating South Africa to the status of a scumbag nation which protects the law-breakers and corrupter of this world,  DA Federal Executive Chairperson James Selfe said.

The Bulgarian, who swatted away Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 6-3 6-2 6-1 on Thursday, has long been thought of as a potential grand slam winner. Yet after beating Wimbledon champion Andy Murray en route to the semi-finals in 2014, his career has stalled. That year he won three tour titles and also reached the last eight at the Australian Open, flourishing an exquisite backhand that had earned him the nickname 'Baby Federer', after the Swiss maestro.     Following that, however, he went almost three years without adding a trophy or staying in a grand slam past the fourth round. There were also questions about his private life as he got dragged into a public spat between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, whom he dated until 2015.  His fortunes seem to have improved this year, however, and a semi-final appearance at the Australian Open, where he fell in a titanic five-set battle with Rafa Nadal, and tour titles in Sofia and Brisbane are testament to his improved form.   Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 6, 2017   Cyprus’ Marcos Baghdatis in action during his second round match against Bulgaria’s Grigor DimitrovMatthew ChildsOn a sun-baked Court Two on Thursday he looked less like  Baby Federer  and more like the real thing as he made light work of Baghdatis, another former semi-finalist at the All England Club.  The Bulgarian looked intensely focussed as he raced through his opening four service games, conceding just two points, before breaking for a 5-3 lead and then wrapping up the first set in the next game with his third ace.  It was then a case of simply tightening his stranglehold, which he did by breaking Baghdatis in the first game of the second and again in the seventh, eventually taking the set after a behind-the-back trickshot.  Slideshow (5 Images)Dimitrov did not have everything his own way in the third, and was forced to save seven break points, but still broke three times himself to claim an emphatic win, which he sealed with a superb diving volley.

France has opposed other uses of palm oil in the past. Several bills have been presented to parliament since 2012 proposing a special tax on its use in food, citing environmental damage caused by plantations. Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's two largest palm oil producers, opposed such a tax, saying it was discriminatory and broke international trade rules.  We will close a window that offered the possibility for using palm oil in biofuels,  Hulot said during a presentation of a wider plan on the fight against climate change. He did not detail measures envisaged but said he wanted to stop  imported deforestation  in France, citing unsustainable soybean and palm oil production in the countries of origin. Hulot also criticized the import of some protein-rich products used in animal feed, saying he wanted to stop French livestock becoming reliant on products from Brazil that were produced in ways that damaged the Amazon rainforest.  It is all this incoherence that I want to stop,  he said. Hulot did not name the products, but soybeans are a protein-rich crop from Brazil often used in animal feed in France. Avril, Europe's largest biodiesel producer, welcomed Hulot's comments. The company uses French rapeseed as its main feedstock for biodiesel, in a process that makes animal feed as co-product known as rapemeal.  Avril group supports all initiatives favoring biofuels that provide protein for animal feed and the banning ... of biofuels made from palm oil,  Avril Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Puig told Reuters by email. He said any action should not be limited to France but should be taken at a European level. Avril has reduced output of biodiesel several times in the past, citing competition from cheaper imports that use palm oil as one of the main problems.  French imports of biodiesel, which often contain palm oil, rose to more than 1.1 million tonnes in 2016 from less than 300,000 tonnes in 2010, Avril said. European biodiesel producers say rapemeal offers an alternative to imported soybeans, which mainly originate from Argentina and Brazil. Crop-based biofuels have faced mounting criticism in Europe. Opponents say some crops are grown on plantations that cause deforestation. They also say the feedstock, such as sugar or grains, should be used to feed people not make fuel.

Cancer accounted for 180 deaths per 100,000 persons in rural areas annually compared with 158 deaths in urban areas, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released on Thursday.  Rural areas, however, reported fewer new cancer cases at 442 per 100,000 persons compared with 457 cases in urban areas.  But for cancers that are often associated with tobacco use such as lung or those that can be diagnosed through early screenings, including colorectal and cervical, the rate of incidence is higher in rural areas, the report said.

Dish faces a Federal Communications Commission deadline to use the spectrum by 2021 to build its first wireless network. Some investors say Ergen will likely want a partner to help share the cost of the investment, even though he has said the company can build the network by itself.

Citi analysts added that Verizon was pressing hard on the IoT front, while T-Mobile recently announced plans for a 5G IoT network. An acquisition of Dish by Amazon is highly unlikely, the WSJ report added. Dish declined to comment, while Amazon was not immediately available for comment. Analysts have said that the telecoms and cable sectors are primed for a wave of deal activity, and executives have openly talked about potential mergers. U.S. wireless company Sprint Corp (S.N) was reportedly holding talks with peer T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), before putting those plans on ice to explore a wireless partnership with  Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).

The struggling Northeastern state, whose general obligation bonds are rated AA-minus by S&P;, has yet to enact a complete spending and revenue plan for the fiscal year that began on Saturday.  The CreditWatch action reflects Pennsylvania's eroding financial position and our view that there is a significant likelihood that the commonwealth will not enact a structurally balanced budget for fiscal 2018,  S&P; credit analyst Carol Spain said in a statement.  Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a $32 billion state spending plan hours before the new fiscal year began but did not devise a revenue package to pay for it all and close a $2.3 billion deficit. It is now among a small handful of states that have not enacted a fiscal 2018 budget.  S&P; also placed Pennsylvania's A-plus appropriation rating, single-A departmental appropriation rating and A-minus moral obligation rating on watch with negative implications. The company said it would consider removing Pennsylvania's ratings from CreditWatch if state lawmakers negotiate a balanced budget within 90 days. If Pennsylvania enacts a budget that relies on  optimistic assumptions  or one-time revenue sources, S&P; said it would probably lower the rating.

We're not going to turn away from or at least acknowledge what has happened since Tzu-Wei has gotten here,  manager John Farrell said.  A team is going into the break either on an uptick or they're grinding to get through it. When you inject new blood it's got a chance to do what we're experiencing. Lin, who was called up from Double-A Portland on June 24, is 9-for-27 in 11 games after going 0-for-2 in the Red Sox's 8-2 loss to Texas on Wednesday.  You're always interested to see how a young player is going to come up and function in a new environment, a game in which the speed is greater than what he has experienced previously. The low-maintenance, compact swing, he's a very good athlete, a good throwing arm. To me, what stands out is the control of his emotions and the control of his game when he's in the batter's box in particular.  RHP Doug Fister (0-2) struggled as the losing pitcher in Boston's 8-2 loss to Texas on Wednesday, lasting only 3 2/3 innings, giving up six runs and five hits, including two home runs, three walks and a hit by pitch. Only four runs were earned, two resulting from his error in Texas' three-run fourth.  It's a real tough pill to swallow tonight,  Fister said.  At the cost of a team loss, especially the guys in the bullpen. They're taxed and I'm adding to that. That's a frustrating thing for me and I'm not getting my job done.  LHP Brian Johnson (left shoulder impingement) made a rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket, allowing three runs -- all in the first inning -- and five hits in 3 2/3 innings. He threw 75 pitches, 51 for strikes. UTL Brock Holt (vertigo) went 1-for-3 while playing third base for Double-A Portland on Wednesday. Holt hasn't played for the Red Sox since April 20. LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee) threw 88 pitches in a rehabilitation game with Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday. He will meet the Red Sox in Tampa and throw a bullpen there. The team will weigh options, which include another start in the minors or a few days in the bullpen before he rejoins the rotation after the All-Star break.  He covered first base last night, fielded a bunt on the third base side. So the functional side, in-game needs have been seen,  Boston manager John Farrell said.  Everything points toward (his velocity) being consistent. The energy was good, the delivery might have been a little quick. But that's a good thing, that indicates he's not favoring anything or sub consciously holding back.  Meeting with him in Tampa  will give us an opportunity to map out what's best for him, best for us. So until we a chance to talk to him, most important thing is he feels good.

Opposing batters are hitting .192 with runners in scoring position and two outs. PH Jon Jay was 1-for-1 with a pinch-hit homer in the sixth inning that forced a 3-3 tie on Wednesday against the Tampa Bay Rays.

It was also the Cubs' second pinch-hit homer this year after Kyle Schwarber had one on June 11. 1B Anthony Rizzo was 2-for-3 with two walks on Wednesday against the Tampa Bay Rays, reaching base four times while driving in two runs. He has a .509 OPB at Wrigley Field since May 7 and has reached base 99 times overall since that date, second most in the National League. C Willson Contreras batted leadoff for the second time this season on Wednesday against the Tampa Bay Rays and is among seven Cubs to appear in the top spot. He led off with a single to center and also walked. The Cubs are 2-0 when he bats first.

At some point in time he might not be here this year, based on the Marcus situation, but regardless, this was great experience for him if, indeed, he is the guy that goes down,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Barreto hit his first career walk-off home run Tuesday in a 7-6 victory against the White Sox. Barreto, 21, became the youngest A's player to hit a walk-off homer since Jimmie Foxx at age 20 on May 14, 1928, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

I think I just got into a little bit of a groove, a little bit of a rhythm,  Gray said.  Throwing a lot of fastballs that kind of move both ways. A lot of ground balls, and that's when I'm at my best. I'm not necessarily going to strike a lot of people out, but I'm going to get a lot of groundballs. I've been getting that a lot lately.  C Ryan Lavarnway was selected from Triple-A Nashville on Wednesday and took the roster spot of C Josh Phegley, who was placed on the paternity list. Lavarnway, 29, is batting .274 with four home runs and 20 RBIs in 61 games for Nashville. Lavarnway is a .196 career hitter in 134 major league games with Boston (2011-14), Baltimore (2015) and Atlanta (2015).  He has a veteran presence to him,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He understands how to run a pitching staff and actually swung the bat pretty well for us (in spring training).

Melvin, however, has yet determine a specific day. Semien went 2-for-5 with a home run and scored two runs during a rehab game Tuesday for Triple-A Nashville at Colorado Springs.  He's played multiple nine innings in a row,  Melvin said.  He'll be ready to go soon.  Semien has been on the disabled list since Aril 15.

The state-owned carrier notified American Airlines last month that it was interested in buying up to 10 percent of its shares but would not exceed 4.75 percent without the approval of American's board.  We will be able to start buying shares in the open market soon, depending of course on what is the share value,  al Baker told reporters in Dublin, where he was launching a new Qatar Airways route.  The share purchases will start as soon as Qatar receives regulatory approval, he said.  However, American said in a regulatory filing dated June 22 that company rules prohibit anyone  from acquiring 4.75 percent or more  of the company's shares in issue without prior board approval. Shares in American were up 0.5 percent at $51.53 at 1342 GMT on Thursday, valuing the company at over $25 billion. The move by Qatar Airways would expand its investments to North America at a time when Qatar is embroiled in the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights row with three other Gulf states. Qatar has no intention of going above 10 percent, al Baker said.  Al-Baker said American's CEO Doug Parker told him at an airline conference in Mexico last month that he was against Qatar's planned investment and that he would not recommend that the board approve the purchase of a stake of over 4.75 percent.  He categorically told us that he was not interested, that he would not suggest to his board to allow us. However, I told him we can still take 4.75 percent and we will do that,  al Baker said.  Air travelers stand at an American Airlines check-in gate at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S., March 14, 2017.Shannon Stapleton Maybe once we have taken that 4.75 and they see the value that Qatar Airways brings to the table for them that they will reconsider,  he said. Anti-Gulf Stance He said he had no ambition to influence American's management or soften what he said was its  anti-Gulf stance.  Along with United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), American has pressed the U.S. government to curb U.S. flights by Qatar Airways and rival Gulf carriers Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways. The U.S. carriers charge that their Gulf rivals have received billions of dollars in unfair state subsidies, allegations the Gulf carriers deny. A stake in American Airlines would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio. The Middle East's second biggest airline also has a 20 percent stake in International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, and a 10 percent stake in Chile's LATAM Airlines LAN.SN. Qatar Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the oneworld airline alliance. British Airways and Qatar Airways have a revenue-sharing partnership between their respective hubs in Doha and London, and Qatar Airways plans to launch flights to LATAM's base in Santiago, Chile. Al-Baker made repeated digs at American, saying it wanted to keep out the Gulf carriers from the U.S. market so it could  swindle their customers.

British employers have started to push harder for a Brexit deal that causes as little disruption as possible after voters failed to back Prime Minister Theresa May's tough approach to divorce negotiations with the EU in an election last month.  The result, which cost May her majority in parliament, has reopened the debate about how Britain should leave the EU.  Instead of a cliff edge, the UK needs a bridge to the new EU deal,  Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director-general, was due to say in a lecture at the London School of Economics.  Even with the greatest possible goodwill on both sides, it's impossible to imagine the detail will be clear by the end of March 2019,  she said. Many firms are worried about losing some of their access to markets in the EU and facing barriers to hiring workers once Britain leaves the bloc in less than two years' time.  This is a time to be realistic,  Fairbairn said.  Our proposal is for the UK to seek to stay in the single market and a customs union until a final deal is in force.   Fairbairn said the CBI's proposal would mean that firms would only need to cope with one transition, not two, which should be  limited  in duration. The possibility of disruption had already caused a major European engineering and electronics firm to shelve its plans to build an innovation center in Britain, she said. Fairbairn did not discuss what Britain would need to do in order to remain temporarily in the single market, but it would probably mean continuing to allow free entry to EU migrant workers and observing rulings of the European Court of Justice. Brexit supporters focused on the need for immigration controls and to break free of the ECJ ahead of last year's referendum, and one pro-Leave campaigner said the CBI proposal threatened to override the decision of voters.  The big business lobby would prefer to ignore the mandate from the referendum of taking back control of our laws, borders, money and trade, and instead attempt to keep the UK in the EU by the back door,  said Gisela Stuart, a former Labour Party lawmaker.  Committing to stay in the EU’s single market and customs union during a transition period would only serve to tie our hands in the negotiations, and make it more likely that the EU gives us a bad deal,  she said.However, signs are growing that Britain will try to avoid an abrupt exit from the EU. Finance minister Philip Hammond has renewed his calls for a  transition period that protects supply chains spanning the English Channel. Britain's Brexit minister, David Davis, has said a transitional arrangement could last one or two years. Neither has discussed whether Britain would remain a member of the single market during any transition.

Researchers followed adults with type 2 diabetes over about four years and found that for those with milder eye disease at the start, having sleep apnea was linked to higher odds that it would become more advanced.  At the outset of the study, they also found that advanced “sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy” was already present in 43 percent of people with sleep apnea, compared to just 24 percent of those without apnea.   Patients with type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at increased risk of developing advanced retinopathy and also are at increased risk of greater decline in kidney function, as we found in a previous publication,” senior study author Dr. Abd A. Tahrani from University of Birmingham told Reuters Health. “Hence, diagnosing OSA offers the opportunity to identify a high-risk group of patients which will allow doctors to apply preventative treatment strategy to slow the progression of these complications,” Tahrani said by email. Diabetic eye disease, or retinopathy, affects as many as 50 percent of people with diabetes, yet it remains unclear exactly what contributes to its development or what causes it to get worse. Past studies have found a link between sleep apnea and damage to tiny blood vessels that causes kidney and nerve problems in people with diabetes, the authors note. Tahrani’s team looked at whether sleep apnea is associated with the progression of diabetic retinopathy in 230 patients with type 2 diabetes, none of whom had diagnosed respiratory conditions, including sleep apnea, at the start of the study.  After sleep monitoring was done, 63 percent of the participants were found to have obstructive sleep apnea. At the outset, the rates of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, advanced diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy (damage to the part of the eye responsible for central vision) were already higher in patients with sleep apnea than in those without sleep apnea.  As time went on, three times as many patients with sleep apnea, 18.4 percent, progressed to more advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy compared to 6.1 percent of those without sleep apnea, according to the report in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The worse the sleep apnea, the faster the progression of diabetic retinopathy, researchers found. Sleep apnea, however, did not appear to be associated with faster progression of existing sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy.  On a positive note, sleep apnea treatment with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) slowed the progression to advanced diabetic retinopathy.  “While the impact of CPAP on retinopathy and other diabetes-related complications requires further study, CPAP treatment has several benefits, including lowering the blood pressure, improving sleepiness, improving quality of life, improving OSA-related symptoms and reducing the risk of road traffic accidents; hence CPAP treatment should be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes who have OSA,” Tahrani said.  Diabetic retinopathy is mostly caused by diabetes, and more severe diabetic retinopathy could be promoted by poor blood sugar control and OSA in type 2 diabetes,” said Dr. Gen-Min Lin from Hualien-Armed Forces General Hospital and National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, Taiwan, who recently looked at the association of sleep apnea with changes in the tiny blood vessels of the retina. “In some cross-sectional studies, women with more severe OSA were found to have higher risk of less severe diabetic retinopathy (such as microaneurysms) than men,” Lin told Reuters Health in an email. “This sex difference might be related to female sex hormone or higher grade inflammation status in women.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2utX8Qz American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, online June 8, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleepapnea-diabetes-retinopath-idUSKBN19R2IU"},

Tesla's shares have fallen about 13 percent this week, wiping off nearly $8 billion from the company's market capitalization, following the carmaker's lower-than-expected deliveries and rising competition in the electric car market. Thursday's 5 percent drop puts the stock on course for its worst weekly performance since February last year. The steep fall also knocked the company off its perch as the most valuable U.S. carmaker, with General Motors (GM.N) reclaiming the spot on Thursday.  At current levels, GM has a market capitalization of $52.71 billion, while Tesla was valued at about $51.8 billion.  Tesla on Monday reported lower-than-expected delivery numbers, citing a  severe  shortfall of new battery packs.  This was followed on Wednesday by Goldman Sachs cutting its six-month price target to $180 from $190.  Andrew Left of short seller Citron Research told CNBC in a phone interview that he thinks that is fair in the short term.

On Thursday, Reuters reported that mining giant Glencore (GLEN.L) had signed a major deal to sell up to 20,000 tonnes of cobalt products to a Chinese firm, a move that in turn helps Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) secure car batteries for its shift to electric vehicles. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group-owned [GEELY.UL] Volvo said on Wednesday all car models it launches after 2019 will be electric or hybrids. In the tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the seat belt in Tesla's Model S was not effective and could lead to the driver's head striking the steering wheel hard through the air bag. Ford's Lincoln Continental, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp's Avalon received the highest rating overall, the agency said on Thursday. Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second-highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email. The company said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested. The IIHS is a research arm of the insurance industry, and its crash tests are increasingly influential in guiding vehicle safety design.

France has opposed other uses of palm oil in the past. Several bills have been presented to parliament since 2012 proposing a special tax on its use in food, citing environmental damage caused by plantations. Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's two largest palm oil producers, opposed such a tax, saying it was discriminatory and broke international trade rules.  We will close a window that offered the possibility for using palm oil in biofuels,  Hulot said during a presentation of a wider plan on the fight against climate change. He did not detail measures envisaged but said he wanted to stop  imported deforestation  in France, citing unsustainable soybean and palm oil production in the countries of origin. Hulot also criticized the import of some protein-rich products used in animal feed, saying he wanted to stop French livestock becoming reliant on products from Brazil that were produced in ways that damaged the Amazon rainforest.  It is all this incoherence that I want to stop,  he said. Hulot did not name the products, but soybeans are a protein-rich crop from Brazil often used in animal feed in France. Avril, Europe's largest biodiesel producer, welcomed Hulot's comments. The company uses French rapeseed as its main feedstock for biodiesel, in a process that makes animal feed as co-product known as rapemeal.  Avril group supports all initiatives favoring biofuels that provide protein for animal feed and the banning ... of biofuels made from palm oil,  Avril Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Puig told Reuters by email. He said any action should not be limited to France but should be taken at a European level. Avril has reduced output of biodiesel several times in the past, citing competition from cheaper imports that use palm oil as one of the main problems.  French imports of biodiesel, which often contain palm oil, rose to more than 1.1 million tonnes in 2016 from less than 300,000 tonnes in 2010, Avril said. European biodiesel producers say rapemeal offers an alternative to imported soybeans, which mainly originate from Argentina and Brazil. Crop-based biofuels have faced mounting criticism in Europe. Opponents say some crops are grown on plantations that cause deforestation. They also say the feedstock, such as sugar or grains, should be used to feed people not make fuel.

BeiGene's shares rose as much as 31.4 percent to an all-time high of $68.67 in afternoon trading on Thursday. Celgene's shares were marginally down. The deal announced on Wednesday will complement Celgene's partnership with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) to develop durvalumab as a treatment for hematological malignancies and expand the drug developer's presence in China's untapped cancer market. BeiGene's advanced tumor cancer therapy, BGB-A317, is a type of antibody that belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. The treatment has been tested in more than 500 patients, with initial data suggesting that it is well-tolerated and exhibits anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumor types, the companies said.  We believe Celgene's ability to combine approved therapies in-house with either durvalumab or BGB-A317 provides the company flexibility during development and commercialization,  William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said in a client note. BeiGene will get $263 million in upfront license fees and $150 million in equity investment. The company will also be eligible to receive up to $980 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. This is a  shockingly good  deal for BeiGene as it monetizes a market that is virtually impenetrable to all but the largest pharma players in the cancer space, Baird analyst Brian Skorney said. Last month, Hutchison China MediTech (HCM.L), the Shanghai-based drugmaker listed in London and commonly known as Chi-Med, filed a marketing application for its cancer drug fruquintinib with the China Food and Drug Administration. Chi-Med is developing the treatment for advanced colorectal cancer in collaboration with U.S. drug developer Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N). BeiGene will acquire Celgene's operations in China and also license and assume commercial responsibility for Celgene's approved therapies - Abraxane, Revlimid and Vidaza - in the region. Celgene will acquire 32.7 million of BeiGene's ordinary shares at $4.58, or $59.55 per BeiGene's American Depositary Shares (ADS), the companies said. Up to Wednesday's close of $52.27, BeiGene's shares had gained about 72 percent this year.

It’s still a very long season ahead, obviously rumors are always going to come at this stage,  he told reporters when asked about speculation that other teams were interested in securing his services.  My target number one is to be with Red Bull next year and start fighting for podiums, wins or whatever they are fighting for next year. I am going to keep pushing for this,  added the 22-year-old.  If that doesn’t happen, obviously a fourth year in Toro Rosso is unlikely and I’m not going to close the door to any opportunity.  Sainz joined Toro Rosso, who are effectively Red Bull's feeder team, in 2015 alongside Dutch teenager Max Verstappen. Verstappen graduated to Red Bull in 2016, swapping seats with Russian Daniil Kvyat and winning the Spanish Grand Prix on his debut with them, and has become one of the sport's established stars. Sainz has had a less meteoric rise but is also highly rated. He was one of several drivers that Mercedes enquired about when they were casting around for a replacement for retired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg. Past Toro Rosso drivers, including four times world champion Sebastian Vettel and Australian Daniel Ricciardo, have historically been moved upwards or out by the team to ensure a steady flow of talent. With Verstappen under a long-term contract at Red Bull and Ricciardo also locked in, Sainz's chances of moving up appear limited. The Spaniard has scored points in six of his eight races this year and now has 29 points to Kvyat's four.

He cited disruption to cross-border traders processing value-added tax (VAT) and a need for all EU imports of animals and animal products to be tested at borders. Those issues are of particular concern in Ireland, where farming businesses on either side of the new UK-EU border on the island fear disruption. Barnier repeated EU willingness to make a priority of agreeing border issues on Ireland, where leaders on all sides fear a  hard  frontier could also undermine the fragile peace in the British province of Northern Ireland. Pressed by British and Irish delegates about the Irish border issue, Barnier said he understood Ireland was a special case but that the EU would also protect its own market. Slideshow (4 Images)An EU free trade deal with Japan on Thursday was hailed by EU leaders as a sign of what the combined economic power of the bloc can achieve - and of what Britain will miss when it leaves.  In the context of the discussion about Brexit, we have heard statements claiming that it isn't worth being in the European Union, as it is easier to do global trade outside of the EU,  European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters.  Today we have shown that this is not true.  EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan said the deal, which should boost European food and drink exports,  shows the importance of size in global trade negotiations .  No individual member state could ever hope to achieve what the EU can achieve together,  Hogan said in a statement. London, where Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed the EU-Japan deal, may seek to emulate the Japan-EU deal's benefits.

EU ministers have never before suggested changes in banking rules specifically to raise capital buffers to cover NPLs.  The move is part of a wider plan to address problems with bad credit, known also as non-performing loans (NPLs), on the balance sheets of some EU member states' banks, seen as a problem for the whole bloc because of spill-over risks. In a regular meeting on Tuesday in Brussels, EU finance ministers will ask the EU Commission to consider  prudential backstops addressing potential under-provisioning which would apply to newly originated loans , the draft document said. Banco Popular and two small Italian banks were liquidated in June after their bad loans became unmanageable, and, this week, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) got approval for a 5.4 billion euro ($6.1 billion) state bailout to plug the capital hole caused by the sale of bad loans. While NPLs dropped to 4.8 percent of all loans in the EU in the first quarter of 2017, they remained well above 40 percent in Greece and Cyprus, at 18.5 percent in Portugal and 14.8 percent in Italy, European Banking Authority data shows. To help address the problem, ministers will also ask for national asset management companies to be set up to facilitate the development of a functioning secondary market for bad loans.

Stocks retreated along with markets in Europe and the United States. By 1500 GMT the rand had weakened 0.2 percent to 13.4250 per dollar, off a session low of 13.5075, as inconclusive U.S. Federal Reserve minutes kept the dollar near one-week highs. The dollar then turned weaker after softer-than-expected private jobs data, but overall sentiment toward local assets remained uneasy after the corruption watchdog said on Thursday she would oppose legal challenges to her recommendation to change the central bank's mandate. The rand hit a seven-week trough after the ruling African National Congress failed to agree a clear plan to get the economy out of recession, with pledges to nationalise the central bank and expropriate land set to stoke fears further.

German defence officials have said they want a low-risk heavy-lift helicopter that already exists, which means the likely supplier will be one of two U.S. firms - Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Airbus on Wednesday said choosing German firms to manage and service the new helicopters would secure German jobs, speed certification and ensure German sovereignty. Any other decision would harm the German helicopter industry, it said. A spokesman for the ministry said Germany had no “buy German” requirement for helicopters, only key technologies such as encryption.  Competition is a very important factor in this case,  he said.  There won't be any free passes for anyone.  Airbus, MTU Aero Engines and six other firms on Wednesday said they had signed a partnership agreement to push for a big German role in managing the new helicopter. Airbus, which currently services nearly all German military aircraft, and the other companies, urged Berlin to award separate contracts for buying and servicing the helicopters. The defence ministry said it would decide this summer how to structure the deal and a  request for proposals  would likely go out to industry next year. But it said its general preference would be to deal with one lead contractor. A second source said the decision was expected this month, but it could become a political football ahead of the Sept. 24 national election, given the jobs at stake. Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky helicopter unit said it was finalising  exclusive relationships  with several German companies, but did not name them. Nathalie Previte, director of strategy and business development for Sikorsky, said the company's goal was to sign agreements with German firms that would be  strategic partners in the areas of sustainment and aircraft content.  A Boeing official said only that the firm had close ties to over 100 companies in Germany as part of its global commercial and military supply chain. Melanie Wolf, a spokeswoman for MTU, said her company wanted to support the German aerospace industry.  We want to maintain technology competencies in Germany, but for that we need German industry and orders for that industry,  Wolf said.

In a media conference call, Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the dealer lobbying organization, said sales should dip to 16.8 million units in 2018 and then be within a range of 16.5 million units to 16.8 million units through 2020. After a record 17.55 million units sold in 2016, the U.S. auto industry has posted declining sales for the last four months, with high consumer discounts and inventory levels  posing concerns for Wall Street. A glut of nearly new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles is expected to pose a challenge to new vehicle sales. Sales of sedans have been particularly weak as consumers have increasingly shifted toward pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Szakaly said consumer discounts are focused heavily on the less-popular models.  We do expect incentives to rise this year, especially as off-lease (sales) begin to exert further downward pressure on sedan pricing throughout the rest of 2017,  he said. Tackling high inventory levels should help automakers meet the NADA's sales forecast, Szakaly added.  If we see inventories level off into September and throughout the third quarter, I think it will be a very strong sign that the industry has made the right decisions... and we should easily make our 17.1 million sales number,  Szakaly said.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia upheld a federal judge's May 2016 dismissal of trademark infringement and false advertising claims by Parks LLC, which said many consumers would be fooled into thinking it made  Park's Finest  frankfurters. Parks' lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. John Dabney, a lawyer for Tyson, declined to comment. The appeals court filed its decision under seal, and will likely release a version within a few weeks after both sides advise whether parts of it should remain confidential.

The Sankofa field forms the first phase of the $7.9 billion Offshore Cape Three Points project (OCTP), which is expected to also deliver up to 180 million cubic feet of natural gas per day by the end of next year, more than doubling domestic gas supply. President Nana Akufo-Addo opened the valves on the Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel, the John Agyekum Kufuor, named after Ghana's former president who was in office between 2001 and 2008. Akufo-Addo said Sankofa coming on stream would ensure reliable and affordable clean energy to support economic activities and keep the country on the right path to growth.  The need for creative thinking to leverage our oil and gas production for national development is a charge for us to keep - and we must not fail our people,  he told a gathering of chiefs and oil sector players at the western port city of Takoradi. Ghana already produces oil from two major fields including the country's flagship Jubilee block which came on stream in late 2010. Akufo-Addo said he was optimistic that the addition of production from the OCTP to those of the TEN and Jubilee fields would enhance significantly gas supply for domestic power generation. ENI officials said Sankofa was completed three months ahead of schedule and within budget. Ghana is recovering from a power crisis caused by lack of funds to buy oil in the absence of domestic gas to power thermal plants. The government estimates gas from OCTP will boost generation by 1,000 megawatts, enough to ensure stable supply.  The country also has a $918 million aid program from the International Monetary Fund to restore fiscal balance to its economy which has a large budget deficit and big domestic and external debts. ENI holds a 44.44 percent stake in OCTP, representing the largest foreign direct investment in Ghana's history.

The 700 pence per share offer for Novae represents a premium of over 20 percent to the London-based insurer's closing price on Wednesday, and shares were up 22.1 percent at the close on Thursday. Axis Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create a roughly $2 billion player in the London specialty market. The deal, expected to close in the final quarter of the year, will add to Axis' earnings in the first year and allow it to bulk up in the Lloyd's insurance market.  It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. Axis is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees,  John Hastings-Bass, chairman of Novae, said.   Axis operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America.  The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid.  Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a  torrid  nine months for the company.  The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price,  Neptune's Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae's shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain's Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune's view.  Insurers have been preparing for a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as valuations in the Lloyd's insurance market became more attractive to overseas buyers due to a fall in the value of the pound after Britain voted to leave the European Union.  Lloyd's companies such as Hiscox (HSX.L), Lancashire (LRE.L) and Beazley BEZG.L have long been seen as acquisition targets, and insurers Amlin, Brit and Catlin have all been snapped up by overseas insurers in recent years.

The company's daily crude production hit a new high of 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2016, according to its annual review released on Thursday, up from 10.2 million bpd in 2015. Recoverable crude oil and condensate reserves, meanwhile, totaled 260.8 billion barrels at the end of 2016, little changed from 261.1 billion in 2015. Saudi Arabia's reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world's largest.  Having an internationally recognized reserves audit has become a key task for Aramco as it seeks to become the world's most valuable company when it lists a 5 percent stake in an initial public offering (IPO). A reserves total significantly above or below the 261 billion figure would likely affect Aramco's potential market value in the listing and is being watched closely by investors.  Earlier phases of the audit have supported Aramco's statements on the total size of deposits. Aramco's gas reserves rose to 298.7 trillion standard cubic feet in 2016 from 297.6 trillion standard cubic feet the year before. Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Aramco and now an energy consultant, was impressed the company had added over one trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves and held proven oil reserves flat, despite producing over 3.6 billion barrels of oil last year. That showed  both the high level of exploration expertise within the company as well as its commitment to continue to supply ample gas-based feedstocks to its domestic industries,  he said.  Discoveries Aramco said it had discovered two new oilfields, Jubah and Sahaban, and one new gas field, Hadidah, all located in the Eastern Province, the main oil region in Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter. The review did not give an update on the IPO process, which is at the heart of Saudi Arabia's economic transformation plan. Aramco, the only company undertaking exploration in the kingdom, said oil exports rose to 7.6 million bpd in 2016 from 7.1 million bpd in 2015. Exports to Asia accounted for 66 percent, up from 65 percent in 2015, followed by exports to the United States, whose share dropped to 15.8 percent from 16.6 percent. Raw gas processing capacity rose to 12 billion standard cubic feet per day (scfd), allowing output of sales gas or methane, used mainly for electricity and petrochemicals, to hit a record 8.3 billion scfd. Ethane production, the favorite feedstock for petrochemicals, was also higher at 920 million scfd from 794 million scfd in 2015. Saudi Aramco plans to double gas production to 23 billion scfd in a decade by including  unconventional gas  in the mix and by continuing to develop gas not associated with oil to help it limit the use of oil in power generation and provide feedstock to the petrochemical industry it is keen to grow. It said over 40 percent of non-associated gas came from offshore fields Hasbah and Arabiyah. Progress continued in unconventional gas, as the company completed wells in northern Saudi Arabia to deliver 55 million scfd of gas by the end of this year to industrial and electrical power facilities in the Wa'ad Al Shamal industrial city, a phosphate project run by Saudi mining firm Ma'aden. The Midyan gas project in northwest Saudi Arabia, a region rich in iron ore deposits, is almost complete, Aramco said, while on the oil side, the expansion of Arab Light Khurais oilfield to 1.5 million bpd will be onstream by mid-2018. Midyan was discovered in the 1980s and has significant reserves.

European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the deal could boost exports by 20 billion euros ($22.8 billion) annually and create thousands of jobs in the EU.  We are basically tearing down all customs duties immediately on some cheeses like Gouda and cheddar and on wine and there will also be elimination of tariffs for other things that have been very expensive to buy from Japan but also very expensive to export to Japan, shoes, clothes, leather, wood products, etc,  she told reporters. Producers and exporters of meat and dairy as well as wines and other specialty foods, categories which are currently highly protected in Japan, will see the biggest windfall from the tariff reductions EU farm lobby Copa-Cogeca said in a statement.  It is good news for EU producers that this ambitious trade deal has been wrapped up,  said Martin Merrild, head of Copa.    Teruyuki Daino, president of Kirin Holdings' wine business Mercian Corp, said he welcomed the potential expansion of the Japanese wine market, but added he was concerned over the impact on smaller Japanese wineries.  Megmilk Snow Brand, which currently shares market dominance with only two other manufacturers in Japan, said it was preparing for a large impact on the domestic dairy industry. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) said it hoped the removal of tariffs on Japanese cars, motorbikes and car parts would pave the way for a bigger deal.  We see this agreement as an opportunity to further negotiations over the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and pick up discussions over the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), as we would like to see a further advancement of global free trade,  JAMA head and Nissan Motor Co Chairman Hiroto Saikawa said.

Concluded in Brussels on the eve of meetings with Trump at a  summit in Hamburg, the  political agreement  between two economies accounting for a third of global GDP is heavy with symbolism. It leaves some areas of negotiation still to be finished, although officials insist the key snags have been overcome.  Ahead of the G20 summit tomorrow, I believe Japan and the EU are demonstrating our strong political will to fly the flag for free trade against a shift toward protectionism,  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a joint news conference with EU institutional chiefs Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker. The  win-win  deal was, Abe said,  a strong message to the world . In the works for four years, it has been pushed over the line towards a final treaty signature in the coming months by the election of Trump and his moves to ditch a Pacific trade pact that included Japan and leave talks with the EU in limbo.  Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case,  European Council President Tusk said. Related CoverageEuropean farmers cheer market access in EU-Japan trade dealJuncker, president of the executive European Commission, played down prospects of any further negotiating problems and said he hoped the treaty could go into effect early in 2019. Alarm Over  America First  Fears of cheaper import competition for European carmakers and Japanese dairy producers were among the thorniest issues, but officials said the two sides were driven by a shared alarm at Trump's apparent shift away from multilateral open trading systems towards an aggressive  America First  policy. Tariffs on much of their bilateral trade -- which Abe noted accounts for some 40 percent of total international commerce -- will be phased out over some years, and other economic areas, such as Japan's public tender system, will be opened up.

The Japan Business Council in Europe, representing Japanese firms in the EU, said it would create  mutual prosperity . The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association also welcomed it. Both the EU and Japan, which are also forging a parallel cooperation pact on broader political issues such as security, crisis aid and climate change, forecast that the trade deal will boost economic growth and employment in Japan and in Europe. Slideshow (5 Images)One detail to be ironed out is how complaints from business over how authorities apply the treaty will be dealt with. That is a touchy subject in Europe due to concerns that trade pacts give too much power to big multinationals. European parliaments nearly blocked a deal with Canada last year over such issues. Juncker stressed the EU would not accept  private tribunals  ruling between business and states. But Greens in the European Parliament, which must ratify the treaty, were not impressed, complaining of a  rushed procedure  that was  not serious . Much remained unclear or unresolved, their leader Ska Keller said, calling also for it to do more to stop Japanese whaling. Cars, Cheese and Brexit EU tariffs of up to 10 percent on Japanese cars will be phased out over seven years. Most EU food exports, including chocolate and biscuits, will see tariffs end over time. Duty of up to 29 percent on hard cheeses like Parmesan will fall to zero over 15 years. Quotas on soft cheeses like feta and mozzarella will still protect Japan's culturally sensitive dairy sector. Japan will respect over 200 EU geographic protections on product names, like Parma ham or Polish wodka. Scotch whisky might not benefit, however, as Britain leaves the EU in 2019. Tusk took the opportunity to scoff at arguments in Britain for Brexit on the grounds that London could cut itself better trade deals without the EU's economic weight behind it. In an ironic nod to Brexit supporters' rallying cry of  Global Britain , Tusk, a former Polish premier, signed off a tweet confirming the Japan deal with the words  Global Europe!

Those signs were also evident in another report on Thursday showing growth in services industry employment slowing in June even as the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, continued to expand at a healthy clip.  The moderation in job gains likely reflects difficulties by employers finding suitable workers amid an unemployment rate  that is at a 16-year low. Even so, the labor market remains strong and tightening conditions could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year.   The slowdown in hiring, in our view, is a function of the difficulty in hiring workers,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  Companies remain very reluctant to lay off workers and this is a continued sign of the tightness of the labor market.    The ADP National Employment Report showed private sector payrolls increased by 158,000 jobs last month, stepping down from the 230,000 positions created in May and below economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000. The report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.  While the ADP report has a spotty record predicting non-farm payrolls, June's modest job gains together with the modest rise in first-time applications for jobless benefits and cooling services sector employment pose a downside risk to the government's June jobs report. According to a Reuters survey of economists, non-farm payrolls likely increased by 179,000 last month after May's 138,000 gain. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.3 percent.  Related CoverageU.S. service sector growth accelerates in June: ISMThe dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the data as did prices for U.S. Treasuries. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended July 1. It was the third straight weekly increase in claims. Tight Labor Market The rise in claims last week likely reflected automakers' closing of assembly plants for the annual summer retooling. Still, it was the 122nd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.  FILE PHOTO - A man holds his briefcase while waiting in line during a job fair in Melville, New York July 19, 2012.Shannon StapletonThat is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low. Unadjusted claims for Michigan, a hub for auto production,  increased 1,159 last week. Automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling at the start of July, which tends to push up claims. Applications are likely to remain elevated as some companies like General Motors embark on extended summer shutdowns to deal will slower sales, which have led to an inventory bloat. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported on Monday that auto sales fell in June for a fourth straight month. Even before the annual summer plant closures, automakers have been laying off workers in response to the softening demand. Slideshow (2 Images) As the recovery has progressed and pent-up demand for autos has likely been filled, the high levels of existing inventories and softening demand are likely to lead some automakers to shut down for longer than the normal one to two weeks,  said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. A third report from the Institute for Supply Management showed its non-manufacturing sector index rose half a point to a reading of 57.4 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sector. Industries reported an increase in new orders, but said employment growth had slowed.     The construction industry described the labor market as continuing to be  constrained,  and said low unemployment in most regions was  making hiring difficult on all phases of the construction supply chain.   The services sector strength was also echoed by another survey on Thursday. The IHS Markit's services sector activity index rose to a reading of 54.2 last month from 53.6 in May, marking a third month of accelerated growth in activity. A report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit fell 2.3 percent to $46.5 billion in May. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit narrowed to $62.8 billion from $63.8 billion in April. Real goods exports surged to an all-time high in May, propelled by record high petroleum exports. Still, the real trade deficit averaged $63.3 billion in April and May, above the first quarter's average of $62.2 billion. That suggests trade will be a drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter after contributing 0.23 percentage point to the economy's 1.4 percent annualized growth pace in the first three months of the year. The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered its second-quarter GDP forecast to a 2.7 percent rate from 3.0 percent earlier.

EU ministers have never before suggested changes in banking rules specifically to raise capital buffers to cover NPLs.  The move is part of a wider plan to address problems with bad credit, known also as non-performing loans (NPLs), on the balance sheets of some EU member states' banks, seen as a problem for the whole bloc because of spill-over risks. In a regular meeting on Tuesday in Brussels, EU finance ministers will ask the EU Commission to consider  prudential backstops addressing potential under-provisioning which would apply to newly originated loans , the draft document said. Banco Popular and two small Italian banks were liquidated in June after their bad loans became unmanageable, and, this week, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) got approval for a 5.4 billion euro ($6.1 billion) state bailout to plug the capital hole caused by the sale of bad loans. While NPLs dropped to 4.8 percent of all loans in the EU in the first quarter of 2017, they remained well above 40 percent in Greece and Cyprus, at 18.5 percent in Portugal and 14.8 percent in Italy, European Banking Authority data shows. To help address the problem, ministers will also ask for national asset management companies to be set up to facilitate the development of a functioning secondary market for bad loans.

Air India's international operations would bring a very important element to our network,  Rahul Bhatia, co-founder of IndiGo, said on a call with investors.  It would provide rapid entry into restricted and in some cases closed international markets.  IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe, last week expressed interest in buying a stake in state-owned Air India, after India's cabinet gave  in-principle  approval to privatise the carrier. Shares in IndiGo fell as much as 5.6 percent the day after this announcement, with analysts citing concern about such an investment given Air India's heavy debt burden.  We continue to like Indigo for its efficient cost structure and balance-sheet strength. However, potential acquisition of AI may create an overhang on the stock,  Joseph George, analyst at brokerage firm IIFL, said in a note published last week. Air India, once the country's biggest airline, has seen its domestic market share slump to 13 percent as private rivals such as IndiGo and SpiceJet have expanded. Air India's businesses include domestic flights, repair and maintenance operations and hotels. But its most sought-after asset is landing slots on international routes. The possibility of the government writing off part or all of Air India's $8 billion in debt could increase its appeal. Bhatia said that the company's operations would  require significant restructuring . He also said IndiGo would not be willing to take on any debt that could not be supported by a restructured Air India operation. The carrier is also wary of doing a deal if the government holds on to any minority or majority stake in Air India. Low-Cost, Long-Haul IndiGo, which flies four of every 10 Indian domestic passengers, launched in 2006 and has expanded rapidly in India's booming aviation market, prioritising domestic routes. In May, the carrier said it planned to start flying smaller planes to second-tier towns and cities this year, giving a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme to make it cheaper for people to fly within India. IndiGo has a fleet of 131 Airbus A320 aircraft, and has placed a provisional order for 50 ATR 72-600 aircraft from European turboprop maker ATR for regional flights. Even without any deal with Air India, IndiGo plans to enter the long-haul international market, Rakesh Gangwal, co-founder of IndiGo, said.  It makes fundamental economic sense for us to enter the long-haul international market. India's market is significantly underserved in non-stop international destinations,  he said, adding that IndiGo would do so with a low-cost model.

Speaking to reporters in Poland, Trump played down the assessment of his own intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the election by hacking Democrats' emails and distributing online propaganda.     “I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,” Trump told a news conference.  Investigations by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, and several U.S. congressional committees are looking into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trump's campaign. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow’s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries.  Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November election, will meet Putin on Friday at a G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg for their first official encounter.  It was not clear whether the Republican president would bring up the issue of election interference when the two men meet.  In a speech in Warsaw, Trump affirmed U.S. commitment to the defense of NATO allies and gently criticized Russia.

Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS and Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout/File photos via REUTERSTrump frequently praised Putin as a strong leader during the election campaign and called for better U.S. relations with Moscow but he has since tempered that rhetoric. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, said Trump's remarks in Poland about the election only propagated  his own personal fiction.        The President's comments today, again casting doubt on whether Russia was behind the blatant interference in our election and suggesting – his own intelligence agencies to the contrary – that nobody really knows, continue to directly undermine U.S. interests,  Schiff said in a statement.             Trump cast doubt at his news conference over media reports that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia had meddled in the election.      Let me just start off by saying I heard it was 17 agencies.  I said, boy, that's a lot, do we even have that many intelligence agencies, right?  Let's check it. And we did some very heavy research. It turned out to be three or four. It wasn’t 17,  Trump said.            The U.S. intelligence report in January accusing Russia of meddling in the U.S. election was issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies.  But the report acknowledges that it is based on an assessment by the CIA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, which held the key classified information on Russian activities. Trump said the CIA told his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, last August about Russian interference in the election but he did nothing to stop it.      I think what happened is he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election, and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way, he would have done something about it,  Trump said.

The Sankofa field forms the first phase of the $7.9 billion Offshore Cape Three Points project (OCTP), which is expected to also deliver up to 180 million cubic feet of natural gas per day by the end of next year, more than doubling domestic gas supply. President Nana Akufo-Addo opened the valves on the Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel, the John Agyekum Kufuor, named after Ghana's former president who was in office between 2001 and 2008. Akufo-Addo said Sankofa coming on stream would ensure reliable and affordable clean energy to support economic activities and keep the country on the right path to growth.  The need for creative thinking to leverage our oil and gas production for national development is a charge for us to keep - and we must not fail our people,  he told a gathering of chiefs and oil sector players at the western port city of Takoradi. Ghana already produces oil from two major fields including the country's flagship Jubilee block which came on stream in late 2010. Akufo-Addo said he was optimistic that the addition of production from the OCTP to those of the TEN and Jubilee fields would enhance significantly gas supply for domestic power generation. ENI officials said Sankofa was completed three months ahead of schedule and within budget. Ghana is recovering from a power crisis caused by lack of funds to buy oil in the absence of domestic gas to power thermal plants. The government estimates gas from OCTP will boost generation by 1,000 megawatts, enough to ensure stable supply.  The country also has a $918 million aid program from the International Monetary Fund to restore fiscal balance to its economy which has a large budget deficit and big domestic and external debts. ENI holds a 44.44 percent stake in OCTP, representing the largest foreign direct investment in Ghana's history.  Trading company Vitol [VITOLV.UL] holds 35.56 percent while state oil company Ghana National Petroleum Corporation has a combined carried and participating interest of 20 percent.

With inflation in the euro zone slowly rebounding, the ECB is preparing to dial back its stimulus policy of ultra-low rates and massive bond purchases, but doing so without upsetting investors is proving a challenge after years of easy money. Rate setters meeting on June 7-8 discussed dropping a long-standing pledge to boost the ECB's 2.3 trillion euros bond purchase program if necessary, a key element of their policy message.   Eventually they decided against doing so because the euro zone's economic recovery had yet to result in higher inflation - the bank's main policy objective. But, confirming a Reuters exclusive, the central bankers said they could review that so-called easing bias at future meetings. Related CoverageRecovery gives ECB room to pare stimulus says Weidmann If confidence in the inflation outlook improved further, the case for retaining this bias could be reviewed,  the ECB said in its policy accounts. German government bond yields hit new 18-month highs and the euro edged higher after the minutes were released as traders speculated on a  tapering  of the ECB's debt-purchase program, due to run until December. They were resuming a rally started last week, when ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at possible policy tweaks.  The ECB’s tiptoeing towards tapering will continue,  said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.  It should remain a very gradual and cautious process, given the ECB’s fear of taper tantrum.   Continued Caution  In the minutes, the ECB stressed the need for  continued caution in communication  as any perception that it was moving away from its stimulus policy could roil financial markets, undoing some of its previous efforts. Indeed, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said earlier on Thursday the central bank needed to be patient and maintain a steady hand in policy as inflation was still far below its target of almost 2 percent. Despite a brisk economic rebound, inflation in the euro zone was 1.3 percent in June and is not expected to near 2 percent at least until 2019. ECB rate setters meeting in June said they found it  puzzling  that forecasts for core inflation had to be revised downwards despite stronger economic growth and a falling unemployment rate. Still, Draghi argued last week that accelerating growth would in itself provide support so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged. That message stirred markets, stoking speculation that policymakers could decide as early as September to reduce asset purchases from next year. The ECB's asset buys are set to run until the end of the year and policymakers will decide in September or October whether to extend, reduce or gradually wind down the purchases.

A long-time critic of the ECB's ultra-loose policy, Weidmann said that low borrowing costs are still needed, but the threat of deflation, the main justification for the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro bond buying scheme is now a distant one and growth is becoming broad based. The comments suggest that Weidmann will continue to advocate a more hawkish stance, even after a small shift in the bank's tone last week pushed yields and the euro sharply higher, raising the risk that tighter financing would dampen growth.  The ongoing economic recovery now raises the prospect of a monetary policy normalization,  Weidmann said.   This is not about a full braking ... but taking our foot somewhat off the gas.  Minutes of the ECB's June interest rate meeting, published on Thursday, indicated that policymakers debated giving up their bias for even bigger asset buys but decided against the move, arguing that any change in the bank's language should be 'very gradual'. ECB President Mario Draghi stirred markets last week when he said that better growth would in itself provide support to the economy so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged. This fueled speculation that policymakers could decide as early as September to reduce asset purchases from next year.     The timing and rate of monetary policy normalization depends on the extent to which price rises are sustainable and self-sustaining,  Weidmann added.  He also argued that while growth is becoming increasingly robust, declining oil prices will be a drag on inflation and price growth could be 'somewhat' lower by the end of the year. The ECB has fallen short of its inflation target of 2 percent for more than four years and projections show it will not reach its objective at least through 2019.

The 700 pence per share offer for Novae represents a premium of over 20 percent to the London-based insurer's closing price on Wednesday, and shares were up 22.1 percent at the close on Thursday. Axis Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create a roughly $2 billion player in the London specialty market. The deal, expected to close in the final quarter of the year, will add to Axis' earnings in the first year and allow it to bulk up in the Lloyd's insurance market.  It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. Axis is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees,  John Hastings-Bass, chairman of Novae, said.   Axis operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America.  The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid.  Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a  torrid  nine months for the company.  The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price,  Neptune's Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae's shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain's Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune's view.  Insurers have been preparing for a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as valuations in the Lloyd's insurance market became more attractive to overseas buyers due to a fall in the value of the pound after Britain voted to leave the European Union.  Lloyd's companies such as Hiscox (HSX.L), Lancashire (LRE.L) and Beazley BEZG.L have long been seen as acquisition targets, and insurers Amlin, Brit and Catlin have all been snapped up by overseas insurers in recent years.

The company's daily crude production hit a new high of 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2016, according to its annual review released on Thursday, up from 10.2 million bpd in 2015. Recoverable crude oil and condensate reserves, meanwhile, totaled 260.8 billion barrels at the end of 2016, little changed from 261.1 billion in 2015. Saudi Arabia's reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world's largest.  Having an internationally recognized reserves audit has become a key task for Aramco as it seeks to become the world's most valuable company when it lists a 5 percent stake in an initial public offering (IPO). A reserves total significantly above or below the 261 billion figure would likely affect Aramco's potential market value in the listing and is being watched closely by investors.  Earlier phases of the audit have supported Aramco's statements on the total size of deposits. Aramco's gas reserves rose to 298.7 trillion standard cubic feet in 2016 from 297.6 trillion standard cubic feet the year before. Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Aramco and now an energy consultant, was impressed the company had added over one trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves and held proven oil reserves flat, despite producing over 3.6 billion barrels of oil last year. That showed  both the high level of exploration expertise within the company as well as its commitment to continue to supply ample gas-based feedstocks to its domestic industries,  he said.  Discoveries Aramco said it had discovered two new oilfields, Jubah and Sahaban, and one new gas field, Hadidah, all located in the Eastern Province, the main oil region in Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter. The review did not give an update on the IPO process, which is at the heart of Saudi Arabia's economic transformation plan. Aramco, the only company undertaking exploration in the kingdom, said oil exports rose to 7.6 million bpd in 2016 from 7.1 million bpd in 2015. Exports to Asia accounted for 66 percent, up from 65 percent in 2015, followed by exports to the United States, whose share dropped to 15.8 percent from 16.6 percent. Raw gas processing capacity rose to 12 billion standard cubic feet per day (scfd), allowing output of sales gas or methane, used mainly for electricity and petrochemicals, to hit a record 8.3 billion scfd. Ethane production, the favorite feedstock for petrochemicals, was also higher at 920 million scfd from 794 million scfd in 2015. Saudi Aramco plans to double gas production to 23 billion scfd in a decade by including  unconventional gas  in the mix and by continuing to develop gas not associated with oil to help it limit the use of oil in power generation and provide feedstock to the petrochemical industry it is keen to grow. It said over 40 percent of non-associated gas came from offshore fields Hasbah and Arabiyah. Progress continued in unconventional gas, as the company completed wells in northern Saudi Arabia to deliver 55 million scfd of gas by the end of this year to industrial and electrical power facilities in the Wa'ad Al Shamal industrial city, a phosphate project run by Saudi mining firm Ma'aden. The Midyan gas project in northwest Saudi Arabia, a region rich in iron ore deposits, is almost complete, Aramco said, while on the oil side, the expansion of Arab Light Khurais oilfield to 1.5 million bpd will be onstream by mid-2018. Midyan was discovered in the 1980s and has significant reserves.

European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the deal could boost exports by 20 billion euros ($22.8 billion) annually and create thousands of jobs in the EU.  We are basically tearing down all customs duties immediately on some cheeses like Gouda and cheddar and on wine and there will also be elimination of tariffs for other things that have been very expensive to buy from Japan but also very expensive to export to Japan, shoes, clothes, leather, wood products, etc,  she told reporters. Producers and exporters of meat and dairy as well as wines and other speciality foods, categories which are currently highly protected in Japan, will see the biggest windfall from the tariff reductions EU farm lobby Copa-Cogeca said in a statement.  It is good news for EU producers that this ambitious trade deal has been wrapped up,  said Martin Merrild, head of Copa. Teruyuki Daino, president of Kirin Holdings' wine business Mercian Corp, said he welcomed the potential expansion of the Japanese wine market, but added he was concerned over the impact on smaller Japanese wineries. Megmilk Snow Brand, which currently shares market dominance with only two other manufacturers in Japan, said it was preparing for a large impact on the domestic dairy industry. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) said it hoped the removal of tariffs on Japanese cars, motorbikes and car parts would pave the way for a bigger deal.  We see this agreement as an opportunity to further negotiations over the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and pick up discussions over the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), as we would like to see a further advancement of global free trade,  JAMA head and Nissan Motor Co Chairman Hiroto Saikawa said.

The pan-European STOXX 600  ended the session 0.7 percent lower, recovering some of its losses with all but three sectors closing in negative territory. Euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E also hit an 11-week low, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.4 percent.  There was nothing in the (June ECB) press conference that suggested that they talked about curtailing QE. But in fact they did,  said AFS analyst Arne Petimezas in Amsterdam. A series of earnings updates were also in focus with Sodexo (EXHO.PA) leading fallers and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) also weak after both companies cut their guidance. Reckitt (RB.L) was down 1.5 percent, making it one of the biggest weights on the STOXX. The UK consumer goods group cut its growth forecast after a global cyber attack last month disrupted business in multiple markets.  We would not see weakness in the share price today as a buying opportunity. Reckitt's markets are likely to have remained sluggish, with peers signaling no pick up here,  Investec said, cutting its price target on the stock. Sodexo (EXHO.PA), the world's second-biggest catering services firm after Compass Group (CPG.L), also cut its sales growth goal following weaker-than-expected third quarter results, sending its stock down 6 percent to a 14-week low.  Compass' shares fell nearly 2 percent. Some earning updates struck a more positive note. Associated British Foods (ABF.L) rose 2.6 percent, among top gainers in Europe, after the company said its full-year outlook had marginally improved after a better-than-expected performance from its Primark clothing chain.  The key divisional figure in this statement, as has become the norm with ABF, is Primark sales growth,  Morgan Stanley said. Banks .SX7P were a bright spot, having been recently underpinned by talk of tightening monetary policy conditions. They were the top-gaining sector, up 0.7 percent. Italian lenders .FTIT8300 were the top performers, up 1.8 percent following a series of deals in the last two weeks that have restored confidence in the sector's prospects. Italy's economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said there were no more  brushfires  threatening other banks after the government wound down two Veneto-based lenders last month in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros. Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) also gained 3.3 percent after a Bloomberg report said that buy-out firm Cerberus was considering buying a minority stake in the German lender through purchases on the market. Stocks sensitive to a rise in interest rates, such as utilities .SX6P, continued to weigh, with the sector down 0.8 percent.

Crude inventories fell 6.3 million barrels in the week to June 30, far more than analysts' forecasts for a 2.3 million-barrel drawdown, to 502.9 million barrels.   U.S. crude imports fell 514,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week as refinery crude runs rose 251,000 bpd and refining utilization rates gained 1.1 percentage points to 93.6 percent of nationwide capacity. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 1.3 million barrels, EIA said. Oil prices rose on the news, reversing Wednesday's selloff as the data will help assuage concerns about weak demand keeping inventories high during the key summer months.

Gasoline stocks fell 3.7 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.1 million-barrel drop. Although gasoline inventories have dropped to 237.3 million barrels, that figure is still 6 percent higher than the five-year average, and demand over the past four weeks is down 1.8 percent from a year ago.  Gasoline demand continues to be down versus last year, taking away some of the bullish aspects of the report.

Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 1.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 217,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed down 0.4 percent at 7,337.28 points among health and consumer staples shares fell. Both sectors are sensitive to interest rates changes. More hawkish central bank comments and the minutes from the European Central Bank's latest policy meeting support the view that the ECB was open to a further step towards reducing stimulus. Among consumer stocks, Reckitt Benckiser fell around 1.5 percent after cutting its growth forecast. The consumer goods giant was targeted in a worldwide attack which crippled computers at several multinational companies on June 27 . Research shows cyber-security breaches can erode companies' share prices permanently. Mining stocks also fell, dropping 0.9 percent, led by a 2.5 percent decline in Glencore's shares. Glencore giant signed a major cobalt deal with a Chinese firm . Banks gained, since they would benefit from higher interest rates. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds were rose between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent. AB Foods rose 2.6 percent after reporting a better outlook thanks to an improved performance from budget clothing chain Primark. Marks & Spencer followed it higher with a 1.3 percent rise, although Next fell as it went ex-dividend.  Some people have been thinking that the consumer is just going to go completely underground, but the evidence is that good companies that have the right offer at the right price can grow very strongly,  said Jonathan Pritchard, retail analyst at Peel Hunt. Investors and analysts expect British consumers to swap to cheaper goods as inflation rises, something that could help low-margin companies offering budget prices offset higher import costs as a result of sterling's weakness.  AB Foods have found more mitigation than they expected and that's because they have got volume growth, which helps their bargaining position with suppliers,  Pritchard said. Merger and acquisition news drove gains on the small-cap index, which outperformed larger stocks to close flat.

BeiGene's shares rose as much as 31.4 percent to an all-time high of $68.67 in afternoon trading on Thursday. Celgene's shares were marginally down. The deal announced on Wednesday will complement Celgene's partnership with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) to develop durvalumab as a treatment for hematological malignancies and expand the drug developer's presence in China's untapped cancer market. BeiGene's advanced tumor cancer therapy, BGB-A317, is a type of antibody that belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. The treatment has been tested in more than 500 patients, with initial data suggesting that it is well-tolerated and exhibits anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumor types, the companies said.  We believe Celgene's ability to combine approved therapies in-house with either durvalumab or BGB-A317 provides the company flexibility during development and commercialization,  William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said in a client note. BeiGene will get $263 million in upfront license fees and $150 million in equity investment. The company will also be eligible to receive up to $980 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. This is a  shockingly good  deal for BeiGene as it monetizes a market that is virtually impenetrable to all but the largest pharma players in the cancer space, Baird analyst Brian Skorney said. Last month, Hutchison China MediTech (HCM.L), the Shanghai-based drugmaker listed in London and commonly known as Chi-Med, filed a marketing application for its cancer drug fruquintinib with the China Food and Drug Administration. Chi-Med is developing the treatment for advanced colorectal cancer in collaboration with U.S. drug developer Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N). BeiGene will acquire Celgene's operations in China and also license and assume commercial responsibility for Celgene's approved therapies - Abraxane, Revlimid and Vidaza - in the region. Celgene will acquire 32.7 million of BeiGene's ordinary shares at $4.58, or $59.55 per BeiGene's American Depositary Shares (ADS), the companies said.

Oleksandr Danylyuk told Reuters that the complexity of the pension reform plan, which is key to unlocking its next round of IMF financing, was the main reason why it would not be completed in the next couple of weeks, as it had hoped.  It doesn't look like it is going to happen so they (parliament lawmakers) will have to finish the work in early fall (autumn),  Danylyuk said in an interview.  We need to invest more time in communication ... both in the public domain but also within the parliament. Yes, the parliament is pretty much ready to vote for it but everybody needs to comfortable.  That would have the knock-on effect of delaying its IMF program.  Whenever we complete it we will get the (IMF) tranche,  he said. It will also affect the timing of its first return to debt markets since its 2015 bailout. Back in May, Danylyuk said it was eyeing a $1 billion bond sale but it appears like the ambitions have been scaled back somewhat.  I think $500 million will go,  Danylyuk said, although it could be higher. He added it would be  logical  to wait until pension reforms were finalised.  For us it is important to be ready and we are ready. We are in a position to issue tomorrow, as by the way we could have done it back in April. The question is do we need it and if we expedite the process, what would we get from that.  Danylyuk said the nomination of a new central bank governor, another issue markets are following closely, was  pretty much imminent .  On the recent cost of cyber attacks that have hit the Ukraine's tax department, power firms and ministries, including the finance ministry, he played down estimates that it could be as much as 0.5 percent of Ukraine's annual GDP.       I don't think it will be that high at all,  Danylyuk said. Ukraine's finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk speaks to a Reuters journalist during an interview in London, Britain July 5, 2017.Hannah McKayMore broadly, Ukraine is still trying to recover from Russia's annexation of its Crimea region in early 2014 and tackle corruption that has long blighted the country. The central bank said in March that the economic blockade of territory held by Russian-backed separatists in the east would drag 2017 economic growth down to 1.9 percent from an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent. Privatbank Slideshow (5 Images)Kiev has nationalized large parts of its banking system to try to stamp out corruption but keep the system running, as a number of international banks have withdrawn. Ukraine is taking legal action to recover loans made by the country's largest, and now nationalized, lender, PrivatBank, many of which were paid out to businesses linked to former shareholders including tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky. After a July 1 deadline to restructure the loans passed, the central bank said on Monday that the authorities had  moved to a legal procedure for the repossession (of the loans) ... the specific steps of which cannot be disclosed now.   Given that the deadline for the restructuring is over...., now we will be much more active in pursuing it,  Danylyuk said.   But how much we will get I don't know. It will not be easy, we know that.  Although there is scarce appetite from buyers at the moment, the longer-term goal will be to return the banks to private ownership at some point.   We are building strategy from Privatbank and then we will come up with the view for the whole banking system. But the fundamentals are clear: reduce the (government's) share.  It currently owns 55 percent of the system via its various holdings but wants to slash that.  There were some numbers - 25 percent... I do not justify 25 percent, it could be 10 percent. As a minister I am not looking to keep 25 percent of the banking system in state ownership, there is no justification for that.

The report from Britain's most powerful financial lobby group said continental Europe might eventually become the preferred destination for banks, insurers and asset managers as they relocate business there to retain access to the EU single market.  Although companies may begin by initially shifting a small number of jobs to Europe this may begin to accelerate when property leases expire, they carry out business reviews, or when the cost of capital becomes uneconomical.    Shifts out of the UK may gradually erode the 'cluster effect' of the financial ecosystem, with the threat of a tipping point in the ecosystem being reached,  the group said in a 83-page document outlining how the industry can thrive over the next decade. Securing a favorable deal for financial services from the Brexit negotiations is one of the biggest challenges for the British government because it is its largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax. Britain's finance industry could lose up to 38 billion pounds ($49 billion) in revenue in a so-called  hard Brexit  that would restrict its access to the EU single market, according to some estimates. The report said the government must ensure businesses can recruit people to fill skill gaps and must simplify the process of getting a visa. Brexit has already made it harder to attract people to Britain and the government is introducing policies making immigration more restrictive and expensive, the report said.   FILE PHOTO: Workers walk to work during the morning rush hour in the financial district of Canary Wharf in London, Britain, January 26, 2017.Eddie KeoghIt said the cost of hiring an employee on a five-year visa has risen by 250 percent to 7,000 pounds over the last year and the minimum salary a business may recruit staff for a visa has risen by almost half since 2015. Aside from Brexit, the report also looks at broader issues that threaten the competitiveness of the City of London as financial services hub, including a need to invest in transport networks and technology. It calls for government and financial services to work together closely to develop international trade policies and to improve the country's digital and physical infrastructure, including speeding up travel times between airports and different financial centers around Britain.  One financial services industry veteran who had independent access to the report said it lacked urgency and there was too little on the impact of Britain leaving the EU given that  Brexit is a catastrophe for the City.   Mark Hoban, a former financial services minister who chaired the report, said that Brexit was only one of several challenges facing financial services.   The challenges facing financial services are much more than just about Brexit. It is about emerging financial centers and also, to a degree, about unmet needs in the UK as well,  Hoban told Reuters.  There is a very clear appetite to tackle these issues at various levels of government.   ($1 = 0.7748 pounds) Reporting By Andrew MacAskill and Huw Jones.

A long-time critic of the ECB's ultra-loose policy, Weidmann said that low borrowing costs are still needed, but the threat of deflation, the main justification for the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro bond buying scheme is now a distant one and growth is becoming broad based. The comments suggest that Weidmann will continue to advocate a more hawkish stance, even after a small shift in the bank's tone last week pushed yields and the euro sharply higher, raising the risk that tighter financing would dampen growth.  The ongoing economic recovery now raises the prospect of a monetary policy normalisation,  Weidmann said.  This is not about a full braking ... but taking our foot somewhat off the gas.  Minutes of the ECB's June interest rate meeting, published on Thursday, indicated that policymakers debated giving up their bias for even bigger asset buys but decided against the move, arguing that any change in the bank's language should be 'very gradual'. ECB President Mario Draghi stirred markets last week when he said that better growth would in itself provide support to the economy so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged. This fuelled speculation that policymakers could decide as early as September to reduce asset purchases from next year.  The timing and rate of monetary policy normalisation depends on the extent to which price rises are sustainable and self-sustaining,  Weidmann added. He also argued that while growth is becoming increasingly robust, declining oil prices will be a drag on inflation and price growth could be 'somewhat' lower by the end of the year. The ECB has fallen short of its inflation target of 2 percent for more than four years and projections show it will not reach its objective at least through 2019.

Completing a picture can take Rathbone hours or even days, and even a tiny mistake can result in significant effort going to waste, as errors are extremely difficult to remove or cover. Rathbone said that her unusual artistic discipline means that at times she sees her surroundings in typographic terms.  So, I'll be looking at you and seeing bracket, bracket, bracket... or, yeah, my eye gets more honed in and I'll be thinking 'I', 'I', hyphen , she said. Rathbone began typewriter art in 2003, and has had her work exhibited in galleries around the UK. Though she focuses on street scenes now, in her early career she did portraits of high-profile figures and close-ups of eyes.

Air India's international operations would bring a very important element to our network,  Rahul Bhatia, co-founder of IndiGo, said on a call with investors.  It would provide rapid entry into restricted and in some cases closed international markets.   IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe (INGL.NS), last week expressed interest in buying a stake in state-owned Air India, after India's cabinet gave  in-principle  approval to privatize the carrier. Shares in IndiGo fell as much as 5.6 percent the day after this announcement, with analysts citing concern about such an investment given Air India's heavy debt burden.  We continue to like Indigo for its efficient cost structure and balance-sheet strength. However, potential acquisition of AI may create an overhang on the stock,  Joseph George, analyst at brokerage firm IIFL, said in a note published last week. Air India, once the country's biggest airline, has seen its domestic market share slump to 13 percent as private rivals such as IndiGo and SpiceJet (SPJT.BO) have expanded.  Air India's businesses include domestic flights, repair and maintenance operations and hotels. But its most sought-after asset is landing slots on international routes. The possibility of the government writing off part or all of Air India's $8 billion in debt could increase its appeal. Bhatia said that the company's operations would  require significant restructuring . He also said IndiGo would not be willing to take on any debt that could not be supported by a restructured Air India operation. The carrier is also wary of doing a deal if the government holds on to any minority or majority stake in Air India.  Low-Cost, Long-Haul IndiGo, which flies four of every 10 Indian domestic passengers, launched in 2006 and has expanded rapidly in India's booming aviation market, prioritizing domestic routes. In May, the carrier said it planned to start flying smaller planes to second-tier towns and cities this year, giving a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme to make it cheaper for people to fly within India.  IndiGo has a fleet of 131 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 aircraft, and has placed a provisional order for 50 ATR 72-600 aircraft from European turboprop maker ATR for regional flights. Even without any deal with Air India, IndiGo plans to enter the long-haul international market, Rakesh Gangwal, co-founder of IndiGo, said.   It makes fundamental economic sense for us to enter the long-haul international market. India's market is significantly underserved in non-stop international destinations,  he said, adding that IndiGo would do so with a low-cost model.

The pan-European STOXX 600  ended the session 0.7 percent lower, recovering some of its losses with all but three sectors closing in negative territory. Euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E also hit an 11-week low, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.4 percent.  There was nothing in the (June ECB) press conference that suggested that they talked about curtailing QE. But in fact they did,  said AFS analyst Arne Petimezas in Amsterdam. A series of earnings updates were also in focus with Sodexo (EXHO.PA) leading fallers and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) also weak after both companies cut their guidance. Reckitt (RB.L) was down 1.5 percent, making it one of the biggest weights on the STOXX. The UK consumer goods group cut its growth forecast after a global cyber attack last month disrupted business in multiple markets.  We would not see weakness in the share price today as a buying opportunity. Reckitt's markets are likely to have remained sluggish, with peers signaling no pick up here,  Investec said, cutting its price target on the stock. Sodexo (EXHO.PA), the world's second-biggest catering services firm after Compass Group (CPG.L), also cut its sales growth goal following weaker-than-expected third quarter results, sending its stock down 6 percent to a 14-week low.  Compass' shares fell nearly 2 percent. Some earning updates struck a more positive note. Associated British Foods (ABF.L) rose 2.6 percent, among top gainers in Europe, after the company said its full-year outlook had marginally improved after a better-than-expected performance from its Primark clothing chain.  The key divisional figure in this statement, as has become the norm with ABF, is Primark sales growth,  Morgan Stanley said. Banks .SX7P were a bright spot, having been recently underpinned by talk of tightening monetary policy conditions. They were the top-gaining sector, up 0.7 percent. Italian lenders .FTIT8300 were the top performers, up 1.8 percent following a series of deals in the last two weeks that have restored confidence in the sector's prospects. Italy's economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said there were no more  brushfires  threatening other banks after the government wound down two Veneto-based lenders last month in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros. Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) also gained 3.3 percent after a Bloomberg report said that buy-out firm Cerberus was considering buying a minority stake in the German lender through purchases on the market. Stocks sensitive to a rise in interest rates, such as utilities .SX6P, continued to weigh, with the sector down 0.8 percent.

Surveys of purchasing managers pointing to a cooling economy have put some pressure on the pound this week, but it is still less than a cent away from nine-month highs reached against the dollar in May. That resilience, say analysts, is largely due to expectations of monetary tightening from the BoE, with some investors betting on a rate hike as soon as next month after a number of policymakers have spoken out in favour of one. By late afternoon trade in London, sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.2967. But it lost ground to a strengthening euro following a round of weaker-than-expected U.S. labour market data that pulled the dollar lower. Sterling last traded 0.2 percent down at 87.98 pence per euro.  Analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that despite data pointing to weakness following June's parliamentary elections they were  loving  sterling, and noted that  soft  indicators such as purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys had also dipped immediately after last year's Brexit vote, before recovering.   Our sterling optimism finds its foundation in what we call 'Brexit economics' and the BoE reconsidering pound weakness and its impact on the economy,  they wrote.  Sterling weakness has undermined living standards, and with inflation above the BoE's 2 percent target and its own staff projections, stabilisation should now be on the BoE's agenda. Talking up rate expectations is a sufficient tool to reach this target.  But some investors remain unconvinced the BoE will move on rates soon, citing underlying risks to the UK economy as it negotiates an exit from the European Union, and the change in the Bank's rate-setting committee. Kristin Forbes, once the BoE's strongest advocate for a hike in rates, has left the central bank. She is replaced by trade-focused economist Silvana Tenreyro, considered a dove by some analysts.  I don't buy in to the new-found hawkish position of the Bank of England. Firstly, I think the risks are too great for anymore of the remaining MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) members to join them,  said Bank of New York Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor.  The mix of hawks is going to change anyway, because one of the MPC members who voted for a hike is now gone, replaced - I think - by a dove...I think there will be a surprise in the next MPC BoE meeting.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects the company's thin, albeit improving, capitalisation, as well as a track record of profitability over the last 5 years, a strong position in the domestic market and sound investment quality compared with peers. Under Fitch's Prism Factor-Based model AlfaStrakhovanie's capital score remained below 'Somewhat Weak' in 2016, though improved on the 2015 score. Significant profit generation, coupled with an absence of dividend payments to the shareholder, supported the company's available capital. However, the level of required capital has increased due to significant net non-life premium growth of 15% in 2016. AlfaStrakhovanie's regulatory solvency margin was 103% at end-2016, down from 149% at end-2015. Exchange rate movements reduced the company's available capital while growing business volumes increased required capital. At end-1Q17 the regulatory solvency margin was restored to a more comfortable level of 120% and Fitch expects AlfaStrakhovanie to remain compliant with regulatory solvency requirements and to maintain the solvency margin above 120% at end-2017. In 2016 the company reported a strong net profit of RUB3 billion, up from RUB2.5 billion in 2015. Return on equity was maintained at an exceptionally high level of 29.3% (2015: 34.2%). Robust investment income of RUB6 billion and a positive underwriting result supported the company's profitability. Adversely the net result was impacted by the revaluation of the Russian rouble and related FX losses on investments amounting to RUB2.7 billion. AlfaStrakhovanie in 1Q17 maintained its uptrend in profitability, with net income totalling RUB1 billion based on local GAAP. In 2016 the company reported a positive non-life underwriting result of RUB2.6 billion, reversing an underwriting loss of RUB384 million in 2015. The combined ratio fell to 95% (2015: 101%). The main contributor was an improvement in the company's loss ratio to 56% in 2016 from 60% in 2015. AlfaStrakhovanie reported an improved underwriting result in all major lines of business it operates in for 2016, with motor insurance being the main driver behind its stronger underwriting profitability. The company's loss ratio for this line decreased to 72% in 2016 from 77% in 2015, in contrast to the overall Russian motor insurance market which saw larger losses over the year. AlfaStrakhovanie has gradually strengthened its market position through acquisitions and organic growth in recent years, with its share of the Russian non-life insurance market excluding obligatory medical insurance growing to 7.9% from 6.6% over 2016. The evolution of the non-life business mix has been gradual in the last five to seven years, with a slight predominance of motor lines in its portfolio up to 2016. The share of compulsory motor third-party liability (MTPL) and motor damage in gross written premiums grew to 45% in 2016. AlfaStrakhovanie's investment portfolio is of sound credit quality and liquidity from a domestic perspective. Non-investment-grade bonds increased sharply in 2016 and in 2015 as a share of the insurer's equity due to a downgrade of the Russian sovereign rating in 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be upgraded if AlfaStrakhovanie strengthens its risk-adjusted capital position to at least a 'Somewhat Weak' score under Fitch's Prism model and maintains a positive non-life underwriting result and a healthy regulatory solvency margin on a sustained basis. The ratings could be downgraded if AlfaStrakhovanie reports negative earnings on a sustained basis or if its capitalisation as measured by Prism weakens significantly. A downgrade could also result from deterioration in its regulatory solvency margin.

Surveys of purchasing managers pointing to a cooling economy have put some pressure on the pound this week, but it is still less than a cent away from nine-month highs reached against the dollar in May. That resilience, say analysts, is largely due to expectations of monetary tightening from the BoE, with some investors betting on a rate hike as soon as next month after a number of policymakers have spoken out in favour of one. By late afternoon trade in London, sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.2967. But it lost ground to a strengthening euro following a round of weaker-than-expected U.S. labour market data that pulled the dollar lower. Sterling last traded 0.2 percent down at 87.98 pence per euro.  Analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that despite data pointing to weakness following June's parliamentary elections they were  loving  sterling, and noted that  soft  indicators such as purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys had also dipped immediately after last year's Brexit vote, before recovering.   Our sterling optimism finds its foundation in what we call 'Brexit economics' and the BoE reconsidering pound weakness and its impact on the economy,  they wrote.  Sterling weakness has undermined living standards, and with inflation above the BoE's 2 percent target and its own staff projections, stabilisation should now be on the BoE's agenda. Talking up rate expectations is a sufficient tool to reach this target.  But some investors remain unconvinced the BoE will move on rates soon, citing underlying risks to the UK economy as it negotiates an exit from the European Union, and the change in the Bank's rate-setting committee. Kristin Forbes, once the BoE's strongest advocate for a hike in rates, has left the central bank. She is replaced by trade-focused economist Silvana Tenreyro, considered a dove by some analysts.  I don't buy in to the new-found hawkish position of the Bank of England. Firstly, I think the risks are too great for anymore of the remaining MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) members to join them,  said Bank of New York Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor.  The mix of hawks is going to change anyway, because one of the MPC members who voted for a hike is now gone, replaced - I think - by a dove...I think there will be a surprise in the next MPC BoE meeting.

Sharing the risk of student loan defaults with for-profit education firms is a way to fine-tune the so-called Fies program, which was created to make it easier for low-income students to attend private universities, Mendonça said at an event in Brasilia. The government, which will offer at least 300,000 Fies loan contracts per year from 2018 under the new rules, will not entirely remove subsidies, Mendonça said, adding that as many as 100,000 loans will have zero interest. Shares of Brazil's listed for-profit education companies fell, reflecting investor concern over the reliance on Fies and that the companies will assume risk as student delinquencies rise. Default rates under the old Fies format neared 47 percent, from an expected 10 percent, according to slides at Mendonça's presentation. Estimates on how the overhaul will affect the budget are expected in a few days, Mendonça said. Kroton Educacional SA fell 1.5 percent, while Estácio Participações SA slid 2.3 percent and Ser Educacional SA shed 1.7 percent. Bear the Brunt Mendonça said the National Treasury bore the brunt of default risk, which is not done in other countries with similar programs. The fiscal cost of the Fies program was 32 billion reais ($9.67 billion) last year, 11 times higher than in 2011, the government said. With the government sharing more of the risk with private companies, the firms will need to be more selective on enrolling students, he said. Additional funding for the program will come from constitutionally created regional funds, state development lender BNDES and private-sector banks. Still, a mechanism will be introduced to increase private-college allocations to a fund known as FGEDUC, which guarantees the loans. The private operators will be required to cover default losses if delinquencies rise above predetermined levels of between 20 percent and 25 percent. Some 150,000 of the annual Fies loan contracts will have a 3 percent interest rate. The rate on the remainder of the loans has yet to be decided.

Crude inventories fell 6.3 million barrels in the week to June 30, far more than analysts' forecasts for a 2.3 million-barrel drawdown, to 502.9 million barrels.   U.S. crude imports fell 514,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week as refinery crude runs rose 251,000 bpd and refining utilization rates gained 1.1 percentage points to 93.6 percent of nationwide capacity. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 1.3 million barrels, EIA said. Oil prices rose on the news, reversing Wednesday's selloff as the data will help assuage concerns about weak demand keeping inventories high during the key summer months.  U.S. crude futures rose $1.03 to $46.17 a barrel, a 2.3 percent increase, while Brent futures were up $1.03 to $48.82 a barrel by 11:22 a.m. EDT (1522 GMT). Gasoline stocks fell 3.7 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.1 million-barrel drop. Although gasoline inventories have dropped to 237.3 million barrels, that figure is still 6 percent higher than the five-year average, and demand over the past four weeks is down 1.8 percent from a year ago.  Gasoline demand continues to be down versus last year, taking away some of the bullish aspects of the report. With the Fourth of July holiday behind us, demand will remain lackluster,  said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  Refinery crude runs rose by 251,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed.  Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 1.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 217,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. Crude production rose markedly, rebounding from storm-related effects that reduced output for the prior week. Overall production rose to 9.34 million bpd, up 88,000 bpd from the week-earlier period.

The Brazilian real weakened 0.4 percent, the biggest decliner among Latin American currencies, which were mostly flat. The Colombian peso, however, strengthened 0.3 percent, tracking rising crude oil futures.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.7 percent, weighed down by blue-chips such as lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and beverage producer Ambev SA. Shares of miner Vale SA also fell on the back of lower iron ore prices.     Still, the index's losses were limited by a rally in shares of power utilities after the government announced that plans to overhaul power sector rules could lead to higher rates and lower taxes.     Shares of state-controlled utility Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, which would benefit directly from the revamp, soared as much as 15 percent, their biggest daily increase in four years.

The consumer price index (CPI) showed prices rose 4.4 percent in June in year-on-year terms, above analysts' expectations for a rise of 4.1 percent in a Reuters poll.     Annual inflation, which picked up from 4.1 percent in May, was mostly driven by higher food prices, data from the statistics service showed, as Russia's harvest was dented by unusually cold weather.     Food prices rose 1 percent on the year in June compared with just a 0.1 percent increase in the same month a year ago.      That appears to be due to fruit and vegetable inflation,  Capital Economics research firm said.     Inflation, which stood at 0.6 percent in monthly terms, also exceeded expectations of the economy ministry that forecast prices would grow by 4.0-4.1 percent in year-on-year terms and by 0.3-0.4 percent in month-on-month terms.     The head of the central bank's monetary policy department, Igor Dmitriev, said the June inflation reading became a  negative surprise .      Dmitriev, however, said it was too early to say if higher inflation boosts chances that the central bank would avoid cutting rates at its next policy meeting in late July.      The central bank is closely watching developments around consumer prices, saying its number one goal for this year is to bring and stabilise inflation at 4 percent.     Despite the latest pick up in pace of prices growth, the central bank may still reach its 2017 target as core inflation, which does not include prices for food and fuel as well as utility tariffs, slowed to 3.5 percent in June, analysts say.     Russian central bank could still trim the key rate by 25 basis points from its current level of 9 percent at its next board meeting, said Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at ING Bank in Moscow.       Its actual reaction will mostly depend on to what extent the rise in food prices and the recent rouble weakness feeds through to households' inflation expectations,  Polevoy said, referring to the central bank.

The Long-Term Local-Currency (LC) IDR is affirmed at 'BBB'. The Outlooks on the FC and LC IDRs are Stable. The upgrade of the FC IDR and senior unsecured rating to 'BBB' reflects the strong implied and proven support of The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) ('A+'/Negative). CCI enjoys a strong operational and strategic relationship with TCCC, which owns 20.1% of CCI and exercises a large degree of influence over major decisions. In the absence of a formal guarantee from TCCC we believe that CCI could rely on TCCC regarding other financial support in case of need. Consequently, Fitch assesses transfer and convertibility risk as low in line with Fitch's ratings criteria,  Rating Non-Financial Corporates above the Country Ceiling , dated February 2017. The 'BBB' IDRs reflect CCI's solid industry operating profile, the quality of its brand portfolio, growth capability in Turkey and the Middle East, and its consistent history of pricing power and profit margin stability through various economic cycles. We expect CCI to maintain a conservative balance sheet with FFO adjusted leverage trending to 3.0x to mitigate the inherent profit/debt mismatch by currency, and its exposure to geopolitical events.

As the fifth-largest bottler for TCCC, CCI's strong brands and relative pricing power lead to resilience against economic downturns and political instability. Growth stems from its high brand awareness, changing consumer tastes, increasing middle-class incomes, favourable demographics and growing economies. Strong Implied Support: CCI has a strong operational and strategic relationship with TCCC, which owns 20.1% of CCI and exercises considerable influence over major decisions. Moreover in the absence of a formal guarantee from TCCC we believe that CCI could rely on TCCC regarding other financial support in case of need. Fitch assesses transfer and convertibility risk as low due to the strong implied support from TCCC considering its past record of support for CCI and its other bottlers, especially in less developed economies. Consumer Health Trend: Health and wellness trends have resulted in a structural shift away from consumption of sugar sparkling soft drinks. CCI is experiencing a contraction in the volume of sparkling beverages in its core market (Turkey), where sales decreased by 2% in 2016. In contrast, the consumption of still beverages, which altogether represented 29% of 2016 group sales, increased in Turkey by 7% in 2016, an underlying trend which we expect will continue. Fitch expects CCI to address such changes in consumer preferences through innovation in its portfolio in favour of healthier alternatives, and focusing on smaller packaging sizes. Geopolitical Events Limit Growth: Factors that constrain the rating are the events and instability that can hinder what would otherwise be strong top-line growth in its key markets. However, CCI continues to demonstrate its ability to operate under challenging conditions, consistently achieving double-digit revenue growth since 2003, apart from in 2016. We currently assume double-digit sales growth in 2017 partly driven by inflation, and high single digit sales expansion in 2018. Stable Cash-Flow Generation:  FFO margin has averaged 13% over the past five years and Fitch expects it to remain steady, demonstrating the stability of the underlying business model. Over the past five years, CCI generated TRY3.9 billion in cash flow from operations and has adjusted its capex and dividends through the cycle, spending TRY3.0 billion on capex (of which about two thirds is growth) and TRY355 million in dividends. We expect its FCF margin to average 4.8% to 2018. Deleveraging Capacity: We expect FFO adjusted net leverage to fall to around 1.6x by 2018 (gross leverage below 2.5x), partly resulting from expected debt repayments but also profit expansion, demonstrating its deleveraging capacity. In our base case projections we assume that dividends are maintained at a steady payout of 35%. We do not factor in any major acquisitions. Therefore we expect CCI to build up its financial headroom under the current rating over the rating horizon. Management's target is to maintain net debt:EBITDA below 2.0x, which we believe is achievable. DERIVATION SUMMARY CCI is the fifth-largest bottler in the Coca-Cola system and the highest-rated corporate in Turkey, benefiting from support from TCCC, a conservatively managed balance sheet and a record of consistent profit growth and of resilience against past and present macroeconomic challenges. CCI has strong credit ratios for the ratings and relative to other Coca-Cola bottlers, with funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage at 2.3x and FFO fixed charge cover of 6.1x at 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -USD/TRY exchange rate at 3.7 at end December 2017, and 3.9 from 2018 onwards; -Turkish volumes to grow in the low single digits with the average selling price (ASP) rising at average of 6% for  2017 and  2018; -international volumes to grow in the low single digits combined with an increase in the ASP (including foreign-currency depreciation) of 1.5%-2.0% per annum for 2017-2020; -consolidated EBITDA margin at around 14.8% for the period 2017-2020 (2016:15.5%); -positive free cash flow (FCF after dividends) after capex at 8.5% of net sales (50% maintenance) but dividends capped at 35% of distributable net income; -minimal M&A; spending. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - As the highest-rated corporate in Turkey, an upgrade of the IDRs is unlikely due to CCI's limited scale, diversification and forex exposure Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action For the LC IDR - A material permanent deterioration in FCF generation or large acquisition leading to FFO adjusted net leverage above 2.5x for an extended period along with FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x - Diminishing of CCI's strategic or operational ties with TCCC or geopolitical developments affecting TCCC's international operations - Adverse impact of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira on the company's credit metrics not accompanied by adequate cash preservation measures such as dividend and capex reduction For the FC IDR - A downward revision of the Country Ceiling for Turkey, which would lead to a downgrade of the sovereign's and CCI's FC IDRs LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Liquidity was supported by unrestricted cash (as defined by Fitch) of TRY1,286 million at end-2016, approximately USD 1.3 billion in undrawn uncommitted (as typical in Turkey) bank lines, as well as strong relationship with both local and international banks. Liquidity is supported by our expectation of positive FCF (forecast above TRY300 million per annum post dividends). CCI's next major debt maturity is in 2018 when TRY1,887 million becomes due.

Air India's international operations would bring a very important element to our network,  Rahul Bhatia, co-founder of IndiGo, said on a call with investors.  It would provide rapid entry into restricted and in some cases closed international markets.   IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe (INGL.NS), last week expressed interest in buying a stake in state-owned Air India, after India's cabinet gave  in-principle  approval to privatize the carrier. Shares in IndiGo fell as much as 5.6 percent the day after this announcement, with analysts citing concern about such an investment given Air India's heavy debt burden.  We continue to like Indigo for its efficient cost structure and balance-sheet strength. However, potential acquisition of AI may create an overhang on the stock,  Joseph George, analyst at brokerage firm IIFL, said in a note published last week. Air India, once the country's biggest airline, has seen its domestic market share slump to 13 percent as private rivals such as IndiGo and SpiceJet (SPJT.BO) have expanded.  Air India's businesses include domestic flights, repair and maintenance operations and hotels. But its most sought-after asset is landing slots on international routes. The possibility of the government writing off part or all of Air India's $8 billion in debt could increase its appeal. Bhatia said that the company's operations would  require significant restructuring . He also said IndiGo would not be willing to take on any debt that could not be supported by a restructured Air India operation. The carrier is also wary of doing a deal if the government holds on to any minority or majority stake in Air India.  Low-Cost, Long-Haul IndiGo, which flies four of every 10 Indian domestic passengers, launched in 2006 and has expanded rapidly in India's booming aviation market, prioritizing domestic routes. In May, the carrier said it planned to start flying smaller planes to second-tier towns and cities this year, giving a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme to make it cheaper for people to fly within India.  IndiGo has a fleet of 131 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 aircraft, and has placed a provisional order for 50 ATR 72-600 aircraft from European turboprop maker ATR for regional flights. Even without any deal with Air India, IndiGo plans to enter the long-haul international market, Rakesh Gangwal, co-founder of IndiGo, said.   It makes fundamental economic sense for us to enter the long-haul international market. India's market is significantly underserved in non-stop international destinations,  he said, adding that IndiGo would do so with a low-cost model.

In a media conference call, Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the dealer lobbying organization, said sales should dip to 16.8 million units in 2018 and then be within a range of 16.5 million units to 16.8 million units through 2020. After a record 17.55 million units sold in 2016, the U.S. auto industry has posted declining sales for the last four months, with high consumer discounts and inventory levels  posing concerns for Wall Street. A glut of nearly new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles is expected to pose a challenge to new vehicle sales. Sales of sedans have been particularly weak as consumers have increasingly shifted toward pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Szakaly said consumer discounts are focused heavily on the less-popular models.  We do expect incentives to rise this year, especially as off-lease (sales) begin to exert further downward pressure on sedan pricing throughout the rest of 2017,  he said. Tackling high inventory levels should help automakers meet the NADA's sales forecast, Szakaly added.  If we see inventories level off into September and throughout the third quarter, I think it will be a very strong sign that the industry has made the right decisions... and we should easily make our 17.1 million sales number,  Szakaly said.

Assuming the panel agrees with the initial case team's conclusions, it could pave the way for the European Commission to issue a decision against Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google by the end of the year. The Commission in April last year charged Google with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals following a complaint by lobby group FairSearch, U.S.-based ad-blocking and privacy firm Disconnect Inc, Portuguese apps store Aptoide and Russia's Yandex (YNDX.O). The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favoring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world's most popular internet search engine because of Android's huge growth potential. The potential fine is expected to top that 2.4 billion euro penalty. The EU's charge sheet issued to Google in April last year said the anti-competitive practices started from January 2011 and the Commission is likely to tell the company to stop them. They are still ongoing, telecoms industry sources said. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Google both declined to comment. The EU ruling has the scope to do the most damage compared with a third case against Google's AdSense, Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies, said in a recent note.  If Google was forced to unbundle Google Play from its other Digital Life services, handset makers and operators would be free to set whatever they like by default potentially triggering a decline in the usage of Google's services,  he said, referring to Google's apps store. A 3D printed Android logo is seen in front of a displayed cyber code in this illustration taken March 22, 2016.Dado Ruvic/IllustrationTaking a Toll The long-running case is taking its toll on users and rivals, FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said.  A decision would come none too soon. Google is hurting Android users, including by surreptitiously commandeering ever-increasing amounts of personal data,  Vinje said.  The EU competition enforcer said Google's tactics include requiring smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser in return for access to other Google apps, and barring the manufacturers from using rival versions of Android. The company was also accused of paying smartphone makers and mobile network operators to only install Google Search on their devices. Google said at the time that Android was a remarkable system based on open-source software and open innovation and was good for competition and for consumers. The Commission had planned to establish a peer review panel, also known as a devil's advocate, in June, the people said.  Such panels are usually made up of three to four experienced officials who examine the case team's conclusions with a fresh pair of eyes to ensure that the case is robust.

The main opposition party said his use of emergency powers was unnecessary and was a ploy to make it easier for police to arrest its supporters. Lungu said the measure would safeguard investments in the country, which is Africa's second-biggest copper producer and is currently in talks with the International Monetary Fund over a financial aid package. He said the IMF was free to terminate the negotiations if it considered his actions wrong.  Political tensions in Zambia, seen as one of Africa's more stable and functional democracies, have been rising since the arrest on treason charges of main opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema in April. He narrowly lost to Lungu in a bruising election last year.  This power (state of emergency) I have invoked is only for seven days,  Lungu said, a day after saying that the fire in the capital was politically motivated arson.  Parliament will within the next seven days determine whether it will be there for one week, one month, three months or six months.  Lungu said the powers would not disrupt normal life, but were aimed at those who posed a danger to public security. Under state of emergency laws, police can prohibit public meetings, detain suspects longer than usual, search without a warrant, close roads, impose curfews and restrict movements. The IMF has been in talks with Zambia over plans for up to $1.3 billion in a three-year credit facility to help plug a budget deficit of around 7 percent.  I don't think the IMF would like to see this country go up into flames. The measures we are taking are intended to safeguard the IMF program, if it comes to be,  he said.   If the IMF feels we have gone beyond the norms of good governance, they are free to go. I am sure the IMF would like to come to a country which is stable. If they think I have gone astray, let them go,  Lungu said in response to a question. Lungu said the fire, which destroyed the southern part of City Market in the capital Lusaka on Tuesday,  bordered on economic sabotage  and was aimed at making the country ungovernable. Nobody was killed or injured in the blaze. Hichilema, along with five others, is accused of trying to overthrow the government after a convoy of vehicles in which he was traveling failed to make way for the president's motorcade.  Lungu said there was no tension in the country but  acts of terrorism , which he blamed on the opposition.   It is a systematic approach by the opposition to stampede us into talks so that we renegotiate the results of the last elections,  he said.   It is a strategy to create terror and panic so that they can say there is tension in the country, let us talk. We follow a system of winner takes all. Don't force us to form a government of national unity,  Lungu said.  'Hidden Agenda'   Hichilema's United Party for National Development (UPND) said it was unnecessary for the president to invoke such powers because the police already have enough power to deal with crime.   For the state to go that route, we think there is a hidden agenda to have more of our members arrested,  UPND spokesman Charles Kakoma said, adding that the party would issue a more comprehensive statement over the next few days.  The police will now find it easier to arrest and indefinitely detain our members.  Unknown people destroyed electricity pylons on a high-voltage line a week ago, leading to a power blackout in some mining areas. Fires have been started in courtrooms and a building belonging to the ministry of education. One analyst said police would target opposition leaders.   It will not be surprising if more UPND leaders are arrested and implicated in acts of sabotage,  said analyst Neo Simuntanyi of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a local research institute.  My fear is that UPND got almost half the votes in the last elections and the impending arrests will only heighten tension by antagonizing almost half the population of the country.

Sales in Canada's largest city fell 37.3 percent last month from a year ago, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said. New listings rose 15.9 percent from last year, though that was slower than the hefty 48.9 percent annual increase in May. The Ontario government introduced a number of measures in late April, including a foreign buyers tax, to try to cool the Toronto housing market amid fears of a bubble. While potential buyers are waiting on the sidelines to gauge the impact of the government's measures, existing owners are listing their homes because they believe price increases may have peaked, TREB's president Tim Syrianos said. The slowdown comes as the Bank of Canada has set the stage for interest rate hikes that could come as soon as next week. Some have blamed low rates for encouraging consumers to take on too much debt and fueling the housing market. Higher rates would likely exaggerate the impact of the Ontario measures on the Toronto market, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.  If we do get 50 basis points of rate hikes over the course of the rest of the year, that chips away at affordability a little bit and probably extends the downturn a bit, especially at the higher end of the market,  Kavcic said. Separate data showing Canadian exports and imports hit record highs in May helped reinforce expectations of hikes on the horizon. The central bank cut rates twice in 2015 during the oil price downturn and has held at 0.50 percent since. The long housing boom in Canada has raised concerns the country could see a painful correction but policymakers have said the ingredients for a U.S.-style crash are not there. The financial regulator said on Thursday it plans to ban some bundled residential mortgages to clamp down on risky lending. The average Toronto home price was C$793,915 ($611,880), up just 6.3 percent from last year, compared with a 14.9 percent annual increase in May. Given Ontario's moves and the possibility of higher rates, TREB forecast 2017 sales at between 89,000 and 100,000 homes, down from 2016's record 113,044 homes.

Security Council statements have to be agreed by all 15-members. It was not immediately clear if the United States would continue to negotiate with Russia in an effort to reach a council consensus on a statement of condemnation. Moscow has said it believes Pyongyang fired an intermediate range ballistic missile on Tuesday, while China has not identified the rocket launched. North Korea said it tested an ICBM and the United States said that was likely true.  The rationale is that based on our (Ministry of Defence's) assessment we cannot confirm that the missile can be classified as an ICBM,  Russia's U.N. mission said in an email to its Security Council colleagues.  Therefore we are not in a position to agree to this classification on behalf of the whole council since there is no consensus on this issue,  the email said. The council met on Wednesday to discuss the missile launch by North Korea, which has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley denounced Russia's reluctance to recognize that North Korea had test-launched an ICBM, which some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii.  If you need any sort of intelligence to let you know that the rest of the world sees this as an ICBM, I'm happy to provide it,  she told the Security Council on Wednesday. The draft statement said the council would start work on  further significant measures  against North Korea. Since 2006 the council has ratcheted up sanctions on Pyongyang in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches. Haley said on Wednesday the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions in coming days and warned that if Russia and China did not support the move, then  we will go our own path.  She said Washington was ready to use force  if we must.   If you are happy with North Korea's actions, veto it. If you want to be a friend to North Korea, veto it,  Haley said of her plan to propose new sanctions.

Activists say intolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people has spiked in recent years in Indonesia and Malaysia, both majority Muslim, multi-ethnic Southeast Asian countries. Perkasa, a group with about 700,000 members that campaigns for the rights of ethnic Malay Muslims, said it agreed with calls this week by Muhammadiyah, Indonesia's second-largest Muslim group, for a boycott of Starbucks over its pro-LGBT stand. Perkasa also agreed with the Indonesian group's call for   Starbucks' operating license to be revoked, it said. Amini Amir Abdullah, who heads Perkasa's Islamic affairs bureau, said Starbucks' position challenged Malaysia's constitution, which recognized Islam as the country's official religion.  Our objection is because they are promoting something that is against the human instinct, against human behavior and against religion. That's why we are against it,  Amini told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  Muhammadiyah's call for a boycott has gained support from the Indonesian Ulema Council, its top clerical body.     The religious groups' opposition to Starbucks came after a video from 2013 circulated online of pro-LGBT comments made by the company's chairman and former chief executive, Howard Schultz. FILE PHOTO: An employee poses with a cup of water at a Starbucks coffeehouse in Austin, Texas, U.S., February 10, 2017.Mohammad Khursheed/File PhotoIn the video, Schultz said Starbucks embraced diversity and  not every decision is an economic decision , in response to a shareholder who complained that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage.  Starbucks Malaysia could not be reached for comment.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain in Indonesia, said in a statement it was not affiliated with any political or ideological groups.  We are grateful and proud to have been a part of local communities in Indonesia for 15 years, always maintaining the deepest respect for, and adherence to, Indonesia's local laws, culture and beliefs,  said Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa, the parent company of PT Sari Coffee Indonesia. Some Muslims in Indonesia, however, said the boycott call would not stop them from buying Starbucks coffee.   I love their products, not their CEO,  said Jakarta resident Kornelius Kamajaya. The boycott call got a similar response from some in Malaysia.  Don't make it such an issue that we have to boycott a company because of one small statement,  said Muhammad Azril Maridzuan, an assistant bank manager in Kuala Lumpur. Muslim groups should not  be so extremist  even though gay rights was against their religious beliefs, he said.

Symantec is paying an undisclosed sum for the Tel Aviv-based company of about 40 employees. Fireglass specializes in an area of security called  browser isolation,  a technology that creates virtual websites allowing users to browse any content without having viruses touch their network.  Browser isolation  is an area that Symantec had been looking to enter for some time, Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview. He cited a Gartner report that projected that 50 percent of enterprises would adopt browser isolation by 2021. Healthcare companies, financial institutions, government and telecommunications firms have been early adopters of the technology, he said.  While it's what I would call a 'tuck-in' acquisition, it will be very valuable to us as we bring it to our customers,  Clark said.

The dollar pulled back after weaker-than-expected U.S. private jobs data affirmed expectations for a gradual pace for U.S. interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Wall Street followed European shares lower as investors saw little reason to buy in a holiday week ahead of the second-quarter earnings reporting season.  It's the lull before earnings. There's not as much enthusiasm for buying,  said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, NC.  Investors don't think companies will surprise as positively as they did in the first quarter.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 89.98 points, or 0.42 percent, to 21,388.19, the S&P; 500 lost 15.04 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,417.5 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 52.43 points, or 0.85 percent, to 6,098.42. Europe's Stoxx 600 index touched its lowest point since April 21 and was last down 0.7 percent MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.3 percent. Some investors were also likely uneasy about geopolitical issues, according to Zaccarelli. A summit of G20 nations this week has taken on greater significance following this week's test of a long-range missile by North Korea. Fund manager Jan Dehn of Ashmore identified a trio of concerns spooking investors, especially in emerging markets, where currencies declined  One is the Middle East and the Qatar-Saudi situation and even the oil market doesn't know how to handle that one,  he said.  The second is North Korea, which is classic geopolitical risk, and finally, and probably most importantly, there has been the recent hawkish tilt from the major central banks and it seems to be coordinated.  Dehn also cited some profit-taking in emerging market assets after a stellar first half to the year. South Africa's rand was down 0.6 percent and Turkey's lira fell 0.5 percent in their second consecutive day of declines. The rand extended Wednesday's 1.6 percent drop driven by proposals to nationalize South Africa's central bank and expropriate land without compensation. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.37 percent, with the euro up 0.44 percent to $1.1402. U.S. Treasury yields rose on the prospect of hawkish global central bank policy and as rising oil prices suggested a potential pickup in inflation. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 15/32 in price to yield 2.3856 percent, from 2.334 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year Treasury bond was off 1-9/32 in price to yield 2.9172 percent, from 2.855 percent. Those yields hit a six-week high of 2.923 percent. Commodity markets continued to swing. Oil recovered some ground after a surprisingly upbeat picture of U.S. demand halted the previous day's 4 percent slide, although the prospect of oversupply in 2018 prompted more analysts to cut price forecasts. U.S. crude rose 2.48 percent to $46.25 per barrel and Brent was last at $48.89, up 2.3 percent on the day. Gold pared losses and was last down 0.2 percent at $1,223.80 an ounce.

While there may be a role for government to play in housing finance, that role should be designed to make future taxpayer bailouts unlikely, Powell said.   We should promote greater competition in this market. The economics of securitization do not require a duopoly,  Powell said.  We ought to do whatever we can to make the possibility of future housing bailouts as remote as possible.

By Stephanie Nebehay and Stephen Kalin GENEVA/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The population of Mosul has endured huge suffering in the war to retake the northern Iraqi city from Islamic State and trauma cases among civilians are sharply rising in the last stages of battle, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Wednesday. The city's basic infrastructure has also been hard hit, with six western districts almost completely destroyed and initial repairs expected to cost more than $1 billion, the United Nations said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped among the shattered buildings in Islamic State's final redoubt in Mosul's Old City by the western bank of the Tigris river, MSF said. Civilians who have managed to get medical treatment are suffering from burns and shrapnel and blast injuries, while many are in need of critical care and are under-nourished, MSF officials said. But there is concern that only a small number of the civilians were getting the medical attention they required.  Really, (there is) a huge level of human suffering,  Jonathan Henry, MSF emergency coordinator in west Mosul, told reporters in Geneva after spending six weeks in Iraq.  This is a massive population that has been traumatized from a very brutal and horrific conflict,  he said. Iraqi commanders have predicted final victory in Mosul this week after a grinding eight-month assault that has pushed Islamic State into a rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters in the city whose population used to be 2 million. A member of the Emergency Response Division holds a a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.Ahmed JadallahInternational charity Save the Children said in a separate report that fighting and years of living under Islamic State have left Mosul's children with dangerous levels of psychological damage. Findings from focus group discussions with 65 children in a displacement camp south of Mosul found that children are so deeply scarred by memories of extreme violence they are living in constant fear for their lives, unable to show emotions, and suffering from vivid  waking nightmares . The loss of loved ones was the biggest cause of distress, with 90 percent reporting the loss of at least one family member through death, separation during their escape, or abduction, the report said. Children said they had seen family members killed in front of them, dead bodies and blood in the streets, and bombs destroying their homes. Others shared stories of family members shot by snipers, blown up by landmines or hit by explosions as they fled. Slideshow (12 Images)In short, Mosul is an  extremely traumatic environment for people to flee from and to return to,  affecting their mental health on a large scale, MSF's Henry said.   The west (of the city) has been heavily destroyed. It's really mass destruction ... similar to the blitz of the Second World War, hospitals have been destroyed, neighborhoods are in ruins.  The battles in the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways is fought house-by-house in streets packed with civilians and planted with multiple explosive devices by the militants, who are also using drones and suicide bombings.     Shrapnel and blast injuries, broken bones from collapsed buildings and burns are the main type of wounds seen by the MSF team of surgeons in west Mosul, Henry said.  Half of the 100 war-wounded over the past two weeks at the MSF 25-bed hospital were women and children in need of critical care and many were malnourished, he said.   But the most urgent patients we feel are not able to leave the conflict area.  About 900,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, taking shelter in camps or with relatives and friends, according the aid group.

Top-rated Germany usually sells bonds with a short maturity relatively easily. It is the euro zone's biggest economy and its benchmark government debt issuer. But two-year bond sales this year have met relatively lacklustre demand. Analysts suspect this is a side effect of the European Central Bank's 2.3 trillion euro stimulus scheme that has helped keep bond yields down -- and their prices high. The bid-to-cover ratio, which measures the degree to which demand exceeds the quantity of bonds allocated has averaged 1.45 at six auctions of two-year paper in the first half of 2017. That is down from 1.83 in the same period last year and marks the weakest first-half for short-dated bond auctions in Germany since 2008, according to calculations based on data from the German debt agency. It also contrasts with generally firmer demand at auctions of longer-dated paper, reflecting investors' search for yield. Tammo Diemer, co-CEO at the German Finanzagentur, the country's debt management agency, said factors such as quantitative easing and post-crisis regulation may lead to a change in auction results.  Auctions for 10- and 30-year Bunds show a very positive trend in 2017,  he said.  Especially 10-year Bunds have delivered strong results in the first half of the year.  Measured over all auctions of Bund securities in 2017, bids exceed the amount offered by the Finanzagentur by 20 percent. Diemer said declining bids for longer-dated bonds in 2015 came when central bank bond-buying focused on short- and medium term-dated maturities and primary dealers -- almost exclusively big banks -- significantly reduced their balance sheets.  This year, auctions at the short end do not perform as they used to, which might be due to the unchanged negative yield environment in those maturities,  he said.  More and more investors seem to be willing to accept higher risks in return for a positive yield, which reduces demand for short-term bonds.  Fading political risks in the euro zone have also dimmed the appeal of safe-haven German bonds. Germany's 2-year Schatz yields around minus 0.60 percent , above record lows hit in February around minus 0.95 percent when worries about French politics peaked. Growing expectations the ECB is moving closer to withdrawing stimulus has also affected demand for short-dated bonds, which are most sensitive to changes in monetary policy, analysts say.  It remains a rich market from an absolute level and it's also a complex segment if you consider the likely discussions around how the ECB is going to end its expansive monetary policy stance in the months ahead,  said DZ Bank rates strategist Christian Lenk.

The European Commission said on Thursday that it had sent three separate charge sheets known as statements of objections to General Electric, Merck KGaA and Canon after investigations showed breaches of the bloc's merger rules. While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of the deals, they could lead to fines of up to 1 percent of global revenue for Merck KGaA and General Electric, and up to 10 percent for Canon.  GE was charged with providing misleading research and development information related to its takeover of Danish rotor blade maker LM Wind this year which secured the EU green light in March. GE's research involved an offshore turbine that generates more than 10 megawatts, larger than the 6-megawatt offshore version that GE currently sells and that it acquired in its purchase of power assets from Alstom.  The research was deemed relevant to both GE's purchase of LM Wind and Siemen's purchase of wind turbine maker Gamesa. The commission and GE are discussing the objections and potential fine, a process expected to last until September or October, according to people familiar with the case.  GE spokesman Jim Healy declined to comment on details of the information GE did not put in its initial application, but said the company  responded forthrightly  to the EU's concern and that GE is  having constructive cooperation  with the commission.  We expect that to continue.

As a result Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) acquired the technology only after a year-long delay. The EU competition enforcer said Canon jumped the gun via a  two-step warehousing move to acquire Toshiba Medical Systems Corp prior to securing regulatory approval. The deal was approved in September 2016.  Companies have to give us full and accurate information, so we can take the right decisions. These decisions require a forward looking assessment,  European Competition Commissioner Margaret Vestige told a news conference.  That includes an assessment of the impact on innovation, an increasingly important part of the economy. And it should be the companies themselves telling us about their future strategies.  GE and Merck KGaA said they acted in good faith while Canon said it would respond in due course.  There was no intent to mislead. When informed of the ECB's concerns, we acted quickly and openly to resolve the issue,  GE said in a statement. Vestige said the companies have until Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 to respond to the charges.

The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 158,000 jobs in June, below the estimated addition of 185,000, suggesting some cooling in the labor market as it nears full employment. The report by payrolls processor ADP acts as a precursor to monthly nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both the public and private sectors.  The market moves significantly on the jobs report. We are expecting to see a little bit of a rebound from last month, but again we didn't get that in the ADP number today which was also expected to be stronger than what it was,  said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims rose for the third straight week, with claims climbing to 248,000, above the 243,000 expected. Bell said ongoing geopolitical worries around North Korea were also adding to the pressure. The United States said it was ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea's nuclear missile program after the country test launched a ballistic missile that could hit Alaska.

A fall in Apple and Microsoft weighed the most on the S&P; and the Nasdaq.

Analysts said traders were still grappling with hawkish comments from the heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England last week, which would be negative for safe-haven government bonds in Europe and the United States.      Those concerns, along with the rising oil prices and traders anticipating that the Fed will begin unwinding its bond holdings later this year, led traders to sell Treasuries even as U.S. June private payrolls data disappointed expectations.       You’re seeing some liquidation as people are trying to wrap their heads around what the central banks have in mind,  said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.     Longer-dated yields were last rising the most among all Treasury maturities, with 30-year yields up about six basis points from Wednesday's closing level at 2.918 percent. Those yields hit a six-week high of 2.923 percent.      Benchmark 10-year yields were last up the second-most on the day, with those yields touching a nearly eight-week high of 2.391 percent.      While shorter-dated yields were not up as much as long-dated yields, they still hit peaks in early trading with two-year yields hitting a more than eight-year high of 1.435 percent and three-year yields touching a roughly 3-1/2-month high of 1.617 percent.      Minutes from the Fed's June meeting on Wednesday showed that several officials wanted to announce a start to the process of reducing the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities by the end of August but others wanted to wait until later in the year.      Most people would say it's pretty clear the Fed is going to start this whole unwinding of the balance sheet,  said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.  That’s not good news by itself for long-end Treasuries.       U.S. five-year Treasury yields hit a more than three-month high of 1.968 percent while seven-year yields  hit an eight-week high of 2.228 percent.      Analysts said rising oil prices also sent longer-dated yields higher. U.S. crude was last up 2.5 percent at $46.25 per barrel.      The private payrolls data came ahead of the Labor Department's broader U.S. June nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs last month, above May's meager 138,000.

The minutes showed ECB rate setters opened the door to dropping from their policy message a long-standing pledge to expand or extend the bank's bond-purchase programme if necessary. It fit with a speech by ECB President Mario Draghi last week that sparked a sharp selloff in bond markets.  One novelty in the minutes and in Draghi's recent speech is there seems to be more tolerance for the current low inflation scenario because they are confident this will go gradually higher in the future,  said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche.  Also, despite the fact they say the adjustment (in policy) will be gradual, they are actually talking about an adjustment -- that's very important.  The market has been pondering the potential tapering of the ECB's two trillion euro bond-buying scheme since Draghi's speech. Although euro zone growth is accelerating, a  steady-hand  policy from the ECB is still needed to revive inflation, its chief economist Peter Praet said on Thursday. Euro zone bond yields were up 7-10 basis points across the curve, with German five, 10 and 30-year government bond yields at their highest level since January last year, while the euro edged higher. The yields on Spanish, Italian and Portuguese 10-year government debt -- seen as most vulnerable to a withdrawal of stimulus because they are bought by the ECB -- were also 10-13 basis points higher. In the United States, Treasury yields rose after an industry report showed the pace of growth in the U.S. economy's service sector accelerated in June. Minutes released on Wednesday of the most recent U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed some policymakers favouring a reduction of the balance sheet within a couple of months.  The bottom line is that more and more investors are growing confident that the Fed will continue its gradual tightening next year,  said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet. Yields may also be affected by large bond sales from France and Spain. France sold 8.5 billions euros of bonds while Spain sold 4.3 billion euros of debt at auction.

By Stephanie Nebehay and Stephen Kalin GENEVA/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The population of Mosul has endured huge suffering in the war to retake the northern Iraqi city from Islamic State and trauma cases among civilians are sharply rising in the last stages of battle, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Wednesday. The city's basic infrastructure has also been hard hit, with six western districts almost completely destroyed and initial repairs expected to cost more than $1 billion, the United Nations said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped among the shattered buildings in Islamic State's final redoubt in Mosul's Old City by the western bank of the Tigris river, MSF said. Civilians who have managed to get medical treatment are suffering from burns and shrapnel and blast injuries, while many are in need of critical care and are under-nourished, MSF officials said. But there is concern that only a small number of the civilians were getting the medical attention they required.  Really, (there is) a huge level of human suffering,  Jonathan Henry, MSF emergency coordinator in west Mosul, told reporters in Geneva after spending six weeks in Iraq.  This is a massive population that has been traumatized from a very brutal and horrific conflict,  he said. Iraqi commanders have predicted final victory in Mosul this week after a grinding eight-month assault that has pushed Islamic State into a rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters in the city whose population used to be 2 million. A member of the Emergency Response Division holds a a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.Ahmed JadallahInternational charity Save the Children said in a separate report that fighting and years of living under Islamic State have left Mosul's children with dangerous levels of psychological damage. Findings from focus group discussions with 65 children in a displacement camp south of Mosul found that children are so deeply scarred by memories of extreme violence they are living in constant fear for their lives, unable to show emotions, and suffering from vivid  waking nightmares . The loss of loved ones was the biggest cause of distress, with 90 percent reporting the loss of at least one family member through death, separation during their escape, or abduction, the report said. Children said they had seen family members killed in front of them, dead bodies and blood in the streets, and bombs destroying their homes. Others shared stories of family members shot by snipers, blown up by landmines or hit by explosions as they fled. Slideshow (12 Images)In short, Mosul is an  extremely traumatic environment for people to flee from and to return to,  affecting their mental health on a large scale, MSF's Henry said.   The west (of the city) has been heavily destroyed. It's really mass destruction ... similar to the blitz of the Second World War, hospitals have been destroyed, neighborhoods are in ruins.  The battles in the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways is fought house-by-house in streets packed with civilians and planted with multiple explosive devices by the militants, who are also using drones and suicide bombings.     Shrapnel and blast injuries, broken bones from collapsed buildings and burns are the main type of wounds seen by the MSF team of surgeons in west Mosul, Henry said.  Half of the 100 war-wounded over the past two weeks at the MSF 25-bed hospital were women and children in need of critical care and many were malnourished, he said.   But the most urgent patients we feel are not able to leave the conflict area.  About 900,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, taking shelter in camps or with relatives and friends, according the aid group.

The board said the window for receiving comments will be open till Dec 31. Modifications to the regulations would be made by March 31 and take effect from April 1, 2018. Lawyers and insolvency professionals maintain that the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a huge step forward from the prior regime. That involved a series of overlapping regulations under which lenders, company promoters and other creditors could initiate competing proceedings in different forums and regions. All the same, some lawyers contend issues exist with the new code that need to be resolved. Among those is an opportunity for borrowers to get a fair hearing before any matters are admitted to tribunals empowered to rule on these cases.  This is a lacuna in the new code and it will need to get addressed,  said a lawyer involved in some ongoing insolvency cases under the new code. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board's move comes just as the new act is set to be tested in some major cases. The Indian government recently empowered its central bank to push banks to begin insolvency proceedings on non-performing assets under the bankruptcy code. And the Reserve Bank of India last month directed lenders to begin proceedings against 12 of the country's largest defaulters .

The European Commission said on Thursday that it had sent three separate charge sheets known as statements of objections to General Electric, Merck KGaA and Canon after investigations showed breaches of the bloc's merger rules. While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of the deals, they could lead to fines of up to 1 percent of global revenue for Merck KGaA and General Electric, and up to 10 percent for Canon.  GE was charged with providing misleading research and development information related to its takeover of Danish rotor blade maker LM Wind this year which secured the EU green light in March. GE's research involved an offshore turbine that generates more than 10 megawatts, larger than the 6-megawatt offshore version that GE currently sells and that it acquired in its purchase of power assets from Alstom.  The research was deemed relevant to both GE's purchase of LM Wind and Siemen's purchase of wind turbine maker Gamesa. The commission and GE are discussing the objections and potential fine, a process expected to last until September or October, according to people familiar with the case.  GE spokesman Jim Healy declined to comment on details of the information GE did not put in its initial application, but said the company  responded forthrightly  to the EU's concern and that GE is  having constructive cooperation  with the commission.  We expect that to continue.

As a result Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) acquired the technology only after a year-long delay. The EU competition enforcer said Canon jumped the gun via a  two-step warehousing move to acquire Toshiba Medical Systems Corp prior to securing regulatory approval. The deal was approved in September 2016.  Companies have to give us full and accurate information, so we can take the right decisions. These decisions require a forward looking assessment,  European Competition Commissioner Margaret Vestige told a news conference.  That includes an assessment of the impact on innovation, an increasingly important part of the economy. And it should be the companies themselves telling us about their future strategies.  GE and Merck KGaA said they acted in good faith while Canon said it would respond in due course.  There was no intent to mislead. When informed of the ECB's concerns, we acted quickly and openly to resolve the issue,  GE said in a statement. Vestige said the companies have until Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 to respond to the charges.

A month of sanctions imposed on Qatar by Egypt and Arab neighbors that have cut ties and accused Doha of supporting militants has galvanized patriotic feelings among Qataris, who number 300,000, as well as fear about the possibility of military escalation. While Doha denies the charges and there are no signs the standoff will spiral into military confrontation, the crisis has bolstered nationalist support for the 37-year-old ruler of the world's wealthiest country per capita.  We will go to the streets and fight for him [Sheikh Tamim],  said Ahmed al-Kuwari, a 32-year-old engineer.  Local media say that hundreds of men are signing up for the military, as others deliver jibes at Arab rulers on social media and rail against  fake news  they say some Arab media outlets are spreading to divide them. After an announcement on Wednesday by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates that their boycott of the tiny Gulf Arab state would continue, playful Qataris shared on Twitter photoshopped images ridiculing officials from those countries. One showed a minister wearing rabbit ears. Others shared a clip of the UAE foreign minister berating Qatar for supporting terrorism followed by a clip of Sheikh Tamim drinking a cup of tea and laughing.

Some say they won't return even if the dispute is settled. Amira, a Moroccan curator at a Doha fashion house that imports designs from the UAE, says the dispute is affecting the decisions of her customers.   People are starting to ask where the fabrics come from,  she said.  Last week a Qatari woman found out a dress was from the UAE. She said 'get it away from me'.

Officials from the four countries have also ruled out any plans to try to change the ruler or use force in the crisis.  No one in the family is worried about him stepping down,  said Haya Alwaleed al-Thani, a student at Doha's Georgetown university and a member of Qatar's ruling family. People walk in Mall of Qatar in Doha, Qatar July 5, 2017. Picture taken July 5, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonMemories of War  He has legitimacy. He has treated people with equality.  The al-Thani tribal rulers of Qatar, a small peninsular country protruding into the Gulf with a population of 2.7 million, most of them foreign workers, have been rattled in the last few decades by internal palace coups or threatened intervention by Saudi Arabia.  But the discovery of vast liquefied natural gas reserves in the 1970s that crowned Doha with skyscrapers and ushered in cradle-to-grave welfare has brought stability and lured in foreign investors. For older Qataris who knew leaner years and witnessed wars in the Gulf including Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the feud is more troubling.  During the Kuwait invasion my relatives barricaded their windows and stayed inside. They are scared of that happening again,  said Haya, the Doha student. Others fear enmity between Gulf states could linger on.

Most members said that given the recent interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, it is indispensable right now to maintain the current relative position,  the statement said.  Nonetheless, most members also said there could be a pause in the bank's rate hike cycle, considering that consumer price movements appear to be helping inflation reach the bank's 3 percent target. Mexico's central bank board raised interest rates MXCBIR=ECI a quarter percentage-point to 7.00 percent at last month's meeting, with one member voting to hold them steady. The central bank has increased its main interest rate in the last seven meetings. Monetary policy is at its tightest since early 2009, and inflation is at a more than an eight-year high.

A majority of members said the June rate move would help bring inflation down toward the bank's target.  The board raised the rate both to anchor inflation expectations and because of the Fed hike, a majority of members said. The Fed voted in June to raise rates for the second time this year.

Despite strong initial public offerings, overall equity capital deals fell 12 percent to C$26.9 billion in the first half from a year ago, the data showed. JPMorgan (JPM.N), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) took the top three spots in the M&A; league tables rankings, while Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), TD and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) were the top three advisers on Canadian equity issues in the first half of 2017. Canadian companies and pension funds have been seeking investment opportunities outside of Canada, and that is expected to keep M&A; bankers busy in the second half.  We see the financial buyers - the pension plans, asset managers - continually active outside of Canada,  said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada. The two biggest energy deals of the year so far were Cenovus Energy Inc's (CVE.TO) roughly C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) oil sands and natural gas assets and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) sale of most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion.  The large international majors are looking to delever their balance sheet and sell non-core assets,  said Peter Buzzi, co-head of Canadian M&A; at RBC.  And for many of them, it appears Canada falls into that non-core category,  he added. Canadian IPOs, which have been rebounding after a quiet 2016, rose to C$3.4 billion, the best first half in 11 years.  The IPO pipeline looks strong,  said Benoit Lauzé, head of equity capital markets at CIBC.  There would be very significant appetite for good technology names,  he added. Kinder Morgan Canada's (KML.TO) C$1.75 billion IPO and Canada Goose Holdings Inc's (GOOS.TO) offering were some of the highlights in the first half. But overall, the equity capital activity in the energy sector could slow because of choppiness in oil prices, bankers said.

After a splurge of repricings and refinancings since September 2016, Europe’s leveraged loan market is finally digesting meaningful new supply. As investors struggle to deploy manpower on every deal, they are instead opting to focus attention on a preferred few. The market is experiencing pricing differentiation of around 150bp between the stronger credits that are reverse flexing to 325bp prior to close, and the less favoured loans, which are flexing wider to 475bp and adjusting documents to make them more borrower friendly. Any pricing differentiation is exacerbated further once OIDs are added into the equation. “There is huge pricing differentiation right now. The more complicated deals are looking at the 450bp-500bp area, 75% fall into the mainstream category of 350bp-400bp and the best will be pushing pricing of 325bp,” a leveraged finance head said. Among the deals that were forced to sweeten terms was the €277m term loan backing Ardian’s acquisition of a 60% stake in Assystem Technologies. Pricing was widened on July 4 to 475bp over Euribor with a 98.5 OID, from launch guidance of 400bp with a 99.5 OID. Banks also offered 101 soft call protection for six months and ticking fees that kick in after 60 days, rather than 90 days, to make the deal more attractive to investors. Meanwhile, at the end of June a €1bn term loan backing the buyout of Hong Kong-based international schools operator Nord Anglia tightened to 325bp over Euribor with a 99.75 OID, from initial guidance of 375bp-400bp with a 99.5 OID. But increasing market sophistication means it isn’t just the small deals that are doing badly and the large liquid deals that are going well. “It used to be that bigger is better, that’s not wholly the case anymore,” a syndicate head said. Investors are looking for diversification and some of the smaller deals have been very successful, including a €330m term loan for French elderly care services company Colisee that allocated on July 4 at 325bp over Euribor, at par from a launch price of 375bp. At the end of June a €245m term loan backing the buyout of Dutch chemical distributor Caldic tightened to pay 325bp over Euribor at par from initial guidance of 350bp-375bp with a 99.5 OID. Given the size of some of the smaller deals, it was easy to get them oversubscribed and therefore rein pricing in, a syndicate head said. Meanwhile, deals that made concessions and flexed higher in syndication included a €765m term loan backing the merger of European industrial supplies distributor IPH and its peer Brammer and a €1.5bn-equivalent loan refinancing for German packaging company Kloeckner Pentaplast. No Overhang Despite some deals struggling, all seem to have a price point at which they will sell, enabling banks and borrowers to avoid any fallout from hung deals. ”The key thing is that there is no overhang being created where banks are sitting on positions as that would cause market dislocation. The buyside know banks have flex and they want their fair share. On the more complicated deals investors are saying pay up and they can afford to say that as they can afford to miss a few deals as there is no pressure to do everything seeing as there is so much in the market,” the leveraged finance head said. Healthy levels of deal flow are likely to continue in the short term at least with a number of situations on the horizon including an £800m term loan for UK-headquartered health food and supplements chain Holland & Barrett; a €3.175bn financing backing a potential buyout of German generic drugmaker Stada ; as well as auctions processes for credits that could come to the leveraged loan market including €1.5bn of loans for German ceramics company CeramTec. Given this state of play, bankers are likely to be more mindful when structuring and pricing this next batch of deals, in order to factor in market risk and credit quality. How long pricing differentiation lasts remains to be seen as the level of supply, while a welcomed improvement from earlier this year, is still not enough to soak up the full demand out there. This has been seen most explicitly in the secondary market, where prices on the whole are holding up and very little new paper is trading hands after allocations. A large financing like Stada that includes a €1.95bn term loan could go some way to easing the pressure of the supply/demand imbalance. “The market is being constructive and operating how it should in that there is differentiation and that is good, as when structuring, bankers will be mindful that there is no longer a common assumption that the market is good and will always remain so, which should introduce a note of caution. All of which is optimistic, as come the autumn everyone will be reckless again as nobody learns anything. If Stada comes there will be some recalibration as it is such a big deal,” the syndicate head said.

Around 1,500 plastic bags, or 1.8 kg worth (roughly 4 lbs), are used to make a skateboard deck by 22-year-old Jason Knight,, a Brunel University design student. The boards are made by putting the plastic in a machine which heats it to around 200 degrees Celsius (roughly 400 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to two hours, then uses pressure to mould it into a solid object.  We all know recycling is the right thing to do,  Knight told Reuters.  I thought if people have a tangible reward like a skateboard (from) recycling it would incentivise people to do so.  The plastic decks are fitted with conventional axles and wheels. Decks are normally made out of plywood, and typically cost anywhere between 40-60 pounds ($50-75).  Jason Knight, an industrial design student at Brunel University, holds one of his skateboard decks made from shredded plastic bags in Southbank, London, Britain June 15, 2017.Matthew StockKnight hopes his idea could be implemented to encourage young people to collect enough waste plastic in exchange for use of a press similar to the one he built. English retailers sold 1.1 billion plastic bags to customers in the six months after a 5p charge was introduced in October 2015, a drop of around 85 percent on the previous year, according to UK government data. Knight is not a skateboarder himself, so he took one of his finished creations to a skate park on London's South Bank for others to field test.  People really like the idea; no one's seen anything like it before. They like the flexibility, it means you can jump higher,  said Knight, adding he's picked up a few tips on where to improve the design.   The thing I need to address most is the weight; it's important for doing tricks that I try and bring the weight down.

We were extremely disappointed with the statements made at Wimbledon by one of our sponsored athletes, Bernard Tomic. His opinions in no way reflect our own attitude for tennis, our passion, professionalism and respect for the game,  the company said in a statement.  Therefore, we have decided to discontinue our collaboration with Bernard Tomic.  Tomic spoke about his lack of motivation following his listless 6-3 6-4 6-3 defeat by Germany's Mischa Zverev on Tuesday.  It's a roller-coaster and I just can't seem to find the commitment to work hard, to enjoy, and to lift trophies,  he told reporters.  The last two years, nothing motivates.  It was definitely a mental issue out there. Wasn't mentally and physically there to perform. I don't know why, but, you know, I felt a little bit bored out there to be completely honest with you,  the 24-year-old told reporters. The Australian also conceded that he had called for medical assistance, not because of injury, but in order to disrupt the momentum of the game. Tomic was subsequently fined 11,600 pounds  ($15,010.40) for  unsportsmanlike conduct.   Head sponsors a number of top players in both the men's and women's game including Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova. The company received criticism for standing by the Russian Sharapova when she was banned after testing positive for use of the substance meldonium. Tomic's comments were criticised by many pundits who suggested he was cheating fans by his attitude. Women's nine-time Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova suggested that Tomic's comments were ungracious and suggested he  stay at home .  It's disrespectful to the sport and disrespectful to the history of the sport. If you can't get motivated at Wimbledon it's time to find another job,  Navratilova said. But former world number one Mats Wilander defended Tomic, saying many other players silently had the same problems.  I guarantee you every single player here at Wimbledon feels or has felt like Tomic is saying he feels,  the Swede told Reuters.  I really appreciate that he was honest about it.  Others have suggested Tomic's words may reflect wider issues and offered support. Tennis Gold Coast president Mike Ford, who has known Tomic since he was a child, called for the player to be left alone.  He's obviously going through a very dark period. He needs time and he needs space,  he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.  Not many realise the work he had to do. He trained at Queens Park in Southport, was there every day with his dad, 11, 12, 13 years old and grinded himself into the court, hour after hour... I don't forget those sort of things.

Tomic's comments came two days after the exit of Australia's other main men's hope Nick Kyrgios, who has had his own struggles with motivation and once said he did not even much like the game that gave him his living. Kyrgios cut short his opener at the All England Club because of a hip problem but Tomic limped out with a listless 6-3 6-4 6-3 first-round defeat at the hands of Germany's Mischa Zverev. His remarks afterwards sparked outrage among some of his predecessors in the top echelons of the game in Australia, a nation that has always prided itself on its mental toughness in the sporting arena. Related CoverageSponsor Head drops Tomic after 'bored' commentsSome closer to Tomic's home on the Gold Coast, however, were more concerned that the  mental issues  the 24-year-old admitted  to having on court were indicative of wider problems for the once child prodigy.  Neil Guiney, who coached Tomic from the age of seven until his early teens, was not surprised by Tomic's words, which he felt might herald the end of his career.  I've been expecting this for a long time,  he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.  I just got the feeling that this is how things would draw to a close.  He's never had the drive really since he was very, very young.  He's talking about 'I'll play on for so many years and that will set me up for life'... he won't get in the draw, his ranking will drop down, down, down.

The court in the central Congolese city of Mbuji Mayi sentenced two army majors to 20 years in prison and three other soldiers to 15 years for murder and improperly disposing of weapons, defense lawyer Jimmy Bashile told Reuters. A video of the massacre showed soldiers shooting people, some of them young women, at point blank range and provoked international condemnation when it appeared in February. Two soldiers were sentenced in absentia to capital punishment, Bashile added, although Congo has observed a moratorium on the death penalty for more than a decade. One other soldier received a 12-month suspended sentence for failing to denounce the crimes, while another was acquitted for lack of evidence, Bashile said. All of the defendants who were convicted plan to appeal their sentences, he added. More than 3,000 people have been killed and 1.3 million displaced since the start of an insurrection last August by the Kamuina Nsapu militia, which demands that the government withdraw its forces. At least 52 mass graves have also been found and several of the defendants in Mbuji Mayi had faced more serious war crimes charges, but those were dropped mid-trial. Congo's government denies any systematic use of excessive force and has said the prosecutions show its justice system's ability to deal with crimes committed during the conflict. The United Nations and rights groups, however, say Congolese authorities have not done enough to hold perpetrators responsible. The U.N. Human Rights Council voted last month to establish an international investigation.  Militia violence in Congo, a tinder box of conflicts over land, ethnicity and minerals, has been worsened by President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December, and analysts say it risks spinning out of control.

Lawmakers across the political divide supported the extension except those from Jean-Luc Melenchon's hard-left France Unbowed party and the Communist party, which both deem the emergency rule dangerous for civil liberties.  Freedom and security are not mutually exclusive,  Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told parliament.  When you strengthen security, you don't take away civil liberties, you preserve them, and sometimes you enhance them.  France, whose forces are part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has been beset by a wave of Islamist militant attacks since early 2015, nearly all of which have been carried out by Islamic State loyalists or individuals inspired by the group. Nonetheless, human rights groups have criticized the state of emergency, saying it tramples on individuals' rights and erodes the rule of law.  The emergency regime allows police to search homes and arrest people without prior consent from judges. It also allows them to tap computer and phone communications more freely. The French government has presented a draft counter-terrorism bill that President Emmanuel Macron, elected in May, wants to replace the temporary emergency powers. The bill, which rights groups have also criticised, envisages extending police powers to stop and search people or conduct house searches and would also give officials more discretion in deciding when to invoke a risk of terrorism as justification for curbs on freedoms.

Despite strong initial public offerings, overall equity capital deals fell 12 percent to C$26.9 billion in the first half from a year ago, the data showed. JPMorgan (JPM.N), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) took the top three spots in the M&A; league tables rankings, while Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), TD and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) were the top three advisers on Canadian equity issues in the first half of 2017. Canadian companies and pension funds have been seeking investment opportunities outside of Canada, and that is expected to keep M&A; bankers busy in the second half.  We see the financial buyers - the pension plans, asset managers - continually active outside of Canada,  said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada. The two biggest energy deals of the year so far were Cenovus Energy Inc's (CVE.TO) roughly C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) oil sands and natural gas assets and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) sale of most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion.  The large international majors are looking to delever their balance sheet and sell non-core assets,  said Peter Buzzi, co-head of Canadian M&A; at RBC.  And for many of them, it appears Canada falls into that non-core category,  he added. Canadian IPOs, which have been rebounding after a quiet 2016, rose to C$3.4 billion, the best first half in 11 years.  The IPO pipeline looks strong,  said Benoit Lauzé, head of equity capital markets at CIBC.  There would be very significant appetite for good technology names,  he added. Kinder Morgan Canada's (KML.TO) C$1.75 billion IPO and Canada Goose Holdings Inc's (GOOS.TO) offering were some of the highlights in the first half. But overall, the equity capital activity in the energy sector could slow because of choppiness in oil prices, bankers said.  Investors have been generally taking a risk-off approach and we're seeing limited conviction that oil prices are going to be high in the near term,  said Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital markets at RBC.

Speaking to reporters at a crowded Austrian Grand Prix news conference, the two men addressed a  road rage  controversy that has dominated the headlines since the June 25 race in Azerbaijan.  I still have the utmost respect for him as a driver and will continue to race him hard through the rest of the season,  declared Hamilton, who said at the time that Vettel had  disgraced himself  by driving into him in Baku. He said Vettel called him on the Monday after the race and then texted an apology, which he accepted. The championship leader had driven into the back of Hamilton's Mercedes while both were following the safety car in first and second places, waiting for it to return to the pits. Vettel then pulled alongside, gesticulating angrily, before banging wheels. The German, a four times world champion, later accused Hamilton of  brake-testing  him by slowing suddenly.  The car's telemetry subsequently showed that was not the case and Hamilton said the accusation was one he particularly wanted correcting. Vettel was handed a 10-second stop-and-go penalty, and finished fourth. He was then summoned to a hearing in Paris last Monday where the governing body declared the matter closed. Initially reluctant to dwell on the matter, saying he did not want to  pump this up more than it is already , the Ferrari driver on Thursday repeated the written apology.  It was the wrong move to drive alongside him and hit his tyres,  he said.  I don't think there was any bad intention (by Hamilton). I don't think he actually brake-tested me. I was upset and over-reacted. I am not proud of the moment.  Hamilton, 14 points behind Vettel after eight races, missed out on victory in Baku after a headrest worked loose and he had to pit. He finished fifth. Before Baku, the two world champions had made much of their mutual respect and the budding  bromance  seemed to be back on.  It's nice to hear that we are able to move forward,  Vettel said.  I think the respect we have for each other on and off track helps us in this regard.

With $300 million in total capital, Felix, set up two years ago by venture capitalist Frederick Court, says it will take stakes in emerging digital fashion brands and the technologies to enable them to compete. Court was the earliest investor in Farfetch, one of the hottest venture backed online luxury companies in the world, which reported a 70 percent rise in gross sales last year to $800 million and has overtaken Net-A-Porter in website traffic, though it has yet to turn in a profit. Farfetch announced two weeks ago it had raised $397 million from No. 2 Chinese ecommerce player JD.com to expand further into China from its base in Europe and the U.S.  For the luxury industry, digital and China are the two topics in fashion today. For most brands, this is where the growth is happening,  Court, a native of France now based in Britain, said in an interview. He declined to comment on reports that Farfetch could be considering a stock market listing later this year or in 2018. The company has said it is not under any pressure to do so. Undated handout image from online luxury platform Farfetch.com.Farfetch/HandoutFelix also holds a stake in The Business of Fashion, a blog-turned media company that competes with WWD.com (Women's Wear Daily) for fashion industry insiders, and Mirakl, a Paris-based supplier of software for managing online marketplaces.

With inflation in the euro zone slowly rebounding, the ECB is preparing to dial back its stimulus policy of ultra-low rates and massive bond purchases, but doing so without upsetting investors is proving a challenge after years of easy money. Rate setters meeting on June 7-8 discussed dropping a long-standing pledge to boost the ECB's 2.3 trillion euros bond purchase program if necessary, a key element of their policy message.   Eventually they decided against doing so because the euro zone's economic recovery had yet to result in higher inflation - the bank's main policy objective. But, confirming a Reuters exclusive, the central bankers said they could review that so-called easing bias at future meetings. Related CoverageRecovery gives ECB room to pare stimulus says Weidmann If confidence in the inflation outlook improved further, the case for retaining this bias could be reviewed,  the ECB said in its policy accounts. German government bond yields hit new 18-month highs and the euro edged higher after the minutes were released as traders speculated on a  tapering  of the ECB's debt-purchase program, due to run until December. They were resuming a rally started last week, when ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at possible policy tweaks.  The ECB’s tiptoeing towards tapering will continue,  said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.  It should remain a very gradual and cautious process, given the ECB’s fear of taper tantrum.   Continued Caution  In the minutes, the ECB stressed the need for  continued caution in communication  as any perception that it was moving away from its stimulus policy could roil financial markets, undoing some of its previous efforts. Indeed, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said earlier on Thursday the central bank needed to be patient and maintain a steady hand in policy as inflation was still far below its target of almost 2 percent. Despite a brisk economic rebound, inflation in the euro zone was 1.3 percent in June and is not expected to near 2 percent at least until 2019. ECB rate setters meeting in June said they found it  puzzling  that forecasts for core inflation had to be revised downwards despite stronger economic growth and a falling unemployment rate. Still, Draghi argued last week that accelerating growth would in itself provide support so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged. That message stirred markets, stoking speculation that policymakers could decide as early as September to reduce asset purchases from next year. The ECB's asset buys are set to run until the end of the year and policymakers will decide in September or October whether to extend, reduce or gradually wind down the purchases.

The property and casualty insurer issued estimates of its catastrophe loss payouts due to severe storms and flooding in Ontario and Quebec that were higher than a National Bank Financial analyst had expected. The materials group, which includes precious and base metal miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.2 percent. Barrick Gold Corp fell 2.2 percent to C$20.22, as gold steadied the day after it hit a two-month low. Energy stocks were off 0.2 percent overall. Oil rose on Thursday, recovering some ground after a surprisingly upbeat picture of U.S. demand halted the previous day's slide, although the prospect of oversupply in 2018 prompted yet more analysts to cut their price forecasts. Canada's trade deficit almost doubled to C$1.09 billion ($845 million) in May, but in a sign of economic strength, both exports and imports reached record highs, Statistics Canada data indicated on Thursday.

Tanzania Commercial banks quoted the Tanzanian shilling at 2,238/2,243 to the dollar on Thursday, little changed from 2,234/2,244 a week ago.  The demand for dollars is more or less matched by supply, so the shilling will probably trade at the same levels next week,  said a trader at CRDB Bank. Kenya The Kenyan shilling may weaken this week due to demand from oil and merchandise importers buying dollars for the last monthly cycle ahead of Aug. 8 elections, traders said. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.75/95 per dollar, compared with 103.60/70 at last Thursday's close.  We are approaching the elections and most businesses will want to import their last stock,  said a trader from a commercial bank. Nigeria The Nigerian naira is seen steady on the foreign exchange markets in the coming days as the central bank continue to inject dollar into the market to improve liquidity while also tightening naira liquidity to curb pressure on the local currency. The local currency was quoted at 368 to the dollar on the black market on Thursday, stronger than 370 per dollar last week, while it was quoted by commercial lenders at 306.20 to the dollar on the interbank market against 305.5 a dollar last week. On the investor forex window, the naira was quoted at 365.41 per dollar.  It appears that the central bank is comfortable with the prevailing rates in the markets and we do not envisage any change soon as the bank sustains its intervention and tighten naira liquidity,   Aminu Gwadabe, president of the Bureau de Change Association, said. Ghana Ghana's cedi is seen steady next week on stable interbank forex liquidity inflows, helped by regular central bank's dollar sales, an analyst said. The local unit was trading at 4.3900 per dollar by mid-morning on Thursday, almost unchanged from 4.3902 a week ago.  The cedi has remained firm this week largely on improved liquidity flows and we don't expect much departure from this narrative in the coming week,  a commercial bank trader said. Uganda The Ugandan shilling is forecast to trade in range over the next one week as investors show little appetite for the greenback at levels above 3,600, which they consider to be on the higher side. At 0957 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,597/3,606, broadly stable from last Thursday's close of 3,595/3,605.  Whenever the dollar climbs above 3,600, appetite cools because some players think the unit (dollar) is over-priced at that level,  said a trader at a leading commercial bank. The trader said the local currency would likely oscillate between 3,590-3,610 against the greenback in the coming days.

The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing's relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China's energy supplies and trade passes. Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company's managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters. Part of that block is in the U-shaped 'nine-dash line' which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for  more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims. A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential.  Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China's interventions in the South China Sea,  the official said. Vietnam's state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June. Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold.  Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam's state oil firm, Spain's Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates.      Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd., has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain's Repsol SA, which also has rights to neighboring block 07/03, Odfjell said.      Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China's claims.      Odfjell's Eirik Knudsen, V‎ice President for Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, referred further queries to Repsol, which declined to comment. PetroVietnam made no comment. Competing Maritime Claims FILE PHOTO: A Repsol logo at a petrol station in Bormujos near the Andalusian capital of Seville, southern Spain March 3, 2016.Marcelo del Pozo/File PhotoWhen asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone  carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over .  We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation,  he told a briefing in Beijing. Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was canceled around the time the drilling began. The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade. Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion  Blue Whale  gas concession off central Vietnam. They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam's evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam's coastguard. Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said.  We know they are unhappy again, but we are resisting the pressure – it is a traditional part of our relations with Beijing,  one official said privately.  Other parts of the relationship remain strong.  Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea. Hanoi's growing defense and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances. The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China's expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia. India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam's waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country. On the agenda are transfers of naval vessels and missiles under a $500 million defense credit line announced last year. Next week, the navies of India, the United States and Japan will hold their largest joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal.

In an executive report following a country visit in the last week of June, the Fund also said policy uncertainty linked to political turbulence would weigh on business and consumer confidence. South Africa's economy entered recession in the first quarter and is suffering from an unemployment rates of close to 28 percent. Bitter divisions inside the ruling African National Congress (ANC) as the contest to replace President Jacob Zuma intensifies have also raised investor fears that policy to revive growth would take a backseat.  Following last year's near-standstill in economic activity, growth is projected to increase to 1 percent in 2017 and 1.2 percent in 2018, still insufficient to keep pace with the rising population,  the IMF said in the report. Investor confidence has been subdued by political uncertainty following the axing of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March and a subsequent credit downgrades to sub-investment.

Gross domestic product contracted 0.7 percent in the first quarter after contracting 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, dragging the economy into its first recession in nearly a decade.  External and domestic contexts could result in significant shocks ... especially if accompanied by further downgrades of local currency sovereign credit ratings to below investment grade,  the fund said.  On government debt, the IMF said:  Low growth has taken a toll on the state of the public finances, increasing government debt.   It said the government's balance sheet is also exposed to sizable contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, under pressure to detail plans to turnaround the economy and avoid credit downgrades deeper into junk, said last week the country may be forced to seek outside financial assistance if the economy kept sinking. This week he announced a 2.3 billion rand ($176 million) bailout of state-owned South African Airways, one of a clutch of state firms heavily dependent on government guarantees totaling nearly 500 billion rand, about a third of total state expenditure.

Although the trade deficit almost doubled to C$1.09 billion ($845 million), that was partly due to one-time imports of five new airliners. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$530 million. The Bank of Canada is set to make an interest rate announcement on July 12. Markets increasingly expect a hike to come soon as the economy recovers from a prolonged shock caused by low oil prices. The central bank, which cut rates twice in 2015 to help contain the damage, has consistently fretted about what it says are disappointing non-energy exports.  How Canada's trade picture is tracking into the second quarter will put yet more wind into the Bank of Canada's sails,  said Derek Holt of Scotiabank Economics.  An almost perfect combination of ripping exports and enough strength in the domestic economy to pull in more imports reflect what the Bank of Canada has emphasized to be more diversified growth,  he added in a note to clients. Canadian companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand should boost investment and hiring, the central bank said last week, increasing expectations for a rate hike. Imports climbed 2.4 percent to C$49.77 billion, their sixth consecutive gain, on increased purchases of aircraft and other transportation parts. Exports rose 1.3 percent in May from April to hit C$48.69 billion, thanks to shipments of unwrought gold to the United Kingdom as well as motor vehicles and parts. Export Development Canada Chief Economist Peter Hall said eight of the 11 main export sectors had grown for three consecutive months.  This is really strong evidence of a broadly based increase,  he said.  It gives us confidence that there is real muscle behind this.  The Canadian dollar was little changed, trading at C$1.2935 to the greenback, or 77.31 U.S. cents. Exports to the United States, which accounted for 74.5 percent of all Canadian exports in May, dipped by 0.3 percent, while imports from the southern neighbor rose 3.6 percent. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States shrank to C$3.53 billion from C$4.76 billion in April. Separately, Statscan said the value of Canadian building permits issued in May jumped 8.9 percent on plans for more construction of residential buildings.

In an executive report following a country visit in the last week of June, the Fund also said policy uncertainty linked to political turbulence would weigh on business and consumer confidence. South Africa's economy entered recession in the first quarter and is suffering from an unemployment rates of close to 28 percent. Bitter divisions inside the ruling African National Congress (ANC) as the contest to replace President Jacob Zuma intensifies have also raised investor fears that policy to revive growth would take a backseat.  Following last year's near-standstill in economic activity, growth is projected to increase to 1 percent in 2017 and 1.2 percent in 2018, still insufficient to keep pace with the rising population,  the IMF said in the report. Investor confidence has been subdued by political uncertainty following the axing of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March and a subsequent credit downgrades to sub-investment.

Gross domestic product contracted 0.7 percent in the first quarter after contracting 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, dragging the economy into its first recession in nearly a decade.  External and domestic contexts could result in significant shocks ... especially if accompanied by further downgrades of local currency sovereign credit ratings to below investment grade,  the fund said.  On government debt, the IMF said:  Low growth has taken a toll on the state of the public finances, increasing government debt.   It said the government's balance sheet is also exposed to sizable contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, under pressure to detail plans to turnaround the economy and avoid credit downgrades deeper into junk, said last week the country may be forced to seek outside financial assistance if the economy kept sinking. This week he announced a 2.3 billion rand ($176 million) bailout of state-owned South African Airways, one of a clutch of state firms heavily dependent on government guarantees totaling nearly 500 billion rand, about a third of total state expenditure.

They urged the nationalist Orban to halt the campaign.  Please make sure this bad dream ends as soon as possible,  Andras Heisler, chairman of the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz), said in an emailed statement. Orban's spokesman said the campaign had nothing to do with anti-Semitism but rather sought only to counter what he called Soros's attempts to unduly change immigration policies in Hungary. Orban has locked horns with fellow European Union members in the west of the bloc over his opposition to immigration and liberal values and has criticized Soros - a major supporter of democracy and human rights causes - in increasingly sharp tones. Orban, who faces elections next year, long proclaimed zero tolerance for anti-Semitism though has more recently risked angering Israel and Jews with remarks apparently meant to court far right voters. His government has conducted a  national consultation  on issues of foreign influence and mass immigration, asking people if they were open to allowing either. Voters who responded rejected both and Orban launched a massive follow-up campaign. The campaign focuses on Soros, 86, a Hungarian Jew who emigrated after World War Two, made a fortune in the United States and has long been heavily involved with groups promoting liberal democratic and open-border values in post-Communist eastern Europe, a cause at odds with Orban's world view. Billboards around Hungary and full-page ads in media across the central European country depict Soros grinning contentedly against a blue background with the inscription:  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh.  Some Soros billboards have been defaced with the words  stinking Jew  in magic marker. Around 100,000 Jews live in Hungary.  Imagery from World War Two   This campaign, while not openly anti-Semitic, clearly has the potential to ignite uncontrolled emotions, including anti-Semitism,  the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Congregations (Mazsihisz) said in an emailed statement. The campaign uses  imagery that evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War showing 'the laughing Jew',  Human Rights Watch campaigner Lydia Gall told Reuters.  The campaign encourages anti-Semitism.  Soros, who rarely addresses personal attacks against him, was not immediately available for comment through a spokesman. Soros has called Orban's rule a  mafia regime  and has funded groups in Hungary that promote democratic transparency, human rights and a positive approach to immigration. Orban's government fortified Hungary's southern border in 2015 against a large influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa into the EU that year and has rejected a quota scheme agreed by EU leaders to distribute migrants among member states.  Heisler said Orban was using Soros as a scapegoat and that carried serious risks.  Graffiti has appeared on the posters on the streets of Budapest and other cities reminding us of a dark era in Hungary's history, but the invisible social damage is probably already worse than that,  Heisler wrote. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said Orban met with Jewish organizations on Thursday and told them the billboard campaign was only calling attention to what he said was Soros's undue interference in Budapest's migration policies.  The campaign has nothing to do with the heritage of George Soros or anyone else,  Kovacs said. Orban, who expects a visit from Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu later this month, said last week he expected confrontations over anti-Semitism.  Let us be vigilant: our opponents use the anti-Semitism card. We reject that,  he told an event of his Fidesz party.  Those who charge us with anti-Semitism bring tens of thousands of anti-Semites into Europe through migration. So our migrant policies serve the interests of European Jewish communities even if they don't stand up for their own interests, and quietly tolerate the unfair attacks that Hungarians receive as they protect them too.

The greenback was already on the defensive after Wednesday's issue of the Fed's policy minutes failed to provide a clear picture of future interest rate increases. The slide extended with Thursday's poor set of U.S. economic data. The ADP National Employment Report showed private sector payrolls increased by 158,000 jobs last month, lower than the 230,000 positions created in May and below economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 248,000 for the week ended July 1. It was the third straight weekly increase in claims.  The slightly weaker-than-expected ADP figures added to the dollar's heavier tone this morning and raised some concerns about a downside surprise to tomorrow's broader non-farm payrolls report,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth FX in Washington. Wall Street economists predicted U.S. non-farm payrolls to grow by 179,000 in June, according to a Reuters poll. In May, the U.S. economy created 138,000 jobs. Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York, noted however that if the ADP figures were correct, the pace of job growth has likely remained above that needed to keep the unemployment rate steady over time. The U.S. services sector index was also released on Thursday, showing an index of 57.4 in June, compared with a forecast of 56.5. The employment index, however, fell to 55.8, compared with 57.8 in May, suggesting a cooling labor market. On Wednesday, the latest Fed minutes showed that policymakers were split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises.  The latest Fed minutes indicate that (Chair) Janet Yellen is preparing the ground work for unwinding its balance sheet at the end of the year and markets aren't expecting large interest rate increases for now,  said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. In mid-morning trading, the dollar index was down 0.4 percent at 95.954. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 113.16 yen, after rising more than 1 percent this week. The euro, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent to $1.1397. The minutes of the ECB meeting nudged the euro higher as bond yields rose, though the single currency hemmed within recent trading ranges.

Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, all hoping to join the European Union, will launch the project at a meeting with EU officials and financial institutions next week in Trieste, EBRD Vice President Pierre Heilbronn said. The aim is to create a single market of 20 million people with support from the EBRD, which has so far invested 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in the region. Heilbronn said removing non-tariff trade barriers would be a first step in an initiative the EBRD and its stakeholders hope will re-engage Balkan states unnerved by the EU's fading enthusiasm for enlargement and exposed to Russia's growing influence.  When asked what would was necessary to make the scheme work, he said:  To have as little as political interference as possible, to be as pragmatic and as practical as you can be at the same time you need ownership by the government ... and EU presence is important.    Investors we meet every day have competing choices for their investment, they look at Asia ... and in the Western Balkans they see small countries with different rules,  Heilbronn said by phone.       This region is very important for Europe,  he said. However, not all Western Balkan countries are wholly supportive of the idea.  Kosovo fears being roped back into a Serbian-dominated union of the kind it fought to leave. Others worry it will only slow their accession to the EU, or worse still replace it.

The G20 countries are responsible for 75 percent of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, but are not yet on track to cut those sufficiently to prevent temperatures reaching dangerously high levels, the index compilers said on Thursday.  It's time for the world's richest economies ... to step up their game on climate action,  said Wael Hmaidan, executive director of the Climate Action Network (CAN), which published the index with Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute.  If we are to realise the goals of the Paris Agreement we need countries to get down to the business of serious implementation,  he said. Under the Paris Agreement, individual countries have drawn up targets to cut emissions to help reach the international goal to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But some are making faster progress than others toward that goal.  Particularly promising are the developments in some of the major emerging economies such as Brazil or India,  said Niklas Höhne, a founding partner of the Berlin-based NewClimate Institute and a professor at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Brazil has achieved advances in reducing deforestation, which now need to be maintained, and India is favouring renewables over coal and electric vehicles over gasoline and diesel, Höhne said.  Both countries are moving in the right direction - yet climate policies and international climate finance need further support,  he said. The index looks at countries' 2030 targets for greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and total energy use. It also compares what countries have achieved with what needs to happen to keep global warming in check.  The results illustrate that even if all (G20) countries were as involved as the current frontrunners, efforts would not yet be sufficient to prevent dangerous climate change,  Germanwatch noted. Climate change is one of the main issues to be discussed at the G20 summit in Hamburg, which starts on Friday. Talks on achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement are likely to be split, following President Donald Trump's announcement last month that the United States will withdraw from the global pact. g20 and Dirty Fuel Environmental campaigners this week said G20 countries provide nearly four times more public finance each year to support fossil fuels than clean energy. In a study published on Wednesday, they said fossil fuel financing from G20 governments averaged $71.8 billion per year between 2013 and 2015. Half of all G20 public finance for energy supported oil and gas production alone, they said. Their report looked at energy projects supported by G20 public finance institutions, including overseas development aid agencies and export credit agencies, and multilateral development banks.  If other G20 governments are serious about standing up to Trump's climate denial and meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement, they need to stop propping up the outdated fossil fuel industry with public money,  said Alex Doukas, a campaigner with Oil Change International and one of the report's authors.  The best climate science points to an urgent need to transition to clean energy, but public finance from G20 governments drags us in the opposite direction. We must stop funding fossils and shift these subsidies,  Doukas said. The study was compiled by Oil Change International, Friends of the Earth U.S., the Sierra Club and the WWF European Policy Office.

If attractive products can be launched with central clearing offered locally, it will encourage those banks to trade those products locally and should also encourage international banks to come in to the domestic market, given the reduction in counterparty risk,  said Misra. The clearinghouse is expected to cover a range of derivatives asset classes including FX futures, equity index futures and options, and commodity futures, including precious metals. Without an established on-exchange derivatives market and no clear roadmap of products, however, the central bank required a flexible approach to development.  The key benefit was that we set this up with a robust risk model that's asset-class agnostic so the central bank can quite readily pick and chose what products can be included in the project without delays or deviation,  said Misra. The project represents an important milestone in Lebanon's strategic capital markets plan, which saw the creation of the country's Capital Market Authority in 2011, led by the Central Bank of Lebanon. Other efforts to build the country's capital markets include the development of more liquid corporate and government debt markets. With US$11bn of gold reserves, the country is also considering initiatives to digitalise gold investment. Alongside its capital markets plan, the central bank is also positioning the country as a fintech hub for Africa and Asia. A fintech ecosystem has already begun to emerge after local banks were encouraged to allocate up to 3% of available funds to start-ups, with the central bank offering guarantees on those equity investments. With a nine-month build time, the new CCP is expected to be up and running in 2018. “Our ability to deliver robust solutions within tight timeframes is key for market infrastructure decision makers,  said Misra.

Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers' knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share.  Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain's Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot.  The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,  he said.  It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren't as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.  Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Prestige Machines Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals.  Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016.  That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker's joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew's products, is less than half the price. FILE PHOTO: Doctors and medical staff work during knee prosthesis surgery in an operation room at the hospital of the Canton of Nidwalden in Stans, Switzerland October 27, 2011. Picture taken October 27, 2011.Michael Buholzer/File PhotoBoth companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company's most important strategic investment for a decade.  We are now basically head to head with Stryker,  he said in an interview.  I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it's Stryker or us.   Cost-Effectiveness Question Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017.  As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,  Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June.  Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven't been specific about.  Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J; is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France's Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew's Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations.  Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up.  Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results.  I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.

The world's second-largest reinsurer is 90 percent of the way through shifting its holdings from tracking traditional benchmarks, a process it expects to complete by the end of the third quarter in 2017. It said taking social and governance (ESG) criteria into account reduced the risk of losses especially for long term investors.  This is not only about doing good, we have done it because  it makes economic sense,  Swiss Re Chief Investment Officer Guido Fuerer told Reuters on Thursday.  Equities and fixed income products from companies and sectors with a high ESG ratings have better risk-return ratios.  Institutional investors are increasingly looking at how companies perform on environmental, social and governance-related issues, given the potential for poor behavior to lead to a share price hit. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Equity and Quant Strategy team last month said ESG-based investing reduced bankruptcy risks for U.S. stocks, while companies with the widest credit default swap spreads are the ones with the weakest ESG credentials, according to research by Hermes Investment Management. The MSCI ESG Leaders Index has gained 11.2 percent in 2017, slightly outperforming the MSCI International World Price Index, which has risen 9.6 percent  MIWD00002GUS .MIWO00000PUS. The decision by Swiss Re follows moves by peers to weave ESG into their own investment processes. For example AXA (AXAF.PA), France's largest insurer, last year said it would stop investing in tobacco and divest all of its 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) of assets in the industry.  At the time AXA called tobacco  the biggest threat to public health in the world . Unlike its rivals, Swiss Re said it would not be shifting its investments away from any particular industry or company.  It is very delicate to exclude whole sectors, keeping diversification in mind. The ultimate point is to put incentives to companies to become more sustainable over time,  said Swiss Re's Fuerer. He said Swiss Re is the first insurer to base its whole portfolio on ethical principles, with portfolio managers being told to use MSCI's environmental, governance and social indices when making investment decisions. MSCI rates companies according to various ethical criteria, with the score combined with market capitalization weight to create an index. That means companies with a more ethical performance have a greater weight in the index.

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, a subsidiary of a company owned by the son-in-law of Sri Lanka's then-central bank chief Arjuna Mahendran, bought more than half of the controversial bond issue on Feb. 27, 2015, prompting charges of a conflict of interest. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a commission to investigate suspected irregularities after opposition lawmakers charged that the sale had cost the state more than $1 billion in rising borrowing costs over the past two years. The central bank has rejected the opposition claims. Mahendran and his son-in-law, Arjun Aloysius, have denied any wrongdoing, as have officials at Perpetual Treasuries. In a statement announcing its action against Perpetual Treasuries, the central bank said:  The central bank will take necessary measures to ensure that this regulatory action does not have a disruptive impact on the market.   Action will also be taken to facilitate the handling of the interests of the customers and counterparties of PTL in an orderly manner,  it said. However, some analysts said the central bank move could trigger a market reaction.  Finally the central bank has taken some action. But this is an abrupt action as the probe is not concluded yet. For some market participants, it will be negative as there could be some disruption in the market,  a Colombo-based economist told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The auction of 30-year bonds at the centre of the controversy was originally planned at a modest 1 billion rupees ($7 million) but was then scaled up by 10 times to meet government borrowing needs.

The world's second-largest reinsurer is 90 percent of the way through shifting its holdings from tracking traditional benchmarks, a process it expects to complete by the end of the third quarter in 2017. It said taking social and governance (ESG) criteria into account reduced the risk of losses especially for long term investors.  This is not only about doing good, we have done it because  it makes economic sense,  Swiss Re Chief Investment Officer Guido Fuerer told Reuters on Thursday.  Equities and fixed income products from companies and sectors with a high ESG ratings have better risk-return ratios.  Institutional investors are increasingly looking at how companies perform on environmental, social and governance-related issues, given the potential for poor behavior to lead to a share price hit. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Equity and Quant Strategy team last month said ESG-based investing reduced bankruptcy risks for U.S. stocks, while companies with the widest credit default swap spreads are the ones with the weakest ESG credentials, according to research by Hermes Investment Management. The MSCI ESG Leaders Index has gained 11.2 percent in 2017, slightly outperforming the MSCI International World Price Index, which has risen 9.6 percent  MIWD00002GUS .MIWO00000PUS. The decision by Swiss Re follows moves by peers to weave ESG into their own investment processes. For example AXA (AXAF.PA), France's largest insurer, last year said it would stop investing in tobacco and divest all of its 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) of assets in the industry.  At the time AXA called tobacco  the biggest threat to public health in the world . Unlike its rivals, Swiss Re said it would not be shifting its investments away from any particular industry or company.  It is very delicate to exclude whole sectors, keeping diversification in mind. The ultimate point is to put incentives to companies to become more sustainable over time,  said Swiss Re's Fuerer. He said Swiss Re is the first insurer to base its whole portfolio on ethical principles, with portfolio managers being told to use MSCI's environmental, governance and social indices when making investment decisions. MSCI rates companies according to various ethical criteria, with the score combined with market capitalization weight to create an index. That means companies with a more ethical performance have a greater weight in the index.

The downward revision to A$205 billion mainly reflects an earlier than expected decline in iron ore prices since the previous forecasts were published three months ago, the Department of Industry, Science and Innovation said. Iron ore, Australia's top source of export revenue, should average $62.40 in calendar 2017, down from an earlier forecast of $65.20, the department said. Iron ore has averaged about $74 a tonne so far this year, implying prices will continue to deteriorate in the second half. The price was last quoted at $63.28 a tonne  Global resource and energy commodity demand growth, particularly for steel making commodities, is expected to slow in the next two years, driven largely by a slowdown in infrastructure spending and construction activity in China,  the department's chief economist, Mark Cully said.   Lower demand growth is expected to adversely affect iron ore and metallurgical coal prices,  he said. Australia mined a record 873.5 million tonnes of iron ore in fiscal 2017, making it the world's top producer, department figures show. The country is home to three of the world's four biggest suppliers - Rio Tinto, BHP and Fortescue Metals Group.  The iron ore price was forecast to decline to $48 a tonne in 2018, the department said. The cuts were in line with other markets forecasts, with Citi recently slashing its 2017 average price forecast for iron ore to $61 a tonne from $70, and to $50 from $53 for next year. The department forecast metallurgical coal prices at an average $191.30 a tonne in 2017, falling to $137 next year. It also revised down its copper price forecast for 2017 to $5,667 a tonne from $5,879 previously, contributing to the revisions in export earnings. Overall, the department revised down resource and energy export earnings by A$13 billion to A$202 billion for the year to end-June 2018, and by A$8.3 billion to A$200 billion the following year.

The alliance against it, meanwhile, may not have options to inflict further damage.  As the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter, Qatar is so rich -- at $127,660, its gross domestic product per capita in purchasing power terms is the highest of any country, according to the International Monetary Fund -- it can deploy money to counter almost any type of sanction.  In the past month it has arranged new shipping routes to offset the closure of its border with Saudi Arabia, deposited billions of dollars of state money in local banks to shore them up, and drawn the interest of some of the West's biggest energy firms by announcing a plan to raise its LNG output 30 percent.  The success of these initiatives suggests Qatar could weather months or years of the current sanctions if it has the political will to do so -- and that further sanctions being contemplated by the alliance may not prove decisive.  On Wednesday, the alliance said Qatar, which denies any support for terrorism, had missed a deadline to comply with its demands. Further steps against Doha will be taken in line with international law  at the appropriate time”, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said.  Saudi media reported this week that the new sanctions would include a pull-out of deposits and loans from Qatar by banks in alliance states, and a  secondary boycott  in which the alliance would refuse to do business with firms that traded with Qatar.  Those steps would cause further pain for Qatar, but not to the point of destabilizing its financial system or breaking the peg of its riyal currency to the U.S. dollar, senior Qatari businessmen and foreign economists said.  Related CoverageFactbox: Qatar's sovereign fund plays key anchor role during Gulf rift As long as we can sell our products we can withstand this for a very, very long time. The only thing that can really hurt us is if they block the gas exports, but then you provoke a crisis in the world,  said a top Qatari banker.   The economy will suffer but not to the point that we Qataris will suffer,  he added, declining to be named because his bank still does some business in other Gulf Arab states.  Instead of having five maids at home, we'll have three.   Qatar does face higher import costs as it is forced to use less convenient shipping routes through ports in countries such as Oman, but probably not to the point of having to cancel big state-led economic projects.   An outright recession looks very unlikely to us, even if the sanctions continue into next year,  Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economic said.  Banking  Qatar's most vulnerable point is probably its banks' dependence on foreign funding. Thirty-six percent of commercial banks' total liabilities in May were to foreigners, including other in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already largely frozen new business with Qatar because of guidance from their central banks; some jittery foreign banks have followed suit. A further tightening of sanctions could mean a mass pull-out of money.  A senior Qatari financial official estimated institutions from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain had $18 billion of deposits in Qatari banks that would mature in two months and which may not be renewed. Bank of America predicts $35 billion of outflows from Qatar's banking system within one year if the GCC severs financial ties completely.  This could force Qatari banks to liquidate overseas assets and hurt their profitability. But Doha could prevent any funding squeeze by mobilizing its foreign assets.  The central bank had $34.8 billion of reserves in May and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund is estimated to have around $320 billion of assets, of which over $200 billion may be liquid foreign assets.  A secondary boycott against Qatar might prove less effective than pulling money from its banks. It is not clear the alliance could maintain such a measure for long because it might break World Trade Organization rules specifying equal treatment of countries.  A  national security exception  might be invoked to justify a boycott, but foreign firms and governments -- including Qatar's big LNG customers in Asia -- could oppose it strongly, fearing a precedent might be sent. In the mid-1990s, GCC states abandoned an attempt to maintain a secondary boycott against Israel.  Capital Economic's Tuvey said any interruption to Qatar's LNG exports could be devastating, but there appeared to be little prospect of it.   For one thing, it could be damaging to all the oil exporters in the Gulf,  he said.       Infographic ID: '2utP9CX'     Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-economy-idUSKBN19R1WA"},

The change in policy was instituted by General John Nicholson, the senior U.S. commander in Kabul, over fears that families could be left guessing for days after casualties were announced but not identified and before families could be notified, said military spokesman Captain Bill Salvin.  It's a balance we're trying to strike between trying to provide all the support we can to families, while also informing the public,  he told Reuters.  Previously, the U.S. military command in Kabul issued a initial announcement only stating that a soldier had been killed, often including a general location within Afghanistan, but not identifying him. Once the soldier's family or next of kin had been notified, the Pentagon would release more details, including names and home units. The change in policy was revealed this week when U.S. Army Private First Class Hansen Kirkpatrick was killed in Afghanistan's Helmand province on Monday, but officials did not announce that a soldier had been killed until Wednesday, when his death and identity was released. A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that the policy only applied to Nicholson’s command, leaving other war zones like Iraq or Syria guided by the usual U.S. reporting requirements. Military spokesmen in Afghanistan would continue to release casualty reports, albeit on a more delayed schedule, Salvin said.   There might be a bit longer period before we report it,  he said.    About 13,000 U.S. and allied troops in a NATO-led force are deployed in Afghanistan to train and advise the security forces fighting Taliban insurgents. More than 3,500 of the coalition troops have been killed since the fighting began in late 2001. Several thousand additional American forces operate in a separate counter-terrorism mission in the country. Kirkpatrick was part of that mission. Salvin said the U.S. military would still respond to public reports of casualties, as occasionally happens when Afghan officials report casualties among foreign troops. Reporting by Josh Smith.

Middle East carriers saw demand rise by 3.7 percent in May compared with a year earlier, close to an eight-year low, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Thursday. IATA said the weaker growth was reflective of the laptop ban on U.S.-bound flights and uncertainty over President Trump's proposed travel bans. The new U.S. security measures, which take effect within three weeks of the announcement, will affect around 325,000 passengers a day traveling on 180 airlines from 280 airports around the world, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Privatizations have been a major part of Greece's three international bailouts since 2010, but political resistance and  red tape have hurt revenues. Athens has raised just 4.4 billion euros so far and has repeatedly revised targets downwards. The country raised 500 million euros from asset sales last year, missing its bailout target by about 2 billion euros, mainly due to delays in completing the lease of 14 airports to a consortium led by Germany's Fraport (FRAG.DE).  The 1.2-billion-euro lease of regional airports was completed this year. Along with the sale of a 67 percent stake in Thessaloniki Port (OLTr.AT) and a first 345-million-euro tranche from the lease of the former Athens airport Hellenikon, the lease will help Athens raise 2 billion euros in total this year, HRADF's chairwoman Lila Tsitsogiannopoulou said.  Our aim is to have the financial closing of the transaction(for Hellenikon) in December 2017,  Tsitsogiannopoulou told reporters. A consortium of Abu Dhabi and Chinese investors backed by conglomerate Fosun, led by Greece's Lamda, signed a deal in 2014 to develop the Hellenikon coastal area. The consortium will pay a total of 915 million euros ($1.03 billion) to lease the site, which is three times the size of Monaco, and the plan is to turn it into one of Europe's biggest coastal resorts. For next year, the agency aims to collect 3.5 billion euros, mainly from the sale of a 30 percent stake in the Athens International Airport (AIA), a 5 percent stake in its biggest telecoms operator OTE (OTEr.AT) and stakes in several energy and water utilities, Tsitogiannopoulou added. Greece's international lenders see a total proceed of 5 billion euros by 2018 from privatizations, according to the latest updated version of its bailout.   In its quarterly report, Greek think-tank IOBE said Hellenikon and other privatizations are expected to boost investments considerably next year. editing by Richard Balmforth","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-privatisation-idUSKBN19R192"},

The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 158,000 jobs in June, below the estimated addition of 185,000. The report by payrolls processor ADP acts as a precursor to monthly nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday, that includes hiring in both the public and private sectors. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims rose for the third straight week, with claims climbing to 248,000, above the 243,000 expected.  The ADP number has some correlation to the U.S. NFP (nonfarm payrolls) and investors always adjust their expectations on the back of this,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd.  But overall we think that the number is not that bad because this is the only second time that we have seen a miss.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 35.20 points, or 0.57 percent, at 6,115.66. All the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the tech sector's 1.08 percent fall topping the list. Investors are also parsing minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting that showed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate hikes. The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation slipped to 1.4 percent in May and has run below the 2 percent target for more than five years now. The minutes revealed a few officials viewed equity prices as high when compared to standard valuation measures, even though earnings growth has been robust. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times.

The state-owned carrier notified American Airlines last month that it was interested in buying up to 10 percent of its shares but would not exceed 4.75 percent without the approval of American's board.  We will be able to start buying shares in the open market soon, depending of course on what is the share value,  al Baker told reporters in Dublin, where he was launching a new Qatar Airways route.  The share purchases will start as soon as Qatar receives regulatory approval, he said.  However, American said in a regulatory filing dated June 22 that company rules prohibit anyone  from acquiring 4.75 percent or more  of the company's shares in issue without prior board approval. Shares in American were up 0.5 percent at $51.53 at 1342 GMT on Thursday, valuing the company at over $25 billion. The move by Qatar Airways would expand its investments to North America at a time when Qatar is embroiled in the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights row with three other Gulf states. Qatar has no intention of going above 10 percent, al Baker said.  Al-Baker said American's CEO Doug Parker told him at an airline conference in Mexico last month that he was against Qatar's planned investment and that he would not recommend that the board approve the purchase of a stake of over 4.75 percent.  He categorically told us that he was not interested, that he would not suggest to his board to allow us. However, I told him we can still take 4.75 percent and we will do that,  al Baker said.

Anti-Gulf Stance He said he had no ambition to influence American's management or soften what he said was its  anti-Gulf stance.  Along with United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), American has pressed the U.S. government to curb U.S. flights by Qatar Airways and rival Gulf carriers Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways. The U.S. carriers charge that their Gulf rivals have received billions of dollars in unfair state subsidies, allegations the Gulf carriers deny. A stake in American Airlines would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio. The Middle East's second biggest airline also has a 20 percent stake in International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, and a 10 percent stake in Chile's LATAM Airlines LAN.SN. Qatar Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the oneworld airline alliance. British Airways and Qatar Airways have a revenue-sharing partnership between their respective hubs in Doha and London, and Qatar Airways plans to launch flights to LATAM's base in Santiago, Chile. Al-Baker made repeated digs at American, saying it wanted to keep out the Gulf carriers from the U.S. market so it could  swindle their customers.   My dear friend Doug Parker, a big supporter of oneworld ... is now frightened of a oneworld carrier wanting to take a stake,  he said.

Elliott bought 237,800 shares of BEA at an average price of HK$32.569 each, increasing its stake in BEA to 8 percent, according to a July 4 filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Elliott's stake was last publicly disclosed in December 2015, when it crossed the 7 percent mark. Under Hong Kong regulations investors only have to disclose stakes when they move through a whole percentage level. Elliott filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong in July last year against BEA, the majority of the bank's directors and its CEO and chairman over a share placement the lender made to Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC). The lawsuit is the latest in a long-running and escalating dispute between the New York-based hedge fund and the tycoon-owned Hong Kong bank.  As a long-term shareholder, we continue to believe that there is the potential for significant shareholder value to be unlocked at BEA, when there are fundamental and substantial improvements to corporate governance and the overall management of the bank,  an Elliott spokesman said. BEA declined to comment on the increase in Elliott's stake. BEA has said previously it will vigorously oppose Elliott's lawsuit, saying it went against the interests of the bank and its shareholders. The dispute pits the $33 billion fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer against BEA's flashy chairman and former politician David Li, whose grandfather founded the bank nearly 100 years ago and whose family is among the city's best connected. The two sides met in the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong's High Court in April and are due to return on July 17.

The Saudi government said it was cancelling all export duties on steel for two years to encourage local industries, and would halve cement export tariffs. Analysts said top-line growth of cement and steel companies was not expected to get a huge boost, but the news was positive for a building materials sector that has been hit hard by the government's austerity policies in the past couple of years.  Despite some companies having obtained a licence to export six months ago, competition from other Asian markets is stiff and the demand outlook is relatively subdued,  said a Riyadh-based cement sector analyst.  Any rise in exports will still do little to reduce the supply glut in the local market.  Najran Cement, one of the companies with an export licence, rose 2.6 percent in its heaviest volume since February and three other stocks among the top 10 gainers were also from the cement industry. Al Yamamah Steel Industries climnbed 1.7 percent. The Riyadh index, however, fell 0.9 percent, its third straight session of losses. The banking sector was the main drag with heavyweight National Commercial Bank dropping 0.6 percent to 50.50 riyals, pulling further away from a 22-month intra-day high hit of 58.00 riyals on Sunday. Elsewhere, Qatar's index edged down 0.1 percent as 21 shares rose and 12 declined. Foreign funds, which have been net buyers of Qatari shares this week, were neutral on Thursday while non-Qatari Gulf investors were net sellers, bourse data showed. Four Arab states decided in a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday not to slap fresh sanctions on Qatar for now, but voiced disappointment at its  negative  response to their demands and warned of the possibility of further action against Doha. The index is down 10.1 percent since June 5, when the diplomatic crisis erupted. Fund managers believe further sanctions, such as a pull-out of bank deposits, remain quite possible in coming days or weeks, but they may hurt the Qatari economy rather than cripple it. In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas fell 1.4 percent after sources told Reuters that London's High Court planned to hold a full hearing in September on efforts by the company to restructure $700 million of its Islamic bonds. A High Court judge upheld an interim injunction there blocking holders of the sukuk, due to mature in October, from enforcing claims against Dana. But he also ordered Dana to cancel an injunction in a court in the emirate of Sharjah and seek a stay of its proceedings there. The Abu Dhabi index edged down 0.4 percent. In Dubai the index lost 0.5 percent in very low volumes, hit by a 1.4 percent drop in blue chip Emaar Properties and a 1.8 percent fall in peer DAMAC Properties . Cairo's stock index rose 0.3 percent in quiet trade as 16 blue chips advanced and 13 declined. Credit Agricole Egypt jumped 6.9 percent in thin volume and inevstment bank EFG Hermes surged 2.9 percent from a four-month low. Highlights Saudi Arabia * The index lost 0.9 percent to 7,204 points.

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to press ahead with implementing the pact to fight climate change after U.S President Donald Trump pulled out of the landmark deal reached in the French capital in 2015. Hulot presented an array of measures under six themes and 23 policy proposals, but most were short of specific details on how exactly the objectives would be achieved.  One of the symbolic acts of the plan is that France, which previously had made the promise to divide its greenhouse gas emissions by four by 2050, has decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 following the U.S. decision,  Hulot said.  The carbon neutral objective will force us to make the necessary investments,  he added.  He said the proposals such as the decision to end the sale of fossil fuel powered vehicles was a tall order and would constitute something of a 'revolution', but solutions were available and French carmakers would be up to the task. Diesel and gasoline vehicles represented about 95.2 percent of French new car fleets in the first half of year, while electric vehicles hold 1.2 percent of the market. Hybrid cars make up about 3.5 percent. Hulot cited the example of Geely's (0175.HK) Volvo that plans to go all electric with new models from 2019, and noted India was also targeting an all-electric vehicles fleet by 2030. Hulot said that even if France lagged countries such as Sweden and Costa Rica on this front, it would nevertheless embrace that 'spirit' and look to end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2040. End Fossil Fuels Hulot said ending the use of fossil fuels was also central in the French objective to cut carbon emissions and become carbon neutral by 2050. Among the key policy proposals is the plan to end the delivery of hydrocarbon licenses in France, with legislation to that effect due later this year. France will end coal-generated electricity production by 2022 and the government maintained its objective of cutting the share of nuclear power generation in the French electricity make-up to 50 percent by 2025, from over 75 percent at present.  The 2025 date is the objective, I hope we will keep to it,  said Hulot. France will also take measures to restrict the use of palm oil in the production of biofuels with the aim of reducing indirect deforestation.  Environmental campaign group Greenpeace said that although the French government had carried out the right analysis of the situation, the proposals were short of concrete measures to deal with the urgent challenges posed by climate change.  We are left wanting, on how these objectives will be achieved,  Greenpeace campaigner Cyrille Cormier said in a statement.   The goal to end the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040 sends out a strong signal, but we would really like to know what are the first steps achieve this, and how to make this ambition something other than a disappointment,  he said.

With $300 million in total capital, Felix, set up two years ago by venture capitalist Frederick Court, says it will take stakes in emerging digital fashion brands and the technologies to enable them to compete. Court was the earliest investor in Farfetch, one of the hottest venture backed online luxury companies in the world, which reported a 70 percent rise in gross sales last year to $800 million and has overtaken Net-A-Porter in website traffic, though it has yet to turn in a profit. Farfetch announced two weeks ago it had raised $397 million from No. 2 Chinese ecommerce player JD.com to expand further into China from its base in Europe and the U.S.  For the luxury industry, digital and China are the two topics in fashion today. For most brands, this is where the growth is happening,  Court, a native of France now based in Britain, said in an interview. He declined to comment on reports that Farfetch could be considering a stock market listing later this year or in 2018. The company has said it is not under any pressure to do so. Undated handout image from online luxury platform Farfetch.com.Farfetch/HandoutFelix also holds a stake in The Business of Fashion, a blog-turned media company that competes with WWD.com (Women's Wear Daily) for fashion industry insiders, and Mirakl, a Paris-based supplier of software for managing online marketplaces.

Those advisors include Grita Loebsack, the former chief executive of Gucci's holding company, Kering SA, David Marcus, vice president of Facebook's messaging business and Sebastian Picardo, ex-Net-A-Porter chief financial officer.

Canada's trade deficit almost doubled to C$1.09 billion in May but in a sign of economic strength, both exports and imports reached record highs, Statistics Canada data indicated.                   The Bank of Canada will probably take some comfort from indications that export growth is holding up,  said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.     Expectations for an interest rate increase as soon as next week have been rising since Bank of Canada officials said in June that a pair of rate cuts in 2015 had done their job to cushion the economy from collapsing oil prices.                          Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, recovered some ground after a surprisingly upbeat picture of U.S. demand halted the previous day's steep slide, although the prospect of oversupply in 2018 prompted more analysts to cut their price forecasts.                  At 9:24 a.m. ET (1324 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2935 to the greenback, or 77.31 U.S. cents, up 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2924 to C$1.2984. It touched on Tuesday its strongest since September at C$1.2912.     Still, foreign exchange strategists expect the loonie to weaken over the coming months as the recent rally driven by expectations for higher interest rates runs out of steam and lower oil prices weigh.                  Separate domestic data showed that the value of Canadian building permits issued in May jumped 8.9 percent on plans for more residential building construction, particularly in the red-hot Ontario market.                  Canadian government bond prices fell across a steeper yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds as minutes from the European Central Bank's June meeting showed the central bank opened the door to dropping a pledge to boost its bond-purchase programme if necessary.                  The two-year            fell 4 Canadian cents to yield 1.153 percent and the 10-year             declined 46 Canadian cents to yield 1.845 percent.     The two-year yield touched its highest since September 2014 at 1.159 percent.     Canada's employment report for June is due on Friday.

The central bank started cutting interest rates in 2008 to help the economy after the global financial crisis and gathered pace as a series of debt crises hit the euro zone in 2011 and 2012.  The monetary easing stepped up a gear when the ECB embarked on a trillion euro bond-buying scheme in March 2015 which pushed borrowing costs even lower. This punished German savers by driving interest rates to record lows but helped countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal manage a sharp increase in their debt loads. It was also good news for the 16 regions and city-states including Lower Saxony, North Rhine Westphalia and Berlin, collectively known as the  Laender .  The regions have had their debt servicing costs cut by an average 40 percent in eight years, according to ratings agency S&P; Global, and have been able to issue long-dated bonds and fix costs at extremely low levels.  Most German states are running a surplus now and one of the reasons for this improvement is certainly the lower interest rate environment besides robust tax revenue increases,  said Thomas Fischinger, a director at S&P; Global. The ECB's deposit rate -- a closely watched interest rate set by the central bank -- has fallen from 3.25 percent in 2008 to minus 0.40 percent. It has been negative since 2014. Then in 2015 it started to buy billions of euros of bonds every month. This brought down yields and interest payments on government borrowing dropped sharply.      Short-dated bond yields even went negative for countries with higher credit ratings such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, so investors were effectively paying to lend to them. This pushed German regional bond yields lower as investors bought German state debt as an alternative to Bunds. Budgetary Surprise While German national debt is among the lowest in the euro zone, regional debt is among the highest. The sixteen have average debts of around 160 percent of revenues. This compares with 5-100 percent for Austrian states and around 20-50 percent for Russian regions, while for Swiss cantons 200 percent would be at the very high end, according to S&P; Global's Fischinger.     In 2009, they were running deficits of around 9 percent. In 2016, all but one of them ran a surplus partly because of low interest rates. This helped fulfill a national directive to balance their budgets four years earlier than the 2020 goal. Preliminary numbers show North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) ran a surplus in 2016 for the first time since 1973.       Our budgetary performance has come as a surprise to some people,  said Axel Bendick, head of funding for NRW. Numbers from the ministry show a 3.88 billion euro increase in tax revenues and a 563 million euro fall in interest payments helped the state shrink its budget by 1.567 billion euros in 2016.     With worries increasing over a scarcity of eligible government bonds to buy under QE, the ECB in 2016 expanded its purchase program to include bonds issued by government-related entities, including regional debt.          Germany's regional benchmark bond market is the biggest beneficiary, being the largest in Europe. UniCredit analysts calculated the size of the state bond market at 364 billion euros at the end of 2016, seven times the size of the next biggest regional bond market, that of Spain, and comparable to the national debt of Belgium and the Netherlands.        The yield on the March 2025 bond of North Rhine Westphalia -- with around 52 billion euros of outstanding euro benchmark bonds -- fell from 1.19 percent two years ago to 0.40 percent. DE000NRW0FU3               New Lenders The easing has also allowed German states to issue longer-dated bonds as investors look to buy longer bonds for the extra yield in a low interest rates environment.        We printed our first 30-year benchmark in 2016, and certainly this part of the curve became attractive on the back of the QE program and inclusion,  said Bendick of the NRW finance ministry.       We usually have a program of around 20 billion; this has shrunk because of the extension of the portfolio. We don't have to fund as much in any given year as a result of this.      Also, regions' higher market profile has helped the state increase its borrowing in other currencies: in 2015, it met close to 20 percent of its funding needs in dollars. This increases the borrower's funding options and provides access to a new set of investors in case of more challenging times.  The boomtime for German states looks set to continue. NRW and Berlin both received strong demand for recent 30-year bond sales and with the ECB increasingly struggling to find German Bunds to buy, this demand may even increase.   Given the scarcity of German Bunds, we think that the ECB does not have any chance other than becoming even more active in the German sub-sovereign market,  said Citi strategist Michael Spies.

Privatizations have been a major part of Greece's three international bailouts since 2010, but political resistance and  red tape have hurt revenues. Athens has raised just 4.4 billion euros so far and has repeatedly revised targets downwards. The country raised 500 million euros from asset sales last year, missing its bailout target by about 2 billion euros, mainly due to delays in completing the lease of 14 airports to a consortium led by Germany's Fraport (FRAG.DE).  The 1.2-billion-euro lease of regional airports was completed this year. Along with the sale of a 67 percent stake in Thessaloniki Port (OLTr.AT) and a first 345-million-euro tranche from the lease of the former Athens airport Hellenikon, the lease will help Athens raise 2 billion euros in total this year, HRADF's chairwoman Lila Tsitsogiannopoulou said.  Our aim is to have the financial closing of the transaction(for Hellenikon) in December 2017,  Tsitsogiannopoulou told reporters. A consortium of Abu Dhabi and Chinese investors backed by conglomerate Fosun, led by Greece's Lamda, signed a deal in 2014 to develop the Hellenikon coastal area. The consortium will pay a total of 915 million euros ($1.03 billion) to lease the site, which is three times the size of Monaco, and the plan is to turn it into one of Europe's biggest coastal resorts. For next year, the agency aims to collect 3.5 billion euros, mainly from the sale of a 30 percent stake in the Athens International Airport (AIA), a 5 percent stake in its biggest telecoms operator OTE (OTEr.AT) and stakes in several energy and water utilities, Tsitogiannopoulou added. Greece's international lenders see a total proceed of 5 billion euros by 2018 from privatizations, according to the latest updated version of its bailout.   In its quarterly report, Greek think-tank IOBE said Hellenikon and other privatizations are expected to boost investments considerably next year. editing by Richard Balmforth","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-privatisation-idUSL8N1JX2Z0"},

In a securities filing on Thursday, BRF said the reorganization would entail 14 vice presidencies reporting directly to Faria. Previously, BRF had five senior vice president positions and six general managers with vice president status, according to a company spokesman. The reorganization will allow BRF to group Asian, European, Americas and African commercial operations into an international division that will be overseen by Simon Cheng, until recently sole head of Asia operations. BRF will also have vice presidents looking after Brazil, halal food division OneFoods Holdings Inc and the Southern Cone separately, the filing said. The move underscores efforts by Chairman Abilio Diniz to arrest weak operational performance and rising debt that led to BRF's first ever annual loss last year. Management at the São Paulo-based food processor has been working with a consultancy firm on a strategy to reignite growth, especially in Brazil. In addition, BRF's operations were disrupted by a federal police probe in March, which found several food processing firms bribing inspectors to overlook food safety rules. Common shares fell less than 0.1 percent to 39.06 reais at open in the São Paulo Stock Exchange. The company's shares are down 19 percent this year, reflecting concern over BRF's rising debt and failure to tame costs and reduce waste in Brazil. After losing $140 million in the fourth quarter, Faria and Diniz announced a management overhaul. BRF lost $87 million in the first quarter after the food safety scandal forced it to shut a plant for several weeks.

Elliott bought 237,800 shares of BEA at an average price of HK$32.569 each, increasing its stake in BEA to 8 percent, according to a July 4 filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Elliott's stake was last publicly disclosed in December 2015, when it crossed the 7 percent mark. Under Hong Kong regulations investors only have to disclose stakes when they move through a whole percentage level. Elliott filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong in July last year against BEA, the majority of the bank's directors and its CEO and chairman over a share placement the lender made to Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC). The lawsuit is the latest in a long-running and escalating dispute between the New York-based hedge fund and the tycoon-owned Hong Kong bank.  As a long-term shareholder, we continue to believe that there is the potential for significant shareholder value to be unlocked at BEA, when there are fundamental and substantial improvements to corporate governance and the overall management of the bank,  an Elliott spokesman said. BEA declined to comment on the increase in Elliott's stake. BEA has said previously it will vigorously oppose Elliott's lawsuit, saying it went against the interests of the bank and its shareholders. The dispute pits the $33 billion fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer against BEA's flashy chairman and former politician David Li, whose grandfather founded the bank nearly 100 years ago and whose family is among the city's best connected. The two sides met in the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong's High Court in April and are due to return on July 17.

Davenport, herself a former world number one, who won three grand slam titles including Wimbledon in 1999, said Konta proved in her three-set Centre Court victory on Wednesday against Donna Vekic that she had the steel needed to get to the top.  I think yesterday's match was a great example of that. I always look at players and look at their weaknesses and if those are improved upon.  To see her on Wednesday just being a mental rock out there under some really difficult circumstances was in a way inspiring,  Davenport said, adding that in the past Konta had buckled under pressure.  We have seen other players just crumble under the pressure of their own country and she stood up, she never panicked, she never blinked, she never had that look I've seen before of looking over with almost scared eyes, that was gone.  You get a sense that is something she has worked incredibly hard on, the discipline to be focused on each point in the routine she has talked about and it proved itself in one of her biggest moments here,  she said. Davenport said that she had noticed Konta's relentless focus when watching her practise.  Watch the discipline she brings, watch the intensity she brings,  she said.  It is hard to see success won't come for her, it is impossible to know.  Davenport said it would be interesting to see Konta at every level in all the majors to judge whether she was able to maintain the aura of Wednesday  because it was awfully impressive . The American said she sensed in Konta the same level of dedication that her compatriot and defending men's champion Andy Murray showed.  I get the sense with her, like you do with Andy Murray, that everything she can do to get better, she is doing. That could be mentally, physically, recovery, on the court.  It is hard not to see success for someone who is willing to put in that amount of effort and that much time and discipline to their career at that age.

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to press ahead with implementing the pact to fight climate change after U.S President Donald Trump pulled out of the landmark deal reached in the French capital in 2015. Hulot presented an array of measures under six themes and 23 policy proposals, but most were short of specific details on how exactly the objectives would be achieved.  One of the symbolic acts of the plan is that France, which previously had made the promise to divide its greenhouse gas emissions by four by 2050, has decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 following the U.S. decision,  Hulot said.  The carbon neutral objective will force us to make the necessary investments,  he added.  He said the proposals such as the decision to end the sale of fossil fuel powered vehicles was a tall order and would constitute something of a 'revolution', but solutions were available and French carmakers would be up to the task. Diesel and gasoline vehicles represented about 95.2 percent of French new car fleets in the first half of year, while electric vehicles hold 1.2 percent of the market. Hybrid cars make up about 3.5 percent. Hulot cited the example of Geely's (0175.HK) Volvo that plans to go all electric with new models from 2019, and noted India was also targeting an all-electric vehicles fleet by 2030. Hulot said that even if France lagged countries such as Sweden and Costa Rica on this front, it would nevertheless embrace that 'spirit' and look to end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2040. End Fossil Fuels Hulot said ending the use of fossil fuels was also central in the French objective to cut carbon emissions and become carbon neutral by 2050. Among the key policy proposals is the plan to end the delivery of hydrocarbon licenses in France, with legislation to that effect due later this year. France will end coal-generated electricity production by 2022 and the government maintained its objective of cutting the share of nuclear power generation in the French electricity make-up to 50 percent by 2025, from over 75 percent at present.  The 2025 date is the objective, I hope we will keep to it,  said Hulot. France will also take measures to restrict the use of palm oil in the production of biofuels with the aim of reducing indirect deforestation.  Environmental campaign group Greenpeace said that although the French government had carried out the right analysis of the situation, the proposals were short of concrete measures to deal with the urgent challenges posed by climate change.  We are left wanting, on how these objectives will be achieved,  Greenpeace campaigner Cyrille Cormier said in a statement.   The goal to end the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040 sends out a strong signal, but we would really like to know what are the first steps achieve this, and how to make this ambition something other than a disappointment,  he said.

The central bank started cutting interest rates in 2008 to help the economy after the global financial crisis and gathered pace as a series of debt crises hit the euro zone in 2011 and 2012.  The monetary easing stepped up a gear when the ECB embarked on a trillion euro bond-buying scheme in March 2015 which pushed borrowing costs even lower. This punished German savers by driving interest rates to record lows but helped countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal manage a sharp increase in their debt loads. It was also good news for the 16 regions and city-states including Lower Saxony, North Rhine Westphalia and Berlin, collectively known as the  Laender .  The regions have had their debt servicing costs cut by an average 40 percent in eight years, according to ratings agency S&P; Global, and have been able to issue long-dated bonds and fix costs at extremely low levels.  Most German states are running a surplus now and one of the reasons for this improvement is certainly the lower interest rate environment besides robust tax revenue increases,  said Thomas Fischinger, a director at S&P; Global. The ECB's deposit rate -- a closely watched interest rate set by the central bank -- has fallen from 3.25 percent in 2008 to minus 0.40 percent. It has been negative since 2014. Then in 2015 it started to buy billions of euros of bonds every month. This brought down yields and interest payments on government borrowing dropped sharply.      Short-dated bond yields even went negative for countries with higher credit ratings such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, so investors were effectively paying to lend to them. This pushed German regional bond yields lower as investors bought German state debt as an alternative to Bunds. Budgetary Surprise While German national debt is among the lowest in the euro zone, regional debt is among the highest. The sixteen have average debts of around 160 percent of revenues. This compares with 5-100 percent for Austrian states and around 20-50 percent for Russian regions, while for Swiss cantons 200 percent would be at the very high end, according to S&P; Global's Fischinger.     In 2009, they were running deficits of around 9 percent. In 2016, all but one of them ran a surplus partly because of low interest rates. This helped fulfill a national directive to balance their budgets four years earlier than the 2020 goal. Preliminary numbers show North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) ran a surplus in 2016 for the first time since 1973.       Our budgetary performance has come as a surprise to some people,  said Axel Bendick, head of funding for NRW. Numbers from the ministry show a 3.88 billion euro increase in tax revenues and a 563 million euro fall in interest payments helped the state shrink its budget by 1.567 billion euros in 2016.     With worries increasing over a scarcity of eligible government bonds to buy under QE, the ECB in 2016 expanded its purchase program to include bonds issued by government-related entities, including regional debt.          Germany's regional benchmark bond market is the biggest beneficiary, being the largest in Europe. UniCredit analysts calculated the size of the state bond market at 364 billion euros at the end of 2016, seven times the size of the next biggest regional bond market, that of Spain, and comparable to the national debt of Belgium and the Netherlands.        The yield on the March 2025 bond of North Rhine Westphalia -- with around 52 billion euros of outstanding euro benchmark bonds -- fell from 1.19 percent two years ago to 0.40 percent. DE000NRW0FU3               New Lenders The easing has also allowed German states to issue longer-dated bonds as investors look to buy longer bonds for the extra yield in a low interest rates environment.        We printed our first 30-year benchmark in 2016, and certainly this part of the curve became attractive on the back of the QE program and inclusion,  said Bendick of the NRW finance ministry.       We usually have a program of around 20 billion; this has shrunk because of the extension of the portfolio. We don't have to fund as much in any given year as a result of this.      Also, regions' higher market profile has helped the state increase its borrowing in other currencies: in 2015, it met close to 20 percent of its funding needs in dollars. This increases the borrower's funding options and provides access to a new set of investors in case of more challenging times.  The boomtime for German states looks set to continue. NRW and Berlin both received strong demand for recent 30-year bond sales and with the ECB increasingly struggling to find German Bunds to buy, this demand may even increase.   Given the scarcity of German Bunds, we think that the ECB does not have any chance other than becoming even more active in the German sub-sovereign market,  said Citi strategist Michael Spies.

Inbound merger and acquisition (M&A;) volumes total $4.6 billion in 2017, almost triple the $1.6 billion seen for the same period in 2016 and the highest for the same period since 2012, with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) the top adviser across Russian M&A.;   Bankers say the increase is an indication that Western banks and companies are more willing to deal with Moscow, despite the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union over the annexation of Crimea. This, along with weak energy prices have hurt Russia's economy although a weakening of the rouble RUB= to above 60 a dollar in the last quarter, close to the level it was at the start of the year, has made Russian assets more attractive.  There has been a pickup. I think it was largely on the back of (an) improved economic outlook, rather than (an) easing geopolitical environment. People have got used to the sanctions,  Alexei Yakovitsky, global CEO at Russia's VTB Capital (VTBR.MM) said. VTB Capital is in third place in the adviser rankings, behind U.S. bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Deutsche. Deals by overseas buyers in Russia make up more than half of all transactions done so far, with a slowdown in domestic M&A; pushing the total value down to $7.5 billion from $10.3 billion in 2016. Last year's figure was boosted by state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) buying its own shares from state development bank VEB for $2.02 billion. [nL8N19L22M]     Deutsche Bank's leading position was thanks to its role in the biggest Russia M&A; deal so far this year, the proposed $1.85 billion purchase by Austria's OMV (OMVV.VI) of a 25 percent stake in oil and gas group Severneftegazprom from Uniper (UN01.DE).

Some had hoped Trump's election would be a step towards sanctions being lifted, but last month the U.S. government added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.   It's reached a new normal. I don't necessarily expect there will be tremendous growth to pre-crisis levels,  a senior banker at a major investment bank based in Moscow told Reuters. Austria leads the countries buying into Russia, with China in second position driven in part by a $887 million deal to sell a 10 percent stake in gold producer Polyus (PLZL.MM) to a Fosun International (0656.HK) led consortium. [nL8N1IX4LW] Polyus' (PLZL.MM) sale of $879 million worth of shares in Moscow and London became the biggest Russian equity markets transaction on the final day of the second quarter, with British investors snapping up around half of the shares.

The alliance against it, meanwhile, may not have options to inflict further damage.  As the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter, Qatar is so rich -- at $127,660, its gross domestic product per capita in purchasing power terms is the highest of any country, according to the International Monetary Fund -- it can deploy money to counter almost any type of sanction.  In the past month it has arranged new shipping routes to offset the closure of its border with Saudi Arabia, deposited billions of dollars of state money in local banks to shore them up, and drawn the interest of some of the West's biggest energy firms by announcing a plan to raise its LNG output 30 percent.  The success of these initiatives suggests Qatar could weather months or years of the current sanctions if it has the political will to do so -- and that further sanctions being contemplated by the alliance may not prove decisive.  On Wednesday, the alliance said Qatar, which denies any support for terrorism, had missed a deadline to comply with its demands. Further steps against Doha will be taken in line with international law  at the appropriate time”, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said.  Saudi media reported this week that the new sanctions would include a pull-out of deposits and loans from Qatar by banks in alliance states, and a  secondary boycott  in which the alliance would refuse to do business with firms that traded with Qatar.  Those steps would cause further pain for Qatar, but not to the point of destabilizing its financial system or breaking the peg of its riyal currency to the U.S. dollar, senior Qatari businessmen and foreign economists said.  Related CoverageFactbox: Qatar's sovereign fund plays key anchor role during Gulf rift As long as we can sell our products we can withstand this for a very, very long time. The only thing that can really hurt us is if they block the gas exports, but then you provoke a crisis in the world,  said a top Qatari banker.   The economy will suffer but not to the point that we Qataris will suffer,  he added, declining to be named because his bank still does some business in other Gulf Arab states.  Instead of having five maids at home, we'll have three.   Qatar does face higher import costs as it is forced to use less convenient shipping routes through ports in countries such as Oman, but probably not to the point of having to cancel big state-led economic projects.   An outright recession looks very unlikely to us, even if the sanctions continue into next year,  Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economic said.  Banking  Qatar's most vulnerable point is probably its banks' dependence on foreign funding. Thirty-six percent of commercial banks' total liabilities in May were to foreigners, including other in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already largely frozen new business with Qatar because of guidance from their central banks; some jittery foreign banks have followed suit. A further tightening of sanctions could mean a mass pull-out of money.  A senior Qatari financial official estimated institutions from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain had $18 billion of deposits in Qatari banks that would mature in two months and which may not be renewed. Bank of America predicts $35 billion of outflows from Qatar's banking system within one year if the GCC severs financial ties completely.  This could force Qatari banks to liquidate overseas assets and hurt their profitability. But Doha could prevent any funding squeeze by mobilizing its foreign assets.  The central bank had $34.8 billion of reserves in May and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund is estimated to have around $320 billion of assets, of which over $200 billion may be liquid foreign assets.  A secondary boycott against Qatar might prove less effective than pulling money from its banks. It is not clear the alliance could maintain such a measure for long because it might break World Trade Organization rules specifying equal treatment of countries.  A  national security exception  might be invoked to justify a boycott, but foreign firms and governments -- including Qatar's big LNG customers in Asia -- could oppose it strongly, fearing a precedent might be sent. In the mid-1990s, GCC states abandoned an attempt to maintain a secondary boycott against Israel.  Capital Economic's Tuvey said any interruption to Qatar's LNG exports could be devastating, but there appeared to be little prospect of it.   For one thing, it could be damaging to all the oil exporters in the Gulf,  he said.       Infographic ID: '2utP9CX'     Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar-economy-idUSL8N1JW2SY"},

Parts of Fukuoka prefecture, on the island of Kyushu, were hit by 556 mm (22 inches) of rain in the 40 hours to 4 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Thursday, about 1.6 times the amount that usually falls in the whole of July, the weather agency said.  Television showed a military helicopter airlifting a stranded resident to safety and houses half submerged in murky water or destroyed by landslides.  I heard this tremendous rumbling noise and then the house exploded. A tree burst through the wall into the room,  a sodden, dishevelled man told public broadcaster NHK after his house was hit by a landslide. Three people had been killed, three were in  cardiopulmonary arrest  and eight were injured, NHK reported, while about 300 people were stranded, mostly in their homes, cut off by floods or landslides. Thousands of soldiers, police and fire fighters fanned out,  wading through water and plodding through mud to search for victims.  Since daybreak today, we have mobilised 7,800 people from police, fire authorities and the Self-Defence Forces to do our utmost in searching and rescuing the affected,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.

Soil has been loosened in these regions because of the heavy rain ... Strict vigilance should be maintained,  an agency official told reporters.

All operations stopped at a Daihatsu Motor Co plant in Oita because staff and parts could not get to the plant. The company also cancelled a shift at a plant in nearby Fukuoka. A spokesman for JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp said there was no impact on its Oita refinery operations and Toshiba Corp said its semiconductor plant in Oita was operating normally.

Its gas reserves rose to 298.7 trillion standard cubic feet from 297.6 trillion, Saudi Aramco said in its 2016 annual review. The company said it had discovered two new oilfields, Jubah and Sahaban, and one new gas field, Hadidah, all located in the Eastern Province, the main oil region in Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter. Saudi Arabia's national oil company plans to list a stake through an initial public offering in 2018 which is expected to be the world's biggest IPO. The review did not make a reference to updates of the IPO. Aramco, which has exclusive rights to explore and develop Saudi Arabia's oil and gas, boosted oil production to a new record of 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2016, from 10.2 million bpd in 2015, it said in the review. Its oil exports rose to 7.6 million bpd in 2016 from 7.1 million bpd in 2015. Asia still accounts for the lion's share of Saudi Aramco's exports at 66 percent, up from 65 percent in 2015, followed by exports to the United States, whose share dropped to 15.8 percent from 16.6 percent in 2015. Aramco has also raised processing capacity of raw gas to 12 billion standard cubic feet per day (scfd). After raw gas is processed, output of sales gas or methane, used mainly for electricity and petrochemicals, hit a new record of 8.3 billion scfd. Ethane production, the favourite feedstock for petrochemicals was also higher to 920 million scfd from 794 million scfd in 2015. Saudi Aramco plans to double its gas production to 23 billion scfd in a decade by including  unconventional gas  in the mix and by continuing to develop gas non-associated with oil to help it limit the use of oil in power generation and provide feedstock to the petrochemical industry it is keen to grow. Its share of chemical production capacity almost doubled to 13,285 kilotonnes per year from 7,016 kilotonnes per year in 2015. Its Wasit gas plant fed by non-associated gas from offshore fields Hasbah and Arabiyah hit full capacity of 2.5 billion scfd. Aramco said more than 40 percent of non-associated gas now comes from the two fields. Progress continued to be made in the unconventional gas programme as the company completed wells in northern Saudi Arabia to deliver 55 million scfd of gas by year-end 2017 to industrial and electrical power facilities in the Wa'ad Al Shamal industrial city, a phosphate project run by Saudi mining company Ma'aden. Saudi Aramco has responded to the challenges of the industry by lowering costs of its operations across the board. As part of technological advancements, it said in the review it implemented new techniques to lower gas production costs such as the use resin-enhanced local sand to fracture a gas well with further trials to follow this year. Another gas project Midyan is almost complete, it said while on the oil side, the expansion of Arab Light Khurais oilfield to 1.5 million bpd will be on stream by mid-2018. Midyan is one of the new gas fields in northwest Saudi Arabia to produce gas for power plants and potentially supply other industries in a region rich in iron ore deposits. It was discovered in the 1980s and has significant reserves.

The Scottsdale, Arizona company is launching  Fender Play,  an online system for learning guitar that Chief Executive Officer Andy Mooney, a veteran of Nike and Disney, hopes will cut down on the number of would-be guitarists who give up. He said 45 percent of the company's guitars sell to  first-time players, but 90 percent abandon the instrument within a year and never become repeat customers.  The 10 percent who make it through the first year own an average of seven guitars,  Mooney said in an interview.  When we gathered the data and looked at the facts, we said, 'Oh my God, if we just reduced the abandonment rate by even 10 percent, we could perhaps double the size of the industry.'  The musical instrument industry grew 9 percent to $7.1 billion in retail sales over the past five years but remains well below its 2005 peak of $7.7 billion, according to data from The Music Trades magazine. Moreover, the electric guitar was virtually absent from the Top 20 music charts in the past five years. The guitar industry hoped video games like  Guitar Hero  would ignite interest among teenagers. Instead, electric guitar sales fell from 1.2 million units in 2011 to just over 1 million in 2016, according to The Music Trades. The overall guitar market held steady at around 2.5 million units per year during that period, thanks to growth from acoustic instruments.

Fender/Handout via REUTERSFender Play aims to address some key trends, Mooney said. About half of first-time buyers are women, according to Fender's research, and they are buying acoustic guitars online and going to sites like YouTube for lessons. For those new players, he said, traditional music stores can be intimidating. A young man uses Fender Play, a new digital learning tool from Fender that uses a song-based approach that helps new players master chords and riffs as seen in this undated photo received by Reuters July 5, 2017. Fender/Handout via REUTERSAfter a free introduction, Fender Play costs $19.99 a month and consists of a series of video lessons that assume no prior knowledge. Mooney said his model was Lynda.com, the online learning platform acquired by LinkedIn for $1.5 billion that defied expectations it could not compete with free videos on the internet. Next year, Fender will make an instructor edition available to dealers so they can use it to manage their guitar students. Fender will compete with other fee-based sites like JamPlay, but is the first guitar maker to dive into the online learning market. Brian Majeski, editor of The Music Trades, said including dealers should help Fender avoid the impression that it competes with stores for guitar students. He called the software initiative a credible strategy to try to spur growth.  All the pieces are there,  Majeski said.  But this is uncharted territory.

Inbound merger and acquisition (M&A;) volumes total $4.6 billion in 2017, almost triple the $1.6 billion seen for the same period in 2016 and the highest for the same period since 2012, with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) the top adviser across Russian M&A.;   Bankers say the increase is an indication that Western banks and companies are more willing to deal with Moscow, despite the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union over the annexation of Crimea. This, along with weak energy prices have hurt Russia's economy although a weakening of the rouble RUB= to above 60 a dollar in the last quarter, close to the level it was at the start of the year, has made Russian assets more attractive.  There has been a pickup. I think it was largely on the back of (an) improved economic outlook, rather than (an) easing geopolitical environment. People have got used to the sanctions,  Alexei Yakovitsky, global CEO at Russia's VTB Capital (VTBR.MM) said. VTB Capital is in third place in the adviser rankings, behind U.S. bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Deutsche. Deals by overseas buyers in Russia make up more than half of all transactions done so far, with a slowdown in domestic M&A; pushing the total value down to $7.5 billion from $10.3 billion in 2016. Last year's figure was boosted by state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) buying its own shares from state development bank VEB for $2.02 billion. [nL8N19L22M]     Deutsche Bank's leading position was thanks to its role in the biggest Russia M&A; deal so far this year, the proposed $1.85 billion purchase by Austria's OMV (OMVV.VI) of a 25 percent stake in oil and gas group Severneftegazprom from Uniper (UN01.DE).

Some had hoped Trump's election would be a step towards sanctions being lifted, but last month the U.S. government added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.   It's reached a new normal. I don't necessarily expect there will be tremendous growth to pre-crisis levels,  a senior banker at a major investment bank based in Moscow told Reuters.

[nL8N1IX4LW] Polyus' (PLZL.MM) sale of $879 million worth of shares in Moscow and London became the biggest Russian equity markets transaction on the final day of the second quarter, with British investors snapping up around half of the shares.

A tapering of monetary stimulus in the euro zone could also cut demand for assets in the European Union's eastern markets, and the prospect of higher yields in the west would make the region's government debt relatively less attractive.      The key negative impact today was the rise in the 10-year Bund yield to above 0.5 percent,  one Budapest-based currency dealer said. The 10-year German yield was bid at 0.566 percent at 1218 GMT, up 9.1 basis points.     Poland's corresponding yield rose 8 basis points to 3.3945 percent.     Hungary's 10-year yield rose 9 basis points to 3.22 percent even though demand at the bond auctions held in the morning was  surprisingly good , one fixed income trader said.      Romania's 10-year bond auction also drew healthy demand before the ECB published its minutes.       Regional currencies have been pushed down by the same impact,  the trader added.  The ECB was more hawkish than expected and that lifts the euro in its crosses.      In early trade, the region's currencies mostly firmed, led by the zloty as some investors took increasing divisions in the Polish central bank over inflation and rates as a sign that it may start to discuss rate hikes late this year.     But the currencies retreated later, led by the Czech crown  and the Hungarian forint which shed a quarter of a percent against the euro by 1227 GMT, while Poland's zloty shed 0.15 percent.     Czech domestic markets were closed due to a holiday.      The economic data released by Hungary on Thursday were mixed, with a surprise surge in industrial output in May and the budget deficit in June. [nB3N1A701Z      I do not see any Hungary-specific factor...Emerging market currencies are falling anyway, like the lira and the rand ,  another Hungarian dealer said.     Central European units are shielded by relatively healthy economic fundamentals.     A Reuters poll of analysts showed on Thursday that growth and a probable kick-off in Czech monetary tightening could lift three of the region's five main currencies - the leu, the crown and the zloty - in the next 12 months.      The region's main equities indices were treading water, except for a 1.1 percent rise in Budapest driven by a rise in shares of OTP Bank, which plans acquisitions in the region, to a 10-year high.

Qatar Airways joins Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS) and Etihad Airways, which have also announced this week a lifting of the ban on their U.S. flights. In March, the United States imposed the ban on direct flights originating at 10 airports in eight countries - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey - to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Qatar Airways said in a statement on Thursday the ban had been lifted after the airline and its hub airport Hamad International met with new U.S. security requirements. The United States announced on June 29 enhanced security measures for flights to the country which require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives.  Related CoverageRoyal Air Maroc expects U.S. laptop ban to end by July 19: officialQatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Dublin the airline was found to be in compliance with the  new draconian requirements  after an audit over the previous two days. U.S. transport officials were due to visit Qatar Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines on July 5 to check the latest measures were in place, a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told Reuters on Wednesday. TSA said on Twitter on Thursday the restrictions on Qatar Airways and Hamad International had been lifted. Airlines affected by the ban have complained that demand on U.S. flights had been weakened by restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump's administration. Middle East carriers saw demand rise by 3.7 percent in May compared with a year earlier, close to an eight-year low, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Thursday. IATA said the weaker growth was reflective of the laptop ban on U.S.-bound flights and uncertainty over President Trump's proposed travel bans. The new U.S. security measures, which take effect within three weeks of the announcement, will affect around 325,000 passengers a day traveling on 180 airlines from 280 airports around the world, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could still face in-cabin restrictions on electronic devices. Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) has said it expects the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19.  Royal Air Maroc also believes [RAM.UL] it can have the ban lifted for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19, a senior official from the state-owned airline told Reuters. Other airlines affected by the ban include Royal Jordanian RJAL.AM, Kuwait Airways [KA.UL] and EgyptAir [EGY.UL].

Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing said Jia Yueting will remain controlling shareholder without any role, having resigned as chief executive in May to focus on the electric car business, of which he will now become chairman. The announcement came after Jia on social media promised to repay debt and reaffirmed LeEco's electric car commitment.   Please give LeEco some time, please give LeEco car some time,  Jia Yueting wrote in Chinese on his Weibo and WeChat accounts.  We will pay back creditors, suppliers and any other debts.  The plea came about a month after Jia said a cash crunch at LeEco was  far worse than expected . He previously said the group, whose businesses include telephones, television sets and cars, expanded too quickly from its video-streaming beginnings 13 years ago. Jia's resignation is the latest development in a week of turmoil, with asset managers seeking to pull investment after a Shanghai court granted China Merchant Bank Co Ltd's request to freeze $182 million in assets due to late interest payments.  Given LeEco's current state, in order to protect fund safety, we have asked our fund manager to pause new investment and will seek to hasten our exit from invested projects,  Noah Holdings Ltd said in a statement late on Wednesday. Hengyu Tianze, known as 1314 fund, also in a statement on Wednesday said it had requested to redeem its convertible bonds in a LeEco unit several times since March and had met with Jia on the matter. Investors were also spooked on Monday after it emerged that China's national enterprise credit information publicity system showed Jia relinquished his role as LeEco's legal representative last month in favor of another executive, Wu Meng.   Resigning as chief executive of LeEco's listed company and many other roles is all aimed at making the FF91 go into production and hit the market as soon as possible,  Jia said earlier on Thursday, referring to a luxury electric car that LeEco is developing with U.S. startup Faraday Future. Analysts have said LeEco's foray into automaking caused its financial troubles, but Jia said LeEco remains committed.  Our dream to revolutionize the auto industry cannot be defeated, however big a bank run,  Jia said, using Chinese characters that mean both  bank run  and  jibe .

Masoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), told Reuters in an interview that the timetable for independence after a Sept. 25 vote on the issue was  flexible but not open-ended . He expected a  yes vote . The vote could turn into another regional flashpoint, with Turkey, Iran and Syria, along with Iraq the states with sizeable Kurdish populations, all resolutely opposed to an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq. But Barzani played down such fears. Within Iraq's borders, there is growing concern the real purpose of the referendum is not secession, but to strengthen Kurdish claims over hotly disputed territory adjoining recognized KRG boundaries, such as the oil-rich region and city of Kirkuk, whose future has been in play for over a decade. Inside the KRG, parties such as the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of Jalal Talabani or the dissident Gorran group, all favor independence but not necessarily under the leadership of Barzani and his Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). At his palace in the hillside village of Salahaddin, Barzani said the vote would decide the fate of Kirkuk, which Kurdish Peshmerga forces prevented Islamic State from capturing in 2014.   Whatever the people of Kirkuk decide within the referendum, that decision should be respected,  said a relaxed Barzani. The Peshmerga effectively runs Kirkuk, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs. Hardline Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin. Barzani, a Kurdish nationalist who has long championed the rights of his people, said negotiations with Baghdad, neighbors and international powers would start immediately after the vote in order to reach an amicable agreement.  Our main goal is to implement and achieve the decision of our people through peace and dialogue,  he said, wearing his traditional Peshmerga uniform. Historic Bid Barzani accused the Shi'ite-led Iraqi government, backed by Iran, of not sticking to a constitutional agreement of allowing the Kurds to have greater powers under a federal state set up after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.  For 14 years we have been waiting and we have been discussing this partnership but we have always been told it's not a good time and it's not acceptable timing so my question is, when is the right time?  The Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East, but their territory ended up split between modern-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran. Saddam's government waged the Anfal campaign against them in the 1980s, killing tens of thousands including with poison gas in the city of Halabja. Iraq's Kurdistan region's President Massoud Barzani speaks during an interview with Reuters in Erbil, Iraq July 6, 2017.Azad LashkariBarzani, whose father led struggles against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, grew up in Iranian exile but returned as a teenager, joined the Peshmerga and took on the mantle of resistance. He said the Kurds were ready to take responsibility for the outcome of the referendum.  We have to rectify the history of mistreatment of our people and those who are saying that independence is not good, our question to them is, if it's not good for us, why is it good for you?  Barzani played down speculation that the referendum would spark violence, saying  the legitimacy of the people is bigger than the legitimacy of any of the political parties or any of the external interventions .  I don’t think anybody can stand against the big wave of the people of Kurdistan when they decide their destiny. Maybe there will be some attempts to foil (it)... We will try our best not to allow that to happen.  He said he was ready to allay the security concerns of Iraq, Turkey and Iran, saying that postponing independence would actually lead to greater instability. Iraq's Kurdistan region's President Massoud Barzani speaks during an interview with Reuters in Erbil, Iraq July 6, 2017.Azad Lashkari We have proved that we are factors of stability,  he said.  So what we do through a referendum is prevent that upcoming instability. We want to cut any possibility of bloodshed in the future.  After Mosul An additional element of regional volatility is Turkey’s determination to stop further advances across northern Syria by the Kurdish People’s Protection Forces (YPG) militia. Ankara and the KDP are united in trying to stop the YPG – allied to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) conducting an insurgency in Turkey – from consolidating self-rule in Syria. But Turkey regards Barzani’s independence bid as pulling in the opposite direction. He said his  Kurdish state  would give full assurances to ethnic minorities including Christians, Yazidis, and Shabaks, indicating his Peshmerga forces had already lost hundreds of fighters to retake their areas from Islamic State. As the battle to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul draws to a close, Barzani said victory is incomplete without a political reconciliation plan. He accused the Iraqi government of failing to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan.  I warned if you are not going to have this political plan, the situation will reverse.  He said a high-level committee formed by the Kurdish region, the Baghdad government and a U.S.-led military coalition to help Mosul leaders rebuild the city had never convened.  I have big concerns about the situation in Mosul and about post-liberation, because the end of Islamic State in Mosul doesn’t mean the end of Islamic State.

The pair collided in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on June 25, costing both a likely place on the podium and the team plenty of points.  Force India have reminded both that the team comes first, with Baku following a row in Canada when Ocon was angry that Perez had not given way. The drivers have yet to clear the air. Mexican Perez left no doubt about his lingering annoyance when he spoke to reporters before Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix, pinning the blame on the 20-year-old - who refused to accept it.  I think what happened in Baku was just totally unacceptable from the team point of view,  Perez said.  I think simply Esteban has to understand what racing means. Racing means just racing another car, not crashing into the other car.  If you just push your team mate into the wall then that’s not the right thing. I expect him to be intelligent enough to understand what he did wrong and change a bit his attitude for the benefit of the team.  Perez was defending third place from Ocon when they collided after a safety car re-start, with the Frenchman suffering a puncture and car damage. He finished sixth while Perez had to retire. Ocon said he had flown to the team's Silverstone factory directly after the race for a debrief that concluded the incident had been 50-50.  It was both of our fault,  he said.  There were things that he did that were not right, there were things I did that were not right.  The Frenchman saw no need to change his approach and bristled at the suggestion he did not know what racing was about.  I've been finishing more than 40 single-seater races in a row, I am European champion and GP3 world champion so I don't think I'm really lacking experience either on racing or wheel-to-wheel fights,  he said.  I am not going to change my attitude. I think it's been working well since the beginning of the year together with the team and the way we work.  The only thing I think we will change is just to be careful on what we do when we race.

Currently, many cross-border payments and settlements in the Gulf are carried out by correspondent banks - banks in one country acting as agents to foreign financial institutions that do not have a local presence. However, a tightening of anti-money laundering rules by U.S. and European banks since the financial crisis has added to the cost of this arrangement, while downsizing by some banks has seen them quit the market. The Arab Regional Payments System (ARPS) will act as a correspondent for its participants such as banks and financial institutions, through a single, centralised platform for cross-border payments, the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) said on Thursday. It will also aim to boost the use of local currencies in cross-border money flows. Many transactions in the Arab world have long been done in U.S dollars. The AMF invited central banks and banks of all member countries, including Qatar, which is facing a diplomatic and economic boycott by four Arab states led by Saudi Arabia, although there was no confirmation whether representatives of Qatari banks were present.  The ARPS aims at establishing a mechanism for use of Arab currencies for settlement, it saves time and cost of transactions and will help boost inter-Arab trade and investments,  said AMF director-general Abdulrahman al Hamidy.  The final touches are being given to the new system before we submit it for approval of the central banks who are supporting this project,  he told a forum of bankers and money exchange companies. The AMF expects the ARPS to be in operation by 2020. The AMF is in talks with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank over the ARPS, and also over whether it could cover the U.S. dollar and euro. A study by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton, which is advising the AMF on the ARPS, showed cross-border transactions in the Gulf currently cost around $33 on average, with a compliance investigation costing around $22. It said both of these costs should probably be around $10 each.  ARPS will provide an alternative to high costs, lengthy correspondent banking and reduce liquidity requirements of commercial banks,  Lazaro Campos, a senior executive adviser at Booz Allen Hamilton, told Reuters. The ARPS will fully comply with international standards and regional compliance requirements, Campos said, adding participants would be liable for compliance.

German Bund yields hit their highest in 1-1/2 years as a sell-off in European stocks and bonds snowballed. Wall Street was set to fall for the first time in four days, while the dollar started to backslide again. With the Federal Reserve sending mixed signals on its balance sheet plans, investors were focusing on U.S. jobs data due on Friday. A summit of G20 nations has also taken on greater significance following this week's test of a long-range missile by North Korea. Fund manager Jan Dehn of Ashmore identified a trio of concerns spooking investors, especially in emerging markets.  One is the Middle East and the Qatar-Saudi situation and even the oil market doesn't know how to handle that one,  he said.  The second is North Korea, which is classic geopolitical risk, and finally, and probably most importantly, there has been the recent hawkish tilt from the major central banks and it seems to be coordinated.  Dehn also cited some profit-taking in emerging market assets after a stellar first half to the year. South Africa's rand, Turkey's lira and the Russian rouble all fell sharply on Thursday for a second consecutive day. The rand fell 0.7 percent, extending Wednesday's 1.6 percent drop driven by ANC proposals to nationalise the respected central bank and expropriate land without compensation, and by the ruling party's failure to agree much-needed reforms. Bond yields, which drive global borrowing costs, pushed higher again ahead of U.S. trading with benchmark U.S. Treasury yields testing 2.4 percent as they rose for a sixth day in the last seven.. Bunds led European yields higher too, with comments from the ECB's chief economist stressing ahead of the bank's latest meeting minutes that it needed to keep a  steady-hand policy  doing little to change the sentiment. The minutes themselves then showed policymakers had last month discussed dropping their pledge to expand or extend the bank's bond-purchase programme if necessary.  If confidence in the inflation outlook improved further, the case of retaining this (easing) bias could be reviewed,  the ECB said in the accounts of its June meeting. Destabilising Activities Commodity markets continued to swing wildly. Brent oil was at $48.54 a barrel ahead of U.S. trading as it recovered 1.5 percent of a 4 percent drop seen on Wednesday when rising OPEC exports raised fresh questions about the group's plans to cut global supply. Gold was down near an eight-week low at $1,222 , though industrial metal aluminum hit its highest in more than five weeks as worries about Chinese supply were fanned by market talk that local smelters would be forced to shut capacity. Ahead of the formal start of the G20 meeting in Germany there was plenty of talk from the major players. Host Angela Merkel said the summit should strengthen international cooperation but a top Chinese official warned the United States that rising tensions over North Korea should not be used as an excuse to impose sanctions on his country. In a speech in Poland, U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile urged Russia to  cease its destabilising activities  and urged it to join the wider international community to tackle problems. U.S. stock futures pointed to a 0.3-0.4 percent dip for Wall Street's S&P; 500 and Dow Jones indexes while the dollar was stalled at 113.32 Japanese yen and $1.1383 per euro . Traders were wary though of making sudden moves, with a flurry of U.S. data looming or already arrived, including ADP employment, ISM non-manufacturing PMI and the initial jobless claims report, all of which are appetizers ahead of Friday's Payrolls numbers. European stocks were pushed to their lowest in over two months by the day's sell-off while the pound slipped back below 88 pence to the euro as Brexit tensions re-emerged in Brussels. The European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned British ministers and businesses who are calling for  frictionless trade  post-Brexit that is  not possible . Barnier also said he was ready to handle a failure of talks and  no deal  but that that would be damaging, especially to Britain, and he saw  no reasonable justification  for it. Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.5 percent as a stronger yen depressed the outlook for export earnings. Trading in Asia has been buffeted this week by tensions on the Korean peninsula after North Korea fired a missile, which U.S. officials concluded was an intercontinental ballistic missile, into Japanese waters.

The government is trying to push contested legislation through parliament, including raising the pension age and lifting a ban on land sales, as part of a $17.5 billion bailout agreed with the IMF in 2015. One tranche of IMF aid will likely be postponed until 2018, acting Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy told reporters at a press conference.   Due to the fact that the consideration of important draft laws, which were key when the IMF Board of Directors decided to allocate the next tranches, are delayed ... we expect that one tranche will be transferred to the next year,  he said.       Smoliy spoke as the central bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 12.5 percent, after two consecutive months of cuts, saying the step was necessary to keep its inflation targets on track amid a worsening economic outlook.  The bank cut its economic growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent and said inflation had accelerated to 15 percent year-on-year in June, higher than predicted. The central bank also said uncertainty hangs more generally over Ukraine's ability to implement the IMF program and that it new economic forecasts hinged on cooperation with the Fund staying on track.  The inefficient implementation of reforms can lead to a deterioration in the prospects for economic growth, which will have negative consequences for inflation and exchange rate expectations and will increase inflationary pressures,  the central bank said in a statement.   Uncertainty remains regarding the implementation of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms necessary to maintain macrofinancial stability, increase the economy's potential and continue the program with the IMF,  it said. The central bank lowered its forecasts for forex reserves at the end of 2017 to $20 billion from $21.1 billion, and said the potential for an escalation in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine posed a significant risk to the economy. However, the bank played down the impact of last week's cyber attack on the Ukrainian economy.

Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing said Jia Yueting will remain controlling shareholder without any role, having resigned as chief executive in May to focus on the electric car business, of which he will now become chairman. The announcement came after Jia on social media promised to repay debt and reaffirmed LeEco's electric car commitment.   Please give LeEco some time, please give LeEco car some time,  Jia Yueting wrote in Chinese on his Weibo and WeChat accounts.  We will pay back creditors, suppliers and any other debts.  The plea came about a month after Jia said a cash crunch at LeEco was  far worse than expected . He previously said the group, whose businesses include telephones, television sets and cars, expanded too quickly from its video-streaming beginnings 13 years ago. Jia's resignation is the latest development in a week of turmoil, with asset managers seeking to pull investment after a Shanghai court granted China Merchant Bank Co Ltd's request to freeze $182 million in assets due to late interest payments.  Given LeEco's current state, in order to protect fund safety, we have asked our fund manager to pause new investment and will seek to hasten our exit from invested projects,  Noah Holdings Ltd said in a statement late on Wednesday. Hengyu Tianze, known as 1314 fund, also in a statement on Wednesday said it had requested to redeem its convertible bonds in a LeEco unit several times since March and had met with Jia on the matter. Investors were also spooked on Monday after it emerged that China's national enterprise credit information publicity system showed Jia relinquished his role as LeEco's legal representative last month in favor of another executive, Wu Meng.   Resigning as chief executive of LeEco's listed company and many other roles is all aimed at making the FF91 go into production and hit the market as soon as possible,  Jia said earlier on Thursday, referring to a luxury electric car that LeEco is developing with U.S. startup Faraday Future. Analysts have said LeEco's foray into automaking caused its financial troubles, but Jia said LeEco remains committed.

Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producers, joined forces in the past year in a deal with other nations to cut oil output and lift oil prices, although that effort has been undermined by rising production elsewhere.  Our cooperation with Saudi Arabia has been at a top-flight level,  Novak told Reuters in an interview. To expand cooperation, he said state-owned Saudi Aramco was offered a role in the Arctic LNG-2 project led by Russia's largest private gas producer Novatek, which aims to start building the first processing unit, or train, to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2022-2023.  Saudi Aramco was offered different options of participation in Arctic LNG-2,  Novak said, without elaborating on the kind of role envisaged for Saudi Arabia.  Our colleagues (in Saudi Arabia) were interested in it and have been looking at the proposals,  he said. In early June, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih was asked by Russia's TASS news agency whether the kingdom would be interested in taking part in Arctic LNG-2. He responded:  All is possible but it's premature to talk about specifics.

Partners for Arctic LNG-2, which aims to produce at least 16.5 million tonnes of LNG per year, have yet to be chosen. Novak has previously said Japanese firms had shown an interest in the project, while Novatek has said Chinese companies and France's Total were studying it.

Western sanctions imposed on Russia for its role in a row with Ukraine have deterred some Western investors and banks. Novatek, with Chinese partners and its shareholder Total, is building another gas liquefaction plant, Yamal LNG, that is expected to start production in the fourth quarter of 2017. Russia is looking to increase its global LNG market share from just under 5 percent currently to 10 percent by 2020. Novak said there were other areas for Russian energy cooperation with Saudi Arabia.  Our companies are interested in working in Saudi Arabia.

Symantec is paying an undisclosed sum for the Tel Aviv-based company of about 40 employees. Fireglass specializes in an area of security called  browser isolation,  a technology that creates virtual websites allowing users to browse any content without having viruses touch their network.  Browser isolation  is an area that Symantec had been looking to enter for some time, Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview. He cited a Gartner report that projected that 50 percent of enterprises would adopt browser isolation by 2021. Healthcare companies, financial institutions, government and telecommunications firms have been early adopters of the technology, he said.  While it's what I would call a 'tuck-in' acquisition, it will be very valuable to us as we bring it to our customers,  Clark said. FILE PHOTO - The Symantec booth is seen during the 2016 Black Hat cyber-security conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. August 3, 2016.David Becker/File PhotoSymantec has been one of the most serial acquirers in security companies in recent years, gobbling up Lifelock Inc for $2.3 billion earlier this year and Blue Coat Inc for $4.65 billion in 2015. The deal will also increase the company's footprint in Israel, a hotbed for cybersecurity, where Clark said Symantec has been looking to expand. Israel, which has more than 400 cybersecurity startups, attracts about 20 percent of private global cyber investment, Reuters has reported. Large U.S. technology companies often go  shopping  in Israel when they are looking for acquisitions and engineering talent. Last month, Microsoft (MSFT.O) agreed to acquire Hexadite, a U.S.-Israeli provider of technology to automate responses to cyber attacks for an undisclosed sum. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of the calendar year. Fireglass, founded in 2014 by a former Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP.O) executive, was backed by investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners.

The Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial regulation for G20 countries, issued guidance ahead of the G20 leaders’ summit in Hamburg on how the 30 global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) should account for internal total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) across their groups. It urged regulators not to “double-count” internal TLAC, because that would force G-SIBs to hold more capital than necessary across their groups. Host authorities should take into account a bank's capital instruments  with a view to ensuring that the material sub-group is not required to issue additional internal TLAC beyond the requirement set by the host authority,” the FSB said. Initial proposals were put out for consultation in December. These said TLAC at subsidiaries should be between 75% and 90% of what would be required if the subsidiary were an independent entity, to be determined by host and home regulators in cooperation. The treatment of internal TLAC, at subsidiary level, highlights the risk of balkanisation of financial regulation. Critics say if countries insist on different approaches it could fracture the global rules on bank capital and other matters the FSB is trying to coordinate. Tit for Tat Internal capital would be called on by a host regulator of a G-SIB if the parent got into trouble and needed recapitalising. The FSB favours G-SIBs being resolved by their home country regulator, which would then direct other regulators where subsidiaries operate. The US, however, requires subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks with more than US$50bn in assets to set up intermediate holdings companies that are fully capitalised. The European Union responded in November, calling for non-EU G-SIBs to form similar IHCs by 2019 for their European operations. The FSB has outlined the process for identifying “material sub-groups” that would need to issue internal TLAC, as well as how much their parents should hold, what it should consist of, and when and how it might be triggered. The FSB recommended such debt be issued under the law of the jurisdiction where a subsidiary is based rather than the home authority where the group is headquartered, so it can be triggered easily on resolution. The FSB also set out principles on how the home regulator of a G-SIB and host authorities should cooperate and coordinate in the event that a bank, or one of its subsidiaries, needs to be resolved. The FSB did revise some recommendations. It said a host regulator may still require a subsidiary to carry sufficient capital, but that this should not make running such cross-border groups capitally inefficient. The FSB said host regulators should also consider how much or how little surplus TLAC at the group level was available to be deployed for recapitalisation at the subsidiary level as necessary in the event of losses. “The issuance of internal TLAC instruments should ... support the resolution strategy and the passing of losses and recapitalisation needs to the resolution entity,  the FSB said. If issuance is unlikely to achieve this then home or host authorities should require the G-SIB to make changes to improve resolvability, it said. Elke Konig, chair of the European Single Resolution Board who chairs the FSB’s resolution steering group, said work still needs to be done to ensure consistency. “The effective implementation of the guidance papers will be another important step in making G-SIBs resolvable and ending 'too-big-to-fail',  Konig said. “Significant work remains to remove obstacles to cross-border resolution and to implement the resolution reforms in a comprehensive and consistent manner across all sectors, including for central counterparties and insurers.” A separate FSB report said  effective information sharing arrangements ... were not in place for all G-SIBs”, highlighting nine of the 30 that did not have such arrangements. The FSB said it would also consult on the execution of  bail-in  over the coming year.

Camurca's eviction eight months ago happened as officials were finalising his claim to 500 hectares of land in southwestern Amazonas state where he had spent nearly three decades growing corn, sugar and beans.  I lost everything,  61-year-old Camurca told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, wiping away tears.  I went into town and when I came back everything was burned and destroyed.  Half a dozen other small farmers in his village suffered the same fate after a large rancher said he was the rightful owner of the land. Camurca's story highlights an increasingly violent environment in parts of rural Brazil which government officials say is fuelled by unclear property title deeds, local corruption and a system where competing state agencies work on land regularisation. 'Death in the Countryside' At least 36 people died in land conflicts in the first five months of this year, according to the Brazil-based Pastoral Land Commission watchdog. One government official said 2017 had so far been the most violent year for land fights this century.  Land conflicts in the Amazon have gotten worse,  said Ronaldo Santos, an official with the National Institute of Colonisation and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), a government body responsible for managing and demarcating rural land.  Big farm operators have the power to dispense injustice,  Santos told the Thomson Reuters Foundation following a public meeting with hundreds of angry farmers embroiled in land conflicts in Amazonas in northwestern Brazil.  We have assassinations and death in the countryside.  Conflicting Titles Recent violence has led officials from different government agencies and privately owned land registration agents known as cartorios to trade blame over who is responsible for the conflicts. Across Brazil, land must be registered by cartorios. They maintain property records and transfer deeds in specific regions. There is no single, centralised system for checking who owns what nationwide. Inherited from Portuguese colonialists, the cartorio system is confusing and widely abused by wealthy land owners, government officials told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. They said unclear property ownership makes it easier for large ranchers to displace small farmers like Camurca.  The cartorios hold the biggest responsibility for legalising grilagem (land grabs),  said Miguel Emile, a senior official with Terra Legal, a government programme for regularising small farmers' land titles in the Amazon. There are an estimated 5 million landless families in Brazil, according to a 2016 Canadian study. Government officials say they are working to speed-up property allocations for the rural poor who often live on land they do not formally own. But even lands demarcated and distributed by government officials from INCRA and Terra Legal must be registered at private cartorios to be fully legal, Emile said. Small farmers often cannot afford cartorio services, he said, and the system itself faces widespread abuse. Wealthy ranchers can bribe cartorios to register someone else's land, Emile told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. A common scam involves elites legally buying a small piece of property and then having a cartorio register a far larger surrounding area in their name, he said. As a result of this type of fraud in Para, a neighboring Amazon state, four times more land has been privately registered than the state's total area, said Jeremy Campbell, an expert on land rights in Brazil at Roger Williams University in the United States. Trading Blame Cartorios, however, say they are not responsible for most of the problem, blaming government agencies for weak Amazon property rights and the resulting violence.  Grilagem is not done by cartorios,  said one cartorio in Amazonas who spoke on condition of anonymity. His office, which is responsible for maintaining local land records, is full of yellowed, time-worn books of property deeds, along with some digitised documents. Corruption in government agencies, including INCRA, is a major driver of land scams, the cartorio said, as property owners can bribe officials to hand them swaths of state land. The government is moving to geocode new property registrations so the land is digitally registered through satellite maps but this process has been slow, he added. Proving Ownership Forced evictions in Camurca's village of Bom Lugar in Boca do Acre municipality exemplify the problems with Brazil's rural property system. INCRA had provided Camurca with a certification of possession, known locally as a  posse title . But the farmer said he couldn't register this as a formal title with a cartorio as the process of property demarcation had not been finalised. This meant that despite a government agency granting Camurca rights to the land where he had lived since 1988 he still did not formally own it. The rancher who Camurca says was behind the burning of his house could not be reached for comment. The federal prosecutor for Amazonas state said he was investigating house burnings and displacement across Boca do Acre. Amazonas senior security official, Sergio Fontes, said the violence affecting Camurca and thousands of others across Brazil's largest state was due to poor management by officials.  INCRA should resolve the farmers' disputes with ranchers before distributing lands, otherwise all these problems happen,  Fontes told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  (Officials) have to take responsibility for who was placed there.  Travel support for this story was provided by the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ).

The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 158,000 jobs in June, below the estimated addition of 185,000. The report by payrolls processor ADP acts as a precursor to monthly nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday, that includes hiring in both the public and private sectors. Another set of data showed weekly jobless claims rose for the third straight week, with claims climbing to 248,000, above the 243,000 expected.  The ADP number has some correlation to the U.S. NFP (nonfarm payrolls) and investors always adjust their expectations on the back of this,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd.  But overall we think that the number is not that bad because this is the only second time that we have seen a miss.  Technology shares have come under pressure in recent weeks after their strong run this year. The S&P; tech sector is up nearly 17 percent for the year. Shares of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet were all down about 0.8 percent in premarket trading. Dow e-minis were down 61 points, or 0.28 percent, with 29,274 contracts changing hands at 8:22 a.m. ET (1222 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were down 8.5 points, or 0.35 percent, with 180,329 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 53.25 points, or 0.94 percent, on volume of 38,850 contracts. Investors are also parsing minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting that showed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate hikes. The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation slipped to 1.4 percent in May and has run below the 2 percent target for more than five years now. The minutes revealed a few officials viewed equity prices as high when compared to standard valuation measures, even though earnings growth has been robust. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. Tesla fell 3 percent after the luxury electric carmaker's Model S did not get the top score in certain tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed total volume marked a slight decline from current levels and was more than 20 percent below targets laid out in a 2007 law. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, requires increased volumes of renewable fuels each year, but the proposal would keep targets for use of conventional biofuels at current levels. The agency has begun preparations to reset future biofuel targets, said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. His proposal was met with praise and calls for broader reform from the petroleum industry and mixed response from biofuels producers. Environmentalists, who have been critical of ethanol, called for Congress to reform the program.       The RFS has become a battlefield between corn and oil interests. The law has been a boon to agriculture, supporting economies across the Midwest's Corn Belt.  The EPA's proposed cuts to advanced and cellulosic biofuels  will have a chilling effect on the push toward next generation biofuels,  said Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley.  Petroleum companies say the biofuel targets are impossible to meet and add billions of dollars in costs. The plan would require companies to blend a total of 19.24 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the country's fuel supply next year.  The proposal is  consistent with market realities focused on actual production and consumer demand while being cognizant of the challenges that exist in bringing advanced biofuels into the marketplace,  Pruitt said in a statement. The agency would keep the 2018 target for conventional ethanol at 15 billion gallons, unchanged from 2017, and set the requirement for advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol, at 4.24 billion gallons. These latest volumes confirmed an earlier Reuters report for volumes well below the 26 billion gallons of renewable fuels outlined by Congress in 2007. The law was aimed at cutting U.S. oil imports and boosting the use of renewable fuels. The EPA also requested comments related to concerns that the biofuels requirements increasingly are being met by supplies from Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia. The agency proposed setting the requirements for cellulosic below the current year's levels at 238 million gallons and kept biomass-based diesel requirements at 2.1 billion gallons for 2019, unchanged from the levels set for 2018 under former President Barack Obama. Development of cellulosic biofuels has been slower than expected by lawmakers when they set up the program, stymied by regulatory delays and the economic downturn. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil companies, including BP America and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), praised the move to lower the overall requirements but said the proposal did not go far enough. Ethanol groups praised the agency for maintaining the target for conventional ethanol, which is mostly produced from corn in the United States, but were critical of the move to lower the advanced targets.  We are concerned that by reducing the cellulosic (requirement), this proposal may weaken the signal to the marketplace,  said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association. “Today’s proposal underscores the need for the U.S. Congress to take the bull by the horns and reform the Renewable Fuel Standard to protect our clean water, our public health, and our wildlife,  said National Wildlife Federation President and CEO Collin O’Mara.  Prices of U.S. renewable fuel credits rose 4 cents to trade at 75 cents apiece. Biodiesel credits were up 3 cents at $1.145 each, traders said.

The government is trying to push contested legislation through parliament, including raising the pension age and lifting a ban on land sales, as part of a $17.5 billion bailout agreed with the IMF in 2015. One tranche of IMF aid will likely be postponed until 2018, acting Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy told reporters at a press conference.  Due to the fact that the consideration of important draft laws, which were key when the IMF Board of Directors decided to allocate the next tranches, are delayed ... we expect that one tranche will be transferred to the next year,  he said. Smoliy spoke as the central bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 12.5 percent, after two consecutive months of cuts, saying the step was necessary to keep its inflation targets on track amid a worsening economic outlook. The bank cut its economic growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent and said inflation had accelerated to 15 percent year-on-year in June, higher than predicted. The central bank also said uncertainty hangs more generally over Ukraine's ability to implement the IMF programme and that it new economic forecasts hinged on cooperation with the Fund staying on track.  The inefficient implementation of reforms can lead to a deterioration in the prospects for economic growth, which will have negative consequences for inflation and exchange rate expectations and will increase inflationary pressures,  the central bank said in a statement.  Uncertainty remains regarding the implementation of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms necessary to maintain macrofinancial stability, increase the economy's potential and continue the programme with the IMF,  it said. The central bank lowered its forecasts for forex reserves at the end of 2017 to $20 billion from $21.1 billion, and said the potential for an escalation in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine posed a significant risk to the economy. However, the bank played down the impact of last week's cyber attack on the Ukrainian economy.

Nigerien soldiers were patrolling a militarily restricted zone around the village of Abadam near Lake Chad on Wednesday afternoon when they opened fire on what turned out to be farmers, according to Yahaya Godi, the Secretary General of the Diffa region of southeast Niger.   Fourteen people are dead. Abadam is a village located in the red zone and has been prohibited for a very long time,  said Godi.  Any individual seen in the area is considered Boko Haram.   He said two of the dead were from Niger and the rest from neighboring Nigeria, where Boko Haram is based and from which the jihadist group has sometimes carried out cross-border attacks into Niger, Cameroon and Chad. It was not immediately clear why the civilians were in the restricted area and what made the soldiers open fire. Nigerien army officials were not reachable for comment. One witness said the farmers had just finished eating when gunfire broke out, forcing them to flee.  The incident occurred three days after suspected Boko Haram militants killed nine people and abducted dozens more in southern Niger. That attack raised concern about Niger's inability to stop Boko Haram crossing the desert border from their bases in Nigeria. The Diffa region has seen intense fighting over the past year between Niger's army and Boko Haram. Thousands of people have been displaced and many areas are off-limits.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended July 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 243,000 in the latest week.  It was the 122nd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 750 to 243,000 last week. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data. Claims for six states and a territory, including California and Alabama, were estimated because of Tuesday's Independence Day holiday. That probably did not contribute to last week's increase as some of the estimates showed a decrease in applications. Unadjusted claims for Michigan increased 1,159 last week.   Automakers normally shut assembly plants for annual retooling at the start of July, which tends to push up claims. Applications are likely to remain elevated as some companies like General Motors (GM.N) embark on extended summer shutdowns to deal will slower sales, which have led to an inventory bloat. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported on Monday that auto sales fell in June for a fourth straight month. Even before the annual summer plant closures, automakers have been laying off workers in response to the softening demand. Outside the auto sector, the labor remain strong, with record high job openings. Labor market tightness contributed to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates last month for the second time this year.  Economists expect another rate hike and the U.S. central bank to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities later this year. Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 11,000 to 1.96 million in the week ended June 24. The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for 12 straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack. The four-week moving average of continuing claims rose 6,750 to 1.94 million, remaining below the 2 million mark for 10 consecutive weeks.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$530 million. Statscan revised April's deficit to C$552 million from an initial C$370 million.

Cambodia is one of China's closest allies in Southeast Asia. In 2009, Cambodia sent home 20 ethnic minority Uighurs, from China's troubled far western region of Xinjiang, despite objections from the U.N. refugee agency and rights groups, which said they feared for the safety of the Uighurs if sent back. Last year, Cambodia deported 13 Taiwanese nationals wanted on fraud charges to mainland China despite vehement opposition from Taipei which has accused Beijing of  abducting  its citizens from countries that do not recognize the island's government - such as Cambodia. Uk Heisela said more than 500 fraud suspects had been deported to China over recent years.

Sales in Canada's largest city fell 37.3 percent last month compared to a year ago, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said in a report. At the same time, new listings rose 15.9 percent from last year, though that was a slowdown from the hefty 48.9 percent annual increase in listings in May. The Ontario government introduced a number of measures in late April, including a foreign buyers tax, to try to cool the housing market in Toronto and the surrounding areas amid fears of a bubble.  We are in a period of flux that often follows major government policy announcements pointed at the housing market,  the real estate board's president Tim Syrianos said in a statement. While potential buyers are waiting on the sidelines to gauge the impact of the government's measures, existing owners are listing their homes because they believe price increases may have peaked, Syrianos said. The average home price in June was C$793,915 ($611,880.54), up just 6.3 percent from last year. The average selling price in May had risen 14.9 percent from a year earlier. The slowdown in the pace of price growth was partly due to increased supply on the market, though a decline in sales of more expensive homes was also a factor, TREB said. The adjustment in the Toronto market comes as the Bank of Canada has set the stage for interest rate increases as soon as next week. Some experts have said low rates have encouraged consumers to take on too much debt and fuelled the housing market. Taking the provincial government's recent measures and the possibility of higher rates into account, TREB forecast sales this year at between 89,000 and 100,000 homes, down from a record 113,044 homes in 2016.

The pan-European STOXX 600 had fallen 1.1 percent by 1204 GMT, with all sectors trading in negative territory after the minutes. Euro zone blue chips also hit an 11-week low, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.8 percent.  There was nothing in the (June ECB) press conference that suggested that they talked about curtailing QE. But in fact they did,  said AFS analyst Arne Petimezas in Amsterdam. A series of earnings updates also grabbed the focus with Reckitt Benckiser and Sodexo leading fallers after both companies cut their guidance. Reckitt was down 2 percent, making it one of the biggest weights on the STOXX. The UK consumer goods group cut its growth forecast after a global cyber attack last month disrupted business in multiple markets.  We would not see weakness in the share price today as a buying opportunity. Reckitt's markets are likely to have remained sluggish, with peers signalling no pick up here,  Investec said, cutting its price target on the stock. Sodexo, the world's second-biggest catering services firm after Compass Group, also cut its sales growth goal after weaker-than-expected third quarter results, sending its stock down 5.6 percent to a 14-week low. Compass shares were down 1.7 percent. Some earning updates struck a more positive note. Associated British Foods rose 2.6 percent, among top gainers in Europe, after the company said its full-year outlook had marginally improved after a better-than-expected performance from its Primark clothing chain.  The key divisional figure in this statement, as has become the norm with ABF, is Primark sales growth,  Morgan Stanley said. In the banking sector, Commerzbank was the biggest gainer, up 3.3 percent after a Bloomberg report said that buy-out firm Cerberus was considering buying a minority stake in the German lender through purchases on the market. The broader banking sector, recently underpinned by talk of tightening monetary policy conditions, was just 0.4 percent lower following the ECB minutes. Stocks sensitive to a rise in interest rates, such as utilities, continue to weigh, with the sector down 1.3 percent. Meanwhile Italian banks rose 0.3 percent, continuing to outperform after a series of deals in the last two weeks that have restored confidence in the sector's prospects. Italy's economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said there were no more  brushfires  threatening other banks after the government wound down two Veneto-based lenders last month in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros.

China Literature Ltd requested the unusual exemption from the Hong Kong bourse, saying revealing the three executives' stakes  would attract unnecessary attention amongst Tencent's employees and would likely create an unfavorable and political working environment which would significantly distort Tencent's workplace culture and distract them from their business duties within [Tencent] as well as their duties as directors of our Company.      The online publisher filed for a Hong Kong IPO on Monday. The three executives are its board members and would have to disclose their stakes in Tencent as per the city's listing rules. The waiver request will now be vetted by the listing committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange.   That's an outrageous waiver request, and I hope that the listing committee will reject it,  said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist and a former director of the Hong Kong stock exchange.  It is the thin end of a nasty wedge if the listing committee allows companies not to disclose directors' shareholdings in their parent company.  Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, said it would set a bad precedent to grant the exception. Tencent and China Literature did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK), which operates the stock exchange, said the firm has a general policy of not commenting on individual companies. China Literature asked for a waiver so it does not have to reveal the stakes held in Tencent by James Gordon Mitchell, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Tencent's chief strategy officer; Cheng Wu, CEO of Tencent Pictures; and Lin Haifeng, general manager of the merger and acquisitions department at Tencent Science & Technology (Shenzhen) Co. The three are non-executive directors in China Literature's nine-member board, with Mitchell also acting as chairman. They hold  an insignificant percentage of share capital  in Tencent, the filing added. But with a market capitalization of nearly $330 billion, even a tiny stake in China's biggest social network and online entertainment firm would make the executives multi-millionaires. In its 2016 annual report Tencent disclosed the stakes held by Chairman Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, President Lau Chi Ping Martin, or Martin Lau, and four independent non-executive directors. The value of the stakes ranged from $29 billion for Ma to as low as $126,348 for one of the independent directors. As in most markets, shareholders owning 5 percent or more of any stock must be disclosed to the Hong Kong stock exchange and under listing rules IPO candidates must also reveal the interests and short positions their board directors hold in the issuer itself or  associated corporations.   Publicly listed companies must also disclose the interests and short positions of their CEOs and all directors in shares and debentures in the companies themselves or associated corporations under a separate rule, the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO). That means even if China Literature were granted the waiver, it would still have to reveal the stakes at a later date.  The listing committee has no powers to waive SFO obligations, so as soon as the company is listed, they would have to file disclosures, which will be available to the public,  investor Webb added.  So not including them in the prospectus would only delay disclosure.

Andrew Bailey, head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, on Thursday set out a blueprint for continued free trade in financial services after Britain leaves the European Union. Even if UK politicians belatedly buy into the idea, their European equivalents have reasons to resist. When Britain withdraws from the EU single market, UK-based financial services firms will no longer be able to serve clients on the continent. Bailey thinks the doors can stay open as long as UK regulations are deemed “equivalent” to those in the EU. He sees four key criteria to achieve this: comparable rules; coordination between regulators; regular exchanges of information; and a mechanism to resolve disputes. This approach might allow Britain’s financial services industry to retain some access to the single market. But it would impose constraints. For one, British regulators would have to enforce any new rules their EU counterparts dream up without having any say over their design. Second, they would have to accept the legal authority of a foreign entity. The European Court of Justice currently plays this role, but Prime Minister Theresa May has made ending its jurisdiction in the United Kingdom one of her key negotiating conditions. British politicians who are waking up to Brexit’s harsh realities may be willing to contemplate such compromises. Their European counterparts, however, are showing no such flexibility. “You cannot be half-in and half-out of the single market,” Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said on Thursday. Many European countries are keen to attract financial firms. And EU citizens working in Britain’s financial services industry, unsettled by half-baked assurances about their status, are increasingly willing to contemplate relocation. As long as London remains Europe’s main financial centre, foreign regulators will worry about what happens there. As Bailey argues, financial stability in the UK is a “global public good”. A sudden withdrawal from the EU would impose risk and pain on all sides, which is why it is essential that Britain quickly agrees to a long transition period after it leaves. The case for a pragmatic Brexit, however, may have come a year too late.       BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Pakistan's rupee had been stable for nearly two years, and the unexpected tumble on Wednesday caught top government officials, including Dar, off guard.  Analysts said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had effectively devalued the rupee by not intervening to prop it up as it usually does.  Traders say the SBP controls the thinly traded rupee market that works as a managed float, while the bank on Wednesday evening backed a weaker rupee, saying it would ease balance of payments pressures in the $300 billion economy. But Dar said the sharp drop in the rupee was harmful to national interests and criticized the central bank, saying it was not its job to worry about the current account deficit.  The current account deficit is the work of the finance ministry and to alter it, the State Bank is not supposed to do that,  an annoyed Dar told media. The rupee regained some ground on Thursday, firming by 1.5 percent to trade at about 106.20/50 to the dollar in the late afternoon. A day earlier the rupee tumbled to as low as 108.5. The central bank governor is appointed by the prime minister and is meant to be independent. Deputy Governor Riaz Riazuddin was in May appointed as acting governor for three months until a permanent new chief was due to be named in late July. But Dar said that decision would be brought forward in light of the currency volatility and a new permanent governor would be appointed late on Thursday or on Friday. 'Artificial' Dar also said he had ordered an inquiry into what he called a  communication gap  in the central bank, and between the bank and other intuitions.  I don’t believe that any individual has this kind of authority to make such a big decision to make an artificial adjustment, and I am calling this artificial,  said Dar, who held an emergency meeting with heads of domestic banks and financial institutions on Thursday.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had previously said the currency was about 20 percent over-valued but Dar had rejected that, saying in May the figure was no more than 5 percent. One analyst said such strong pressure on the State Bank by Dar called into question the independence of the central bank, which is among the most respected Pakistani institutions.  It doesn't send a good signal,  said the Karachi-based analyst who declined to be identified.  Dar is a dominant personality.  Following a balance of payments crisis in 2013, improving security and vast infrastructure investment by China have spurred growth to above 5 percent for the first time in nearly a decade. But over the past year the current account deficit has ballooned again, and the IMF last month said that eroding macroeconomic stability gains could pose risks to the economic outlook. The SBP, in a statement late on Wednesday, said a weaker rupee would shore up growth and  address the emerging imbalance in the external account , referring to growing balance of payment pressures. Raza Jafri, executive director at brokerage Intermarket Securities, said he expected the rupee to consolidate in a range of 105-108 to the dollar.  The central bank and the finance ministry will find middle ground,  Jafri said.

The deficit stood at 3.4 percent of national output last year, still stubbornly above the European Union's agreed cap of 3 percent after a decade of overshoots. Last week Prime Minister Edouard Philippe pledged to stick to plans to bring the deficit to below 3 percent this year after an audit found France was at risk of overshooting the limit yet again without urgent budget cuts. Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that respecting the 3 percent deficit target was necessary  if only to ensure France's credibility in Europe .  Further out, restoring the health of the public finances is a matter of safeguarding national sovereignty as higher interest rates risk piling pressure on the budget, he said.  It's vital to regain control of our public debt in order to be able to cope with a future increase in interest rates,  Villeroy told reporters presenting an annual letter to the president. Years of high deficits have pushed France's national debt to nearly 100 percent of gross domestic product. As a result, a one percent increase in interest rates would cost the equivalent of the research and higher education budget, a panel of economic advisers to the government said on Thursday.  Courageous  Tax Cuts In his first letter to President Emmanuel Macron, who took office in May, Villeroy said the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary policy was not  eternal  and nominal interest rates were bound to rise in line with a recovery in growth and inflation. France should see growth this year of 1.6 percent as its economic recovery lags the broader euro zone, he said, though that is slightly above a previous forecast of 1.4 percent following an upward revision of recent data.  It's a real recovery even if it remains moderate. France is going to be at less than the 2 percent growth of the euro zone,  Villeroy said. As the economy recovers, the unemployment rate can be expected to fall to around nine percent, but a rate of around seven percent is within reach if ambitious reforms are carried out, he said.

Bankers and lawyers say several mechanisms, new and old, could address the problem, though it may be impossible to remove the risk entirely. Legal provisions in contracts for financial instruments could prevent their sharia-compliance from being questioned after they are issued. Investors may also screen scholars who certify instruments as sharia-compliant more carefully, and pay more attention to what mechanisms, such as courts, exist to rule on potential disputes. Last month, Sharjah-based Dana Gas declared it would not make payments on $700 million of sukuk maturing this October because Islamic finance standards had changed since the instruments were issued four years ago. The change in standards meant the instruments were no longer sharia-compliant and had become  unlawful  in the United Arab Emirates, Dana argued. This raised concern across the Islamic finance industry that more companies could avoid redeeming sukuk by adopting the same argument as Dana. The outcome of the Dana case, which is being fought in British and UAE courts, could hurt liquidity and growth in the global sukuk market, Moody's said. To try to avoid similar cases in future, investors may demand  more detailed and restrictive language in sukuk documentation. Such language already exists for some sukuk, but it is not used consistently and is not standardised.  We foresee sukuk investors increasingly demanding sharia assurances which could include a sharia undertaking in the form of an explicit waiver of any defence of non-compliance,  said Mohammad Hasif Murad, investment manager at Aberdeen Islamic Asset Management in Malaysia. Some issuers in Indonesia go further by stipulating that if their sukuk cease to be sharia-compliant, they will be declared in default, mature immediately and become repayable to investors. Sukuk issued by Maybank Indonesia, BRI Syariah and Bank Jambi include such clauses, according to Fitch Ratings. They all used an investment management partnership structure known as mudaraba, the same format employed by Dana. But early redemption is not fundamentally desirable for issuers or investors, which may limit wide use of such clauses in the Gulf region, said a Dubai-based partner of an international law firm. Also, such clauses may not suffice against an issuer in financial distress seeking to force a restructuring aggressively or delay repayment, said the lawyer.  This is part of the risk that investors run in our region. Such risk already tends to be priced into instruments issued out of the Middle East.  Endorsements Investors may therefore cast a more watchful eye on the groups of scholars who provide sharia endorsements for sukuk.  With this case, we will be more stringent when looking at what are the pledges made, who are the sharia councils,  said Heddy Humaizi Hussain, director of institutional sales and marketing at Kuala Lumpur-based financial firm Saturna. At present, sukuk issuers generally choose the scholars who certify their instruments. Some analysts think that model could eventually change under pressure from investors, if that is necessary to maintain the credibility of Islamic finance. Issuers could be required to have an independent sharia board that answers to directors and shareholders rather than to management, said Sheikh Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo, a scholar with over three decades of experience in Islamic finance.  Certainly in Muslim-majority jurisdictions this should be the case, whether it's an airport authority, or a shipbuilder, or a real estate developer,  he said. Malaysia has succeeded in limiting disputes over sharia compliance partly because it has country-level sharia boards within its central bank and capital markets regulator. These boards tend to create a national consensus on standards. In May, the UAE approved the formation of a high sharia authority for Islamic banking and finance, which is expected to set rules and a general framework for Islamic finance governance and the issuance of sharia rulings. It is not yet known if the board will have influence over the Dana case. But it could be instrumental in restoring confidence in the UAE market, improving liquidity and reducing costs, Dubai consultancy Acreditus said in a research note.  The Dana restructuring will be a critical and important test for the Board,  it predicted.

China Literature Ltd requested the unusual exemption from the Hong Kong bourse, saying revealing the three executives' stakes  would attract unnecessary attention amongst Tencent's employees and would likely create an unfavorable and political working environment which would significantly distort Tencent's workplace culture and distract them from their business duties within [Tencent] as well as their duties as directors of our Company.      The online publisher filed for a Hong Kong IPO on Monday. The three executives are its board members and would have to disclose their stakes in Tencent as per the city's listing rules. The waiver request will now be vetted by the listing committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange.   That's an outrageous waiver request, and I hope that the listing committee will reject it,  said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist and a former director of the Hong Kong stock exchange.  It is the thin end of a nasty wedge if the listing committee allows companies not to disclose directors' shareholdings in their parent company.  Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, said it would set a bad precedent to grant the exception. Tencent and China Literature did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK), which operates the stock exchange, said the firm has a general policy of not commenting on individual companies. China Literature asked for a waiver so it does not have to reveal the stakes held in Tencent by James Gordon Mitchell, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Tencent's chief strategy officer; Cheng Wu, CEO of Tencent Pictures; and Lin Haifeng, general manager of the merger and acquisitions department at Tencent Science & Technology (Shenzhen) Co. The three are non-executive directors in China Literature's nine-member board, with Mitchell also acting as chairman. They hold  an insignificant percentage of share capital  in Tencent, the filing added. But with a market capitalization of nearly $330 billion, even a tiny stake in China's biggest social network and online entertainment firm would make the executives multi-millionaires. In its 2016 annual report Tencent disclosed the stakes held by Chairman Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, President Lau Chi Ping Martin, or Martin Lau, and four independent non-executive directors. The value of the stakes ranged from $29 billion for Ma to as low as $126,348 for one of the independent directors. As in most markets, shareholders owning 5 percent or more of any stock must be disclosed to the Hong Kong stock exchange and under listing rules IPO candidates must also reveal the interests and short positions their board directors hold in the issuer itself or  associated corporations.   Publicly listed companies must also disclose the interests and short positions of their CEOs and all directors in shares and debentures in the companies themselves or associated corporations under a separate rule, the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO). That means even if China Literature were granted the waiver, it would still have to reveal the stakes at a later date.  The listing committee has no powers to waive SFO obligations, so as soon as the company is listed, they would have to file disclosures, which will be available to the public,  investor Webb added.  So not including them in the prospectus would only delay disclosure.

The loan is the second tranche of a $5 billion funding facility Eskom is seeking, after signing a $500 million credit facility with China Development Bank in 2016.  This loan will also aid us in ensuring that we complete the Medupi project and ensure security of energy supply,  Eskom's acting CEO Johnny Dladla told reporters. The power utility, which has in the past been forced to impose power cuts due to insufficient supply, is scrambling to revamp its aging power plants. Once completed, Medupi is expected to be the largest dry-cooled coal-fired power station in the world and will add 4,800 megawatts to the grid. But the facility is over budget and years behind schedule. Eskom Chief Financial Officer Anoj Singh said the Chinese loan would be paid back over 15 years.  He expected Eskom's debt to peak at 500 billion rand, up from 350 billion rand currently. To date Eskom has secured 77 percent of this fiscal year's funding requirement, Dladla said, and expected that it would meet the required funding for the year. Singh also said Eskom sees significant appetite from international investors for the firm's bonds and the utility could tap the market for between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in sales in the next six months. However, he said governance issues at the utility had impacted the firm's plans to secure funding.  We'll probably look for about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the next six months depending on the appetite,  he told Reuters. Eskom has been in a leadership crisis after several board members, including the chairman and chief executive, resigned in recent months amid growing concerns about governance at the country's sole electricity provider.

The deficit stood at 3.4 percent of national output last year, still stubbornly above the European Union's agreed cap of 3 percent after a decade of overshoots. Last week Prime Minister Edouard Philippe pledged to stick to plans to bring the deficit to below 3 percent this year after an audit found France was at risk of overshooting the limit yet again without urgent budget cuts. Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that respecting the 3 percent deficit target was necessary  if only to ensure France's credibility in Europe .  Further out, restoring the health of the public finances is a matter of safeguarding national sovereignty as higher interest rates risk piling pressure on the budget, he said.  It's vital to regain control of our public debt in order to be able to cope with a future increase in interest rates,  Villeroy told reporters presenting an annual letter to the president. Years of high deficits have pushed France's national debt to nearly 100 percent of gross domestic product. As a result, a one percent increase in interest rates would cost the equivalent of the research and higher education budget, a panel of economic advisers to the government said on Thursday.  Courageous  Tax Cuts In his first letter to President Emmanuel Macron, who took office in May, Villeroy said the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary policy was not  eternal  and nominal interest rates were bound to rise in line with a recovery in growth and inflation. France should see growth this year of 1.6 percent as its economic recovery lags the broader euro zone, he said, though that is slightly above a previous forecast of 1.4 percent following an upward revision of recent data.  It's a real recovery even if it remains moderate. France is going to be at less than the 2 percent growth of the euro zone,  Villeroy said. As the economy recovers, the unemployment rate can be expected to fall to around nine percent, but a rate of around seven percent is within reach if ambitious reforms are carried out, he said. Villeroy said tax cuts planned by Macron's government over the next five years were  lucid and courageous , but added that some cuts should be pushed back if not properly financed. He said reining in public spending should be a top priority for the government and said that its plan to limit expenditure growth to no faster than the rate of inflation was  reasonable .

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic of China seaborne coal imports: reut.rs/2tTdFjS By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 6 (Reuters) - Thermal coal prices in Asia have had a strong run recently, amid Chinese demand and supply disruptions in major exporters, but these factors point to a temporary boost rather than any structural change. The price of spot cargoes from Australia's Newcastle port , the world's largest thermal coal export harbour, have jumped 23 percent since mid-May to close on Wednesday at $87.90 a tonne. While still negative for the year, the recent rally has taken Newcastle coal close to the $93.50 a tonne it fetched at the end of last year. The strong gains appear justified by supply and demand fundamentals, with vessel-tracking data showing a tightening of seaborne supplies in June to China, the world's top importer of the polluting fuel. China's seaborne imports totalled 17.77 million tonnes in June, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. This figure is filtered to show only vessels that have discharged cargoes and the final numbers may vary slightly to account for ships that arrived before month-end and are still in the process of unloading. The ship data also doesn't perfectly align with official customs figures given differences as to when cargoes are booked as having unloaded, but the vessel-tracking has proven to be an accurate indicator of trends in China's coal imports. The June figure for seaborne imports is 3.35 million tonnes lower than the 21.12 million reported in May, and is the lowest monthly total since February, according to the data. Shipments from Australia were largely steady in June at 7.84 million tonnes, compared to May's 7.81 million. However, imports from number two supplier Indonesia were sharply lower, dropping to 6.31 million tonnes in June, from May's 9.47 million and April's 9.83 million. While May and April were strong months for Indonesian shipments to China, the decline in June made it the weakest month since February, a month in which imports were affected by the Lunar New Year holidays. Weather's Starring Role Exports from Indonesia, China's largest supplier of seaborne coal, were curbed by heavy rainfall in June, which caused flooding and disruptions to mining operations. A short strike at mines owned by Glencore in Australia's Hunter Valley coal region contributed to sentiment driving prices higher, even if the labour action didn't have much material effect on coal exports. On the demand side in China, a drop in output of as much as two-thirds from hydropower plants because of excessive rains pushing rivers to flood levels has boosted demand for coal-fired power as a replacement. Chinese thermal coal prices have spiked higher in line with those in Australia, with the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange futures gaining almost 16 percent from the recent low in early May to Wednesday's close of 588.2 yuan ($86.50) a tonne. Spot coal at China's Qinhuangdao port SH-QHA-TRMCOAL has also moved higher, reaching 590 yuan a tonne on Wednesday, up 4.4 percent from the recent low of 565 yuan on June 14. It's worth noting that Chinese domestic prices are below the Newcastle spot price, meaning that imports are now more costly, especially once the cost of freight and taxes is added in. This suggests that the spike in Newcastle prices is unlikely to persist, especially if export volumes from Indonesia recover from weather disruptions. At the same time, China is likely to be able to ramp up hydropower once the threat of flood damage recedes, which will likely lower demand for thermal power generation. The rally in coal prices is likely more of a seasonal and temporary factor than a signal that higher prices will be sustained.

The fiscal 2018 budget plan, which has drawn both Democratic and Republican support in the legislature, does not guarantee funding for public schools to open on time next month. The plan identifies only enough funding to pay down roughly a third of the state's record $15 billion unpaid bill backlog. In addition, no substantial progress was made to reduce Illinois’ paralyzing $130 billion unfunded pension liability. The state's pension contribution is set to consume more than $7.8 billion of the state's $36 billion budget in the fiscal year that began July 1. Illinois on Thursday could end its dubious status as the only state to ever go multiple years without a full operating budget if the Democratic-led legislative chamber overturns the vetoes from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. One of the bills increases the state's personal income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and corporate income tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent. Moody’s Investors Service issued a warning on Wednesday that even if the House follows identical Senate action Monday and overrides Rauner’s vetoes, the nation’s fifth-largest state risks a credit rating downgrade to junk because of unaddressed fiscal woes. Moody's said the budget plan falls short of adequately addressing pensions and the backlog of unpaid bills.  It's not clear to me that they won't quickly find themselves with a comparable backlog and more long-term bonded debt,  said Moody's analyst Ted Hampton. Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government finance watchdog, said the bill does not provide stability. “What rating agencies are pointing to, even with the tax increase if the General Assembly overrides the governor and with the spending plan as approved, the state still has severe financial challenges going forward,” he said. Drafters of the budget package inserted language that ties release of billions of dollars for K-12 education to enactment of a school-funding overhaul that Rauner has called a “bailout” for Chicago’s cash-strapped school system. The House and Senate have passed the funding revamp, but Rauner has threatened to veto it. If Republicans and Democrats do not reconcile their differences before the first state payment goes to schools in August, about a dozen financially struggling public school systems might not open for classes next month, said Roger Eddy, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards. “We’re talking about children that are going to be affected by this stalemate at this point. That is absolutely not an exaggeration. This is real, and it’s going to happen,” Eddy told Reuters. The budget impasse also resulted in a halt of construction projects and Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets. In another key area--the state's $14.7 billion backlog of unpaid bills--the plan authorizes only $6 billion of general obligation bonds, as well as $1.5 billion in borrowings and transfers from other state funds for that purpose. Sufficient money exists only to support $3 billion of $6 billion in authorized bonding, which in turn would generate $2 billion in federal matching Medicaid dollars for unpaid bills. The budget also purports to save $500 million from pension changes, although there were slim details on how those savings would be realized. “The pension reform in (the legislation) doesn’t look like it’s really revolutionary or will move the needle in any big way,” Hampton said.

Federal Reserve policymakers were split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises, according to the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting on June 13-14 released on Wednesday.  The latest Fed minutes indicate that (Chair) Janet Yellen is preparing the ground work for unwinding its balance sheet at the end of the year and markets aren't expecting large interest rate increases for now,  said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. The dollar was broadly flat at 113.35 Japanese yen in early trading after rising more than 1 percent this week. Against the euro, the dollar weakened in a lacklustre session trading 0.2 percent at a day's low of 1.13735. The minutes of the ECB meeting nudged the euro higher as bond yields rose, though the single currency hemmed within recent trading ranges. Markets appeared to ignore comments from ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet on Thursday that euro zone growth is accelerating but a  steady-hand  policy from the European Central Bank was still needed to revive inflation. However, analysts were wary of betting against the dollar before U.S. data on tap later in the day which includes ADP employment, ISM non-manufacturing PMI and the initial jobless claims report. The dollar's continued strength against emerging market currencies such as the South African rand and Turkey's lira would also deter short sellers. Stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls data on Friday would mean the dollar may find some support around current levels, analysts said. Investors will also look to comments from San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell for their potential impact on U.S. yields. In terms of trading ranges, the dollar index was comfortably within recent established ones with the basket of currencies holding below a 20-day moving average it broke below last week. Markets were also waiting for the European Central Bank's June policy meeting minutes due later on Thursday.

The minister also told Reuters there was potential for an oil price rise from current levels and that $50 to $60 was  fair  value for a barrel, after benchmark Brent fell 20 percent in the first half of the year. It now trades at around $48. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia agreed to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January this year to rein in inventories and support prices. The deal runs to March 2018. Despite the initiative, oil prices have registered their biggest first-half decline in almost two decades, as OPEC-led supply cuts have been undermined by rising output in the United States and from other producers not bound by the global pact. Some market analysts have suggested OPEC states, Russia and their allies might now need to implement additional steps, such as deepening the cuts or extending them beyond March.  We believe that it is necessary to move within the framework of the agreed decisions and that new, snap decisions are not necessary,  Novak said in an interview in Moscow.  I think that the decisions that were taken, they were the right ones,  he said, adding that any additional measures would create  chaos  and more misunderstanding in the market.  We have got the positive effect for market stabilization. The prices have been stabilized at higher levels, which allows the interests of investors, producers and consumers to be taken into account,  Novak said. Although oil prices are now back near November levels seen before OPEC announced its plan to cut output, they are still well off lows of around $27 reached in early 2016. Novak said prices had room to rise from current levels and said inventories in industrialized nations were expected to ease back to the five-year average thanks to the decision by OPEC and its allies to extend supply curbs from the first half of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. Market Monitoring The Joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), set up to monitor the global supply pact, meets on July 24 in the Russian city of St Petersburg. Ministers from Russia, Oman, Algeria, Venezuela, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, alongside OPEC's secretary general, are to attend. Novak said there were no proposals for more nations to be represented at that regular committee meeting, which plans to discuss the deal implementation and the market situation. The committee had the authority to recommend  any decisions  to participants involved in the pact if needed, Novak said. While he saw no need for further action, he said:  I can't predict what the proposals could be from (other) ministers.  OPEC and its allies face a challenge from U.S. shale producers, which ramped up output as oil prices rose from 2016 lows. In addition, Libya and Nigeria, two OPEC members which are exempt from the cuts, have also pushed up production. Novak said it was up to OPEC to decide how to stick to its pledges on cuts while Libyan and Nigerian output climbed. The Russian energy minister also said any exit from the global pact at the end of the first quarter would be  smooth , adding that inventories would have fallen by that stage and demand would be picking up in the second quarter of 2018.  We are not going - as we discussed with our colleagues - to all hike oil production on April 1 at once,  he said.  Other OPEC members have also confirmed their interest to exit the deal in a way that any supply increase would follow a demand rise during the second and third quarters,  he added. Russia, the world's biggest oil producer, agreed under the output deal with OPEC and others to cut its production by 300,000 bpd from its October 2016 level, when it was just below 11 million bpd.

The loan is the second tranche of a $5 billion funding facility Eskom is seeking, after signing a $500 million credit facility with China Development Bank in 2016.  This loan will also aid us in ensuring that we complete the Medupi project and ensure security of energy supply,  Eskom's acting CEO Johnny Dladla told reporters. The power utility, which has in the past been forced to impose power cuts due to insufficient supply, is scrambling to revamp its aging power plants. Once completed, Medupi is expected to be the largest dry-cooled coal-fired power station in the world and will add 4,800 megawatts to the grid. But the facility is over budget and years behind schedule. Eskom Chief Financial Officer Anoj Singh said the Chinese loan would be paid back over 15 years.  He expected Eskom's debt to peak at 500 billion rand, up from 350 billion rand currently. To date Eskom has secured 77 percent of this fiscal year's funding requirement, Dladla said, and expected that it would meet the required funding for the year. Singh also said Eskom sees significant appetite from international investors for the firm's bonds and the utility could tap the market for between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in sales in the next six months. However, he said governance issues at the utility had impacted the firm's plans to secure funding.  We'll probably look for about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the next six months depending on the appetite,  he told Reuters. Eskom has been in a leadership crisis after several board members, including the chairman and chief executive, resigned in recent months amid growing concerns about governance at the country's sole electricity provider.

One tranche of IMF aid will likely be postponed until 2018, acting Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy told reporters at a press conference.   Due to the fact that the consideration of important draft laws, which were key when the IMF Board of Directors decided to allocate the next tranches, are delayed ... we expect that one tranche will be transferred to the next year,  he said.       Smoliy spoke as the central bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 12.5 percent, after two consecutive months of cuts, saying the step was necessary to keep its inflation targets on track amid a worsening economic outlook.  The bank cut its economic growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent and said inflation had accelerated to 15 percent year-on-year in June, higher than predicted. The central bank also said uncertainty hangs more generally over Ukraine's ability to implement the IMF program and that it new economic forecasts hinged on cooperation with the Fund staying on track.  The inefficient implementation of reforms can lead to a deterioration in the prospects for economic growth, which will have negative consequences for inflation and exchange rate expectations and will increase inflationary pressures,  the central bank said in a statement.   Uncertainty remains regarding the implementation of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms necessary to maintain macrofinancial stability, increase the economy's potential and continue the program with the IMF,  it said. The central bank lowered its forecasts for forex reserves at the end of 2017 to $20 billion from $21.1 billion, and said the potential for an escalation in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine posed a significant risk to the economy. However, the bank played down the impact of last week's cyber attack on the Ukrainian economy.

The forfeiture will include some 5,500 artifacts purchased by Hobby Lobby Inc that originated from the region of modern-day Iraq and were shipped under false labels, as well as an additional $3 million to settle the civil charges, the Department of Justice said in a statement.  The protection of cultural heritage is a mission that (Homeland Security Investigations) and its partner U.S. Customs and Border Protection take very seriously as we recognize that while some may put a price on these artifacts, the people of Iraq consider them priceless,” Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said in the statement. Privately-held Hobby Lobby said that it was new to the world of antiquities when it began acquiring historical items for its Museum of the Bible in 2009 and made mistakes in relying on dealers and shippers who  did not understand the correct way to document and ship  them. The company's president, Steve Green, is the chairman and founder of the Museum of the Bible, which is under construction in Washington, D.C. The artifacts being forfeited include cuneiform tablets and bricks, clay bullae and cylinder seals. Cuneiform is an ancient system of writing on clay tablets.  At no time did Hobby Lobby ever purchase items from dealers in Iraq or from anyone who indicated that they acquired items from that country,  Green said in his statement.  Hobby Lobby condemns such conduct and has always acted with the intent to protect ancient items of cultural and historical importance. ... “We have accepted responsibility and learned a great deal,” Green added, saying that the company has now  implemented acquisition policies and procedures based on the industry's highest standards.  Federal prosecutors say that when Hobby Lobby, which is based in Oklahoma City, began assembling its collection it was warned by an expert on cultural property law to be cautious in acquiring artifacts from Iraq, which in some cases have been looted from archaeological sites. Despite that warning and other red flags the company in December 2010 purchased thousands of items from a middle-man, without meeting the purported owner, according to prosecutors. A dealer based in the United Arab Emirates shipped packages containing the artifacts to three Hobby Lobby corporate addresses in Oklahoma City, bearing false label that described their contents as  ceramic tiles  or  clay tiles  and the country of origin as Turkey.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-iraqiartifacts-idUSL1N1JX00C"},

U.S. companies announced 31,105 planned job cuts in June, a 6.0 percent decline from 33,092 in May, according to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The previous month's figure was downwardly revised from 51,692 after Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported it would cut 1,400 workers, not 20,000, as initially reported.  Overall, June's job cuts were down 19.3 percent from a year earlier, when 38,536 layoffs were announced in June 2016.  Some companies are not making their layoffs this year, which they might have done if the labor pool wasn't so stretched, especially for skilled labor,  John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, told Reuters. With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, its lowest since May 2001, employers are having a harder time finding the talent they need so they keep existing workers, Challenger said. The slowdown in layoff activity in June is reflected in the year-to-date totals as well, with the number of planned workforce reductions falling by 28 percent to 227,000 in the first six months of 2017 from more than 313,000 in the first half of 2016. The technology sector, for instance, reported 23,813 job cuts for the first six months of the year, down 52.5 percent from 50,161 announced in the first half of 2016.  One notable exception is in the retail sector, where announced layoffs in the first half of 2016 are the highest since the recession as big chains such as Macy's Inc (M.N) close stores and companies restructure to focus on online sales.  The sector had announced 60,127 job cuts through June, a 42 percent increase from the 42,095 cuts reported through the first half of 2016. This represents the highest number of layoffs in the first half since 2009, according to Challenger. Though the retail sector reported over 5,000 store closings this year, the worst of the layoffs may be behind. Challenger said retailers typically trim their staff in the first quarter after the holiday season before they start to expand again.

Minister Gerard Collomb was speaking ahead of a parliamentary vote to extend emergency search-and-arrest powers given to police after Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015.  We traced about a hundred ... We're sizing up the situation and taking the weapons away,  he told TV channel CNews, adding that police had foiled seven attacks in France this year alone. The issue of weapons came to light last month when public prosecutors confirmed that a 31-year-old man, who died after ramming his car into a police convoy in Paris, had joined a gun sports club to train as a jihadist fighter. He had built up a large weapons arsenal and renewed his gun permit, despite being on an intelligence services list of people who appear to have been radicalized and could commit attacks. Prosecutors said the man had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State militant group, whose bases in Syria and Iraq are being bombed by jets from a coalition of countries including France. They say he appears to have been killed by the thick orange fumes that billowed out of his vehicle after he hit the police van on the Champs Elysees avenue. The government of President Emmanuel Macron is proposing legislation to replace the system of emergency rule in November, including changes making it easier for officials vetting gun permit requests to cross-check against watchlists of would-be militants. More than 230 people have been killed in France by Islamist assailants in the past two and a half years. In the most recent operation, police arrested a man in northern France this week and four more were arrested in Brussels in a Belgian-led counter-terrorism swoop.

Shares in Europe's third-largest budget carrier by passenger numbers after Ryanair and easyJet, were down 7.96 percent at 1045 GMT. It was the worst performing stock on the Oslo bourse. Frode Foss, who had been CFO for 15 years, will be replaced in the interim by Norwegian Air's head of investor relations, Tore Oestby, until a permanent replacement is named.  When a CFO quits it creates uncertainty and it comes on top of the June traffic report,  said Swedbank analyst Hans-Marius Lee Ludvigsen. Norwegian Air's latest monthly report showed its yield was down 6 percent year-on-year and its load factor, a measure of how much it is able to fill planes with passengers, was down half a percentage point. Norwegian Air is one of several budget airlines trying to grab a slice of the profitable transatlantic business, once the preserve of more established flag carriers. It is launching an increasing number of transatlantic flights - on Wednesday it launched direct routes between London and Chicago and Austin, and Paris to Boston and Oakland. To grow, the airline has placed large orders for new, lightweight planes that help keep costs down, including 110 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, with options for another 90 - the first two were delivered on June 29. Securing funding to pay for these aircrafts is seen as a key task for the company. Ludvigsen, the analyst, said Foss did a  very good job  as CFO and that his replacement, Oestby, was also a well-known name and  should be ready for the task .  It's time for me to explore new ventures. I wish Norwegian all the best for the future,  Foss said in a statement.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang for treatment of late stage liver cancer. Liu has been being treated for various conditions as side effects of his cancer, including a build up of fluid in his stomach caused by liver scarring.  Liu Xiaobo's liver function has worsened, his bilirubin levels are gradually rising,  the hospital said in a statement, referring to a substance produced by the liver, high levels of which can indicate liver failure. Asked about Liu's condition on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had nothing new to add and reiterated that China hoped other countries would not use  individual cases  to interfere in China's internal affairs. A liver expert from Beijing, Mao Yilei, had come to Shenyang to lead a consultation on Liu's condition, the hospital said on Wednesday. The team decided to adjust his treatment plan and the family said they understood, the hospital said on Wednesday, without providing details. However, Ye Du, a dissident who is close to Liu's family, said a source with direct knowledge of the situation said the team of doctors treating Liu had decided on Wednesday to halt medication after the deterioration in his condition.  Liver function has worsened and it cannot take the medication, so Chinese and Western drugs to fight cancer have been halted,  the source told Ye in a message. Reuters was unable to independently verify Ye's assertion. A message from more than 40 friends of Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, shared on instant messaging platforms called for friends to have access to the couple to provide support following the news of his deteriorating condition.   From this moment, we urgently need the ability to visit, to bring Mr Liu Xiaobo and Mrs Liu Xia their friends' care and well-wishes,  the friends said. The Shenyang city justice department said on Wednesday the hospital had invited doctors from the United States and Germany to help with Liu's treatment. President Xi Jinping is due to attend a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday and Saturday, where he will seek to project Chinese leadership on issues such as climate change and free trade. Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China has been nervous the issue over the Nobel Peace Prize winner could overshadow Xi's appearance. Rights group Amnesty International said the invitation to foreign doctors appeared in part  an attempt to limit international criticism  even as the government continued to refuse to allow Liu to be treated overseas.

In an interview with the Guardian in London, Mahathir said Anwar should be released from jail, where he is serving a five-year sentence for sodomy, and allowed to contest elections as he was a victim of a political vendetta. Anwar is seen as the greatest threat to Prime Minister Najib Razak and his coalition, after leading a three-party opposition alliance to stunning electoral gains in 2013.   In the case of Anwar we can make a case that he was unfairly treated. The decision of the court was obviously influenced by the government and I think the incoming government would be able to persuade the king to give a full pardon for Anwar,  Mahathir told the Guardian.  In which case he would be able to participate in politics and become PM. I can have no objection to that.  Malaysia's political landscape has been shaped for nearly two decades by a bitter feud between Anwar and Mahathir. Anwar was once a protege of the veteran prime minister, Mahathir, and the rising star of Malaysian politics, but they fell out in the late 1990s. Soon afterwards, Anwar was jailed for the first time on charges of sodomy and graft, after being sacked as the deputy prime minister. He denied the charges, dismissing them as politically motivated. He was convicted and jailed in 2013, when Najib was prime minister, for another sodomy charge, which he and his supporters described as a politically motivated attempt to end his career. But after their years of animosity, opposition to Prime Minister Najib is drawing Anwar and Mahathir back together. Last year, Anwar endorsed a political compact spearheaded by Mahathir to fight Najib. Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He has denied any wrongdoing, even as the fund became the subject of money laundering investigations in the United States and at least five other countries. The sodomy conviction disqualifies Anwar from political office and from contesting the next election that must be held by mid-2018. A royal pardon, however, would let him contest. Government sources have told Reuters that Najib had been preparing to call polls in September, but the timing has since become less clear in the wake of the scandals.

He added the United States wanted to discuss with Russia the use of on-the-ground ceasefire observers and the coordinated delivery of humanitarian aid to Syrians.  If our two countries work together to establish stability on the ground, it will lay a foundation for progress on the settlement of Syria's political future,  Tillerson said in a statement ahead of this week's Group of 20 summit in Germany. The statement made no mention of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's future. The United States largely blames Assad for the six years of civil war and has called on him to step down. Tillerson also said Russia had an obligation to prevent the use of chemical weapons by Assad's government. Washington hit a Syrian air base with a missile strike in April after accusing the Assad government of killing dozens of civilians in a chemical attack. Syria denied it carried out the attack. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg this week, and Tillerson said Syria would be a topic of discussion. Russia is Assad's major ally and Moscow's military support has helped the Syrian government turn the tide in a multi-sided war against Islamic State and Syrian rebels. As the fight against Islamic State winds down, Tillerson said Russia has a  special responsibility  to ensure Syria's stability. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows damaged buildings in a rebel-held part of the southern city of Deraa, Syria June 22, 2017.Alaa Al-Faqir/File PhotoHe said Moscow needs to make sure no faction in Syria  illegitimately re-takes or occupies areas  liberated from Islamic State or other groups.  U.S.-backed forces have surrounded Islamic State's stronghold in Syria, the city of Raqqa. Tillerson lauded U.S. and Russia cooperation in establishing de-confliction zones in Syria and said it was evidence  that our two nations are capable of further progress.  Speaking before he left Washington for Hamburg, Tillerson said:  I think the important aspect of this is that this is where we've begun an effort to begin to rebuild confidence between ourselves and Russia at the military-to-military level but also at the diplomatic level.   In March, Tillerson said the United States would set up  interim zones of stability  to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq. Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute think-tank in Washington cautioned against a U.S. approach in Syria that relied on Russia.  Russia is neither capable nor willing to give us what we want in Syria,  Lister said.  Time and time again, the Obama administration placed its hopes in Russia as the sole guarantor of de-escalation, humanitarian aid and political progress, and time and time again the Obama administration was left disappointed,  he said.  Why do we think this time will be any different?   Trump came into office in January seeking to improve ties with Russia that had soured during the Obama administration. But Trump is under pressure at home to take a hard line with Putin due to allegations that Russians meddled in the U.S. election and of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Pyongyang's first test on Tuesday of an ICBM with a potential to strike the state of Alaska has raised the question: How capable is the U.S. military of knocking down an incoming missile or barrage of missiles? Briefing reporters on Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said:  We do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there.      Davis cited a successful test in May in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM. But he acknowledged the test program's track program was not perfect.  It's something we have mixed results on. But we also have an ability to shoot more than one interceptor,  Davis said. An internal memo seen by Reuters also showed that the Pentagon upgraded its assessment of U.S. defenses after the May  test. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on a multi-layered missile defense system, the United States may not be able to seal itself off entirely from a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile attack. Experts caution that U.S. missile defenses are now geared to shooting down one, or perhaps a small number of basic, incoming missiles. Were North Korea's technology and production to keep advancing, U.S. defenses could be overwhelmed unless they keep pace with the threat.  Over the next four years, the United States has to increase its current capacity of our deployed systems, aggressively push for more and faster deployment,  said Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.  Mixed Results The test records of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), charged with the mission to develop, test and field a ballistic missile defense system, also show mixed results.  The intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 is seen during its test launch in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency. KCNA/via REUTERSMDA systems have multiple layers and ranges and use sensors in space at sea and on land that altogether form a defense for different U.S. regions and territories.      One component, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD), demonstrated a success rate just above 55 percent. A second component, the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships and on land, had about an 83 percent success rate, according to the agency.  A third, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, has a 100 percent success rate in 13 tests conducted since 2006, according to the MDA. Lockheed Martin Corp is the prime contractor for THAAD and Aegis. Boeing Co is the lead contractor for GMD.      Since President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s, the U.S. government has spent more than $200 billion to develop and field a range of ballistic missile defense systems ranging from satellite detection to the sea-based Aegis system, according to the Congressional Research Service.     Funding for MDA was on average $8.12 billion during President Barack Obama's administration that ended on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump has requested $7.8 billion for fiscal year 2018. 'Another Year or Two' Last month, Vice Admiral James Syring, then director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a congressional panel that North Korean advancements in the past six months had caused him great concern. U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North said the pace of North Korea's missile development was quicker than expected.  However, it will probably require another year or two of development before this missile can reliably and accurately hit high-value continental U.S. targets, particularly if fired under wartime conditions,  he said. Michael Elleman, a fellow for Missile Defence at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that although North Korea was several steps from creating a dependable ICBM,  There are absolutely no guarantees  the United States can protect itself.  In missile defense,  Even if it had a test record of 100 percent, there are no guarantees.

Ambassador Joseph Yun's trip was announced after North Korea on Tuesday tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that Pyongyang says can carry a large nuclear warhead and some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska. The test, the first of its kind by North Korea, triggered an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting and a call for global action by the United States. Yun, the U.S. State Department's special representative for North Korea policy, will be in Singapore July 11 to 13 to attend the conference of the Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD), and will then travel to Myanmar. The North Korean mission to the United Nations said Pyongyang was not sending a delegation to the dialogue. Yun negotiated Pyongyang's release of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. student sentenced to 15 years' hard labor for trying to steal an item with a propaganda slogan, who returned to the United States in a coma on June 13 and died June 19. While visiting the North to secure his release, Yun met three other Americans held there. The NEACD describes itself as a forum where officials from China, Japan, North and South Korea, Russia and the United States can regularly meet, attending in a private capacity rather than as official government representatives. The University of California at San Diego's Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC), which sponsors the conference, said North Korean officials attended the forum in 2016 and 2012. Asked if there were plans for Yun to meet North Korean officials during his trip, or if she could rule out such a meeting, Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, replied:  There are no sideline meetings on Ambassador Yun’s schedule that I am aware of.   The United States remains open to credible talks on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. However, conditions must change before there is any scope for talks to resume,  she said, without saying what had to happen to hold talks. From Singapore, Yun will travel July 17 and 18 to Myanmar, where North Korea will also be on the agenda, Adams said. In September, the then top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Daniel Russel, told a congressional hearing there could be “a few residual pockets” in the Myanmar military who might still have interactions with North Korea.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea's actions were  quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution  and the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies.  One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction,  Haley said. She urged China, North Korea's only major ally, to do more to rein in Pyongyang.  Speaking with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis underscored the  ironclad commitment  of the United States to defending Japan and providing  extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Mattis' assurances to Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada came during a phone call to discuss the North Korean test, the statement said. Taking a major step in its missile program, North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea says the missile could carry a large nuclear warhead. The missile test is a direct challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile.  He has frequently urged China to press the isolated country's leadership to give up its nuclear program.         Haley said the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea in coming days and warned that  if Russia and China did not support the move, then “we will go our own path.” Related CoverageCan U.S. defend against North Korea missiles? Not everyone agreesRussia says military force against N.Korea should be excludedU.S. diplomat heads to Asia but no talks with North Korea scheduled    She did not give details on what sanctions would be proposed, but outlined possible options.  The international community can cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime. We can restrict the flow of oil to their military and their weapons programs. We can increase air and maritime restrictions. We can hold senior regime officials accountable,  Haley said.     Diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North.     “Much of the burden of enforcing U.N. sanctions rests with China,” Haley said.  The United States might seek to take unilateral action and sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks, U.S. officials have said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks on during the test-launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 5, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERSChina's U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, told the Security Council meeting that the missile launch was a  flagrant violation  of U.N. resolutions and  unacceptable.   We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,  Liu said. Tensions With u.s. The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty and the past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. Tensions have risen sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests                 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the ICBM test completed his country's strategic weapons capability that includes atomic and hydrogen bombs, the state KCNA news agency said. Slideshow (18 Images)Pyongyang will not negotiate with the United States to give up those weapons until Washington abandons its hostile policy against the North, KCNA quoted Kim as saying.  He, with a broad smile on his face, told officials, scientists and technicians that the U.S. would be displeased ... as it was given a 'package of gifts' on its 'Independence Day,'  KCNA said, referring to the missile launch on July 4.  Trump and other leaders from the Group of 20 nations meeting in Germany this week are due to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons program, which it has pursued in defiance of Security Council sanctions. Russia's deputy U.N. envoy said on Wednesday that military force should not be considered against North Korea and called for a halt to the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. He also said that attempts to strangle North Korea economically were  unacceptable  and that sanctions would not resolve the issue. The U.S. military assured Americans that it was capable of defending the United States against a North Korean ICBM.         Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis noted a successful test last month in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM.  So we do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there,  he told reporters. He acknowledged though that previous U.S. missile defense tests had shown  mixed results.          The North Korean launch this week was both earlier and  far more successful than expected,  said U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North. It would now probably only be a year or two before a North Korean ICBM achieved  minimal operational capability,  he added. Schilling said the U.S. national missile defense system was  only minimally operational  and would take more than two years to upgrade to provide more reliable defense.

Meeting in Germany ahead of a G20 summit, Xi told South Korean President Moon Jae-in that China upheld maintaining the peace and stability of the peninsula, and that all sides should strictly abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions, China's state news agency Xinhua reported. China supported the new South Korean government's efforts to restart dialogue and contacts with North Korea, Xi said, adding that the international community should work together to play a positive role to ease tension. Ties between China and South Korea have soured over the basing in South Korea of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system China sees as a threat to its own security, despite Washington and Seoul saying it is purely to defend against North Korea. Xi told Moon that China did not want to see the  difficulties  that have been present in relations of late, and that South Korea should  clear obstacles  to bilateral ties and pay attention to China's  legitimate concerns . The news agency did not elaborate. Taking a major step in its missile program, North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea says the missile could carry a large nuclear warhead. The missile test is a direct challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile. He has frequently urged China to press the leaders of isolated North Korea to give up their nuclear program, and on Wednesday he denounced China's trade with its defiant neighbor. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking in Beijing earlier on Thursday, said China fully implemented UN resolutions on North Korea. As a neighbor, China had  normal  trade relations with North Korea and U.N. resolutions were clear that they were not intended to impact upon  livelihood and humanitarian needs , he added.

The  Blind Date  episode, to air on Saturday to coincide with London's gay pride march, will feature a woman deciding between three potential female dates who are hidden from view. LGBT rights group Stonewall said it welcomed the decision and hoped to see more television programmes featuring sexually diverse people.  The show's commitment to inclusion is welcomed by the community, demonstrating just how far society - and LGBT representation in the media - has come,  a Stonewall spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We hope see even more shows follow Blind Date's example by helping viewers across Britain gain a better understanding of the diversity of the LGBT community,  he said. The popular dating show first aired in 1985 on the ITV network and was hosted by former singer Cilla Black, who died in 2015. The new series was relaunched on Channel5 last month and is now presented by English entertainer Paul O'Grady.  We wanted to be inclusive with our contestants and having LGBT representation throughout the series was really important to us from the outset, alongside maintaining the spirit and warmth of the original and much-loved format,  a Channel5 spokeswoman said. In the United States, advocacy group GLAAD said sexual diversity on U.S. television was at an all time high in 2016, with nearly 5 percent of all characters identifying as LGBT. The group added that some TV characters and storylines still portrayed the LGBT community in a negative or stereotypical way, but noted that television was far ahead of movies in terms of representation.

U.S. companies announced 31,105 planned job cuts in June, a 6.0 percent decline from 33,092 in May, according to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The previous month's figure was downwardly revised from 51,692 after Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported it would cut 1,400 workers, not 20,000, as initially reported.  Overall, June's job cuts were down 19.3 percent from a year earlier, when 38,536 layoffs were announced in June 2016.  Some companies are not making their layoffs this year, which they might have done if the labor pool wasn't so stretched, especially for skilled labor,  John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, told Reuters. With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, its lowest since May 2001, employers are having a harder time finding the talent they need so they keep existing workers, Challenger said. The slowdown in layoff activity in June is reflected in the year-to-date totals as well, with the number of planned workforce reductions falling by 28 percent to 227,000 in the first six months of 2017 from more than 313,000 in the first half of 2016. The technology sector, for instance, reported 23,813 job cuts for the first six months of the year, down 52.5 percent from 50,161 announced in the first half of 2016.  One notable exception is in the retail sector, where announced layoffs in the first half of 2016 are the highest since the recession as big chains such as Macy's Inc (M.N) close stores and companies restructure to focus on online sales.  The sector had announced 60,127 job cuts through June, a 42 percent increase from the 42,095 cuts reported through the first half of 2016. This represents the highest number of layoffs in the first half since 2009, according to Challenger. Though the retail sector reported over 5,000 store closings this year, the worst of the layoffs may be behind. Challenger said retailers typically trim their staff in the first quarter after the holiday season before they start to expand again.

The government has been looking to slash the subsidies it uses to keep consumers' energy prices down and raise taxes in a bid to tighten up government finances. The measures are part of a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan agreement it hopes will lure back foreign investors who fled after a 2011 political uprising. It said previously it would phase out electricity subsidies entirely by the end of the 2018-19 fiscal year beginning in July, but Shaker said tough economic conditions brought on by the floating of the pound currency in November means the subsidies will be phased out more gradually, by the end of 2021-22.  Owing to conditions related to the big increase in the exchange rate, we have extended the period (for subsidies) by three more years,  Shaker told a news conference announcing the new electricity prices. Inflation has soared in import-dependent Egypt following the currency float, reaching a three-decade high of over 30 percent. Price rises are expected to continue following hikes to the prices of electricity and fuel. Shaker said Egypt spent 64 billion Egyptian pounds ($3.58 billion) on electricity subsidies during the 2016-17 fiscal year which ended in June, more than twice the 30 billion initially expected in the budget, largely a result of higher import costs for liquefied natural gas (LNG), which supply its power stations, following the float. The price hikes, which will take effect beginning August 1, will cut subsidy spending to 52.7 billion pounds in the current fiscal year and then to 43.4 billion pounds in the 2018-19 fiscal year, Shaker said. $1 = 17.8726 Egyptian pounds Reporting by Omar Fahmy; Writing by Eric Knecht; Editing by Toby Chopra","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-electricity-idUSL8N1JX2C4"},

Poland imports most of the 16 billion cubic metres of gas it consumes a year from Russia, on the basis of a long-term deal with Gazprom which expires in 2022. Warsaw plans to replace the Russian gas after then with supplies from Norway via a planned pipeline as well as with more LNG from the U.S. coming to its terminal at the Baltic Sea. Duda spoke to Trump, who is visiting Warsaw, about Poland's security and gas supplies.  Let's hope for more supplies and further diversification of supplies of this commodity to Poland,  Duda said at a joint news conference with Trump adding that he expects a long term contract with the U.S. to be signed  soon  and expressing hopes Poland may become a hub for U.S. deliveries for the region. Trump confirmed that  many more  U.S. LNG shipments will be coming to Poland, but said the price might rise.  Maybe we get your price up a little bit, but that's ok, tough negotiations,  the U.S. president said.  We are sitting on massive energy, we are now exporters of energy. Whenever you need energy, just give us a call,  Trump said. Poland received its first and only LNG shipment from the U.S. in June and its state-run firm PGNiG is in talks over more deliveries. Poland's ambition is to resell gas in future, especially to Ukraine, but also to southern Europe. Once it completes the pipeline to Norway and expands its LNG terminal it will be able to import more gas than it consumes.  America stands ready to help Poland and other European nations diversify their energy supplies, so that you can never be held hostage to a single supplier,  Trump said, referring to Russia. Duda said that Poland wants to make sure no countries from the region fall victim to any gas  blackmailing  in the future.

Qatar Airways on Thursday joined Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS) and Etihad in saying the ban had been lifted.  Overall, IATA said global capacity measured in available seat kilometers rose 6.1 percent, slower than demand. That meant load factors - a measure of how full planes are - increased 1.2 percentage points to 80.1 percent, which IATA said was a record for the month.

Brent oil was up 1.5 percent at $48.5 a barrel, recovering one percent of the four percent it lost in the previous session, while broader Asian markets were down after the U.S. Federal Reserve gave mixed signals on Wednesday.     The minutes of the Fed's June policy meeting showed that several officials were divided on their outlook for inflation.       The key parts of the markets are still reluctant to move forward as the minutes of the Fed meet show that even the committee itself is still mixed about the proper measures to reduce the balance sheet of the U.S. Federal Reserve,  said Rakpong Chaisuparakul, a strategist with KGI Securities Thailand.     Asian shares have been shaky this week due to tensions in the Korean peninsula after North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into Japanese waters, causing the United States to warn that it was ready to use force if need be to stop the missile program.     In southeast Asia, Thai shares closed 0.3 percent down at their lowest in over three weeks as energy stocks slid.      Thai energy stocks fell because oil prices fell overnight. This is why Thai market is slightly weaker compared with Asia today,  added Chaisuparakul.     Singapore ended the session 0.7 percent lower, with financial stocks accounting for more than half the losses. DBS Group Holdings Ltd and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited were the top losers on the index.     Philippine shares closed 0.5 percent higher, aided by financial stocks.     Metro Pacific Investments Corp closed up 6.7 percent at its highest in nearly two months.

The list of detainees, which includes officers as well as servicemen from the lower ranks of the army, navy, air force and National Guard, provided the clearest picture to date of dissatisfaction and dissent within Venezuela's roughly 150,000-strong military. The records, detailing prisoners held in three Venezuelan jails, showed that since April nearly 30 members of the military have been detained for deserting or abandoning their post and almost 40 for rebellion, treason, or insubordination.  Most of the remaining military prisoners were charged with theft.   Millions of Venezuelans are suffering from food shortages and soaring inflation caused by a severe economic crisis. Even within the armed forces, salaries start at the minimum wage, equivalent to around $12.50 a month at the black market exchange rate, and privately some members admit to being poorly paid and underfed. Since the opposition started its protests more than three months ago, a handful of security officials have gone public with their discontent. Last week, rogue policeman and action movie star Oscar Perez commandeered a helicopter and attacked government buildings, claiming that a faction within the armed forces was opposed to Maduro's government. The military documents seen by Reuters, which covered detentions until mid-June, appeared to support opposition leaders' assertions that anger and dissent among soldiers over economic hardship is more widespread.   This shows low morale and discontent and, of course, economic necessity,  one former army general said of the detentions, asking not to be named for fear of reprisals.  Venezuela's military and Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.    Venezuelans view the armed forces as the key power broker in their country. Opposition leaders have repeatedly exhorted military leaders to break with socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro has said that he is the victim of an  armed insurrection  by U.S.-backed opponents seeking to gain control of the OPEC country's oil wealth. He has said that the top military brass have been standing by him. A demonstrator throws back a tear gas canister while rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, July 4, 2017.Andres Martinez CasaresThe National Guard has been at the forefront of policing protests across the country. It uses tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets against masked youths who in turn hurl stones, Molotov cocktails and excrement at security lines. At least 90 people have been killed since April. Privately, some National Guard members on the streets have acknowledged being exhausted, impoverished and hungry, though most remain impassive during protests and avoid engaging in conversation with reporters.   Little Rambos   The documents, which identified detainees by their rank, listed captains, sergeants, lieutenants and regular troops held in three prisons in different parts of Venezuela. Ninety-one are at Ramo Verde, a hilltop jail near Caracas where opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez is also held.  Another two dozen are at Pica prison in the northeastern city of Maturin and eight are at Santa Ana jail in the western state of Tachira, near the Colombian border. It was not immediately clear if military prisoners were also being held in other jails. Three lieutenants fled to Colombia and requested asylum in May, and a man who said he was a Venezuelan naval sergeant appeared in a video published by local media last month expressing his dissent and urging colleagues to disobey  abusive  and  corrupt  superiors. Maduro has blamed the problems on an  economic war  being waged by the opposition with backing from Washington, a position taken in public by senior military officials.   Many are seeking ... little 'Rambos' in the armed forces, but you're not going to find them,  Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said in a video published on Monday, alluding to speculation of a military coup.  Perez, who staged the helicopter attack last week against the Interior Ministry and the Supreme Court in Caracas, appeared in an online video on Wednesday vowing to keep up the fight.  We are fully sure of what we are doing and if we must give up our lives, we will hand them over to the people,  Perez said, sitting in front of a Venezuelan flag and rifle.

Banks, insurers and asset managers based in Britain are already making contingency plans to shift some operations to continental Europe after Brexit takes effect in case access to the EU single market is closed off. But Bailey said Britain and the EU are in a position to preserve free trade for financial services, meaning such moves need not happen.   Firms should be able to take their own decisions on where they locate, subject to appropriate regulatory arrangements being in place which preserve the public interest,  Bailey said, in his first major speech on Brexit since Britain triggered the formal EU divorce proceedings in March.   Authorities should not dictate the location of firms,  he told an audience in Canary Wharf, home to some of the world's biggest banks. Future financial sector relations between Britain and the EU should be based on  mutual recognition  or regulatory cooperation  but not exact mirroring  of rules, Bailey said.   Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Dublin are all vying for a slice of Britain's financial services industry after Brexit. Bailey said such competition was good. But he also said Brexit should not be used as an excuse to restrict the ability to have open markets and freedom of location.  The roots exist to come out with sensible outcomes on this.  Some companies have already announced plans to move people to continental European locations to retain access to the EU single market. Bailey said a transition period based on current trading arrangements was needed this year. This would avoid a  regrettable  situation whereby firms had to  press the button  on moves to the EU before they know what the outcome of Britain's negotiations with the bloc will be.  It needs to be a sensible period,  Bailey said. Bailey questioned whether restricting trade in this way was an inevitable or necessary response to Brexit.  When I hear people say firms need to re-locate in order to continue to benefit from access to EU financial markets, I start to seriously wonder.  No Location Policies France and other EU countries, for example, want the clearing of euro denominated derivatives, which London dominates,  located  within the EU after Brexit. Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, speaks during a  Reuters Newsmaker  interview at the Reuters offices in London, Britain, July 6, 2017.Hannah McKay It does not require a location policy,  Bailey said. Joint oversight with the EU of clearing houses in London is  something that is very clearly preferable to the cost and risk that is introduced by a location based policy.  Such joint oversight was already working well between the UK and United States regulators in clearing, he said. He dismissed talk in the EU that given the dominance of Britain's financial services sector, the largest in Europe, there should be specific rules for the UK, rather than the existing general regime for recognizing non-EU financial firms.  I do not accept that,  Bailey said. Non-EU financial firms from the United States, Singapore and elsewhere can currently offer their services in the EU if their home regulation is deemed by Brussels to be  equivalent  or as tough as the bloc's own rules. Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, poses for a photo as he arrives at the Reuters offices for an interview in London, Britain, July 6, 2017.Hannah McKayThis regime should be applied to Britain in the same way.  It would not be the best outcome to adopt a special treatment for the oversight of outsourced service provision arrangements involving the UK and EU when there are already arrangements in place which can form the basis of an equivalence arrangement,  Bailey said. No Race to the Bottom Britain was not interested in a  race to the bottom  in regulation after Brexit, he said. Britain has worked hard over the years to build up relations with EU and national regulators across the bloc, he said, though he conceded that he was already being locked out of EU regulatory discussions about Brexit.  It's perfectly reasonable ... It does not concern me.  There are already fears that asset managers in Britain will be prevented from managing funds based in the EU after Brexit, but Bailey said this longstanding cross-border  delegation  should continue.  It works well today. There is no reason to disrupt that model,  Bailey said. Critics of Brexit have said that Britain will end up being a  rule taker , meaning it will have to copy and paste the bloc's rules into UK law if it wants to maintain access in financial services.  I don't want to be in a situation where we become a pure rule taker,  Bailey said.

The People's Bank of China has been relying more on market-based policy tools, including the MLF, SLF and repurchase agreements to adjust liquidity and market interest rates, while keeping its benchmark interest rates steady.  We will deepen market-based interest rate reform, constantly improve the formation, regulation and transmission mechanism of market-based interest rates, and enhance the central bank's ability to adjust interest rates,  the PBOC said in a report on financial market development in 2016,  The PBOC adopted a modest tightening stance at the start of this year, guiding interest rates higher during the first quarter, including immediately after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. rates in March. But the central bank did not hike following a Fed rate rise in June, and it injected substantial liquidity last month to help avoid a end-quarter cash crunch amid a deleveraging drive. The central bank also said it will increase yuan flexibility versus dollar, actively guide and stabilize market expectations and balance cross-border capital flows.  The PBOC said on Tuesday that it would continue to implement a prudent and neutral monetary policy, and keep liquidity in China's financial system basically stable.     China will study and steadily push financial regulatory reform and improve the stability of financial institutions, as well as appropriately deal with some high-risk institutions this year, the central bank said. Chinese leaders will hold the National Financial Work Conference, a five-yearly meeting, in mid-July to discuss financial regulatory reforms, financial safety and other issues, the financial magazine Caixin reported on Wednesday.

Agakhan Sharief, a prominent Muslim leader, told Reuters that after a band of Islamist fighters overran parts of Marawi City on May 23 and took hundreds of people hostage, he was approached by a senior Duterte aide to use his connections with the Maute militant group's leaders to start back-channel talks.  Two other Marawi sources familiar with the matter confirmed the president had worked behind the scenes to hold talks with the Maute brothers, Omarkhayam and Abdullah. However, the process was halted when Duterte in a May 31 speech declared he  will not talk to terrorists . It was not immediately clear what prompted Duterte's about-face. It came five days after another televised speech in which he told the militants  we can still solve this through dialogue , but if he could not convince them of that,  so be it. Let's just fight .  The problem with our president, his mind is changing always,  said Sharief, a cleric who has had roles in various peace agreements on the long-restive southern island of Mindanao.  He announced he will no longer talk to terrorists and that made our negotiations cut.  Duterte's top peace envoy Jesus Dureza said he was unaware of any back-channel talks, while his national security adviser, Hermogenes Esperon said it was unlikely Duterte had reached out to the Maute group.  Why will he talk to the terrorists?  Esperon said. Despite his tough rhetoric and frequent promises to wipe out militants, Duterte has a reputation as a peace-broker, having dealt with separatist and Marxist rebellions during his 22 years as mayor of Davao City in Mindanao, an island of 22 million with a long history of unrest. Duterte's Biggest Crisis The battle for control of Marawi has been the biggest crisis of Duterte's year-old presidency. Fighters from the Maute group and others loyal to Islamic State have been holed up in the commercial district of the town through more than 40 days of air strikes, artillery bombardments and fierce street clashes with troops. More than 400 people have been killed, including 337 militants, 85 members of the security forces, and 44 civilians.  Some 260,000 residents have been displaced by a siege that has fanned regional fears that Islamic State is trying to establish a stronghold in Southeast Asia. Marawi Mayor Majul Usman Gandamra confirmed that back-channel talks did start but said he was not privy to details. Agakhan Sharief, a Marawi City Muslim, talks during an interview with Reuters in Cagayan de Oro, Philippines, July 3, 2017.Martin PettyHe told Reuters the process failed because the rebels did not show good faith or reduce the intensity of attacks on government forces after Duterte offered them an olive branch.  There was a window of opportunity,  he said.  But there was no show of sincerity.  Rebels 'Convinced' Sharief, known locally as  Bin Laden  due to his resemblance to the late al Qaeda leader, would not reveal the identity of Duterte's aide, whom he said was confidentially assigned to set up a meeting with the Maute clan. He said the aide agreed that Sharief would accompany the Maute brothers' influential mother, Farhana, by helicopter to meet Duterte in nearby Cagayan De Oro or Davao City. Agakhan Sharief, a Marawi City Muslim, shows a picture of casualties in Marawi during an interview with Reuters in Cagayan de Oro, Philippines, July 3, 2017.Martin PettySharief said her sons who requested she represent them in talks with Duterte.  He (Duterte's aide) prepared everything that I needed. I told him that I need a chopper to get the mother of the Maute brothers to bring her to the president. He prepared that.   I called the Maute brothers and their mother ... I told them, I convinced them.  Sharief said the president was prepared to offer the Maute clan implementation of Sharia law in their hometown, Butig, if he achieves his goal of establishing a federal system in the Philippines. Reuters could not independently verify that such a proposal had been made. The talks with the Maute group did not go ahead and the mother was arrested on June 9 elsewhere in the same province as Marawi. The Maute brothers' father, Cayamora Maute, was apprehended three days earlier in Davao City. The cleric said that the rebels would have taken Duterte's deal to end the siege.  They agreed, they supported this,  said Sharief, who last met with Abdullah Maute on June 25, when he led a group of emissaries into the heart of Marawi to free some hostages during the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday. Sharief, who owns four private schools in Marawi, some of which were badly damaged by the fighting, said he was against the radical ideology of Islamic State. But he said he was reluctant to speak out against the Maute clan because he still hoped he could convince them to end the siege.  I am a peacemaker,  he said.  I cannot negotiate anymore if I talk against them.

Reuters reported exclusively on Wednesday that Duterte was preparing to make a deal with the Islamic State-inspired militants in the days after they occupied the town of Marawi, but he aborted the plan without explanation.  No, I did not,  Duterte said when asked during a media briefing if he had indeed, as Reuters reported, pushed for talks with the Maute group of militants battling government troops for control of Marawi.  I have never talked to terrorists and I will never talk to criminals and terrorists, but I will talk to revolutionaries who are imbued with principle,  Duterte said. The battle for control of Marawi has been the biggest crisis of Duterte's year-old presidency.  His government has consistently ruled out negotiating with  terrorists  so any behind-the-scenes efforts by either side to get talks going are likely to be scrutinized. Defence Minister Delfin Lorenzana, responding to the report from Reuters, said earlier the influential mother of two brothers, who with their Maute group of militants seized Marawi on May 23, had approached the government for talks. But Duterte had rejected the offer from the woman, Farhana Maute, as government forces had suffered too many casualties by the time the offer came, Lorenzana said. More than six weeks after the militants launched their assault in the town on the southern island of Mindanao, they are still resisting daily attacks by government forces using aircraft and artillery. More than 400 people have been killed, including 351 militants, 85 members of the security forces, and 39 civilians. About 260,000 residents have been displaced. The fighting in the largely Muslim town in the predominantly Christian Philippines has alarmed neighbors, fearful that Islamic State is bent on gaining a foothold in the region as it loses ground in the Middle East.   'Let Us Finish This' Duterte said members of other Muslim separatist groups, some of which are involved in peace talks with the government, may  have started initiatives  to hold talks with the militants in Marawi but it was  impossible  that any attempt was made by him.   Many of my soldiers and policemen have been killed. If there has to be peace it would really be peace. Don't play with me. Let us finish this once and for all,  Duterte said. A prominent Muslim leader told Reuters earlier that Duterte had been preparing to make a deal with the militants in the days after they began their assault but dropped the plan without explanation. Agakhan Sharief, an intermediary involved in the process, said he was approached by a senior Duterte aide to use his connections with the Maute group's leaders to start back-channel talks.   Lorenzana said he did not know about any back-channel efforts.  Talking does not mean negotiating,  he said. Lorenzana reiterated that the government did not negotiate with terrorists.   Either they surrender, or we go to war,  he said.   Two other sources in Marawi familiar with the matter confirmed the president had worked behind the scenes to hold talks with the Maute brothers, Omarkhayam and Abdullah.  However, the process was halted when Duterte, in a May 31 speech, declared he  will not talk to terrorists . Duterte's spokesman, Ernesto Abella, referring to any effort by the president on talks, said he had  no verified reports that there were efforts to initiate such actions .

Faltering appetite in a country where gold is used in everything from investment to wedding gifts could further drag global prices, already trading near their lowest level in eight weeks.  In the short term at least, we believe (the tax) may pose challenges for the industry,  said Alistair Hewitt, director of Market Intelligence at WGC.  Small-scale artisans and retailers with varying degrees of tax compliance may struggle to adapt,  Hewitt said in the report published on Gold Investor quarterly magazine on Thursday. As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the goods and services tax (GST) on gold jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously.  There have been fears the tax increase could stoke under-the-counter buying and spur appetite for precious metal smuggled into India, where millions of people store chunks of their wealth in bullion and jewelry. Longer term, the GST will have a positive effect by making the gold sector more transparent and improving the supply chain, said Hewitt. The WGC also said a government move to ban cash transactions over 200,000 rupees ($3,090) from April 1 could hurt gold demand in rural areas where farmers often purchase the metal using cash due to limited access to cheques and electronic payment systems. Two-thirds of India's gold demand comes from rural areas, where jewelry is a traditional store of wealth. The transactions rule's  potential impact isn't entirely clear: it could curb gold purchases; it could encourage gold shoppers to buy smaller amounts of gold spread over more transactions; or it could push a large part of demand underground and encourage a black market in gold,  Hewitt said. The WGC kept its 2017 gold demand estimate for India at 650 to 750 tonnes, well below the average annual consumption of 846 tonnes in the past five years.  Over time however, we anticipate that economic growth should push demand higher. By 2020 we see Indian consumers buying between 850 tonnes to 950 tonnes of gold,  he said.

Middle East carriers had a 3.7 percent rise in demand in May compared to a year ago, close to an eight-year low, with IATA saying that reflected the ban on large portable electronics devices in the cabin from 10 airports in the region to the United States, plus uncertainty over President Trump's proposed travel bans.     Qatar Airways on Thursday joined Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS) and Etihad in saying the ban had been lifted.  Overall, IATA said global capacity measured in available seat kilometers rose 6.1 percent, slower than demand. That meant load factors - a measure of how full planes are - increased 1.2 percentage points to 80.1 percent, which IATA said was a record for the month.  The rising price of fuel and other input costs is likely to see airlines' ability to stimulate markets with lower fares taper over the coming months,  IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said.

By Indonesian law, the combined budget deficits of the central and regional governments in one year could not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The proposed revisions to the central government's 2017 budget, released on Thursday, would create a fiscal deficit of 2.92 percent, a finance ministry document showed.  However, the ministry said the revisions do not mean the 3 percent legal limit might be breached, as traditionally not all of the approved budget is spent. In the ministry's view, this year's fiscal deficit will be 2.67 percent of GDP. That's above the original budget projection of 2.41 percent, but well below 3 percent. The documents showed the ministry expects a shortfall of 36.16 trillion rupiah ($2.70 billion) in 2017 total revenue, due to less-than-initially-expected tax receipts. That would reduce the total revenue to 1,714.13 trillion rupiah. The government plans to increase spending by 30.91 trillion rupiah, which would lift total budgeted spending to 2,111.36 trillion rupiah. Included in the proposed extra spending are bigger allocations for connectivity infrastructure, improvement of prisons and preparations for the 2018 Asian Games, which Indonesia will host.  The government also proposed a 33.4 percent increase in energy subsidies to 103.11 trillion rupiah, due to higher global oil prices. The proposed changes need to be approved by parliament, which will have deliberations about them with the government.

Cinven acquired CeramTec for €1.49bn in 2013 from Rockwood Holdings, backed with a US$747.5m-equivalent loan. It tried to list CeramTec in 2015 but that was pulled, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Cinven is now looking to exit the company, hiring Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch as advisers to evaluate strategic options, the sources said. A sale will be the focus of the process but an IPO still remains an option, the sources said. Cinven declined to comment. The sale process is in the early stages but a number of potential buyers are circling the company and are expected to submit first round bids in an auction process, the sources said. Morgan Stanley and BAML are providing a staple financing that will be available to any potential buyer, giving certainty of funds for financing an acquisition, the sources said. Other banks are also working on debt financings in an attempt to fund a deal and some €1.5bn of debt equates to around 7 times CeramTec’s approximate €195m Ebitda. CeramTec has been popular with leveraged finance bankers and debt investors as it is seen as a strong, stable business and a good performer, the sources said. “Seven times leverage might be seen as high but CeramTec already has a high level of leverage on it and it is a great business that everyone loves,” a head of leveraged finance said. Senior leveraged loans and second-lien loans, denominated in euros and dollars are all being considered, the sources said. The US$747.5m-equivalent loan backing Cinven’s 2013 buyout comprised a US$472.5m term loan and a €291.3m term loan, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. In May 2016, CeramTec acquired US-based peer DAI Ceramics. Headquartered in Plochingen, Germany, CeramTec manufactures high performance ceramics for medical and industrial end-markets.

The Tampa Bay Rays, who host the Red Sox on Thursday for the opener of a four-game series that closes the first half, are creeping up on second place in the East but come home with an empty feeling after a 4-4 road trip. The Rays gave themselves a chance at a winning trip by holding off the Chicago Cubs 6-5 on Tuesday but could not muster the same offensive surge while falling 7-3 in the finale of the two-game interleague series. Logan Morrison, who is up for the final spot on the AL All-Star team and made some waves over the long weekend by suggesting he should have been asked to participate in the Home Run Derby, remained hot with two hits in Wednesday's loss and has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games. Boston was full of hot hitters before managing a total of three hits in an 8-2 setback at Texas on Wednesday that snapped its six-game winning streak.

Sale made two starts against Tampa Bay earlier in the season and won both while yielding four runs and five hits with 24 strikeouts in 14 frames. Faria recorded a quality start in each of his first five major-league outings but was kept out of the win column in the last two.

The surprising Twins, who trail first-place Cleveland by 1 ½ games in the division race, host the struggling Baltimore Orioles on Thursday for the opener of a four-game series that leads into the All-Star break. Minnesota failed in an attempt to record its sixth sweep of the season with Wednesday’s setback, but second baseman Brian Dozier (back) returned to the lineup after missing two contests and extended his hitting streak to five games.

The 24-year-old Oklahoma native suffered a tough-luck loss in his first career start against Minnesota on May 23, giving up two runs, six hits and three walks with seven strikeouts over seven frames in a 2-0 setback. Dozier homered off Bundy in that contest. Berrios allowed season highs of five runs and nine hits over five innings at Kansas City last time out, but he was able to avoid a loss in the 11-6 setback.

His comments may dampen expectations for imminent policy tweaks. Accelerating growth will increase returns on investments, making borrowing conditions more attractive, essentially providing further accommodation to the economy, Praet said. But inflation has yet to rise convincingly toward the ECB's target, measured inflation remains exceedingly volatile and price growth expectations are still too low, he said.  We need patience and persistence,  Praet said, repeating ECB President Mario Draghi's message from last week.  Therefore, maintaining a steady hand continues to be critical to fostering a durable convergence of inflation toward our monetary policy aim.  Draghi stirred markets last week when he appeared to open the door to tweaks in policy, fuelling speculation that policymakers could decide as soon as September to reduce asset buys from next year. He argued that accelerating growth will in itself provide support -- a message Praet repeated on Thursday -- so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged. Sources then suggested the market had over-interpreted his comments. Praet, considered a top dove on the rate-setting Governing Council, argued that even the relatively muted baseline projection for inflation in the coming years depends on the ECB's support.  We need to be persistent, because the baseline scenario for inflation going forward remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.  The ECB is keeping rates in negative territory and buys 60 billion euros worth of debt each month, all in the hope of keeping borrowing costs low to fuel investment and eventually growth.

Faltering appetite in a country where gold is used in everything from investment to wedding gifts could further drag global prices, already trading near their lowest level in eight weeks.  In the short term at least, we believe (the tax) may pose challenges for the industry,  said Alistair Hewitt, director of Market Intelligence at WGC.  Small-scale artisans and retailers with varying degrees of tax compliance may struggle to adapt,  Hewitt said in the report published on Gold Investor quarterly magazine on Thursday. As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the goods and services tax (GST) on gold jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously.  There have been fears the tax increase could stoke under-the-counter buying and spur appetite for precious metal smuggled into India, where millions of people store chunks of their wealth in bullion and jewelry. Longer term, the GST will have a positive effect by making the gold sector more transparent and improving the supply chain, said Hewitt. The WGC also said a government move to ban cash transactions over 200,000 rupees ($3,090) from April 1 could hurt gold demand in rural areas where farmers often purchase the metal using cash due to limited access to cheques and electronic payment systems. Two-thirds of India's gold demand comes from rural areas, where jewelry is a traditional store of wealth. The transactions rule's  potential impact isn't entirely clear: it could curb gold purchases; it could encourage gold shoppers to buy smaller amounts of gold spread over more transactions; or it could push a large part of demand underground and encourage a black market in gold,  Hewitt said. The WGC kept its 2017 gold demand estimate for India at 650 to 750 tonnes, well below the average annual consumption of 846 tonnes in the past five years.  Over time however, we anticipate that economic growth should push demand higher. By 2020 we see Indian consumers buying between 850 tonnes to 950 tonnes of gold,  he said.

The parliament has limited influence on Turkey's decades-old pursuit of EU membership, now in limbo after bitter exchanges between Ankara and some European countries, but the decision highlighted the gulf which has grown between the two sides. EU leaders have been critical of Erdogan and his behavior toward opponents, both before and after an abortive military coup against him last July. A year-long crackdown since the failed coup and the sweeping new powers which Erdogan won in a tightly fought referendum in April have raised concerns among Turkey's Western allies. Erdogan says both the crackdown and the increased presidential powers are needed to help tackle serious challenges to Turkey's security both at home and beyond its borders. The resolution passed by parliament in Strasbourg  calls on the Commission and the member states... to formally suspend the accession negotiations with Turkey without delay if the constitutional reform package is implemented unchanged.  Related CoverageTurkey still wants to join EU, but bloc is confused: Turkish PMEU's Hahn says Turkey must respect rule of lawSome constitutional changes approved in April have already been implemented - Erdogan has been able to return to lead the ruling AK Party, and members of a top judicial body have been changed. Other steps, such as scrapping the post of prime minister, are due to take place within two years. Opposition parties and human rights groups say the changes threaten judicial independence and push Turkey toward one-man rule. The EU has also expressed concern, although many in the European Parliament believe the bloc has not gone far enough.  The current strategy of the European Commission and EU leaders seems to wait silently for things to improve in Turkey,  said the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Turkey, Kati Piri, criticizing a stance which she said was  feeding President Erdogan’s authoritarianism .  False Claims  FILE PHOTO: A European Union (L) and Turkish flag fly outside a hotel in Istanbul, Turkey, May 4, 2016.Murad Sezer/File PhotoTurkey's EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik said Ankara regarded Thursday's vote in Strasbourg as invalid, while the foreign ministry was similarly dismissive.  This decision, which is based on false claims and allegations, is trampling the reputation of the institution in question,  the ministry said in a statement, referring to the European Parliament.  This decision is of no value for us.  Thursday's vote came as EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn visited Istanbul for talks with Celik and other Turkish ministers.  As a European official I have to respect the decision of a democratic body,  Hahn told reporters, adding that he had raised the issue of the rule of law during his talks in Ankara. He also raised the case of 12 rights activists detained on Wednesday, but said he had not received a satisfactory reply. Hahn said Turkey has the right to defend its institutions in the wake of last year's failed coup, but added:  I want to be very clear that we are very worried about the reaction, very concerned about the large number of imprisoned journalists and academics.   I really want to move forward in such an important strategic relationship. It depends on Turkey's willingness, and (taking) steps on the rule of law and fundamental rights.  Despite their concerns over Turkey, EU leaders do not want to undermine an agreement struck last year whereby Ankara effectively stopped migrants reaching Greece from Turkish shores, thereby easing a crisis that had threatened EU unity. In an interview on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told Reuters that Turkey was not responsible for the escalation of tensions between the two sides.  Europe displaying inappropriate behavior toward Turkey is not a situation we can accept. Being against our President Erdogan is also not a rational stance from Europe. Europe must decide: ... Do they really want to enlarge?  Kurtulmus said.

China Literature Ltd requested the unusual exemption from the Hong Kong bourse, saying revealing the three executives' stakes  would attract unnecessary attention amongst Tencent's employees and would likely create an unfavorable and political working environment which would significantly distort Tencent's workplace culture and distract them from their business duties within as well as their duties as directors of our Company.  The online publisher filed for a Hong Kong IPO on Monday. The three executives are its board members and would have to disclose their stakes in Tencent as per the city's listing rules. The waiver request will now be vetted by the listing committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange.  That's an outrageous waiver request, and I hope that the listing committee will reject it,  said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist and a former director of the Hong Kong stock exchange.  It is the thin end of a nasty wedge if the listing committee allows companies not to disclose directors' shareholdings in their parent company.  Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, said it would set a bad precedent to grant the exception. Tencent, China Literature and the Hong Kong bourse didn't immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment. China Literature asked for a waiver so it doesn't have to reveal the stakes held in Tencent by James Gordon Mitchell, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Tencent's chief strategy officer; Cheng Wu, CEO of Tencent Pictures; and Lin Haifeng, general manager of the merger and acquisitions department at Tencent Science & Technology (Shenzhen) Co. The three are non-executive directors in China Literature's nine-member board, with Mitchell also acting as chairman. They hold  an insignificant percentage of share capital  in Tencent, the filing added. But with a market capitalization of nearly $330 billion, even a tiny stake in China's biggest social network and online entertainment firm would make the executives multi-millionaires. In its 2016 annual report Tencent disclosed the stakes held by Chairman Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, President Lau Chi Ping Martin, or Martin Lau, and four independent non-executive directors. The value of the stakes ranged from $29 billion for Ma to as low as $126,348 for one of the independent directors. As in most markets, shareholders owning 5 percent or more of any stock must be disclosed to the Hong Kong stock exchange and under listing rules IPO candidates must also reveal the interests and short positions their board directors hold in the issuer itself or  associated corporations.  Publicly listed companies must also disclose the interests and short positions of their CEOs and all directors in shares and debentures in the companies themselves or associated corporations under a separate rule, the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO). That means even if China Literature were granted the waiver, it would still have to reveal the stakes at a later date.  The listing committee has no powers to waive SFO obligations, so as soon as the company is listed, they would have to file disclosures, which will be available to the public,  investor Webb added.  So not including them in the prospectus would only delay disclosure.

His comments may dampen expectations for imminent policy tweaks. Accelerating growth will increase returns on investments, making borrowing conditions more attractive, essentially providing further accommodation to the economy, Praet said. But inflation has yet to rise convincingly toward the ECB's target, measured inflation remains exceedingly volatile and price growth expectations are still too low, he said.  We need patience and persistence,  Praet said, repeating ECB President Mario Draghi's message from last week.  Therefore, maintaining a steady hand continues to be critical to fostering a durable convergence of inflation toward our monetary policy aim.  Draghi stirred markets last week when he appeared to open the door to tweaks in policy, fuelling speculation that policymakers could decide as soon as September to reduce asset buys from next year. He argued that accelerating growth will in itself provide support -- a message Praet repeated on Thursday -- so the ECB could tighten policy somewhat to keep the broad level of financial accommodation unchanged. Sources then suggested the market had over-interpreted his comments. Praet, considered a top dove on the rate-setting Governing Council, argued that even the relatively muted baseline projection for inflation in the coming years depends on the ECB's support.  We need to be persistent, because the baseline scenario for inflation going forward remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.  The ECB is keeping rates in negative territory and buys 60 billion euros worth of debt each month, all in the hope of keeping borrowing costs low to fuel investment and eventually growth.

Leads on the €750m no-grow perpetual non-call five-year slashed initial talk of 6.5% area to 6%-6.125% on books of over €3.5bn. Pricing is expected later today. That move was likely to see some orders fall away - one investor pegged fair value at 6.5% - but a lead said it would not impact the success of the trade.  Given the level of oversubscription and the performance of Bankia's last few trades, they're right to test at the tightest possible level. It is incredible, the result they're achieving.  Bankia's last subordinated offering, a €500m 3.375% 10NC5 Tier 2 in March, was a blowout. It was bid at swaps plus 271bp last Friday, according to Thomson Reuters data, some 64bp inside its 335bp reoffer level. The response provides yet further evidence of investors' willingness to isolate losses imposed on failed lender Banco Popular in June. It is the second capital trade from a Spanish lender this week, after CaixaBank's €1bn 11NC6 Tier 2 drew €2.2bn in orders on Wednesday despite a minimal concession.  It's a seller's market,  said a second banker.  With that in mind, it's clear that you don't have optionality when you're an investor. If you choose to sit out, there are plenty of other people who will take up the slack, unless you are a real off-the-run credit.  Bankia could also take heart from the reception for last week's AT1 deals from HSBC and Raiffeisen Bank International, the first banks to sell AT1 since Banco Popular's resolution. The market has also proved impervious to the collapse of two Italian lenders and the first case of AT1 coupon cancellation, at Bremer Landesbank.  The underlying technicals are super strong and the AT1 market is now at such a stage of maturity that, even with a resolution and coupon cancellation, it charges on,  said a third banker. Despite AT1's loss-absorbing characteristics, Scope Ratings said in a note last week that actual losses depend to a far larger degree on credit fundamentals and warned against extrapolating losses at Popular and Bremer to all AT1 securities. Bankia, which last week agreed to acquire Spanish regional lender Banco Mare Nostrum, stacks up well against its peer group in this respect. The joint entity is expected to report a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 12% by year-end, compared with BBVA's 11%, for example.  In 2012 received state aid, transferred a large stock of bad assets to the state created vehicle SAREB, and wiped out sub debt, but now its recovery story looks well entrenched,  CreditSights analysts wrote. The bond, which is expected to be rated B+ by S&P;, will convert to equity if Bankia's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio breaches 5.125%. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are structuring advisers and global coordinators. They are also joint leads alongside Bankia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and UBS.

In the poll of 40 analysts, conducted between June 28 and July 5, the median forecasts see Romania's leu gaining  1.8 percent relative to Wednesday's close to 4.51 against the euro. The Czech crown could firm 1.3 percent to 25.75 and the zloty 1.2 percent to 4.19, while the forint could shed 0.5 percent to levels around 310 as Hungary's central bank is seen keeping its policies loose for years. Analysts said economic fundamentals were generally good in the region, but inflation risks could stay on the radar, and the possibility of European Central Bank policy tightening weighed on the outlook of regional currencies.  The ECB's policy will be the main factor on exchange rates (in the region),  said Peter Virovacz, analyst of ING in Budapest.  The crown is seen extending the gains it has posted since April, while the leu and the zloty could regain some of the ground that they have lost. The leu has been hit by worry that the ruling leftists could boost the budget deficit and inflation. The zloty retreated in the past three months as dovish signals from the Polish central bank have made analysts shift their forecasts for the date of its first rate hike to the fourth quarter of 2018 from the second quarter. Only the Czech central bank has shifted to hawkish policies in the region, and that helps the crown. Three months ago it removed the cap which had kept its currency weaker than 27 against the euro for three and a half years. The measure opened the way for the crown to gain about 3.5 percent so far this year to around 26.1. The bank has signalled that it may start to lift interest rates later this year. The crown's volatility after the exit from the cap has been lower than expected as investors who had bought tens of billions of euros worth of crowns, betting for its firming, have not been desperate to close their positions in a rush. According to the median forecasts in the poll, the crown will not weaken beyond 26.45 or firm past 25.85 against the euro until the end of September. A month ago, the projected range was at weaker levels, at 27-26.2.  If the CNB does not deliver the rate hike in Q3, the Czech crown may correct (weaken) a bit, but I believe that any such correction would be temporary,  said Radomir Jac, chief economist of Generali Investments CEE.

Banks, insurers and asset managers based in Britain are already making contingency plans to shift some operations to continental Europe after Brexit takes effect in case access to the EU single market is closed off. But Bailey said Britain and the EU are in a position to preserve free trade for financial services, meaning such moves need not happen.   Firms should be able to take their own decisions on where they locate, subject to appropriate regulatory arrangements being in place which preserve the public interest,  Bailey said, in his first major speech on Brexit since Britain triggered the formal EU divorce proceedings in March.   Authorities should not dictate the location of firms,  he told an audience in Canary Wharf, home to some of the world's biggest banks. Future financial sector relations between Britain and the EU should be based on  mutual recognition  or regulatory cooperation  but not exact mirroring  of rules, Bailey said.   Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Dublin are all vying for a slice of Britain's financial services industry after Brexit. Bailey said such competition was good. But he also said Brexit should not be used as an excuse to restrict the ability to have open markets and freedom of location.  The roots exist to come out with sensible outcomes on this.  Some companies have already announced plans to move people to continental European locations to retain access to the EU single market. Bailey said a transition period based on current trading arrangements was needed this year. This would avoid a  regrettable  situation whereby firms had to  press the button  on moves to the EU before they know what the outcome of Britain's negotiations with the bloc will be.  It needs to be a sensible period,  Bailey said. Bailey questioned whether restricting trade in this way was an inevitable or necessary response to Brexit.  When I hear people say firms need to re-locate in order to continue to benefit from access to EU financial markets, I start to seriously wonder.  No Location Policies France and other EU countries, for example, want the clearing of euro denominated derivatives, which London dominates,  located  within the EU after Brexit. Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, speaks during a  Reuters Newsmaker  interview at the Reuters offices in London, Britain, July 6, 2017.Hannah McKay It does not require a location policy,  Bailey said. Joint oversight with the EU of clearing houses in London is  something that is very clearly preferable to the cost and risk that is introduced by a location based policy.  Such joint oversight was already working well between the UK and United States regulators in clearing, he said. He dismissed talk in the EU that given the dominance of Britain's financial services sector, the largest in Europe, there should be specific rules for the UK, rather than the existing general regime for recognizing non-EU financial firms.  I do not accept that,  Bailey said. Non-EU financial firms from the United States, Singapore and elsewhere can currently offer their services in the EU if their home regulation is deemed by Brussels to be  equivalent  or as tough as the bloc's own rules. Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, poses for a photo as he arrives at the Reuters offices for an interview in London, Britain, July 6, 2017.Hannah McKayThis regime should be applied to Britain in the same way.  It would not be the best outcome to adopt a special treatment for the oversight of outsourced service provision arrangements involving the UK and EU when there are already arrangements in place which can form the basis of an equivalence arrangement,  Bailey said. No Race to the Bottom Britain was not interested in a  race to the bottom  in regulation after Brexit, he said. Britain has worked hard over the years to build up relations with EU and national regulators across the bloc, he said, though he conceded that he was already being locked out of EU regulatory discussions about Brexit.  It's perfectly reasonable ... It does not concern me.  There are already fears that asset managers in Britain will be prevented from managing funds based in the EU after Brexit, but Bailey said this longstanding cross-border  delegation  should continue.  It works well today. There is no reason to disrupt that model,  Bailey said. Critics of Brexit have said that Britain will end up being a  rule taker , meaning it will have to copy and paste the bloc's rules into UK law if it wants to maintain access in financial services.  I don't want to be in a situation where we become a pure rule taker,  Bailey said.

Faltering appetite in a country where gold is used in everything from investment to wedding gifts could drag further on global prices, already trading near their lowest level in eight weeks.  In the short-term at least, we believe (the tax) may pose challenges for the industry. Small-scale artisans and retailers with varying degrees of tax compliance may struggle to adapt,  the WGC said in a report published on Thursday. As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on gold has jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously. There have been fears the tax increase could stoke under-the-counter buying and drive up appetite for precious metal smuggled into India, where millions of people store chunks of their wealth in bullion and jewellery. Meanwhile, the WGC also said a government move to ban cash transactions over 200,000 rupees ($3,090) from April 1 could hurt gold demand in rural areas where farmers often purchase the metal using cash due to limited access to cheques and electronic payment systems. Two-thirds of India's gold demand comes from rural areas, where jewellery is a traditional store of wealth.  (The transactions rule's) potential impact isn't entirely clear: it could curb gold purchases; it could encourage gold shoppers to buy smaller amounts of gold spread over more transactions; or it could push a large part of demand underground and encourage a black market in gold,  said the WGC. The group kept its demand estimate for India at 650 to 750 tonnes for 2017, well below average annual demand of 846 tonnes in the past five years. In the long-term, the GST will have a positive effect on the gold industry by making the sector more transparent and improving the supply chain, the WGC added.

A stand-off on a plateau next to the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim, which borders China, has ratcheted up tension between the neighboring giants, who share a 3,500 km (2,175 miles) frontier, large parts of which are disputed. According to the Chinese interpretation of events, Indian guards crossed into China's Donglang region early in June and obstructed work on a road on the plateau. Troops from the two sides then confronted each other close to a valley controlled by China that separates India from Bhutan - a close Indian ally - and gives China access to the so-called Chicken's Neck, a thin strip of land that connects India to its remote northeastern regions. India has said it had warned China that construction of the road near their common border would have serious security implications. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking at a daily news briefing, again urged India to withdraw its personnel to the Indian side  to avoid there being an even more serious situation creating even more serious consequences . Geng said China did not understand what reason India had for believing the road was a security risk, and that China had every right to build roads in its own territory. It was  ridiculous  for India to cross the border on the pretext of concern over the road, he added.  Over the past few years it's actually been India that has in the Sikkim sector of the China-India border who has been building a great number of facilities and deploying a large number of forces,  Geng said. In some areas they have been building military facilities including fortifications, he added.  I don't know whether India has considered China's security concerns while doing these things.

ExxonMobil(XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen not to take sides after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. Here are some facts about international oil companies which operate in the Gulf countries involved in the rift:     Exxonmobil ** Qatar The U.S. oil major's relationship with Qatar goes back to 1935 when it was known as Socony-Vacuum, and later Mobil.  It helped to develop the North Field, the world's biggest gas field, and supplied Qatar with technology to make it the top competitor in the LNG market.  Qatar's LNG production is divided between two companies, Qatargas and Rasgas. State oil company Qatar Petroleum (QP) owns a majority stake in both. RasGas is 70 percent-owned by QP and 30 percent-owned by ExxonMobil, while Qatargas is owned by a consortium including QP, ExxonMobil, Total, Mitsui (8031.T), Marubeni (8002.T), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Royal Dutch Shell. ExxonMobil is also the only foreign participant in two domestic gas projects, Al-Khaleej Gas and Barzan Gas. ** Saudi Arabia ExxonMobil is one of the largest foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, with more than 3,000 Saudi nationals working in the joint ventures in which the U.S. oil major participates. These range from petrochemicals manufacturing to petroleum refining. The company began working with Saudi Arabia in 1927 and owned a stake in the state oil giant Saudi Aramco before it was fully nationalized in the 1980s.  ExxonMobil has been a partner with Aramco in several major projects over the years including building the East-West Pipeline (Petroline) linking the Eastern Province fields with Yanbu on the Red Sea and the SAMREF refinery in Yanbu, which is equally-owned by Aramco and a subsidiary of Exxon. It is also a partner with SABIC in two petrochemical joint ventures - Saudi Yanbu Petrochemical Company (YANPET), and Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company (KEMYA). ** The UAE ExxonMobil was awarded the first oil concession in Abu Dhabi, now the capital of the UAE, in 1939.  Exxon is now developing the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield through a joint venture, Zakum Development Company (ZADCO), with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. ADNOC  has a 60 percent stake, while Exxon owns 28 percent and Japan's Jodco 12 percent. The U.S. company also markets lubricants and petrochemicals for the Middle East and North Africa region out of its office in Dubai. Total ** Qatar The French oil major has been working with Qatar since 1936 through cooperation with Qatar Petroleum in developing LNG, refining and petrochemicals projects.  Total is one of the main partners of Qatargas, the world's largest LNG producer, owning stakes in Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2. It is a main shareholder in the Dolphin Energy pipeline which transfers natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.  A Shell logo is seen reflected in a car's side mirror at a petrol station in west London, Britain, January 29, 2015.Toby Melville/File PhotoIt has joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum to develop the Al-Khalij and Al-Shaheen oil fields. Total Refining & Petrochemicals has stakes in both Qatar Petrochemicals Company (QAPCO), operating a petrochemical complex manufacturing ethylene and low-density polyethylene, and QATOFIN. Total is a partner in the Ras Laffan refinery and also sells lubricants. ** Saudi Arabia Total has been present in Saudi Arabia for almost 40 years and is a main player in the downstream sector. The French company has a 51 percent stake in the Saudi Total Petroleum Products joint venture, which manufactures and retails lubricants and specialty products. It owns a 37.5 percent stake in the SATORP joint venture - a 400,000 barrels per day refining and petrochemicals complex in Jubail - with Saudi Aramco owning the remaining 62.5 percent. ** The UAE Since 1939, Total has been working with the majority of Abu Dhabi's oil and gas operating companies and other energy firms: ADCO, ADMA-OPCO, ADGAS, GASCO, FERTIL, Taweelah A1, Shams 1 and Dolphin Energy.  It has a 10 percent stake in a 40-year onshore concession to help develop Abu Dhabi's biggest oilfields. ** Iran Workers fix a sign for oil giant Total at a petrol station in Cairo, Egypt, October 13, 2016. Picture taken October 13, 2016.Amr Abdallah DalshTotal signed a 20-year contract with Iran this week to develop the giant South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar. The deal is the first major Western energy investment since sanctions against Tehran were lifted.  Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake in  South Pars. The first stage will cost around $2 billion. Shell ** Qatar Shell said it is the biggest international investor in Qatar, surpassing Exxon. It is in partnership with Qatar Petroleum in projects covering LNG production, gas to liquids (GTL), shipping, exploration and petrochemicals. One of Shell's main investments in Qatar is Pearl Gas-to-Liquids in Ras Laffan, the largest GTL plant in the world. The company also own a 30 percent stake in Qatargas 4, an integrated LNG production facility together with Qatar Petroleum, and is the shipping and maritime services provider for QatarGas Transport Company (Nakilat).  ** Saudi Arabia Shell has a diverse business with Saudi Arabia. It has a  stake in SASREF, a 50:50 joint venture refinery at Jubail with a crude oil refining capacity of 305,000 bpd, and a partnership with SABIC through its SADAF joint venture. It also has a joint venture that markets and sells Shell lubricants, and another that handles aviation re-fueling operations in the kingdom.  ** The UAE Shell currently does not own a direct stake in UAE's oil or gas fields as talks with ADNOC to renew its 40-year oil concession stalled. However, the company has its regional headquarters in Dubai, through which it manages its businesses in the Middle East.  ** Other foreign companies such as Occidental (OXY.N) have operations in both Qatar and the UAE, while ConocoPhillips also owns interests in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  ** Trading houses including the world's biggest names such as Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore also have business interests with all the countries locked in the political crisis. ** Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea and Japan are major buyers of crude, condensate and LNG from the Middle East producers. ** Sources: Companies' websites, Reuters Reporting by Rania El Gamal; editing by David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-energy-factbox-idUSKBN19Q2HH"},

The chief executives of ExxonMobil(XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) all met the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in Qatar before it announced a plan on Tuesday to raise output of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 30 percent. Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years. The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM] Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk.  There is only one policy here – you have to behave like a commercial corporation,  the executive told Reuters.  You have to make your choices purely economically and be Qatari in Qatar, Emirati in the Emirates.  Energy sales have powered Qatar's rapid rise as a regional  player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors' interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbors. Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks. Qatar, the world's largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher. Related CoverageFactbox: Oil majors' investments in countries involved in Qatar rowWillingness to Invest The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha's response to their grievances had been negative. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said.  Doha denies aiding terrorism and its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused the four of  clear aggression  while adding that Qatar continued to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. [nL8N1JW27A] [nL8N1JW1Y1] Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible.     Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing  cooperation  with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency.   Industry sources close to the talks said that  the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest . Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar's LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year.     Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie. Shell's Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world's largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019. Shell's operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio. The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said. Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran's South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar's North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4]     Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company's plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source. Qatar's LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimizing existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as  debottlenecking , according to a senior industry source. Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer.   Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there,  Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said.      Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals.

The action coincided with Trump's arrival in Warsaw and Greenpeace said it did not include a gathering of protesters. The authorities said they did not expect any major protests against Trump on Thursday, though there were some small-scale demonstrations planned by a marginal opposition party.  Trump announced in May that he would pull the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, a global accord on fighting climate change. The move drew criticism from governments and climate change activists around the world. Poland opposed European Union's climate policy to reduce  carbon emissions but supported the Paris deal as it did not imposed specific obligations on signatories. The White House has said Trump will hold a speech underlining his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He will also meet with EU countries closest to Russia before heading to the G20 summit in Germany which begins on Friday. Climate issues are not expected to be discussed during Trump's visit in Warsaw, but will be a key topic at the summit of the Group of 20 leading economies.

The pay-TV unit, Premium, has struggled to make a return on its large investments in Champions League and Italian Serie A soccer matches, and has been losing market share to its major competitor, Sky. It now wants to move to a strategy that relies less on such expensive, premium sporting content. Milan-based Mediaset, controlled by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, agreed to sell Premium to France's Vivendi last year but the deal collapsed, prompting the rethink of Premium's strategy.  The falling trend for sales will continue. We got rid of (channels) for children making us lose subscribers and revenues, but margins are growing,  Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani said at a presentation of Mediaset's new programming schedule. Premium loses its TV rights to broadcast Champions League matches in Italy from the second half of 2018. From then, the rights switch to Sky, which last month won the rights for three seasons starting from the 2018-2019 season. Premium, which counts 2 million subscribers, is expected to contribute almost half of Mediaset's ambitious target of a 468 million euro improvement in operating profit by 2020. At the presentation, Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi said he was open to selling Premium's final season of Champions League matches, for 2017-18, to Sky.  We must ask them. There are no ongoing talks. But if they make an offer,  Berlusconi said, without finishing his sentence.  With soccer you always lose. If you don't buy it, you lose subscribers; if you do, you lose money for the investment you have to make,  he added. Mediaset paid just under 700 million euros ($794 million) in 2014 for its Champions League rights, but it failed to add enough customers to offset the money spent. Despite its troubles with Premium, Pier Silvio Berlusconi confirmed Mediaset was on track with its business plan and that it would return to profit this year. Mediaset last declared a dividend in its 2015 accounts.  We are satisfied with what we will be able to do but it is too early to say whether we will be able to pay a dividend,  he said, adding the group's advertising sales were up 2 percent in the first six months of the year.

Pyongyang's first test on Tuesday of an ICBM with a potential to strike the state of Alaska has raised the question: How capable is the U.S. military of knocking down an incoming missile or barrage of missiles? Briefing reporters on Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said:  We do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there.  Davis cited a successful test in May in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM. But he acknowledged the test program's track program was not perfect.  It's something we have mixed results on. But we also have an ability to shoot more than one interceptor,  Davis said. An internal memo seen by Reuters also showed that the Pentagon upgraded its assessment of U.S. defenses after the May test. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on a multi-layered missile defense system, the United States may not be able to seal itself off entirely from a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile attack. Experts caution that U.S. missile defenses are now geared to shooting down one, or perhaps a small number of basic, incoming missiles. Were North Korea's technology and production to keep advancing, U.S. defenses could be overwhelmed unless they keep pace with the threat.  Over the next four years, the United States has to increase its current capacity of our deployed systems, aggressively push for more and faster deployment,  said Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. Mixed Results The test records of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), charged with the mission to develop, test and field a ballistic missile defense system, also show mixed results. MDA systems have multiple layers and ranges and use sensors in space at sea and on land that altogether form a defense for different U.S. regions and territories. One component, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD), demonstrated a success rate just above 55 percent. A second component, the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships and on land, had about an 83 percent success rate, according to the agency. A third, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, has a 100 percent success rate in 13 tests conducted since 2006, according to the MDA. Lockheed Martin Corp is the prime contractor for THAAD and Aegis. Boeing Co is the lead contractor for GMD. Since President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s, the U.S. government has spent more than $200 billion to develop and field a range of ballistic missile defense systems ranging from satellite detection to the sea-based Aegis system, according to the Congressional Research Service. Funding for MDA was on average $8.12 billion during President Barack Obama's administration that ended on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump has requested $7.8 billion for fiscal year 2018. 'Another Year or Two' Last month, Vice Admiral James Syring, then director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a congressional panel that North Korean advancements in the past six months had caused him great concern. U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North said the pace of North Korea's missile development was quicker than expected.  However, it will probably require another year or two of development before this missile can reliably and accurately hit high-value continental U.S. targets, particularly if fired under wartime conditions,  he said. Michael Elleman, a fellow for Missile Defence at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that although North Korea was several steps from creating a dependable ICBM,  There are absolutely no guarantees  the United States can protect itself. In missile defense,  Even if it had a test record of 100 percent, there are no guarantees.

The Scottsdale, Arizona company is launching  Fender Play,  an online system for learning guitar that Chief Executive Officer Andy Mooney, a veteran of Nike and Disney, hopes will cut down on the number of would-be guitarists who give up. He said 45 percent of the company's guitars sell to  first-time players, but 90 percent abandon the instrument within a year and never become repeat customers.  The 10 percent who make it through the first year own an average of seven guitars,  Mooney said in an interview.  When we gathered the data and looked at the facts, we said, 'Oh my God, if we just reduced the abandonment rate by even 10 percent, we could perhaps double the size of the industry.'  The musical instrument industry grew 9 percent to $7.1 billion in retail sales over the past five years but remains well below its 2005 peak of $7.7 billion, according to data from The Music Trades magazine. Moreover, the electric guitar was virtually absent from the Top 20 music charts in the past five years. The guitar industry hoped video games like  Guitar Hero  would ignite interest among teenagers. Instead, electric guitar sales fell from 1.2 million units in 2011 to just over 1 million in 2016, according to The Music Trades. The overall guitar market held steady at around 2.5 million units per year during that period, thanks to growth from acoustic instruments. A young man uses Fender Play, a new subscription-based digital learning program from Fender for desktop and iPhone with instructor-guided video lessons as seen in this undated photo received by Reuters July 5, 2017. Fender/Handout via REUTERSFender Play aims to address some key trends, Mooney said. About half of first-time buyers are women, according to Fender's research, and they are buying acoustic guitars online and going to sites like YouTube for lessons. For those new players, he said, traditional music stores can be intimidating. A young man uses Fender Play, a new digital learning tool from Fender that uses a song-based approach that helps new players master chords and riffs as seen in this undated photo received by Reuters July 5, 2017. Fender/Handout via REUTERSAfter a free introduction, Fender Play costs $19.99 a month and consists of a series of video lessons that assume no prior knowledge. Mooney said his model was Lynda.com, the online learning platform acquired by LinkedIn for $1.5 billion that defied expectations it could not compete with free videos on the internet. Next year, Fender will make an instructor edition available to dealers so they can use it to manage their guitar students. Fender will compete with other fee-based sites like JamPlay, but is the first guitar maker to dive into the online learning market. Brian Majeski, editor of The Music Trades, said including dealers should help Fender avoid the impression that it competes with stores for guitar students. He called the software initiative a credible strategy to try to spur growth.  All the pieces are there,  Majeski said.  But this is uncharted territory.

The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry's (SACCI) monthly business confidence index (BCI) ticked up to 94.9 in June from 93.2 in May. Business activity and perceptions in June were soothed by an improved exchange rate, with the rand advancing more than 2.5 percent in the month as the currency reaped the benefits of a worldwide search for higher yields.  The main contribution to the monthly improvement to the BCI in June was made by higher merchandise import and export volumes, the improved rand exchange rate,  SACCI said in a statement. The rand has since surrendered those gains, dipping back near seven-week lows on Wednesday as proposals by the ruling party to nationalise the central bank and expropriate land raised fears of more anti-market policies. Confidence has been subdued by political uncertainty following the axing of the finance minister in March and a subsequent double credit downgrade to sub-investment grade, while the economy slipped into technical recession.  When an economy that is in a recession gets the label of junk status, the stance of the economy becomes even more complicated,  SACCI said.  If structural economic deficiencies become part of the assessment, the challenges for recuperation become more multifaceted.

Roy Cimatu said on Thursday that the power of issuing such permits is no longer limited to the environment minister, giving back the authority to officials of the Environmental Management Bureau, an agency under him. It was the first policy step by Cimatu who assumed office on May 8, days after Regina Lopez was dismissed after leading a 10-month mining crackdown in the world's top source of nickel ore. Lopez previously had the sole authority to approve an environmental clearance certificate (ECC).  In the interest of service and in order to expedite the issuance of the ECC in regional level consistent with the directive of the President to fast track issuance of government permits and licenses , Cimatu said he had indefinitely suspended Lopez's previous order signed in February. Cimatu, a former soldier, said this was consistent with President Rodrigo Duterte's directive to cut bureaucratic red tape. Lopez, a staunch environmentalist who ordered the closure and suspension of more than half of the country's mines, earlier ordered a review of all ECCs including those granted to mining projects in her bid to stop environmental destruction by the sector. She later canceled the ECCs of some nickel projects which effectively stalled them. In what was seen as a sign that Lopez' drastic measures could be challenged, a senior mines bureau official last week said her other move to ban open-pit mining had  no legal basis  and was under review. Cimatu told Reuters in May shortly after assuming his post that it was possible to strike a balance between mining and protecting natural resources. Last week Cimatu said he might decide later this month on the fate of dozens of mining operations and contracts that Lopez ordered closed, suspended or canceled.

Primark's performance confounds fears that a squeeze in British consumers' spending power could dent demand. AB Foods, which also has major sugar, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, said Primark's better than expected third quarter performance meant the group's outlook for the year to mid-September 2017 had  marginally improved . The statement sent its shares as much as 6 percent higher, making it the FTSE 100 index's biggest riser. Primark's total sales increased 15 percent at constant exchange rates in the 16 weeks to June 24, its fiscal third quarter, and were up 21 percent at actual exchange rates. Finance Director John Bason said Primark's overall like-for-like sales were positive in the quarter, having been flat in the first half.  The UK is very strong. It's not a bit of an improvement, it’s a big improvement,  he told Reuters, though he declined to give a specific figure.  It's a combination of factors but first and foremost the product and particularly the stores are looking great at the moment,  he said, noting the contribution of a later Easter holiday this year and better weather. Analysts at Credit Suisse, AB Foods' house broker, estimated UK like-for-like sales growth at 6 percent, versus 2 percent in the first half. The UK accounts for about half of Primark's business. Tough Conditions British consumers have been hit by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since Britain's vote to leave the European Union, and by a slowdown in wages growth. The housing market is also cooling. Marks & Spencer and Next, Britain's two biggest clothing retailers, have both said they are suffering from a broad slowdown in spending on clothing and footwear that dates back to late 2015. Primark, which is at the budget end of the clothing market, has said it has not raised prices to offset the impact of the weaker pound.  I have said over the years that Primark has grown in tougher economic times as well as good economic times,  said Bason.  Primark has maintained its price discipline and I think we've certainly gained from that,  he added. AB Foods said it now expected Primark's full-year operating profit margin to be in line with the first half's 10 percent, having previously forecast a decline. Credit Suisse raised its 2016-17 EPS estimate for the group by 1 percent to 122 pence, up from 106.2 pence in 2015-16, noting the strong trading at Primark UK was offset in part by pressure on grocery margins. AB Foods said third quarter group revenue growth was 13 percent at constant currency and 20 percent at actual exchange rates. Shares in the group, majority owned by the family of Chief Executive George Weston, were up 126 pence at 3,049 pence at 0910 GMT, valuing the business at 24 billion pounds.

And it did. The crowd warmed to the dreadlocked German though, especially those pining for the days when grasscourt tennis really was grasscourt tennis and volleying was revered. These days serve and volleyers are regarded as novelty attractions in a sport dominated by players more than happy to win back at the baseline. Take a peak at the wear pattern on Wimbledon's lawns this week and the baselines are straw-colored and dusty. It's a far cry from the days when net-rushing turf warriors like John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Pete Sampras left the baselines alone and chewed up the zone around the service boxes. There are still players prepared to gamble though -- which is how Germany's Mischa Zverev describes his serve and volley game that bamboozled Murray at this year's Australian Open.  It's like flipping a coin 200 times a day and then hopefully you win the majority of those coin tosses,  the German 27th seed, who plays Mikhail Kukushkin on Thursday, says.  You need to be ready mentally to (play serve and volley) for months and months at a time. Maybe lose 6-2 6-2, get passed 75 times, and still be okay the next time you do it.  There are multiple reasons, it appears, that only a handful of players -- Zverev, giant Croatian Ivo Karlovic, Luxembourg left-hander Gilles Muller, Queen's Club champion Feliciano Lopez and Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky -- are serve and volleying. In 2002, when critics decried the shortness of the rallies, Wimbledon switched to a harder-wearing rye grass. The result was less skid, and higher more trustworthy bounce -- giving baseliners crucial extra time to line up their passing shots. Slower balls, enhanced strings -- offering more spin and control -- and the fact that modern groundstrokes have become so deadly are also contributory factors. When Lleyton Hewitt, essentially a baseliner, won the Wimbledon title in 2002, serve-and-volley made up 33 percent of total points in the men's draw. Now it is in single digits. Yet when utilized the success rate is high. Muller followed his serve in a relatively modest 32 times during a five-set marathon against Czech Lukas Rosol on Wednesday but won 81 percent of those points.  You have to mix it up, you can't give these guys too many targets,  Muller, who was bumped up to 16th seed from a ranking of 26 because of his grasscourt acumen, told Reuters.  But I use it a couple of times a game, maybe more. Back in 2001 when I was reached the junior final the courts were really fast. The bounce is still low, but it's slow too.  That makes it harder.  Stakhovsky, who in 2013 famously beat Wimbledon king Roger Federer playing old-school serve and volley tennis, said the tactic can cause shocks every now and again but the percentages are loaded in favor of those who stay back.  Dustin is one of the few that come in all the time but it's an unacceptable level of risk,  the Ukrainian told Reuters after losing to Japan's Kei Nishikori.  You won't get away with it. The pace of the courts are slow. It used to be a wide serve and volley into the corner, point done. Now a deep volley is not dangerous any more and you can become a sitting duck.   I understand the spectators want to see longer rallies, not just 180 serves in a match, but somewhere along the lines it just went too much towards the extremes.  There is hope though for lovers of the volleying arts. Ultimate baseline warrior Rafa Nadal played some sublime serve and volley points against Donald Young on Wednesday and Federer will employ the tactic.  If I were coaching a young player I would teach them to serve and volley,  34-year-old Muller said.  95 percent of the top 100 are not doing it so that means they never practise to prepare for a serve and volleyer coming at them. If you mix it up and throw in some serve and volley it makes the returner take more risks.

The deal is the largest ever for the photocopier maker, which has been seeking to diversify away its office equipment business. It pulled out of cameras about a decade ago. Konica Minolta said its advanced imaging technology complemented privately held Ambry's genetic testing capabilities, with initial applications for combining the technologies seen in diagnosing hereditary cancer.  Together with Ambry, we will have the most comprehensive set of diagnostic technologies for mapping an individual's genetic and biochemical makeup,  Chief Executive Shoei Yamana said in a statement. In a transaction that will be partially funded by a Japanese state-backed fund, Konica Minolta said $800 million would paid in cash upon closure of the deal while $200 million could be paid over two years depending on financial performance. Konica Minolta, which has a market value of around $4 billion, will account for 60 percent of the investment, with the fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) accounting for the remaining 40 percent. INCJ, which was set up to help struggling Japanese companies, said it wanted to support the growth of the nation's medical industry.

Japan defies international protests to carry out what it calls scientific research whaling, having repeatedly said its ultimate goal is to whale commercially again. In the 2016-2017 season, its fleet took 333 minke whales in the Antarctic. The new law, passed in June, will help enshrine as a  national responsibility  an activity that was previously just a tacit policy, said Shigeki Takaya, director of the Whaling Affairs Office at Japan's Fisheries Agency.  While the government has given its support to the implementation of scientific research into whales, it is heartening to see that the law clarifies its position even further,  Takaya told a news conference. In 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan should halt Antarctic whaling. Japan suspended its hunt for one season, to re-tool its whaling program with measures such as cutting the number of whales and species targeted, but resumed hunting in the 2015-2016 season. Japan has long maintained that most whale species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its culture. It began scientific whaling in 1987, a year after an international whaling moratorium began. The meat ends up on store shelves, even though most Japanese no longer eat it.   This resource exists,  said Kiyoshi Ejima, a member of the upper house of parliament from Shimonoseki, a whaling port in western Japan that forms part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's electoral district.  There are minke whales down in the Antarctic that are of body weight of about 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb) to 10,000 kg (22,000 lb),  added Ejima, one of the lawmakers behind the bill.  These are a great source of food and my position is that we should harness this.  But activist Nanami Kurasawa, from the Dolphin and Whale Action Network, said the law, which sped through parliament in barely a week, was enacted without sufficient debate or attention and actually proves that whaling is unsustainable.  It's clear that this industry cannot stand on its own two feet without government subsidy,  she told the news conference.

Merck KGaA was accused of failing to provide information about an innovation project for chemicals during the merger review of its Sigma-Aldrich takeover which was approved in June 2015. GE was charged with providing misleading research and development information related to its takeover of LM Wind earlier this year. The EU competition enforcer said Canon jumped the gun via a complex move and acquired Toshiba Medical Systems Corp prior to securing regulatory approval. The deal was approved in September 2016.

The melee, which injured seven opposition politicians, was another worrying flashpoint in a traumatic last three months for the South American OPEC nation, shaken by opposition protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro. At least 90 people have died in the unrest, with fighting and barricades frequently blocking cities across Venezuela. National Assembly president Julio Borges said more than 350 politicians, journalists and guests to the Independence Day session were trapped in the siege that lasted until dusk.    There are bullets, cars destroyed including mine, blood stains around the (congress) palace,  he told reporters.  The violence in Venezuela has a name and surname: Nicolas Maduro.  The crowd had gathered just after dawn outside the building in downtown Caracas, chanting in favor of Maduro, witnesses said. In the late morning, several dozen people ran past the gates with pipes, sticks and stones and went on the attack. Several injured lawmakers stumbled bloodied and dazed around the assembly's corridors. Some journalists were robbed. After the morning attack, a crowd of roughly 100 people, many dressed in red and shouting  Long Live The Revolution! , trapped people inside for hours, witnesses said.  Some in the crowd outside the legislature brandished pistols, threatened to cut water and power supplies, and played an audio of former socialist president Hugo Chavez saying  Tremble, oligarchy!  Fireworks were thrown inside. The worst-hurt lawmaker, Americo De Grazia, was hit on the head, fell unconscious, and was eventually taken by stretcher to an ambulance. His family later said he was out of critical condition and being stitched up. Related CoverageVenezuela Assembly siege ending: witnessesDowntown Caracas is a traditional stronghold neighborhood for the government and there has been a string of clashes there since the opposition thrashed the ruling Socialist Party in December 2015 parliamentary elections. In a speech during a military parade for Independence Day, Maduro condemned the  strange  violence in the assembly and asked for an investigation. But he also challenged the opposition to speak out about violence from within its ranks. In daily protests since April, young demonstrators have frequently attacked security forces with stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails, and burned property. They killed one man by dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire.  I want peace for Venezuela,  Maduro said.  I don't accept violence from anyone.  Foreign Condemnation Opposition lawmaker Luis Stefanelli (L) gestures next to fellow opposition lawmaker Leonardo Regnault (C) and a worker of the assembly after both were injured when a group of government supporters burst into Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly, in Caracas, Venezuela July 5, 2017.Andres Martinez CasaresNumerous foreign nations repudiated Wednesday's events.   I condemn the grotesque attack on the Venezuelan assembly,  tweeted UK ambassador John Saville.   This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela's independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela's independence 206 years ago today,  the U.S. State Department said. Venezuela's opposition is demanding general elections to end socialist rule and solutions to the OPEC nation's brutal economic crisis. The government says its foes are seeking a violent coup with U.S. support. Earlier, a Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video vowing to continue fighting. Slideshow (21 Images) Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,  police pilot Oscar Perez said in the video, wearing a military uniform and wool cap, with a Venezuelan flag and rifle behind him. Perez had not been seen since he hijacked a helicopter last week and flew through Caracas pulling a  Freedom  banner. He opened fire and dropped grenades on the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court but nobody was injured.     Maduro, 54, the successor to Hugo Chavez, called that attack a terrorist assault to overthrow him and lambasted Western nations for not condemning it. But many government critics doubt the official version, and some even suggested it may have been staged to divert attention from the country's economic and political crises. In the video, Perez said the attack was  perfectly achieved  with no collateral damage  because it was planned, because we are not murderers like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro.  Perez said he had staged an emergency landing on the Caribbean coast following the attack, and returned to the capital after hiking through mountains. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Perez, who has portrayed himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, also is an actor who starred in a 2015 movie about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman. Although he has claimed wider support within the security forces, Perez's actions so far appear to be a rogue stunt organized by a small group of disaffected policemen. Venezuela's opposition says Maduro is seeking to consolidate control through a Constituent Assembly, a superbody that will be elected at the end of July. The opposition has promised to boycott the vote, which it says is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party. Before the attack on them, opposition lawmakers held a session denouncing the president as a  dictator  and approving a plebiscite that the opposition is organizing for July 16, asking Venezuelans what they think of Maduro's plans.

There was also caution ahead of the publication later in the day of the minutes from the European Central Bank's last policy meeting. Should these be more hawkish than expected, they could weigh on Central European assets.     The zloty led the slight rise, firming 0.2 percent to 4.234 against the euro by 0819 GMT, regaining the ground shed in the previous session as the central bank retained its loose policy stance.     Poland's central bank, reporting after its latest policy meeting, said inflation remained moderate, but some analysts pointed to increasing divisions within the Monetary Policy Council over inflation risks and the impact of negative real interest rates on savings.     The bank's communication on these matters is  contradictory , said Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto in a note.      This means the minutes (of the bank's meetings) will be more important going forward.      Montalto said he believed a rate hike in mid-2018 remained likely.     Danske Bank said in a note that the bank was too relaxed about a likely rise in inflation next year, and that it could still prompt rate hike discussions later this year.     Stronger rate hike expectations could support the zloty.        A tapering of monetary stimulus in the euro zone by the ECB could hit demand in the European Union's eastern markets, and the prospect of higher yields in the West would make the region's government debt relatively less attractive.     Bonds on offer at Hungary's auctions on Thursday are expected to be bought up, though demand could be weaker than at earlier auctions, and yields could rise a bit, with German yields also rising, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.      Germany's 10-year bond yield is again banging on the 0.5 percent level, and a break above it could also mean a rise in our bond yields,  the trader said.      Romania could sell 10-year bonds at an average yield of 4 percent, a tick up from Wednesday's closing bid of 3.99 percent, Bucharest-based ING said in a note.     The sale could draw decent demand as Romanian markets are recovering from the past two weeks' jitters, helped by speculation in the local media that the government could water down a new plan to overhaul corporate taxes.     Budapest led a rise in regional equities prices, with the stocks of OTP Bank reaching a 10-year peak.     The shares of road haulage firm Waberer's rose 1.1 percent as they launched Budapest bourse.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. The hospital, in the northeastern city of Shenyang, made the decision at the request of the family and in consultation with the doctors already treating him, the Shenyang Bureau of Justice said in a short statement on its website. It provided no other details. Officials who picked up the telephone at the hospital said they were unaware of the case. A German government spokesman confirmed that a German doctor was part of the team treating Liu and that Berlin was in close contact with the Chinese government on the issue.  The Chinese government told us yesterday about their willingness to allow treatment for Mr Liu including access to foreign doctors, including a German specialist,  government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.  We very much welcome this and are still pushing for a humanitarian solution,  Seibert said. A source close to Liu's family said the invitation was a positive step that greatly increased transparency around Liu's illness and the chance that he would receive the best possible treatment available.  The fact that they specially chose the U.S. and Germany suggests that the authorities are considering allowing Liu to travel to one of these two countries,  the source said, although there were still questions about how the doctors would be chosen and what access they would have. Asked if the move would lead to Liu leaving the country, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing:  We hope other countries can respect China's judicial sovereignty and not meddle in China's internal affairs.  Time  Running Out  FILE PHOTO: A protester holds a portrait of Chinese Nobel rights activist Liu Xiaobo as she step on portraits of Chinese President Xi Jinping during a candlelight vigil demanding the release of Liu, ahead of 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China June 29, 2017.Tyrone Siu/File PhotoRights group Amnesty International said the move appeared in part  an attempt to limit international criticism  even as the government continued to refuse to allow Liu to be treated   overseas.  Time is running out for Liu Xiaobo,  said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's secretary general.  It is not too late for the authorities to end this cruel farce. They must let Liu Xiaobo and his wife, Liu Xia, travel abroad to get the medical treatment he so desperately needs.   The U.S. embassy in Beijing declined to comment. Newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said last week the United States would like to see Liu treated elsewhere for his cancer. FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoThe move comes ahead of President Xi Jinping's attendance at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday and Saturday, where Xi will seek to project Chinese leadership on issues such as climate change and free trade.Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China has been nervous the issue over the Nobel Peace Prize winner could overshadow Xi's appearance. An open letter by a coalition of rights groups, including those representing Tibetans and Uighurs, on Wednesday urged G20 leaders to press China for the unconditional release of Liu and his freedom to travel.  Liu Xiaobo's 2010 Nobel Peace Prize illuminated the human and political rights of the people under China's rule, and created a real sense of hope,  the coalition said.  We urge you not to let that sense of hope fade.    The government has said Liu is getting the best care possible and is being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. However, a growing number of Western politicians and international rights activists have expressed concern about the quality of Liu's treatment and say he should be given the choice to leave China if that was the best option. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has met Chinese officials regarding Liu, a spokeswomen said on Tuesday. Chinese authorities told diplomats from Germany, the United States and the European Union on Friday that Liu could not be moved abroad due to his condition, sources briefed on the matter have told Reuters.

But that isn't happening this time. Asia-based traders are holding back from delivering to LME warehouses because they expect the premium to rise further, tin industry sources said. That has intensified the problem of tumbling stocks of tin in LME warehouses, which at below 1,700 tonnes are at their lowest since 1989 and less than one percent of annual global demand which is estimated at around 350,000 tonnes this year. Also exacerbating nearby shortages is one company holding between 50 and 79 percent of cash contracts and warrant holdings. <0#LME-WHL> The premium or backwardation for cash tin over the three-month MSN0-3 flared out this week to $315 a tonne, its highest since Sept 2015.  The backwardation isn't incentivising replenishment by off-warrant stock holders,  a tin producer said.  They are waiting to see higher levels.  Supplies are expected to rise because China, the world's largest producer and consumer of the soldering metal, at the start of this year abolished a 10 percent tax on refined tin exports.  Filling the void is going to take time, it won't happen immediately,  a London-based tin trader said. Expectations for rising global supplies were reinforced after Yunnan Tin Co Ltd, the world's biggest tin producing company, said last month it had received government approval for so-called  processing trade , churning out refined metal for export using imported concentrate. Yunnan Tin is the world's biggest producer of refined tin, with some 76,000 tonnes of output last year. But analysts still expect supplies to fall short of consumption, which is expected to be boosted by semiconductor firms, which account for nearly half of global tin demand. Industry body World Semiconductor Trade Statistics expects the semiconductor market to grow by more than 10 percent to $388 billion by 2018.

Singaporeans have been riveted since mid-June by a public battle between the heirs of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's long-serving first prime minister, over whether to demolish the old family home or let the government decide whether it should become a heritage site. Lee Kuan Yew's daughter, Lee Wei Ling, and his youngest son, Lee Hsien Yang, insist that the house should be demolished in accordance with their father's will. Prime Minister Lee has said the government must decide what to do with the property. The siblings had accused their elder brother of abusing his powers, prompting the prime minister to call an extraordinary  special sitting of parliament on Monday and Tuesday to  clear the air  over an issue that some people say has tarnished Singapore's image. The premier said that debate failed to find any substantiated evidence of abuse of power, but he wanted to avoid taking his siblings to court for defamation. Responding in a seven-page statement posted on Facebook, Hsien Yang and Wei Ling described the parliamentary debate as a  whitewash  and said they had more evidence of abuse of power that they would only divulge if there was an independent investigation. However, they also reacted positively to the prime minister saying that he wanted to settle the matter privately. Related CoverageNew map records sites of Australia's colonial massacres We therefore welcome Hsien Loong’s stated desire on 4 July 2017 to manage his disagreement with us in private ... without the involvement of lawyers or government agencies,  they said in the statement. They also repeated allegations of abuse of power in a separate 10-page document titled  Evidence , without making any fresh revelations.  It seems that releasing further evidence on social media at this time will only muddy the facts,  they said, and that there was  much evidence  they had not made public.  We reserve this to show to a truly open and independent investigation, if there ever is one,  they said.  A view of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's Oxley Road residence in Singapore June 14, 2017.Edgar SuQuestioned Will Before his death in 2015, Lee Kuan Yew had made public his desire for the humbly furnished home at 38 Oxley Road, near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum. He stated that in his last will, but the prime minister has said there were  deeply troubling circumstances  over how the document was drawn up. The prime minister's siblings said in their latest Facebook posting that any dispute over the will should be resolved in court if it could not be settled otherwise. Prime Minister Lee has said that, while he personally favored the house being demolished, it was up to the government to decide whether it should become a heritage site. He maintains that his father was aware that the government might make that decision, and was prepared to consider alternatives if the government decided the site should be preserved in any way.  The siblings dispute that account.  Were our father alive today, he would be furious about this situation. His wishes are crystal clear: He wanted to demolish the house because he knew it was the right thing for Singapore,  they said in their latest statement.  He did not want Singaporeans to create a cult around him.  The prime minister has recused himself from a committee looking at options for the house, but his siblings say the committee is made up of subordinates who cannot be impartial.  If Hsien Loong wishes to challenge the will, the correct forum was and is the courts,  they said. Prime Minister Lee was in Germany on Thursday for a meeting of the G20 countries.

The exact number of indigenous deaths since Australia's settlement has long been debated, but the map is the first to detail evidence of more than 150 massacres involving almost every aboriginal clan between 1788 and 1872. That compares with six recorded massacres of colonists during the same period.  At present, it's a preliminary list, as we expect to find more massacres, as people come forward with more evidence,   historian and project author Lyndall Ryan said at the launch of the map on Wednesday. The map, published by the University of Newcastle's Centre for the 21st Century, drew on sources such as settler diaries, newspaper reports, evidence from Aboriginal groups and state and federal archives, Ryan told reporters.  A supplied image of historian and project author, Professor Lyndall Ryan, standing next to a map in Newcastle, Australia July 4, 2017, that details research by the University of Newcastle's Centre for 21st Century of massacres of indigenous Australians by European settlers between the years 1788 and 1872.  University of Newcastle/Handout via REUTERSThe map was an  incredible historical project that will have positive repercussions,  aboriginal leader Warren Mundine told Reuters.  Knowledge is so important because with it you can do things; we can add to the education of our nation and know how we got where we are today.   The project, which now covers only massacres on Australia's eastern seaboard, took four years of painstaking research, with more expected over the next two years as incidents in the country's west are mapped.

The National Social Security Authority (NSSA), with assets of $1.1 billion, is one of the biggest investors on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and has at several times bailed out government with loans. NSSA board chairman Robin Vela said in a statement that the government had paid its $180.9 million arrears dating back to 2013 through treasury bills with a tenure of 10 years.  The increase in contributions is attributable to improved collections arising from stakeholder engagement. This has resulted in more voluntary compliance despite the decline in the number of registered employers,  Vela said. Short of funding from foreign donors since 1999, President Robert Mugabe's government is relying on domestic taxes and borrowing to fund its budget and has struggled to pay salaries and pension contributions for its workers. Vela said 28,162 employers were registered with the NSSA, down 2 percent from the previous year. The NSSA paid $271 million in claims, pension and other benefits last year, up from $254 million previously.

The Federal Reserve gave mixed signals on Wednesday. Market were sandwiched between what had been the largely inconclusive Fed minutes and Friday's U.S. jobs data and the start of a G20 summit that has risen in importance following this week's long-range missile test by North Korea. The euro and the dollar were flat against each other but South Africa's rand,  Turkish lira and Russian rouble buckled again after a wave of emerging market selling on Wednesday. Bond yields, which drive global borrowing costs, were pushing higher again with benchmark U.S. Treasuries up for the sixth day in the last seven at just over 2.34 percent. European yields and southern euro zone ones in particular were up too as investors waited to see whether the ECB would signal it is closer towards unwinding extraordinary stimulus after the Fed's minutes had shown it was still split.  They want the process to look like paint drying,  Charles Schwab UK managing director Kully Samra said of the Fed's stimulus reduction.  The S&P; 500 is up 9 percent this year, so we are discouraging our clients to do anything dramatic.  Brent oil was at $48.35 a barrel in early European trading as it recovered 1 percent of the 4 percent lost on Wednesday after rising OPEC exports had raised fresh questions about the group's plans to cut back supply. Gold was off 0.2 percent at $1,224.24 per ounce though it was up from an eight-week low of $1,217.14 it had hit the previous day. The dollar meanwhile was stalled at 113.32 Japanese yen as it consolidated a near 1 percent gain this week and was also hovering at $1.13495 per euro. Traders were wary of making any sudden moves before a flurry of U.S. data later, which includes ADP employment, ISM non-manufacturing PMI and the initial jobless claims report, all of which are appetizers ahead of Friday's Payrolls numbers. Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.5 percent as a stronger yen depressed the outlook for export earnings. Trading in Asia has been buffeted this week by tensions on the Korean peninsula after North Korea fired a missile, which U.S. officials concluded was an intercontinental ballistic missile, into Japanese waters. In Europe, earnings were back in focus. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.2 percent ahead of the ECB's minutes. Euro zone blue chips and Britain's FTSE 100 were down a similar amount.

The exact number of indigenous deaths since Australia's settlement has long been debated, but the map is the first to detail evidence of more than 150 massacres involving almost every aboriginal clan between 1788 and 1872. That compares with six recorded massacres of colonists during the same period.  At present, it's a preliminary list, as we expect to find more massacres, as people come forward with more evidence,   historian and project author Lyndall Ryan said at the launch of the map on Wednesday. The map, published by the University of Newcastle's Centre for the 21st Century, drew on sources such as settler diaries, newspaper reports, evidence from Aboriginal groups and state and federal archives, Ryan told reporters.

University of Newcastle/Handout via REUTERSThe map was an  incredible historical project that will have positive repercussions,  aboriginal leader Warren Mundine told Reuters.  Knowledge is so important because with it you can do things; we can add to the education of our nation and know how we got where we are today.   The project, which now covers only massacres on Australia's eastern seaboard, took four years of painstaking research, with more expected over the next two years as incidents in the country's west are mapped.

AB Foods rose after reporting a better outlook thanks to an improved performance from budget clothing chain Primark, with Marks & Spencer following it higher with a 1.8 percent rise, although Next fell as it went ex-dividend.  Some people have been thinking that the consumer is just going to go completely underground, but the evidence is that good companies that have the right offer at the right price can grow very strongly,  Jonathan Pritchard, retail analyst at Peel Hunt said. Investors and analysts expect British consumers to swap to cheaper goods as inflation rises, something that could help low-margin companies offering budget prices offset higher import costs as a result of sterling's weakness.  AB Foods have found more mitigation than they expected and that's because they have got volume growth, which helps their bargaining position with suppliers,  Pritchard added. Elsewhere, Reckitt Benckiser cut its growth forecast in a surprise update, after the consumer goods firm was targeted in a worldwide attack which crippled computers at several multinational companies on June 27. Reckitt, which sells Durex condoms and Dettol disinfectants was the worst-performing on the FTSE, down 2.1 percent. Research shows cyber security breaches can erode companies' share prices permanently. Basic resources, often a support for the blue chip index, edged down on the day, with miner Antofagasta the worst performer after a downgrade to 'sell' from UBS. But healthcare stocks supported the index as Shire gained after HSBC upgraded it to 'hold' from 'reduce'. Housebuilders, strong outperformers in the previous session, rose again after mid-cap Bovis Homes' first-half results added to signs of resilience. The firm said it would spend an extra 3.5 million pounds to tackle problems related to the quality of its homes. Bovis gained 1.7 percent, lifting Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development. Merger and acquisition news drove gains on the small-cap index, which outperformed larger stocks. Novae Group jumped up to 23 percent after the insurer agreed to be taken over by AXIS Capital, a Bermuda-based speciality lines insurer and reinsurer, for 468 million pounds ($605 million) in cash. Top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalues the firm. (Editing by Alexander Smith)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-stocks-idUSL8N1JX1I8"},

A resolution, filed by opposition senator Leila de Lima on Thursday, is the second such request in less than a week and puts the Senate under increasing pressure to act.  The chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, former police chief Panfilo Lacson, told Reuters on Monday he would launch an investigation and invite witnesses named in the article to testify under oath. The Senate reconvenes at the end of July. De Lima's chief of staff, Fhillip Sawali, said the two separate calls for a probe showed the gravity of the matter.  It sends a clear message that this is something that is serious, that is worthy of the conduct of a Senate investigation,  Sawali told Reuters. President Rodrigo Duterte's office has yet to comment on the Senate moves. Thousands have died since Duterte came to power a year ago and declared war on what he called the drugs menace.  The Reuters report, published on June 29, drew on data from two of Metro Manila's five police districts for the first eight months of the drug war along with interviews with witnesses, family members, doctors and police. It detailed how the Philippine National Police had sent hundreds of dead drug suspects to hospital after anti-drug operations. It showed that the proportion of drug suspects sent to hospital only to be declared dead on arrival rose in step with international and domestic criticism of the drug war. One police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity explained that the practice of sending drug war corpses to hospital was a tactic to avoid crime scene investigations and media attention. Interviewed for the report, Metro Manila Police Chief Oscar Albayalde promised to investigate its findings. National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa, who declined to be interviewed for the article, said later that the police lack the medical training to determine if a suspect is dead or alive.

We ironed out the few remaining differences,  European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said after a meeting on Wednesday with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should now sign the  political agreement  with EU institutional chiefs Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk on Thursday in Brussels. The three men will then head to a G20 summit in Hamburg, where the EU and Japan will urge Trump not to weaken U.S. free trade traditions. Summit host Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, took aim at Trump on Wednesday, saying:  While we are looking at the possibilities of cooperation to benefit everyone, globalisation is seen by the American administration more as a process that is not about a win-win situation but about winners and losers.   Japan, which lost out when Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord, and the EU, which has seen talks on a U.S. trade deal called TTIP lapse into limbo, both see their accord as striking a blow against a feared increase in nationalistic protectionism in world trade.  Leaders will stress their commitment to promote an open and fair global economy and refrain from all forms of protectionism,  the European Council said. Germany's Chambers of Commerce hailed the  symbolic power  of a deal with Japan, saying it would not only bring economic benefits in itself but also benefit world trade policy. FILE PHOTO - European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom (L) and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida (2nd R) attend their meeting as a part of the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations at Iikura guest house in Tokyo, Japan 30 June 2017.Franck Robichon/PoolCheese and Cars Senior EU officials acknowledged that it would take months to complete the full EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, with not just legal technicalities but also some substantive negotiations still outstanding. However, one insisted,  We agreed on almost everything that is important for either side.  Details have yet to be confirmed and it is unclear how much detail Thursday's political agreement will contain, but officials on both sides say differences have narrowed or disappeared in thorny areas including cars, where Europeans wanted to keep tariffs, and food, especially cheese, where Japan's protected dairy industry feared exposure to EU imports. The European carmakers' lobby had called for at least seven years to phase out tariffs of up to 10 percent on Japanese cars, and a senior EU official said they would  not be disappointed . More than 200 European products that benefit from geographic protections -- for example Parma smoked ham must come from around the Italian city -- would not face Japanese competition under those names, he added. Scotch whisky might not benefit from such a deal as Britain will be leaving the EU in 2019. Most EU food exports to Japan would see tariffs removed over time, the official said, although in some sensitive sectors such as cheese and other dairy products they would be limited by quota. Japan would make it much easier for European firms to tender for public contracts. There remain differences over how disputes under the trade agreement should be settled, he added. That could be significant as increasingly ambitious EU trade deals have faced vocal opposition, notably on the European left, over concerns that they give multinational corporations too much clout over national regulators. A deal with Canada nearly came unstuck last year when one small Belgian region refused to ratify it. Brussels is pushing Japan to accept an arbitration system less likely to meet opposition from European lawmakers.

Police had arrested several users of the website, mainly in Germany and Austria, it said. Among them was the suspected operator of the platform, a 39-year-old man living in the district of Limburg-Weilburg north of Frankfurt.  The website had more than 87,000 users and was used for the worldwide exchange of child pornography and to make appointments for the sexual abuse of children, prosecutors said.  Among the child pornographic images and video files exchanged by the members of the platform were recordings of the most serious sexual abuse of children, including toddlers and depiction of sexual violence against children,  it said. The suspected operator was arrested on June 12 when police raided his apartment and seized the server of the platform.

Inconclusive U.S. Federal Reserve minutes kept the dollar near one-week highs and while some policymakers said weak inflation made them uncomfortable with the implied path of rate rises, expectations are that the Fed is moving steadily towards unwinding its balance sheet. Emerging currencies and equities took little solace from oil's 1 percent bounce with the rouble tumbling 0.7 percent against the dollar to the lowest level since January and MSCI's benchmark emerging equity index flat after a lacklustre session in Asia. JPMorgan data showed an emerging currency index, the ELMI Plus, closing at a six-week low on Wednesday. The rand fell 0.4 percent, extending the 1.6 percent slide driven by proposals at the conference of the ruling ANC to nationalise the respected central bank and expropriate land without compensation but also by the party's failure to agree any much-needed reforms. The central bank calmed some nerves by stressing its independence was enshrined by the constitution regardless of ownership. But Commerzbank said the rand faced  uncertain times  reminding clients of proposals last month to change the central bank's mandate to include growth.  The announcement does leave a bad taste. Even well before the parliamentary elections in 2019 this is likely to cause further concerns about the central bank's independence and its stability-orientated course,  Commerzbank said. Benchmark bond yields were near 2-1/2-month highs but the commodity-heavy bourse rose to one-month highs. The Turkish lira, the emerging currency most vulnerable to higher U.S. interest rates, touched six-week lows, losing half a percent against the dollar. Earlier in the day, most Asian currencies also weakened, led by the Korean won's 0.3 percent fall and the Philippine peso touching 11-year lows Morgan Stanley said however that while Western central banks' stimulus unwind presented some risks to emerging markets, the latest moves were likely down to  position squaring  amid recovering growth and reasonable asset price valuations.  We think this period of EM weakness will prove temporary and maintain a bullish medium-term view,  the bank added. Middle Eastern assets were steady after four Arab states decided not to immediately slap fresh sanctions on Qatar. Qatari stocks fell 0.6 percent but the riyal was flat in the spot as well as forward markets. Emerging sovereign bond spreads over Treasuries narrowed one basis point but were at the highest in two weeks.

Protests by Gorkhas, ethnic Nepalese living India's West Bengal state, halted the plucking of Darjeeling's premium  second flush  tea crop, named for the harvest period that starts in mid-May and peaks in June.  Second flush Darjeeling teas are prized by tea consumers for their amber color and muscatel flavor that is unique to the region and harvest timing. The taste and color characteristics are the result of genetic changes to the tea leaves caused by insects that infest the plants before the second flush harvest. Some second flush teas have sold for as much as $1,850 a kg because of this uniqueness. Losing the second flush harvest will cut grower's incomes and leave blenders scrambling to find substitutes.  This is the first time we lost the entire second flush,  said A.N. Singh, managing director of Goodricke Group, a Kolkata-based producer with gardens in Darjeeling.  The viability of tea estates is totally dependent on the second flush volume and quality. This is 20 percent in terms of volume and 40 percent in terms of revenue. This is a complete disaster for the industry.  Tea plucking has been suspended since June 9 after the Gorkha community started strikes and protests, which turned violent, demanding a separate state within India to protect their Himalayan culture. Later flushes would not compensate for the second flush loss since they yield comparatively poorer crops.  Key buyers of Darjeeling tea are Germany's Hälssen & Lyon, London-based Unilever and prominent UK brands Typhoo, Twinings and Tetley. Second flush Darjeeling teas average about 1,000 rupees ($15.45) a kg, and more exotic varieties can command 5,000 rupees ($77.20) versus only 130 rupees ($2.01) for black tea grown in neighboring Assam state. Significant Price Hikes    Without doubt this crisis will lead to further price increases,  said Angela Pryce, an independent tea consultant with 15 years of experience as a blender and taster at Twinings.  If supply becomes untenable then brands may look at their blends to replace Darjeeling teas where possible, though for pure Darjeeling blends this will have a number of impacts - either a significant price hike, or an out of stock situation.  Darjeeling produces about 8 million kg of tea per year, more than two-thirds of which is exported mainly to Europe. Global tea production in 2016 was 5.46 billion kg, according to International Tea Committee data.  We have been sourcing teas for more than 300 years and disruption of all sorts, including this type, is something we have to contend with from time to time,  said a spokesman from Twinings, owned by Associated British Foods. Darjeeling tea planters like Goodricke Group have already lost more than 2.6 billion rupees, or about $40 million, in potential revenues due to the turmoil, said Kaushik Basu, secretary of the Darjeeling Tea Association (DTA), representing more than 100 tea exporters in the region.      Unfortunately, the indefinite shutdown is still on and no one knows when there would be a respite,  said Basu. Three Gorkha activists have died in clashes with police, while dozens of security personnel have been seriously injured during the current unrest. At least 1,200 people died during the first Gorkhaland protests in the 1980s. The plucking delay has caused the loss of the entire July crop as well since workers have been unable to maintain the plants to cause them to grow leaves.   First we have to slash tea bushes then only leaves will grow and become ready for plucking after three weeks,  said Kalyan Sundaram, secretary of the Calcutta Tea Traders Association.  I would expect many brands to have second flush stock (season 2016) to cover until around September 2017, at which point inventory will become exhausted,  tea consultant Pryce said.

Future financial sector relations between Britain and the EU should be based on regulatory cooperation  but not exact mirroring  of rules, Bailey also said.  Firms should be able to take their own decisions on where they locate, subject to appropriate regulatory arrangements being in place which preserve the public interest,  Bailey said.  Authorities should not dictate the location of firms.  Banks, insurers and asset managers based in Britain are drawing up contingency plans to shift some operations to the EU after Brexit in 2019 in case access to the single market is closed off. But Bailey questioned whether restricting trade in this way is an inevitable or necessary response to Brexit.  When I hear people say firms need to re-locate in order to continue to benefit from access to EU financial markets, I start to seriously wonder.  France and other EU countries want the clearing of euro denominated derivatives, which London dominates, moved to within the EU after Brexit. But Bailey said that joint oversight with the EU of clearing houses in London is  something that is very clearly preferable to the cost and risk that is introduced by a location based policy.  Such joint oversight was already working well between the UK and United States regulators, he added. He dismissed talk in the EU that given the sheer dominance of Britain's financial services sector, the largest in Europe, there should be specific rules for treating the UK, rather than the existing general regime for recognising non-EU financial firms. Non-EU financial firms in the United States, Singapore and elsewhere can currently offer their services if their home regulation is deemed by Brussels to be  equivalent  or as tough as the bloc's laws. This regime should be applied to Britain in the same way.  It would not be the best outcome to adopt a special treatment for the oversight of outsourced service provision arrangements involving the UK and EU when there are already arrangements in place which can form the basis of an equivalence arrangement,  Bailey said. Britain has worked hard over the years to build up relations with EU and national regulators across the bloc, he said.  No good will come from a breakdown of these relationships since we are pursuing common public interests,  Bailey said.

Though the pound has weakened a little this week as purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys have pointed to a cooling economy, it is still only around a cent away from nine-month highs hit against the dollar in May. It was flat on Thursday at $1.2935 and at 87.74 pence per euro. Its recent strength, say analysts, is largely down to expectations of monetary tightening from the BoE, with some investors betting on a rate hike as soon as next month. Analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that despite data pointing to weakness following June's parliamentary elections they were  loving  sterling, and noted that  soft  indicators such as PMI surveys had also dipped immediately after last year's Brexit vote, before recovering.  Our sterling optimism finds its sterling in what we call ‘Brexit economics’ and the BoE reconsidering GBP weakness and its impact on the economy,  they wrote.  Sterling weakness has undermined living standards, and with inflation above the BoE’s 2 percent target and its own staff projections, stabilisation should now be on the BoE’s agenda. Talking up rate expectations is a sufficient tool to reach this target.  A number of BoE policymakers, including Governor Mark Carney, have spoken in recent weeks in favour of soon reversing last year's interest rate cut, which followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The hawkish remarks have helped the pound to reverse the 2 percent drop against the dollar that came after a snap election on June 8 left no party with a clear majority. But some investors are still anxious about Britain's economic prospects as it negotiates its way out of the EU, and about political instability.  The BoE is the toughest call because the UK economy has outperformed and inflation has ramped up. However, the odds that Brexit leads to economic underperformance seem high enough to make us wonder how much of a bad streak the BoE would be willing to contemplate before taking hikes off the table,  wrote Steven Englander, head of research at hedge fund Rafiki Capital.  Carney's hiking comment in Sintra was pretty conditional at the end of the day,  he added, referring to the BoE governor's saying that a rate rise was likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity, and that the central bank would debate when to do so  in the coming months .

Activists say intolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people has spiked in recent years in Indonesia and Malaysia, both majority Muslim, multi-ethnic Southeast Asian countries. Perkasa, a group with about 700,000 members that campaigns for the rights of ethnic Malay Muslims, said it agreed with calls this week by Muhammadiyah, Indonesia's second-largest Muslim group, for a boycott of Starbucks over its pro-LGBT stand. Perkasa also agreed with the Indonesian group's call for   Starbucks' operating license to be revoked, it said. Amini Amir Abdullah, who heads Perkasa's Islamic affairs bureau, said Starbucks' position challenged Malaysia's constitution, which recognized Islam as the country's official religion.  Our objection is because they are promoting something that is against the human instinct, against human behavior and against religion. That's why we are against it,  Amini told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  Muhammadiyah's call for a boycott has gained support from the Indonesian Ulema Council, its top clerical body.     The religious groups' opposition to Starbucks came after a video from 2013 circulated online of pro-LGBT comments made by the company's chairman and former chief executive, Howard Schultz. FILE PHOTO: An employee poses with a cup of water at a Starbucks coffeehouse in Austin, Texas, U.S., February 10, 2017.Mohammad Khursheed/File PhotoIn the video, Schultz said Starbucks embraced diversity and  not every decision is an economic decision , in response to a shareholder who complained that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage.  Starbucks Malaysia could not be reached for comment.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain in Indonesia, said in a statement it was not affiliated with any political or ideological groups.  We are grateful and proud to have been a part of local communities in Indonesia for 15 years, always maintaining the deepest respect for, and adherence to, Indonesia's local laws, culture and beliefs,  said Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa, the parent company of PT Sari Coffee Indonesia. Some Muslims in Indonesia, however, said the boycott call would not stop them from buying Starbucks coffee.   I love their products, not their CEO,  said Jakarta resident Kornelius Kamajaya. The boycott call got a similar response from some in Malaysia.  Don't make it such an issue that we have to boycott a company because of one small statement,  said Muhammad Azril Maridzuan, an assistant bank manager in Kuala Lumpur. Muslim groups should not  be so extremist  even though gay rights was against their religious beliefs, he said.

The former British colony situated at the mouth of China's Pearl River Delta is one of the world's top global transit hubs for endangered species and their products, such as shark fin, pangolin skin and rosewood furniture. Customs officials on Thursday said they had seized 7,200 kg (15,873 lb) of ivory tusks, valued at around HK$72 million ($9.22 million), at a cargo warehouse beside the city's harbor. The ivory was discovered in a 40-foot container from  Malaysia declared to hold frozen fish, beneath which officers found the tusks.   The 1,000 boxes were half-empty when we found them with frozen fish put around the ivory,  said customs official Raymond Chan.  Conservation group WildAid estimated the tusks had probably been taken from about 720 elephants. Hong Kong's agriculture, fisheries and conservation department said it was investigating the shipment's final destination, probably a nearby country.

Regulatory loopholes allow traders to use a stockpile of legal ivory as cover to smuggle illegal ivory to unsuspecting buyers, say groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and WildAid.  China, Singapore and the United States have all banned the ivory trade, with the mainland closing down all operations by the end of this year. Slideshow (3 Images)Hong Kong, however, has only timetabled a ban by 2021. Legislators are set to discuss the issue on Friday and decide if traders should be compensated in the case of a total ban.  The teeming port city has the largest retail market for ivory, with 90 percent of consumers from the mainland. Hong Kong has been trading ivory for more than 150 years, fashioned into jewelry and sculptures, but activists say illegal poaching is pushing elephants toward extinction. The independent Environmental Investigation Agency last week identified Shuidong, a southern Chinese coastal town close to Hong Kong, as the hub for 10 to 20 Chinese-led criminal syndicates bringing in ivory from Africa.

Grow a new skin? Chop off a few heads? For Zeng Xiaoxian, that seemed like the best shot. ​Unable to compete with her boyfriend's obsession with the hugely popular and top-grossing online game  Honour of Kings , the unemployed 23-year-old from Zhejiang province figured she might as well join him.  So began Zeng's journey through Tencent Holdings' fantasy world of kings, queens and life-or-death adventures. A journey that has practically become a full-time job.  I'm out of work at the moment, so apart from when I'm eating or sleeping I play  Honour of Kings  non-stop until the system kicks me out. A rough estimate would be at least eight hours,  she said. Honour of Kings, a fantasy multiplayer role-playing battle game, is the most popular mobile game in China with around 55 million daily active users, more than Pokemon Go at its peak, and it's the highest-grossing mobile game in China. Its massive success, however, has drawn scrutiny from China's official media - which described it as  poison  - as well as parents and teachers amid concerns that children are becoming addicted to the game. Half of those playing it are below 24 years of age, according to Chinese mobile data firm Jiguang. The main criticism of  Honour of Kings  is not due to its violent content, but more about concerns over addiction. China's communist party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, cited examples of teenagers stealing money to spend on game features and also a case of alleged suicide.    FILE PHOTO: Tencent's booth is pictured at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason Lee/File PhotoOn Sunday, Tencent, which has a portfolio of more than 200 games, said it would limit  Honour of Kings  players below 12 years of age to one hour of play time each day, while those aged 12 to 18 would be limited to two hours a day.  The secrets to its success include the fact that games are relatively short at around 20 minutes for each and  Honour of Kings  is seen as a social tool, with scores of players telling Reuters it now played a huge part in their social lives.    It's not just a game, but it's now becoming a crucial part of my social life ... It's crazy, like everyone is playing, and I just don't want to be left out, said Crysal Xu, a 20-year-old university student living in Toronto.   I am totally addicted to it. I play it during lunch time, class breaks, bus-waiting periods.   Liu Jie, a 24-year-old who works for a local government was caught red-handed when officials from the local disciplinary inspection department burst into his office only to find him playing  Honour of Kings . For Liu, who said he had to write a letter criticizing his actions, the game is also a spectator sport of sorts.   Sometimes, you log on not to play the game, but also to check which friends of yours are online, to see how well they have been doing in the battles,  Liu said.    Once you send them an emoji, you just start talking.

The killer slit the throat of an 85-year-old woman with a knife and stabbed and beat her 87-year-old husband in the northern city of Linz on Friday. He also brought fuel and set fire to their flat. Investigators who searched the suspect's home and looked at his social media activities found that the killing  clearly had an Islamist background , ORF radio on Thursday quoted Sobotka as saying late on Wednesday.  It turns out that the suspect is obviously a radicalized Muslim who has murdered two people,  Sobotka said.  For this reason I am talking about a murder case which clearly has an Islamist background.  The suspect, a 54-year-old Tunisian who has been living in Austria for 28 years, knew the victims. He used to deliver their groceries and allegedly believed the couple had links to the far right.  He said he committed the murders for political motives and out of hatred of the FPO,  a police spokesman said, referring to Austria's far-right Freedom Party. When asked whether the suspect, who handed himself to police, also mentioned Islamist motives, the spokesman declined to comment. Current evidence suggested that the suspect acted alone and not within a network, Andreas Pilsl, Upper Austria's chief of police, told the radio.  He said intelligence services had looked into the suspect in 2015 following anonymous tips but  nothing was found that could indicate a radicalization . An attack at the Berlin Christmas market in December which killed 12 people, was carried out by a Tunisian. Austria's federal office for the protection of the constitution said in a recent report that religiously motivated Islamic extremism and terrorism were the biggest threats to internal security. Several of the deadly recent Islamist attacks in France, Britain, Germany and Belgium have been carried out by  lone wolf  assailants with little apparent connection with militant networks.

The agency has also affirmed Admiral's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' and subordinated notes at 'BBB'. The Outlook on the IFS Ratings and IDR is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects Admiral's very strong financial performance and earnings, strong capitalisation, which benefits from significant use of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements, continuing leading position in the UK motor insurance market, and prudent reserving practices. The ratings are constrained by Admiral's medium scale and a concentrated business profile. Fitch views Admiral's track record of technical profitability as very strong and expects that Admiral will maintain its robust underwriting performance. In 2016, Admiral's underwriting results were impacted by a change in the Ogden discount rate used to calculate lump-sum payments in large bodily injury cases in the UK. The significant reduction in the Ogden discount rate to -0.75% from 2.5% meant that UK insurers had to substantially increase their reserves held for open and not yet notified claims on business earned prior to the change. As a result, Admiral's profit before tax for 2016 fell to GBP284 million, from GBP390 million on a pre-Ogden basis, and Admiral's reported combined ratio deteriorated to 94.4% (86.7% pre-Ogden and 85.6% in 2015). Earnings are expected to be reduced by a further GBP65 million over the next three to five years in total as a result of lower reserve releases and profit commissions. Admiral implemented price increases on UK motor insurance ahead of the announcement on the new Ogden discount rate and further price increases following the change in the discount rate, helping it to mitigate some of the Ogden impact. Fitch views positively Admiral's ability to implement price changes within a short time, allowing the group to respond rapidly to changing market conditions. Admiral's capital position is 'Extremely Strong' as measured by Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Model (FBM) capital score. The insurer's financial profile, including capitalisation, benefits from significant use of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements, with Admiral sharing 30% of its UK motor insurance risks on a co-insurance basis and 10% on a quota share basis with Great Lakes, a subsidiary of Munich Re (IFS AA/Stable). The arrangements with Great Lakes are secured under multi-year contracts until 2020 and further quota share agreements are in place until at least 2018, providing substantial capital relief to Admiral. Fitch views the credit quality of Admiral's co-insurance and reinsurance counterparties as very strong. Admiral's ratings are constrained by a concentrated business profile. UK car insurance is the main contributor to the group's profits and accounts for 83% of total net premiums earned. While Admiral's international operations are developing well, they are still small relative to the overall group. Fitch takes a positive view of Admiral's prudent reserving strategy. Over the past 10 years, Admiral's prior-year reserve releases, excluding reserve releases on commuted reinsurance, averaged 14% of net premiums earned. The insurer's strategy is to maintain a buffer above actuarial best estimate, allowing the group to support underwriting results with reserve releases every year. RATING SENSITIVITIES A marked deterioration in technical or overall profitability, particularly compared with peers, could result in a downgrade. A downgrade could also be triggered by a substantial erosion of capital equivalent to a sustained increase in net underwriting leverage (net written premiums/equity) to 1.5x (2016: 1.0x). A downgrade may also result from a loss of Admiral's co-insurance contract, resulting in an immediate and significant increase in capital requirements or significant falls in business volumes. An upgrade is unlikely in the medium term given Admiral's concentrated business profile and limited geographical diversification.

Meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week in Washington, Trump said the United States would do more to address trade imbalances with South Korea and create a level playing ground for U.S. businesses, especially carmakers, in the world's 11th largest auto market by sales. While imports from automakers including Ford, Chrysler and GM more than doubled last year largely thanks to free trade deal which took effect in 2012, sales account for just 1 percent of a market dominated by more affordable models from local giants Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp. Imports make up just 15 percent of the overall Korean auto market, and are mainly more luxurious models from German automakers BMW and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, which also benefit from a trade deal with the European Union.  Addressing non-tariff barriers would not fundamentally raise the competitiveness of U.S. cars,  a senior Korean government official told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.    What we really want to say to the United States is: make good cars, make cars that Korean consumers like.  Taste Barrier The logo of Tesla is seen on a steering wheel of its Model S electric car at its dealership in Seoul, South Korea July 6, 2017.Kim Hong-JiIn Korea, U.S. imports are seen as lagging German brands in brand image, sophistication and fuel economy, industry experts say. U.S. imports do have a competitive advantage in electric cars: Tesla Motors' electric vehicles are seen as both environmentally friendly and trendy, while GM has launched a long-range Bolt EV.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had cited a quota in the current trade deal as an obstacle to boosting imports. Slideshow (2 Images)The quota allows U.S. automakers to bring in each year 25,000 vehicles that meet U.S., not necessarily Korean, safety standards. Should GM, for example, decide to bring in more than its quota of one model - the Impala sedans -  it would cost up to $75 million to modify the cars to meet Korean safety standards, the company told its local labor union. Asked about non-tariff barriers, a spokesman at GM's Korean unit said removing them could expand the range of models the company can bring in from the United States. No U.S. company, however, has yet to make full use of the quota, industry data shows. GM, the most popular U.S. brand, sold only 13,150 U.S.-made vehicles last year.        U.S. cars could also see the benefits of a renegotiated trade deal at a time when diesel-powered cars offered by Volkswagen's are losing appeal following cheating on emissions tests. However, they still need to appeal to the locals, experts say.  Upgrading their vehicles and meet the luxurious taste of consumers is more important than complaining about non-tariff barriers,  said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of engineering at Daelim University College near Seoul.

The killer slit the throat of an 85-year-old woman with a knife and stabbed and beat her 87-year-old husband in the northern city of Linz on Friday. He also brought fuel and set fire to their flat. Investigators who searched the suspect's home and looked at his social media activities found that the killing  clearly had an Islamist background , ORF radio on Thursday quoted Sobotka as saying late on Wednesday.  It turns out that the suspect is obviously a radicalized Muslim who has murdered two people,  Sobotka said.  For this reason I am talking about a murder case which clearly has an Islamist background.  The suspect, a 54-year-old Tunisian who has been living in Austria for 28 years, knew the victims. He used to deliver their groceries and allegedly believed the couple had links to the far right.  He said he committed the murders for political motives and out of hatred of the FPO,  a police spokesman said, referring to Austria's far-right Freedom Party. When asked whether the suspect, who handed himself to police, also mentioned Islamist motives, the spokesman declined to comment. Current evidence suggested that the suspect acted alone and not within a network, Andreas Pilsl, Upper Austria's chief of police, told the radio.  He said intelligence services had looked into the suspect in 2015 following anonymous tips but  nothing was found that could indicate a radicalization . An attack at the Berlin Christmas market in December which killed 12 people, was carried out by a Tunisian. Austria's federal office for the protection of the constitution said in a recent report that religiously motivated Islamic extremism and terrorism were the biggest threats to internal security. Several of the deadly recent Islamist attacks in France, Britain, Germany and Belgium have been carried out by  lone wolf  assailants with little apparent connection with militant networks.

The Sweden-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but its move signals the eventual end of nearly a century of Volvos powered solely that way.      While electric and hybrid vehicles are still only a small fraction of new cars sales, they are gaining ground at the premium end of the market, where Volvo operates and where Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one. As technology improves and prices fall, many in the industry expect mass-market adoption to follow.   This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,  Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said.     The company, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - would all be fully electric.  These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,  Volvo said.  This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.      The electric models will be produced at Volvo plants world-wide - it has factories in Europe and China and is building one in the United States - while development costs will be met from within its existing budget, Samuelsson told Reuters.  This also means we won't be doing other things. We of course will not be developing completely new generations of combustion engines,  he said about future investment needs. A Volvo hybrid car is seen connected to a charging point in this picture illustration taken July 6, 2017.Phil Noble/IllustrationVolvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Geely from Ford in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies that allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars. Slideshow (3 Images)Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. Volvo has also said it will build its first fully electric car in China based on its architecture for smaller cars which will be available for sale in 2019 and exported globally. Still, Volvo is not alone among traditional carmakers in pushing strongly into electrics and plug-ins – or among premium brands in resorting to 48V mild hybrid systems to lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from their combustion-engine cars. Among them, BMW plans to introduce an electric version of its popular 3 series in September to meet the challenge from Tesla, Handelsblatt reported last month. Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made.  It is still an option and a question for our owner,  Samuelsson said.

Meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week in Washington, Trump said the United States would do more to address trade imbalances with South Korea and create a level playing ground for U.S. businesses, especially carmakers, in the world's 11th largest auto market by sales. While imports from automakers including Ford, Chrysler and GM more than doubled last year largely thanks to free trade deal which took effect in 2012, sales account for just 1 percent of a market dominated by more affordable models from local giants Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp. Imports make up just 15 percent of the overall Korean auto market, and are mainly more luxurious models from German automakers BMW and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, which also benefit from a trade deal with the European Union.  Addressing non-tariff barriers would not fundamentally raise the competitiveness of U.S. cars,  a senior Korean government official told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.    What we really want to say to the United States is: make good cars, make cars that Korean consumers like.  Taste Barrier The logo of Tesla is seen on a steering wheel of its Model S electric car at its dealership in Seoul, South Korea July 6, 2017.Kim Hong-JiIn Korea, U.S. imports are seen as lagging German brands in brand image, sophistication and fuel economy, industry experts say. U.S. imports do have a competitive advantage in electric cars: Tesla Motors' electric vehicles are seen as both environmentally friendly and trendy, while GM has launched a long-range Bolt EV.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had cited a quota in the current trade deal as an obstacle to boosting imports. Slideshow (2 Images)The quota allows U.S. automakers to bring in each year 25,000 vehicles that meet U.S., not necessarily Korean, safety standards. Should GM, for example, decide to bring in more than its quota of one model - the Impala sedans -  it would cost up to $75 million to modify the cars to meet Korean safety standards, the company told its local labor union. Asked about non-tariff barriers, a spokesman at GM's Korean unit said removing them could expand the range of models the company can bring in from the United States. No U.S. company, however, has yet to make full use of the quota, industry data shows. GM, the most popular U.S. brand, sold only 13,150 U.S.-made vehicles last year.        U.S. cars could also see the benefits of a renegotiated trade deal at a time when diesel-powered cars offered by Volkswagen's are losing appeal following cheating on emissions tests. However, they still need to appeal to the locals, experts say.  Upgrading their vehicles and meet the luxurious taste of consumers is more important than complaining about non-tariff barriers,  said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of engineering at Daelim University College near Seoul.

The South Asian nation typically ships in around 2.5 million tonnes of fuel oil and 3.2 million tonnes of diesel annually, making it one of the top 10 such importers in the region. But its push towards cleaner gas is likely to displace some of that appetite for oil, with the country's first floating LNG import terminal due to begin accepting cargoes in May next year.  LNG is considered to be an environmentally friendly source of energy and its cost is cheaper than fuel oil,  said Nasrul Hamid, Bangladesh junior energy minister. He added that the country would gradually shift to greener, cheaper sources of energy for electricity generation and in industry. State-run Petrobangla has signed preliminary deals for two more LNG terminals and a memorandum of understanding with Swiss commodity merchant AOT Energy for help lining up supplies. It has also said that it is in talks with top LNG producer Qatar.   Of the total 13.3 gigawatts of installed electricity capacity in Bangladesh, about 63 percent is from gas-fired plants, 22 percent from plants powered by fuel oil and 8 percent from diesel, said Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at energy consultancy FGE. That translates to consumption of 12,000 to 14,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) of high sulfur fuel oil for power generation and 10,000 to 12,000 bpd of diesel, he added.  While it was not clear how much of the country's import demand for oil products would be displaced by LNG, it would probably start to happen in 2019, said FGE and an official with state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corp.   At the end of this year, we will get a full picture of our imports of oil products for the next year,  said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media.       LNG is currently about 15 to 20 percent cheaper than fuel oil, said Kazi Mohammad Anwarul Azim, manager of Petrobangla's LNG unit. Bangladesh's imports of LNG are expected to reach 5 million tonnes in 2020, said FGE's Kumaran.  Still, with not many dual-feed power plants in the country and new oil-fired power plants installed over the last few years, Bangladesh will continue to import fuel oil to run those plants, he said.

Oxford BioMedica will received $10 million from Novartis upfront, as well as payments for various performance incentives and bioprocessing and development services.

I remember when me and my sister used to train at public courts and stuff, random people would be, like, 'Are you the next Venus and Serena?'  I feel like they had a great role in us growing up.

At $3 billion, the acquisition would have been the largest ever insurance M&A; transaction in Southeast Asia, and the biggest in Asia since August 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. Insurers in Asia have been looking to expand the so-called bancassurance tie-ups - or leveraging bank branch networks for distribution - as opposed to the traditional agency model to tap into the region's fast-growing insurance market. The takeover of the unit would have helped FWD expand its existing wholly owned insurance business in Thailand, which started in 2012 and had total assets of about 74.7 billion baht ($2.2 billion) at the end of 2015. The SCB unit, SCB Life Assurance, ranks among the top Thai insurers. It had net premium earnings of 48 billion baht and net profit of 5.8 billion in 2014, as per financials available on the SCB Life Assurance website.

Insurers in Asia have been looking to expand the so-called bancassurance tie-ups - or leveraging bank branch networks for distribution - as opposed to the traditional agency model to tap into the region's fast-growing insurance market. The takeover of the unit would have helped FWD expand its existing wholly owned insurance business in Thailand, which started in 2012 and had total assets of about 74.7 billion baht ($2.2 billion) at the end of 2015. The SCB unit, SCB Life Assurance, ranks among the top Thai insurers. It had net premium earnings of 48 billion baht and net profit of 5.8 billion in 2014, as per financials available on the SCB Life Assurance website. Reuters had reported in January that Hong Kong-based AIA Group, Manulife Financial Corp, and Prudential Plc were among insurers weighing a bid for SCB's unit. SCB's insurance business sale plan was one of several large Asia insurance M&A; deals in the pipeline, which included a sale of Australia and New Zealand Banking's life insurance and wealth business valued at more than $3 billion.

It noted that only Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, and to some extent, Germany have a national strategy in place to track spending related to climate mitigation and adaption. The EU estimates it should have investments of around 177 billion euros  ($200 billion) per year from 2021-2030 to meet climate and energy targets, which will require a doubling of current investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal has rejected a roughly $850 million takeover offer from its larger rival Flipkart, a person familiar with the situation told Breakingviews. A sale at this price would fall short of the startup industry’s magical $1 billion-plus mark, let alone the peak valuation of $6.5 billion Snapdeal hit more than a year ago. But the rebuff is probably a mistake: buyers are scarce and a delay is only likely to lead to a lower price. Japan's SoftBank is the largest shareholder and has been pushing for a quick sale. But it needs the support of other investors including Snapdeal's founders, as it does not control the board of the country's number three e-commerce player. A sale will hurt in the short-run given the technology conglomerate has spent around $1 billion on Snapdeal at valuations up to an estimated $5 billion. However, Reuters reports that founder Masayoshi Son wants to invest a further $1 billion to become a top shareholder in the enlarged entity. Throwing good money after bad has some logic for the Japanese. The merged group could later be combined with the retail unit of Paytm, another industry player that is backed by Alibaba, the Chinese giant already part-owned by SoftBank. If the end result is a profitable, dominant outfit, that would also help to preserve SoftBank's boasting rights. Leaving aside Alibaba, the Japanese company claims to have earned a 43 percent cumulative return over the past 18 years on internet investments worth $7 billion. At this point, Snapdeal looks like a blot on that record. With Amazon the only other significant player in the industry, Snapdeal has a poor negotiating position. Flipkart already counts powerhouses like China's Tencent, U.S. marketplace eBay, and Microsoft among its investors. Holdouts may be disappointed with the valuation on the table, and possibly other terms and conditions. But one thing is almost certain: the longer this sale drags out the less Snapdeal will look like a unicorn.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The minutes reflected a split among Fed members on the future pace of US interest-rate hikes.

New bonds put in mixed performances. Hindustan Petroleum's 4% 2027s, which priced yesterday at 167.5bp over US Treasuries, tightened to around mid-range of 163bp. Shanghai Pudong's two floaters due 2020 and 2022 caught a slower bid as they traded around reoffer levels after pricing at par yesterday.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules. UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels. Its Finnish country manager Joel Jarvinen said it would halt UberPOP in Finland to avoid problems for its drivers.  We want to ensure that we do not pose drivers who use our app or our employees any unnecessary issues – especially now that we have a bright future to look forward to. We believe that the best way to do so and focus on the future is to pause UberPOP and relaunch in the summer of 2018,  Jarvinen said in a blog post on Thursday. Uber's licensed service UberBLACK will continue operating in the Finnish capital Helsinki and Jarvinen said the company was committed to supporting the hundreds of drivers who would no longer be able to make money with UberPOP. Once the new law comes into effect, drivers will still need permits but annual permit quotas and fare restrictions will be removed, which could help new entrants to the market. Uber is legal in Finland provided its drivers hold valid taxi licenses, but the company has been the target of police investigations and drivers have been ordered to give up their earnings to the state for not having valid taxi permits.  Helsinki district court last week ordered the assets of Jarvinen be confiscated until police conclude an investigation into whether Uber operates an illegal taxi service in Finland.

The company has also begun moves to raise S$100 million ($72 million) from private-equity players and existing strategic investors in the next 60 to 90 days. After that fundraising, the company is eyeing a valuation of S$650 million, CEO Malcolm Rodrigues told a media briefing. He did not name potential investors in MyRepublic. The company is considering getting listed in Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia. My Republic declined to say how much it wants to raise through an IPO.  Once we get through our listing, our plan is to expand around the region and expand around the world,  Rodrigues said, adding that targets for expansion include Thailand, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. MyRepublic, which has previously raised S$120 million, operates in Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The company, backed by French billionaire Xavier Niel, lost out to Australia's TPG Telecom in a competition last year to become Singapore's fourth telecom operator. Rodrigues said MyRepublic had considered bidding for Singapore telecom operator M1 Ltd but was not pursuing it. M1's main shareholders are conducting a strategic review of their stakes.

The account of the European Central Bank's last monetary policy meeting is due to be published later in the day and a number of key policymakers are scheduled to speak. Investors will be keeping an eye out to see if the ECB has moved closer towards unwinding extraordinary stimulus. In the United States, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting showed some policymakers in favour of starting to reduce the Fed's balance sheet in a couple of months. Though policymakers appeared divided on the outlook for inflation and the future pace of rate hikes, U.S. Treasury yields remained near recent highs, with 10-year yields a touch higher Thursday at 2.34 percent.  The bottom line is that more and more investors are growing confident that the Fed will continue its gradual tightening next year,  said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet.  And there is a spillover effect into Europe - though the ECB minutes could change that.  Most high-rated euro zone bond yields were up 2-3 basis points on Thursday and low-rated southern European bond yields even more so. The yield on Spanish, Italian and Portuguese 10-year government debt was higher 5-6 basis points. Yields have risen sharply in recent weeks on the belief that the ECB could announce the tapering of its two trillion euro bond-buying scheme as early as September, after ECB chief Mario Draghi appeared to open the door to policy tweaks. ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet will speak in Paris while Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Austrian central bank governor Ewald Nowotny are due to participate in a conference.  Volatility should remain elevated amid headline risks from ECB speakers, accounts from the latest meeting and likely solid US labour market data,  said Commerzbank analyst Rainer Guntermann. Yields may also be affected by large bond sales from France and Spain scheduled for later today. France is to sell 7.5-8.5 billion euros of long-dated bonds while Spain will raise 3-4 billion euros through a debt auction that includes a reopening of its 30-year benchmark bond.

Addressing the EU's EESC business and trade union forum in Brussels on Thursday, Barnier said London's  red lines  for a future trade relationship meant Britain was definitely leaving the single market and the customs union, and only membership of both allowed  frictionless  trading arrangements. Prime Minister Theresa May is still hoping for trade that is  as frictionless as possible , her spokesman said in response. Barnier said he was unsure the EU's insistence on preserving its own rules  have been fully understood across the Channel .  I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and keep all of its benefits - that is not possible,  he said.  I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and build a customs union to achieve 'frictionless trade' – that is not possible.  Stressing time is tight for a deal before Britain leaves the bloc on March 30, 2019, Barnier said he was ready for a failure of talks and  no deal  but that would be damaging, especially to Britain, and he saw  no reasonable justification .  A fair deal is far better than no deal,  he said, turning around May's argument that no deal is better than a bad deal. He called for rapid agreement on priority issues in talks begun last month to build a  climate of trust  so that trade negotiations could begin as soon as possible. But in urging businesses to prepare for Brexit now, he stressed that whatever deal was done would carry  significant consequences . European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gestures during a working visit at the port of Zeebrugge, Belgium July 6, 2017.Eric Vidal A trading relationship with a country that does not belong to the European Union obviously involves friction,  Barnier said. He cited disruption to cross-border traders processing value-added tax (VAT) and a need for all EU imports of animals and animal products to be tested at borders. Those issues are of particular concern in Ireland, where farming businesses on either side of the new UK-EU border on the island fear disruption. Barnier repeated EU willingness to make a priority of agreeing border issues on Ireland, where leaders on all sides fear a  hard  frontier could also undermine the fragile peace in the British province of Northern Ireland. Pressed by British and Irish delegates about the Irish border issue, Barnier said he understood Ireland was a special case but that the EU would also protect its own market. Slideshow (4 Images)An EU free trade deal with Japan on Thursday was hailed by EU leaders as a sign of what the combined economic power of the bloc can achieve - and of what Britain will miss when it leaves.  In the context of the discussion about Brexit, we have heard statements claiming that it isn't worth being in the European Union, as it is easier to do global trade outside of the EU,  European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters.  Today we have shown that this is not true.  EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan said the deal, which should boost European food and drink exports,  shows the importance of size in global trade negotiations .  No individual member state could ever hope to achieve what the EU can achieve together,  Hogan said in a statement. London, where Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed the EU-Japan deal, may seek to emulate the Japan-EU deal's benefits.

Le Maire did not identify the companies, although analysts say France could cut its 5.7 percent stake in construction company Eiffage, its 28.65 percent in utility Engie, its 50.63 percent in airport operator ADP or its 23.05 percent in telecom operator Orange. Le Maire also said in an interview on BFM TV that he hoped the government could end a workers' dispute at car parts supplier GM&S;, which is seeking to finalize a rescue deal.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules. UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels. Its Finnish country manager Joel Jarvinen said it would halt UberPOP in Finland to avoid problems for its drivers.  We want to ensure that we do not pose drivers who use our app or our employees any unnecessary issues – especially now that we have a bright future to look forward to. We believe that the best way to do so and focus on the future is to pause UberPOP and relaunch in the summer of 2018,  Jarvinen said in a blog post on Thursday. Uber's licensed service UberBLACK will continue operating in the Finnish capital Helsinki and Jarvinen said the company was committed to supporting the hundreds of drivers who would no longer be able to make money with UberPOP. Once the new law comes into effect, drivers will still need permits but annual permit quotas and fare restrictions will be removed, which could help new entrants to the market. Uber is legal in Finland provided its drivers hold valid taxi licenses, but the company has been the target of police investigations and drivers have been ordered to give up their earnings to the state for not having valid taxi permits.  Helsinki district court last week ordered the assets of Jarvinen be confiscated until police conclude an investigation into whether Uber operates an illegal taxi service in Finland.

The South Asian nation typically ships in around 2.5 million tonnes of fuel oil and 3.2 million tonnes of diesel annually, making it one of the top 10 such importers in the region. But its push towards cleaner gas is likely to displace some of that appetite for oil, with the country's first floating LNG import terminal due to begin accepting cargoes in May next year.  LNG is considered to be an environmentally friendly source of energy and its cost is cheaper than fuel oil,  said Nasrul Hamid, Bangladesh junior energy minister. He added that the country would gradually shift to greener, cheaper sources of energy for electricity generation and in industry. State-run Petrobangla has signed preliminary deals for two more LNG terminals and a memorandum of understanding with Swiss commodity merchant AOT Energy for help lining up supplies. It has also said that it is in talks with top LNG producer Qatar.   Of the total 13.3 gigawatts of installed electricity capacity in Bangladesh, about 63 percent is from gas-fired plants, 22 percent from plants powered by fuel oil and 8 percent from diesel, said Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at energy consultancy FGE. That translates to consumption of 12,000 to 14,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) of high sulfur fuel oil for power generation and 10,000 to 12,000 bpd of diesel, he added.  While it was not clear how much of the country's import demand for oil products would be displaced by LNG, it would probably start to happen in 2019, said FGE and an official with state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corp.   At the end of this year, we will get a full picture of our imports of oil products for the next year,  said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media.       LNG is currently about 15 to 20 percent cheaper than fuel oil, said Kazi Mohammad Anwarul Azim, manager of Petrobangla's LNG unit. Bangladesh's imports of LNG are expected to reach 5 million tonnes in 2020, said FGE's Kumaran.  Still, with not many dual-feed power plants in the country and new oil-fired power plants installed over the last few years, Bangladesh will continue to import fuel oil to run those plants, he said.

Activists say intolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people has spiked in recent years in Indonesia and Malaysia, both majority Muslim, multi-ethnic Southeast Asian countries. Perkasa, a group with about 700,000 members that campaigns for the rights of ethnic Malay Muslims, said it agreed with calls this week by Muhammadiyah, Indonesia's second-largest Muslim group, for a boycott of Starbucks over its pro-gay stand. Perkasa also agreed with the Indonesian group's call for Starbucks' operating license to be revoked, it said. Amini Amir Abdullah, who heads Perkasa's Islamic affairs bureau, said Starbucks' position challenged Malaysia's constitution, which recognised Islam as the country's official religion.  Our objection is because they are promoting something that is against the human instinct, against human behaviour and against religion. That's why we are against it,  Amini told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Muhammadiyah's call for a boycott has gained support from the Indonesian Ulema Council, its top clerical body. The religious groups' opposition to against Starbucks came after a video from 2013 circulated online of pro-LGBT comments made by the company's chairman and former chief executive, Howard Schultz. In the video, Schultz said Starbucks embraced diversity and  not every decision is an economic decision , in response to a shareholder who complained that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage. Starbucks Malaysia could not be reached for comment. PT Sari Coffee, which holds the licence to run the Starbucks chain in Indonesia, said last week it  always obeys the prevailing regulations and appreciates the cultural values in Indonesia . Some Muslims in Indonesia, however, said the boycott call would not stop them from buying Starbucks coffee.  I love their products, not their CEO,  said Jakarta resident Kornelius Kamajaya. The boycott call got a similar response from some in Malaysia.  Don't make it such an issue that we have to boycott a company because of one small statement,  said Muhammad Azril Maridzuan, an assistant bank manager in Kuala Lumpur. Muslim groups should not  be so extremist  even though gay rights was against their religious beliefs, he said.

Factories registered a 1.0 percent increase in orders in May after contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods dropped by a downwardly revised 2.2 percent in April, data from the Economy Ministry showed.  The reading for May undershot the Reuters forecast for a 2.0 percent rise, with the Economy Ministry saying the proportion of bulk orders was below average for May.  The German industrial sector is back in form and the decline in April was likely a one-off,  said Dirk Schlotboeller, an economist at Germany's Chambers of Commerce (DIHK).  Although increasing protectionism around the world is dampening the mood, business is going extremely well in Europe, Asia and also in the USA,  he said, adding that investment was finally picking up. But others were less optimistic, with Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe KG, saying the data was disappointing in view of bullish sentiment indicators such as Ifo, which showed business morale hitting a record high in June. Bookings for capital goods picked up but factories making consumer and intermediate goods saw a downturn in demand.  A breakdown of the May data showed domestic demand tumbled by 1.9 percent while foreign orders climbed by 3.1 percent, with orders from outside the euro zone surging by 4.0 percent. On the less volatile two-month comparison, orders declined by 1.1 percent but the Economy Ministry said the average order level for the April-May period was roughly at the same level as the strong first quarter. The data comes on the heels of a survey showing German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June as orders surged and manufacturers were increasingly optimistic about the outlook for production. Other recent indicators also bode well for the sector, with data from the VDMA industry association showing engineering contracts jumping 17 percent in May from the previous year. Germany's central bank and leading economic institutes have raised their estimates for German gross domestic product (GDP)growth for this year and next, pointing to a broad-based and self-reinforcing upswing propelled by vibrant domestic demand. But the government remains more cautious, forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018. This would be below the 1.9 percent in 2016, which was the strongest rate in five years.

You've got until 3 o'clock tomorrow to vote,  Yost said, referring to the All-Star Game's internet balloting in which Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas is one of five candidates to join the American League team.  Vote Moose! Let's get him there.  Moustakas certainly boosted his credentials in the three-game sweep of the Mariners, hitting a home run in each contest. His two-run shot in the first inning Wednesday, his 25th of the season, gave the Royals a 4-0 lead.  I'm just trying to go up there with the same game plan all the time, not trying to do too much,  said Moustakas, who will compete in the Home Run Derby on Monday in Miami. As for the online voting?  It's something I'm not trying to think about too much,  said Moustakas, who won that vote in 2015 to make his first All-Star team.  I'm just trying to be along for the ride. I'd love to go to Miami and stay for two days and not just one.  Perez, who will be the American League's starting catcher on Tuesday, homered off James Pazos (2-2) in the 10th to break a 6-6 tie Wednesday.  The pitch before was away, so I was looking for something over the plate,  said Perez, whose 17th homer went to the opposite field in right.  My whole body was (aiming) the other way.  Related CoveragePreview: Royals at MarinersKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchRoyals relievers Scott Alexander, Joakim Soria, Mike Minor and Kelvin Herrera allowed a total of one hit over the final five innings. Minor (5-1) got the victory after pitching the ninth, and Herrera earned his 19th save with a perfect 10th. It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Royals (44-40).  The bullpen held us right where we needed to be, and Salvy came up big,  said Kansas City left-hander Jason Vargas, who had one of his worst starts of the season.  That's the way it's been going recently. We've been able to come up with big hits in big moments.  The Mariners (41-45), who took their seventh consecutive home defeat, might have dealt a blow to Vargas' hopes of starting the All-Star Game. Vargas, who has a league-best 12 victories, allowed six runs on eight hits in five innings, yielding three home runs. Vargas, who left with the score tied 6-6, saw his ERA jump from 2.22 to 2.62.  It was just one of those nights when he battled his control,  Yost said. The Royals, who saw their 4-0 lead turn into a 6-4 deficit on home runs by Mike Zunino, Jean Segura and Nelson Cruz, tied it in the fifth on Lorenzo Cain's two-run shot. It stayed that way until the 10th, when Cain led off by reaching on second baseman Robinson Cano's error. Cain was erased on Eric Hosmer's fielder's choice, but Perez followed with his home run to give the Royals an 8-6 lead. They added a final run on Alex Gordon's two-out RBI single off Nick Vincent. Zunino nearly ended it in the bottom of the ninth against Minor, as his deep fly ball was caught by left fielder Gordon against the wall.  It was going to come down to getting a big hit,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Off the bat, I thought (Zunino's) was a big hit.  The Royals scored four runs in the top of the first off Ariel Miranda. Whit Merrifield led off with a single and, an out later, Cain walked. Hosmer hit a two-run double to center field. With two outs, Moustakas hit a two-run shot just over the right-field fence. Miranda, who leads the Mariners with seven wins, went five innings. He allowed six runs on five hits, with two walks and six strikeouts. The Mariners overcame their early deficit by scoring in the first three innings.  It would have been easy to get down, but our guys got after it,  Servais said. Segura led off the first with a single, moved to second on a one-out single by Cano and stole third. Segura scored on a groundout by Cruz and Cano came home on a two-out single by Gamel, cutting the margin to 4-2. Seattle took a 5-4 lead in the second. Zunino led off with a first-pitch homer to left field, his 12th homer of the season. Jarrod Dyson then walked against his former team, stole second and advanced to third on a wild pitch before Segura cranked a two-run homer to center field, his sixth homer of the season. Cruz led off the third with a home run to left field to make it 6-4. It was his 15th homer of the season, his first since June 4. NOTES: Mariners 3B Kyle Seager, in an 0-for-14 slump, didn't play Wednesday. ... Royals 1B Eric Hosmer extended his hitting streak to 12 games, and 2B Whit Merrifield extended his to 10. ... The Royals will have Thursday off before a three-game weekend series in Los Angeles against the Dodgers. RHP Jason Hammel (4-7, 5.08 ERA) is scheduled to pitch in the opener Friday. ... The Mariners continue their homestand Thursday when they host the Oakland Athletics in the opener of a four-game series. RHP Sam Gaviglio (3-3, 3.48) is set to face A's RHP Paul Blackburn, who will be making his second major league start. Blackburn allowed one unearned run on three hits in six innings in his debut Saturday against Atlanta.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED76NNXVC3"},

While few market players expect the BOJ to follow the European Central Bank and a couple of others in winding back its easy policy stance, rising bond yields in the West put pressure on Japanese bonds as they make JGBs relatively less attractive. The benchmark 10-year yield, which the BOJ is trying to keep  around zero percent , rose to 0.100 percent, up 2.0 basis points on the day and its highest level since February. That was just 1.0 basis point from 0.110 percent, where, on Feb. 3, the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year bonds to stop s rise in their yields. That operation -- to buy bonds at a specific yield -- is different from the BOJ's regular bond purchases and is the most powerful tool the central bank has now to control the market.  The market is trying to test the BOJ's stance,  said Tadashi Matsukawa, head of fixed income investment at PineBridge Investments in Tokyo. For now, expectations that the BOJ would step in again if the yield climbs to the BOJ's previous defence line are keeping further rises in check.  I suspect the market tends to believe that the BOJ will defend the 0.11 percent level. If the BOJ does not do so even if it hit that level, that's a bit scary. The yields will likely spike, probably forcing the BOJ to do a fixed rate operation later,  said  Yusuke Ikawa, strategist at BNP Paribas. The 10-year JGB futures price dropped 0.17 point to 149.81. The contract has lost 0.63 point over the past five sessions, its biggest five-day fall since November. The auction of 30-year JGBs held on Thursday attracted decent demand but that was not enough to change the sentiment as investors fret that a stronger reading in Friday's U.S. payrolls data could boost bond yields globally, including in Japan.  I've bought back bonds today after having sold them quite a lot last week. But I'm still not comfortable going long, given we have big data such as U.S. job reports,  Matsukawa at PineBridge added. The 30-year yield rose 3.5 basis points to 0.900 percent , a 4-1/2-month high. The 20-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to a three-month high of 0.615 percent, although there was some bargain-hunting in that maturity. The five-year yield rose 2.0 basis points to minus 0.040 percent, matching the defence line the BOJ drew in November when it offered to buy them at that yield. The BOJ has scheduled its next regular purchase of 5-10 year JGBs on Friday. Some market players expect the central bank will increase its purchase from the regular amount of 450 billion yen.

Scandinavian countries are leading the way among 157 nations ranked by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German social responsibility foundation.  But income inequality, high consumption levels and carbon emissions put the United States at No. 42 in the list while   Russia was ranked 62nd and China 71st. The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, were approved in September 2015 by the 193 U.N. members as a roadmap to tackle the world's most troubling problems by 2030. The 17 goals, and their accompanying 169 targets, range from  halting deforestation to raising living standards, reducing child mortality and promoting global peace. The cost of their enactment has been estimated at $3 trillion a year. The SDSN, a U.N.-connected group that promotes the SDGs, said the world's most powerful nations are failing to lead the way.  A rising 'my country first' approach by many heads of government threatens the realization of the SDGs,  it said in a statement released with the report.  Not only does a rising trend of nationalism and protectionism impede the implementation of the goals, but as the report shows, industrialized countries are not serving as role models,  it said.  Many of the richest countries in the world are nowhere near achieving the global policy objectives.  Using extensive data and information submitted by nations, the report noted so-called spillovers have a major impact on measuring progress among nations. For example pollution caused in one nation can harm water quality in another or weapons production in one nation affects peace and security elsewhere. At the top of the list were Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway, with Germany and France also in the top ten. Britain  was 16th and Canada 17th. At the bottom were Central African Republic, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along with a cluster of developing nations plagued by food insecurity, extreme poverty, lack of education and violent conflict. Release of the report comes ahead of the G20 summit on Friday in Hamburg, a global forum where German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The progress report's results  highlight the need for urgent action on the part of G20 countries in making sustainable development a reality both within and beyond their borders,  said Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN director, in a statement.  If the world is to achieve the SDGs, all countries must take up the goals as part of their national development strategies and ensure that they take responsibility for their impact on the rest of the world.

While some doubt the strong trend in blue chips will continue, many analysts see little risk of a major downturn in stocks with solid fundamentals. Resource stocks far outperformed the broader market, underpinned by expectations of greatly improved profitability amid an industry recovery and a weaker dollar, with many starting to issue upbeat forecasts for mid-year performance.

High on his list is figuring out how to cope with the rising water eating away the land where he lives on the Louisiana coast.  One night, we might be sleeping and the water come in and we don't know, and we stuck and we trapped down here,  he said at a recent meeting seeking input from local residents on ways to adapt to the changing lowland environment.  So having a plan - we can have a plan to get out before we stuck here,  Williams told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The meeting was one in a series staged by LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments), a federally funded project to design ways of making vulnerable coastal communities more resilient to climate change and other threats. Williams lives on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish, a sparsely populated county mostly surrounded by water - the Mississippi River on one side and the Gulf of Mexico on the other. The grassy river delta is dotted with houses elevated - some awkwardly, some gracefully - on cinder-block columns. Much of the landscape is wetlands, accessible only by boat, that once were naturally rebuilt by the sediment-filled Mississippi but are now rapidly disappearing. Lined by levees designed to limit flooding, the river is funneled to the Gulf rather than depositing sediment and replenishing the wetlands along its way.  The shrinking wetlands are letting salt water intrude into the fresh water, dramatically affecting seafood harvests, while sea level rise in the Gulf is submerging land as well. Even in the face of such pressures, Williams and his friends say they would like to live their adult lives on the quiet peninsula, but worry it could be abandoned. Ghost Town? The east bank of Plaquemines Parish has lost nearly 40 percent of its population since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when levees failed and it was submerged by a storm surge of more than 20 feet (6 m) of water. Businesses did not return after the disaster, and the declining economy, combined with land loss and flood risks, has made it hard to attract and sustain jobs, according to LA SAFE. Williams said there were just four other students in his school grade this year. A lone store sells groceries in the town of Pointe à la Hache, with a population of 188 according to the last census, and the nearest gas station is nearly 30 miles (48 km) north. The closest sizable town, with doctors and dentists, is a drive of almost 40 miles and a ferry ride across the Mississippi.  To keep it from being a ghost town, it's about putting more businesses down here,  said Julius Tarrence, also 17. He wants to go away to college but return to east Plaquemines as a high-school math teacher. Williams said he sees himself going to college in New Orleans, nearly 50 miles up river, joining the U.S. Navy, and returning to open a garage to repair boats.  A lot of people down here, they have messed-up boats,  he explained. Participating in projects such as LA SAFE can help the younger generation stay in Plaquemines, Williams said.  If we get more people to get involved, if they see us leaving, doing something, coming back, giving back to the community, they'd probably want to do it,  he said.

The Nikkei fell 0.4 percent to 19,994.06, the lowest closing level since June 16. The broader Topix shed 0.2 percent to 1,615.53.  Investors took profits on stocks such as financials, which gained recently on rising U.S. yields,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.  They are risk averse now, and they want to secure profits before they see the outcome of G20 meeting.  Kuramochi also said demand for overbought Japanese financial companies, which invest in high-yielding products such as foreign bonds, will be determined by whether benchmark U.S. 10-year yields rise to 2.4 or 2.5 percent in the coming weeks. They are currently trading above 2.3 percent. Elsewhere, Infoteria Corp, surged as much as 13 percent to hit a record high of 1,714 yen on the small-cap Mothers market before ending down 2.4 percent. Market participants said day traders were seen engaging in short-term margin trade after Blockchain Collaborative Consortium, which is led by Infoteria, announced on Wednesday that it issued a new virtual currency called  Zen.  Turnover of shares in Infoteria, which has a market capitalization of 25 billion yen, was a whopping 91.6 billion yen, accounting for about a half of the Mothers market's daily turnover of 196 billion yen. The banking sector fell 0.5 percent, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group both declining 0.7 percent. Convenience-store operator Lawson Inc shed 3.4 percent after its operating profit dropped 6.9 percent on the year to 16.25 billion yen for the first quarter ended May. Ministop Co stumbled 3.9 percent after it posted an operating loss of 269 million yen for the first quarter ended May. Meanwhile, retail investors sought investment opportunities in shares in construction companies in the Kyushu region on post-disaster damage repair demand after the region was hit by heavy rain overnight. Evacuation centres were set up at schools and government buildings on high ground amid reports of landslides and flooded roads. Engineering services provider Kyudenko Corp surged 4.1 percent and civil-engineering firm Wakachiku Construction Co jumped 7.9 percent.

With his house in 20 feet (6 m) of water, Ragas moved and started shrimping some 140 miles (225 km) west in another tiny fishing town on the southern tip of the Mississippi delta.  I was like 'This ain't gonna be so bad. It's almost just like home, you know, one road in, one road out',  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on his boat  Stomp the Hatch .  But it just wasn't home. We stayed over there for a few months and it just wasn't the same,  he said.  I came back and started rebuilding my house.  Like many of his neighbors, to Ragas, Plaquemines Parish, south of New Orleans, is home despite being at high risk of flooding, storm surges, rising sea levels and sinking land.  It's good food, and it's laid back and you don't have any traffic lights,  said Michael Boudreaux, 47, who fishes with Ragas and also lost his house in Katrina.  We've run from many, many, many storms and always come back to it.   But the time will come when returning and rebuilding is no longer an option, said Ragas.  One day we ain't gonna be able to come back,  he said. Chatty and cheerful, leathery from the sun and missing a leg from a freak car accident, Ragas, 45, has lived all his life - like his father before him - in Plaquemines Parish.  Last year we would work around this little marsh island and you could see it getting smaller and smaller, and I went back this year and that island's completely gone. It's like that everywhere.  Between the storms and the oil spill and the coastal erosion, I tell you, it's heartbreaking,  he said. Ragas said he would like to see a system of canals cut into the levees lining the Mississippi River that would act as flood-gates that could be opened during storm surges. Like he did with Katrina, Ragas keeps an eye on looming storms and moves his shrimp boat to safe harbors, although it cannot go more than 7 or 8 miles (11 or 13 km) an hour.  You just play it by ear,  he said.  I don't have no plan.  Refugee Fisherfolk Also shrimping in Buras is Lien Nguyen, 61, who like Ragas has no plan. Nguyen is one of thousands of Vietnamese refugees who moved to Louisiana, and she has been in the United States since 1975. A federally funded project, LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments), has been trying to reach out to the close-knit Vietnamese fishing community as part of its efforts to help residents adapt to the changing landscape. More than 60 people attended a recent LA SAFE meeting held in Vietnamese, and another 36 local residents attended a meeting with Khmer interpreters for Cambodians. Nguyen and her husband fish from a boat they repaired after they found it hanging upside-down from a causeway bridge in the wake of Katrina. Contemplating what she would do in another storm, she pointed skyward.  I don't know. I belong to God. Nobody knows,  she said.

Factories registered a 1.0 percent increase in orders in May after contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods dropped by a downwardly revised 2.2 percent in April, data from the Economy Ministry showed.  The reading for May undershot the Reuters forecast for a 2.0 percent rise, with the Economy Ministry saying the proportion of bulk orders was below average for May.  The German industrial sector is back in form and the decline in April was likely a one-off,  said Dirk Schlotboeller, an economist at Germany's Chambers of Commerce (DIHK).  Although increasing protectionism around the world is dampening the mood, business is going extremely well in Europe, Asia and also in the USA,  he said, adding that investment was finally picking up. But others were less optimistic, with Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe KG, saying the data was disappointing in view of bullish sentiment indicators such as Ifo, which showed business morale hitting a record high in June. Bookings for capital goods picked up but factories making consumer and intermediate goods saw a downturn in demand.  A breakdown of the May data showed domestic demand tumbled by 1.9 percent while foreign orders climbed by 3.1 percent, with orders from outside the euro zone surging by 4.0 percent. On the less volatile two-month comparison, orders declined by 1.1 percent but the Economy Ministry said the average order level for the April-May period was roughly at the same level as the strong first quarter. The data comes on the heels of a survey showing German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June as orders surged and manufacturers were increasingly optimistic about the outlook for production. Other recent indicators also bode well for the sector, with data from the VDMA industry association showing engineering contracts jumping 17 percent in May from the previous year. Germany's central bank and leading economic institutes have raised their estimates for German gross domestic product (GDP)growth for this year and next, pointing to a broad-based and self-reinforcing upswing propelled by vibrant domestic demand. But the government remains more cautious, forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018. This would be below the 1.9 percent in 2016, which was the strongest rate in five years.

High on his list is figuring out how to cope with the rising water eating away the land where he lives on the Louisiana coast.  One night, we might be sleeping and the water come in and we don't know, and we stuck and we trapped down here,  he said at a recent meeting seeking input from local residents on ways to adapt to the changing lowland environment.  So having a plan - we can have a plan to get out before we stuck here,  Williams told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The meeting was one in a series staged by LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments), a federally funded project to design ways of making vulnerable coastal communities more resilient to climate change and other threats. Williams lives on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish, a sparsely populated county mostly surrounded by water - the Mississippi River on one side and the Gulf of Mexico on the other. The grassy river delta is dotted with houses elevated - some awkwardly, some gracefully - on cinder-block columns. Much of the landscape is wetlands, accessible only by boat, that once were naturally rebuilt by the sediment-filled Mississippi but are now rapidly disappearing. Lined by levees designed to limit flooding, the river is funneled to the Gulf rather than depositing sediment and replenishing the wetlands along its way.  The shrinking wetlands are letting salt water intrude into the fresh water, dramatically affecting seafood harvests, while sea level rise in the Gulf is submerging land as well. Even in the face of such pressures, Williams and his friends say they would like to live their adult lives on the quiet peninsula, but worry it could be abandoned. Ghost Town? The east bank of Plaquemines Parish has lost nearly 40 percent of its population since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when levees failed and it was submerged by a storm surge of more than 20 feet (6 m) of water. Businesses did not return after the disaster, and the declining economy, combined with land loss and flood risks, has made it hard to attract and sustain jobs, according to LA SAFE. Williams said there were just four other students in his school grade this year. A lone store sells groceries in the town of Pointe à la Hache, with a population of 188 according to the last census, and the nearest gas station is nearly 30 miles (48 km) north. The closest sizable town, with doctors and dentists, is a drive of almost 40 miles and a ferry ride across the Mississippi.  To keep it from being a ghost town, it's about putting more businesses down here,  said Julius Tarrence, also 17. He wants to go away to college but return to east Plaquemines as a high-school math teacher. Williams said he sees himself going to college in New Orleans, nearly 50 miles up river, joining the U.S. Navy, and returning to open a garage to repair boats.  A lot of people down here, they have messed-up boats,  he explained. Participating in projects such as LA SAFE can help the younger generation stay in Plaquemines, Williams said.  If we get more people to get involved, if they see us leaving, doing something, coming back, giving back to the community, they'd probably want to do it,  he said.

About 66(d), the legislature is considering amendments to that particular law,   Suu Kyi told a news conference, referring to a broadly worded clause of the Telecommunications Law that prohibits use of the telecoms network to  extort, threaten, obstruct, defame, disturb, inappropriately influence or intimidate . Suu Kyi did not say what changes were planned, but Myanmar officials have indicated that the law may be changed to enable judges to release on bail those charged under the law, diplomats have told Reuters. Some Senior NLD members oppose changes to the law, which they defend as a tool for curbing hate speech and false news as internet access expands in Myanmar. Suu Kyi's defenders say the Nobel Peace Prize winner - who spent years under house arrest for opposing army rule - is hamstrung by a military-drafted constitution that keeps the generals in politics and free from civilian oversight. Reporters protest as they call on Myanmar government and military authorities to release reporters who were arrested in Yangon, Myanmar June 30, 2017.Soe Zeya TunLast month, three journalists covering an event organized by an ethnic minority rebel group, that authorities have designated an  illegal organization , were detained by the military and later arrested on suspicion of breaching a colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act. A newspaper editor is also on trial under the telecoms law over a satirical article making fun of the military. The cases have sparked outrage among the boisterous media community that has emerged in the commercial hub Yangon since the government lifted pre-publication censorship in 2012.  They have also prompted statements of concern from both the European Union and the United States. When asked about the case of the three arrested reporters, Suu Kyi said it was  not for us to comment on ... how the various cases should be tried in the court - that's for the justice sector to take care of .  This should not be seen very narrowly as three journalists against the army or vice versa, but in general, as to whether the existing laws are in line with our desire for justice and democratization,  she said, without elaborating on her position. The three journalists are due to appear in court in Shan State in the north of Myanmar on July 11. They face up to three years in prison.

The 700 pence per share offer for Novae represents a premium of over 20 percent to the London-based insurer's closing price on Wednesday. AXIS Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create an about $2 billion player in the London speciality market.  It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. AXIS is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees,  John Hastings-Bass, Chairman of Novae, said. AXIS operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America.

Sodexo, the world's second-biggest catering services company after Compass Group, said it was still confident revenue growth would accelerate in the fourth quarter due to recent contract start-ups, and kept its full-year profit growth target. Chief Executive Michel Landel told a conference call that business in France was improving, while the image of France had improved abroad since the election of French President Emmanuel Macron, which he said was  extremely favourable  for business. Sodexo, whose clients range from the Royal Ascot Racecourse in England to the U.S. Marine Corps, posted revenues of 15.984 billion euros ($18.1 billion) in the nine months to May 31, up 0.5 percent on a like-for-like basis, but below market consensus expectations of 1.2 percent growth. In the third-quarter alone, growth was 1.5 percent, which was  disappointing  when compared to the 2.5 percent Sodexo had expected, Landel said. Business was weaker-than-expected in the health care and universities sectors in north America, and in the corporate sector in Europe during the quarter, offsetting better performances at other divisions. As a result, Sodexo now expected annual, like-for-like sales to rise by between 1.5 percent and 2 percent, instead of the 2.5 percent growth previously anticipated. Sodexo, however, still expected operating profit at constant exchange rates, and excluding one-time items, to grow by between 8-9 percent in the full-year ending Aug. 31. However, Landel cautioned that operating profit growth was likely to be near the low end of that range. Looking ahead to the 2017/18 financial year, Landel said he eyed like-for-like sales growth of 2.5-3 percent, which could even rise to 3.5-4 percent, including acquisitions, although he said Sodexo would provide its official guidance only in November. In May, Sodexo announced that Landel, 65, would retire as CEO in January 2018 and would be replaced by internal executive Denis Machuel. To ensure a smooth transition, Machuel who also heads Sodexo's benefits and rewards business, will become deputy CEO as of Sept. 1, and work alongside Landel. $1 = 0.8821 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sodexo-results-idUSL8N1JX0NS"},

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was down 0.1 percent or 4.45 points to 5,758.80 at the close of trade. The benchmark fell 0.4 percent on Wednesday. Financial stocks accounted for about one-third of the losses with the Big Four banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Australia New Zealand Banking - all edging lower. Minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the pace of interest rate rises. Despite the slippage for the benchmark index, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 1.3-to-1 ratio. Sentiment in some sectors was boosted by data showing Australia's trade surplus rebounded sharply in May as coal shipments recovered faster than expected from cyclone disruptions. This put exports back on track to add to economic growth in the quarter. CSL Ltd and Newcrest Mining both climbed 1.5 percent each.

In the days since the Israeli prime minister reneged on a decision that would have allowed men and women to pray together at Jerusalem’s holy Western Wall, the outrage among American Jews is only getting worse.   The carefully-crafted agreement, adopted by Netanyahu’s cabinet in January 2016 with input from Israeli and American leaders of the Reform and Conservative Jewish movements, would have created a third area at the Wall where both men and women could pray together. In spiking the deal, and thereby keeping the genders separated, with the lion’s share of the wall reserved for men, Netanyahu has caved to pressure from the increasingly strident ultra-Orthodox partners in his governing coalition. But the prime minister’s pandering to minority hardliners has caused an unprecedented uproar among the Diaspora Jews whose political and financial support is crucial to Israel.  “Enough is enough,” wrote Isaac Fisher, a board member of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), in a pained letter to senior Israeli officials. “The time has come for the Israeli government to understand that its public includes all the people of Israel.”  Fisher, a real estate magnate and philanthropist, has asked for the return of the $1 million he invested in Israeli bonds last month and announced that he is suspending fundraising activities for Israel over what he described as Netanyahu’s “serious act of contempt” for the rabbis and leaders of U.S. communities. “Netanyahu and the ultra-Orthodox say, ‘You don’t matter. They say to our women, ‘Your Judaism isn’t Judaism’,” Fisher told the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. “We have an obligation to put an end to it.”  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Bennett Ramberg: How to stop Kim Jong Un using his nukes Mohamad Bazzi: Mosul's fall won't stop Islamic State spreading fear Jewish Canadian Charles Bronfman, a billionaire and major donor to North American Jewish causes, wrote to Netanyahu that he did not know of any other country that “denies any Jew based on denomination.” AIPAC, a powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, was so concerned that it sent an emergency delegation to meet with Netanyahu over the Fourth of July weekend.    Female Jewish worshippers pray in front of the men's section at the Western Wall.Ammar AwadAt present, the Wall, once part of the ancient temple of Jerusalem, divides men from women, with 75 percent of the space and access to more than 100 Torah scrolls reserved exclusively for men. The remaining quarter, with no scrolls, is assigned to women. Non-Orthodox Jews do not separate men and women for prayer in synagogue, but they are not allowed to pray together at the Wall except in a third section, below ground level, that is not fully excavated and invisible from the main plaza. The agreement would have given them equal space for their prayers – a principle supported by nearly two-thirds of Israelis.    Friction over how women pray at the Wall, known in Hebrew as the Kotel, has been increasing for years. In 2013, Israel police detained 10 women from Women of the Wall, a group that has been protesting gender restrictions since 1988, for chanting prayers out loud and wearing prayer shawls traditionally used by men.  The current crisis, however, takes place against a backdrop of growing ultra-Orthodox extremism and the secular majority’s dwindling patience for their demands. Orthodox political parties are incensed about a conscription law drafting young ultra-Orthodox men as part of Israel’s mandatory military service; secular Israelis resent the preferential tax treatment and state sponsorship of religious institutions that the ultra-Orthodox enjoy.  Orthodox political leaders have recently adopted more confrontational rhetoric. On July 3 Shas leader Aryeh Dery, one of the ministers who forced Netanyahu’s hand, absurdly claimed the Reform movement intends to convert thousands of African asylum-seekers (he called them “infiltrators”) to Judaism, so they could become Israeli citizens. The next day, the baseless xenophobic claim was parroted by Minister of Education Naftali Bennett, who heads the Jewish Home party.  The Israeli public is alert to the consequences of Netanyahu’s rebuff of their international supporters. The hosts of Vilensky and Bardugo, a popular afternoon drive-time radio news show, said the prime minister’s “surrender to the ultra-Orthodox… signifies a loss of Israel’s number one strategic interest, American Jews.”  A July 4th editorial in Haaretz noted the key political role played by U.S. Jews: “They push Israeli causes in the White House, lobby for budgets on Capitol Hill … defend Israel’s good name in the media, fight our wars, lock horns with our enemies and stand by our side even when they don’t agree with it.”  Another commentator, National Jewish Book Award winner Daniel Gordis, thinks that American Jews should force “a coalition crisis” for the Netanyahu government.   “Netanyahu, his party and anyone in his coalition must become toxic,” Gordis, an American-born Orthodox Jew who lives in Israel writes. “No meetings with American Jews, not in Israel and not in the U.S. Delegations that would normally meet with him should stop. Israel’s consuls-general in the US should be shunned and disinvited.”  Netanyahu seems impervious to the scale of the rage he has precipitated. After heaping praise on President Trump at the United States embassy’s Fourth of July party, he said,  I am committed to making every Jew feel at home in Israel, including at the Kotel. All we need is patience and perseverance.  He offered no details as to how he would reconcile the tension between keeping his coalition partners happy without alienating his mainstream supporters.

World number nine Nishikori said he wanted to  win the whole thing  after his first round win and the 27-year-old moved a step closer to achieving that goal with a hard-fought 6-4 6-7(7) 6-1 7-6(6) over the dangerous Stakhovsky.  My opponent is a great grass court player so I had difficulty reacting to his serves but it was good I managed to win in four sets. I'm glad I'm back and healthy,  he said, adding that his lingering hip injury was not a concern. Nishikori, who is Japan's most successful tennis player with 11 ATP Tour titles, next faces a tricky test to overcome Spanish 18th seed Roberto Bautista Agut and advance to the fourth round for a third time since his Wimbledon debut in 2008. Rising teenager Osaka put in an impressive performance to beat Czech 22nd seed Barbora Strycova 6-1 0-6 6-4 and will face five-time champion Venus Williams in the third round.  The duo were scheduled to meet in January's Auckland Open but Venus withdrew through injury, and Osaka is delighted she finally has a chance to face one of her idols.  I can't believe I'll be facing Venus Williams, someone I've been watching on TV. If it weren't for (the Williams sisters) I wouldn't be playing tennis. I feel like all my life I've been preparing for this one match. I'll do my best,  she said.

Profit reached 84.1 billion yen ($743.66 million) for the first quarter. That compared with a 85.91 billion yen Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate, based on forecasts of three analysts. The convenience store operator stuck with its 386.5 billion yen forecast for the year ending February, versus the 391.53 billion yen SmartEstimate of 19 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weight to recent forecasts by top-rated analysts. On Thursday, Seven & i also announced a business tie-up with mail order firm Askul Corp as it looks to drive more customers to its e-commerce platform. Convenience store operators are looking to defend their central position in the daily lives of Japanese consumers as a wealth of new internet businesses emerge offering products delivered directly to shoppers' homes. The operator of Japan's largest convenience store chain is expanding its network at home and in the United States, where it is spending $3.3 billion to acquire 1,100 convenience stores from Sunoco LP, bringing its total number of stores in the country close to the company's 10,000 goal. Operating profit at convenience stores abroad fell 31.5 percent in the first quarter. At home, the opening of the first Seven-Eleven store in the southern island prefecture of Okinawa in 2019 will give the chain a presence in every prefecture in Japan, where convenience stores remain a bright spot in an overall sluggish retail landscape. The retail industry is facing a shortage of labour, with Seven-Eleven Japan easing the financial burden on franchisees by cutting royalty fees from September and introducing labour-saving measures in stores. $1 = 113.0900 yen Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Christopher Cushing","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/seveni-hldgs-results-idUSL3N1JX272"},

Combined with recent upbeat reports on consumer and business spending, economic growth now looks likely to have picked up from the March quarter's disappointing 0.3 percent pace. Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the trade surplus surged to A$2.47 billion ($1.88 billion) in May, up from a downwardly revised A$90 million in April and more than twice market forecasts of A$1.1 billion. Exports of coal alone jumped 62 percent to a cool A$5 billion as mines rushed to resume shipments after Cyclone Debbie tore up rail tracks in Queensland, one of the world's biggest coal-exporting regions. Total exports climbed 8.5 percent to more than recover April's slump, while imports edged up just 0.7 percent. Crucially for growth, export volumes were strong across the board with hard coking coal up 180 percent, semi-soft coal 58 percent and iron ore fines 5 percent. That suggests net exports made a welcome contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) in the June quarter, having been the biggest single drag on growth early in the year. Gas-Powered Surplus Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also ramping up significantly as new projects come on line, with export volumes up a huge 29 percent in May. Analysts at National Australia Bank predict the value of LNG exports will pass A$27 billion this year and near A$35 billion in 2018, overtaking coal as the second biggest earner. Australia has been on track to overtake Qatar as the world's largest LNG exporter, but just this week the Gulf state announced plans to expand its output by 30 percent.  The West's three biggest energy corporations have expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years. Australian output is forecast to reach 85 million tonnes in the next one to two years. Qatar's plans may not be a threat to Australia in the near term given the vast bulk of its LNG has already been sold on long-term contracts. Still, greater competition from such a low-cost producer as Qatar could eventually threaten markets in Asia, where Australia is currently the largest supplier to Japan and China and the second largest to Korea. Much hangs on the fortunes of the industry, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) counting on LNG exports to add half a percentage point to economic growth in both 2017 and 2018.

A government-funded research team from Seoul National University found the footage, which was filmed in 1944 by an American soldier, in the United States National Archives after a two-year hunt.  South Korea has not had its own data on comfort women and (has) been relying on Japanese and American data,  said Kang Sung-hyun, an academic on the team.  It is crucial for South Korea to have our own data for the issue of comfort women,  he said. The 18-second black-and-white clip shows seven women lined up outside a brick house, being questioned by Chinese soldiers. The women were found by U.S.-China allied forces in China's Yunnan province, the research team said in a statement.  The women were registered by U.S. soldiers, the research team said. Two of the women in the video had already appeared in previously released photos of  comfort women . The term is used to describe girls and women from South Korea, China, the Philippines and elsewhere, who were forced into prostitution in Japanese wartime military brothels. South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims. Japan and South Korea agreed to resolve the issue  finally and irreversibly  in 2015 if all conditions were met. Japan made an apology and promised one billion yen ($8.84 million) for a fund to help victims.  However, the issue continues to strain relations between the two countries. Japan wants South Korea to remove a statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women, as well as another near the Japanese embassy in Seoul, saying that the presence of the statues violates the 2015 agreement. South Korean President Moon Jae-in suggested during his campaign for a May 9 election that most South Koreans did not accept the 2015 deal negotiated by his conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, and that he could try to renegotiate it. Since the election, he has not directly addressed whether he will seek to renegotiate the pact. The issue is likely to be discussed when he meets Abe on Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

Palm climbed to has much as 2,559 ringgit ($595.53) per tonne in early trade on Thursday, in line for a fourth consecutive session of gains. [POI/] End-stocks are forecast to slightly gain in June, up 0.2 percent to 1.56 million tonnes from the previous month, according to the median of responses in a survey of nine traders, planters and analysts. This would be the lowest June stockpile levels since 2010.  Falling exports likely contributed to the rise in stockpiles, as seasonal demand ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan declined. Exports last month are forecast to drop 8.2 percent from May to 1.38 million tonnes, its first monthly drop in four months, the Reuters poll showed. Ramadan sees devotees break day-long fasts with communal feasting that increases palm oil consumption for cooking purposes in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Middle East. Buyers typically stock up on palm oil a month before Ramadan, which began in late May this year.  The weaker exports in June were due to weaker demand from China, India and the EU as the consuming countries may have stocked up ahead of the Ramadan festival,  said Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank.  Lower demand from China could be due to higher soybean imports and crushing activities.  Chinese soyoil, palm's rival oilseed, has dropped over 15 percent since the start of the year due to a glut of edible oils in the market, reducing the need for palm oil imports from top producers Malaysia and Indonesia. The survey also forecast a drop in production at 1.62 million tonnes in June, down 2.1 percent from 1.65 million tonnes in May. Palm oil output is expected to rise in line with seasonal trends in the second half of the year, but June production is seen falling due to Eid-al-Fitr, the holiday which marks the end of Ramadan, as workers go on leave.  Production wise, we feel that growth may weaken slightly this month as workers will be on holiday to celebrate Eid,  said a trader with a plantations operator. Indonesia and Malaysia, which produce nearly 90 percent of global palm oil, are Muslim-majority countries that observe Ramadan and Eid, leading to a shortage of workers to harvest fruit. The median figures from the Reuters survey imply Malaysian consumption of 285,619 tonnes in June.  Official data will be released by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board after 0430 GMT on July 10.

Following a recent spate of arrests of reporters, the United States and the European Union have raised concern that despite Myanmar electing its first civilian government in about half a century, its media face increasing curbs. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) has a majority in parliament - and many of its lawmakers are former political prisoners - but the party has not until now prioritized repealing laws that previous governments used to quash dissent.  About 66(d), the legislature is considering amendments to that particular law,   Suu Kyi told a news conference, referring to a broadly worded clause of the Telecommunications Law that prohibits use of the telecoms network to  extort, threaten, obstruct, defame, disturb, inappropriately influence or intimidate . Suu Kyi did not say what changes were planned, but Myanmar officials have indicated that the law may be changed to enable judges to release on bail those charged under the law, diplomats have told Reuters. Some Senior NLD members oppose changes to the law, which they defend as a tool for curbing hate speech and false news as internet access expands in Myanmar. Suu Kyi's defenders say the Nobel Peace Prize winner - who spent years under house arrest for opposing army rule - is hamstrung by a military-drafted constitution that keeps the generals in politics and free from civilian oversight. Reporters protest as they call on Myanmar government and military authorities to release reporters who were arrested in Yangon, Myanmar June 30, 2017.Soe Zeya TunLast month, three journalists covering an event organized by an ethnic minority rebel group, that authorities have designated an  illegal organization , were detained by the military and later arrested on suspicion of breaching a colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act. A newspaper editor is also on trial under the telecoms law over a satirical article making fun of the military. The cases have sparked outrage among the boisterous media community that has emerged in the commercial hub Yangon since the government lifted pre-publication censorship in 2012.  They have also prompted statements of concern from both the European Union and the United States. When asked about the case of the three arrested reporters, Suu Kyi said it was  not for us to comment on ... how the various cases should be tried in the court - that's for the justice sector to take care of .  This should not be seen very narrowly as three journalists against the army or vice versa, but in general, as to whether the existing laws are in line with our desire for justice and democratization,  she said, without elaborating on her position. The three journalists are due to appear in court in Shan State in the north of Myanmar on July 11. They face up to three years in prison.

Wood improved to 10-0 on the season after allowing three hits and walking two on 85 pitches to lower his ERA to 1.67. It was his 13th consecutive start without a loss, the longest streak by a Dodgers pitcher to open the season since Rick Rhoden went 19 straight in 1976. Wood followed up Kershaw's performance Tuesday night, when the three-time NL Cy Young winner also threw seven shutout innings in a 4-3 victory against the Diamondbacks.  You see your teammate, in Clayton, the way he goes at guys, prepares, pitches every game like it's conceivably his last,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.  Every time Alex takes the mound, he has that pitching-with-a-purpose mentality.  Wood showed rare emotion during a matchup between the top two teams in the NL, pumping his fist several times after making the final out of an inning. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at DodgersArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch I don't know how often you get two teams that are 50-plus wins before the All-Star break playing each other, especially in the same division,  Wood said.  It felt a little bigger tonight.  The Dodgers scored in the second. Chris Taylor singled up the middle with one out, and Yasmani Grandal hit the first pitch from Arizona starter Zack Godley into the left-center-field gap for a stand-up double and his third RBI of the series. It was also Grandal's 18th double of the season, moving him into a tie among major league catchers with Salvador Perez of the Kansas City Royals. The first-place Dodgers moved 4 1/2 games in front of the Diamondbacks in the NL West standings with their 22nd win the past 26 games and fifth shutout since June 20. Godley (3-3) held the Dodgers to three hits and one run over 5 2/3 innings, striking out six and walking one. Godley came in holding opposing hitters to a .191 average, second among NL starters with at least nine starts. Los Angeles batters were 3-for-19 off Godley (.158) before he exited after 92 pitches.  I felt good, I felt like I commanded the zone pretty well,  Godley said.  They took advantage of a couple mistakes.  Pedro Baez relieved Wood to start the eighth and threw five consecutive balls before getting three straight outs. Kenley Jansen then came on for the ninth and recorded his 20th save in 20 opportunities this season. Wood needed only six pitches to record the first three outs and was at 29 pitches through three innings. He encountered his first threat in the fourth when Ketel Marte walked to lead off the inning and Jake Lamb slapped a two-out double down the left field line, Arizona's first hit. With runners on second and third, Wood struck out his third batter of the inning, Brandon Drury, to escape the jam.  They certainly delivered a 1-2 punch on us,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said of Wood and Kershaw. Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner doubled with two outs in the first for his third extra-base hit of the series. Turner went 1-for-3 and is batting .384, tops among major league players with at least 200 at-bats. That mark would also be the fourth-highest at the All-Star break since 1969. The only players with a higher average were Larry Walker (.398 in 1997), Tony Gwynn (.394 in 1997) and Andres Galarraga (.391 in 1993). NOTES: Dodgers UT Chase Utley started at first base for the ninth time this season and 34th time of his 15-year career. He went 0-for-3 with a hit by pitch and remains one RBI shy of 1,000 for his career. ... Arizona 1B Paul Goldschmidt went his fifth straight game without an RBI, and 3B Jake Lamb didn't knock in a run for a fourth straight game. Goldschmidt leads the NL with 66 RBIs, and Lamb is second with 65. ... Arizona CF A.J. Pollock was not in the starting lineup a day after returning from seven weeks on the DL with a groin strain. He pinch-hit to lead off the eighth, prompting Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to relieve LHP Alex Wood after his warmups. Pollock walked on four pitches off RHP Pedro Baez.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED76NLMIAY"},

Peter Fleet, Ford's Asia-Pacific chief, said the first quarter had been difficult after a purchase tax on small-engine  cars rose to 7.5 percent from 5 percent previously. Although Ford's China sales declined 7 percent in the first-half from the same period a year ago, they were up 7 percent in the second quarter. Sales for June alone climbed to more than 100,000 vehicles with deliveries of sedans including the Escort and Mondeo, which were hurt by the tax increase, improving.  I would expect to see for the third quarter strong single digit percentage growth (for) the industry. That's certainly how it looks to us based on the run rate and how the month of July has opened up,  Fleet said in an interview. Ford's level of discounting tracked an overall 4 percent price decline for the industry so far this year.   I'm not interested in driving our prices down to drive market share,  Fleet said.  Year-on-year comparisons will  get a bit tricky  in the fourth quarter because sales rose so fast at the end of 2016 as consumers rushed to buy cars before the purchase tax went up, he added.  The purchase tax on small-engine cars is set for another increase back to its normal 10 percent rate in 2018. Ford aims to focus its efforts on the sport-utility vehicle market, the fastest growing segment in China, with plans to launch a new version of the EcoSport small SUV later this year. Outside of China, Ford continues to post positive sales growth in Southeast Asia, India and Australia, he said.

German defense officials have said they want a low-risk heavy-lift helicopter that already exists, which means the likely supplier will be one of the two biggest U.S. weapons makers - Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Airbus officials say they do not have a helicopter large enough for Germany's likely military's needs, but want to take a close look at the requirements when they are released by the defense ministry, a move that could occur next year. Europe's biggest aerospace company and seven German firms including engine maker MTU Aero Engines said on Wednesday they had teamed up to push for a management and maintenance role in the project.  This is about the future of the German helicopter industry,  Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland, told Reuters at a helicopter conference in northern Germany. The Defence Ministry has proposed spending 3.84 billion euros ($4.35 billion) for the project through to 2029, although the program must still be approved by parliament. The German firms want the ministry to split the procurement of the helicopters from the work of certifying, managing and maintaining the new aircraft that will go on for decades. This program is  too big for Germany industry not to be involved,  Airbus's Stefan Woelfle told military officials and industry executives at the conference.  There's nothing else on the horizon,  Schoder said, noting that German law did not require a specific amount of German content on major weapons systems, and that many German firms in the sector had been hit hard in recent years by a drop in demand linked to declining oil prices. 'Nothing Ruled Out' Airbus and Boeing worked together for five years on a possible heavy-lift helicopter but dropped their plans in 2012 after realizing the effort would be too costly.  Boeing's CH-47 Chinook, already used by eight other NATO countries, will now square off against Lockheed's Sikorsky CH-53K, a redesigned version of the CH-53G that Germany now flies and which the U.S. Marine Corps plans to start using in combat in 2019. Senior executives from both firms attended the conference. Wednesday's surprise announcement by Airbus follows talks between U.S. and German firms, and reflects growing concerns in German industry about how much work would be left for them. Boeing and Lockheed already work closely with German industry and have said they would seek to form partnerships to build and maintain a future German helicopter. If the ministry decided to award a single contract that included procurement and system maintenance, then Airbus would have to look for a partner and negotiate good terms, but it could also consider submitting a bid of its own, Schoder said. He said Airbus could bid as a prime contractor, offering a U.S.-made helicopter made by a partner, though any future moves would depend on the terms of the contract.  I'm not ruling anything out,  he said.

Peter Fleet, Ford's Asia-Pacific chief, said the first quarter had been difficult after a purchase tax on small-engine  cars rose to 7.5 percent from 5 percent previously. Although Ford's China sales declined 7 percent in the first-half from the same period a year ago, they were up 7 percent in the second quarter. Sales for June alone climbed to more than 100,000 vehicles with deliveries of sedans including the Escort and Mondeo, which were hurt by the tax increase, improving.  I would expect to see for the third quarter strong single digit percentage growth (for) the industry. That's certainly how it looks to us based on the run rate and how the month of July has opened up,  Fleet said in an interview. Ford's level of discounting tracked an overall 4 percent price decline for the industry so far this year.   I'm not interested in driving our prices down to drive market share,  Fleet said.  Year-on-year comparisons will  get a bit tricky  in the fourth quarter because sales rose so fast at the end of 2016 as consumers rushed to buy cars before the purchase tax went up, he added.  The purchase tax on small-engine cars is set for another increase back to its normal 10 percent rate in 2018. Ford aims to focus its efforts on the sport-utility vehicle market, the fastest growing segment in China, with plans to launch a new version of the EcoSport small SUV later this year. Outside of China, Ford continues to post positive sales growth in Southeast Asia, India and Australia, he said.

On Wednesday, he and the Rangers gave the Boston Red Sox a good whack. Cashner pitched seven strong innings, and Rougned Odor, Jurickson Profar and Carlos Gomez each had two RBIs as the Rangers earned a much-needed 8-2 victory over Boston. The Red Sox had their six-game winning streak snapped. Cashner (4-7) picked up his first victory in more than a month for Texas, which had lost three straight and six of its previous seven games. He gave up two runs (both unearned), three hits and three walks while striking out four.  Big-time performance by Cash,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  He went out there and put a foot down. We know this is a dynamic pitcher with dynamic stuff. He proved that tonight.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RangersBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchThe Rangers' offensive attack was led by Odor, Profar and Gomez. Odor was 1-for-1 with a two-run homer, his 16th home run of the season, a walk and a hit by pitch. He also scored three runs. Profar, called up from the minors earlier in the day, was 2-for-3 with two doubles, one of them driving in two runs in the fifth off Boston starter Doug Fister (0-2). Gomez, who has hits in six consecutive games, had a solo home run and a run-scoring single as Texas played the last of a stretch of 20 consecutive games without a day off. Adrian Beltre went 1-for-4 with a double, the 601st of his career, tying him with Barry Bonds for 16th all-time. Cashner had a no-hitter for 5 2/3 innings and appeared to be headed to the seventh inning with it intact before first baseman Pete Kozma -- a replacement for Joey Gallo, who left the game in the fifth with soreness in his left hamstring -- dropped a throw from shortstop Jurickson Profar on a routine grounder. Xander Bogaerts, the next batter, belted a two-run homer.  These guys are too good to think about a no-hitter,  Cashner said.  My job is to think about one pitch at a time. Keep executing. If you don't execute ... think about the next pitch.  Having lost the first two games against Boston in this series, the Wednesday victory, Cashner said,  was huge  going into an off day and a big series with the division rival Los Angeles Angels beginning on Friday at Globe Life Park. Aside from the Bogaerts homer, Boston's only other hits were singles from Mitch Moreland, the hitter after Bogaerts in the sixth, and Jackie Bradley Jr. in the seventh.  We hit some balls hard, we hit some balls right at people,  Boston manager John Farrell said.  But make no mistake, Cashner threw one of the better games he's thrown this year. We ran into a pitcher that threw the ball well tonight.  Boston pitchers entered the game with an American League-low 2.87 ERA in their previous 14 games. However, Fister lasted only 3 2/3 innings, giving up six runs (four earned) and five hits, including two home runs, three walks and a hit by pitch. The two unearned runs were the result of his error in Texas' three-run fourth. Red Sox left-handed reliever Robby Scott also hit two batters -- Beltre and Odor on consecutive at-bats -- in the fifth inning. Odor slammed his bat to the ground but walked to first base without incident. He left the game an inning later. X-rays on his left wrist were negative. Odor's two-run homer in the second was followed by Gomez's solo shot to left in the next inning that made it 3-0. Texas sent eight men to the plate and scored three more times in the fourth.  It's a real tough pill to swallow tonight,  Fister said,  at the cost of a team loss, especially the guys in the bullpen. They're taxed, and I'm adding to that. That's a frustrating thing for me, and I'm not getting my job done.  NOTES: The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 26 minutes because of rain. ... Boston DH Hanley Ramirez went 0-for-3, ending his nine-game hitting streak. ... Texas SS Elvis Andrus was placed on paternity leave for the imminent arrival of a baby son. INF Jurickson Profar was called up from Triple-A Round Rock and will play shortstop for the duration of Andrus' absence, manager Jeff Banister said. ... Boston LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (right knee), who made his second rehab start at Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday, will meet the team in Tampa Bay and throw a bullpen. It is still undetermined whether he will make another start in the minors or be activated for bullpen duty until rejoining the rotation after the All-Star break, manager John Farrell said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED76NK07A9"},

Yet since Modi arrived on Tuesday, military ties -- for decades the secretive bedrock of India-Israel relations -- have taken a back seat. The governments have instead spent time discussing companies that sell medical devices, hi-tech and water systems. Rather than making the visit, the first by a sitting Indian prime minister, all about the value of deals signed, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Modi appear intent on playing up shared culture and values, in the hope this will give commercial ties deeper roots. Under Arab pressure, India kept its distance from Israel for  decades but is now seeing advantages in a complementary relationship with Israel. There is interest on both sides in building a broad economic base, rather than merely a contractual exchange based around defense. The timing reflects a diplomatic shift toward Israel being more accepted in the region. Modi, who is acutely conscious of the need to adopt innovation and new technology to update India's infrastructure has always had a personal affinity for Israel and came to learn more about the country before he became premier.  India and Israel are walking hand in hand into the future as partners,  Modi and Netanyahu wrote in a joint editorial this week.  From start-ups to space, communications to cybernetics, Israel's technological capabilities are merging with India's.  The two men are spending 48 hours together with Modi, accompanied by Indian business leaders, getting a political and business tour that covers Israeli history, culture and innovation, as well as the signing of economic agreements. Hopes for More Deals  What's it going to take to get Israeli money to take India seriously? Just open their eyes,  Jon Medved, CEO of Israeli equity crowdfunding group OurCrowd said.  The problem is their eyes are ... blinded by the China opportunity,  he added. There have only been a handful of Indian investments in Israel over the past decade, as opposed to the $16.5 billion received from China in 2016 alone. OurCrowd just closed three deals with India, joining with Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) for a hi-tech incubator that helps to grow young companies in Jerusalem, bringing Israeli technology to India with Reliance Capital (RLCP.NS), and collaborating with India's Lets Venture to invest in start-ups. During Modi's visit, Zebra Medical Vision, a company from a kibbutz near Tel Aviv, and Bangalore-based Teleradiology Solutions will sign a partnership to use analytics in 150 health-care centers. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they deliver joint statements during an exchange of co-operation agreements ceremony in Jerusalem July 5, 2017.Amir CohenLooking to reorient Israel's economy toward Asia, Netanyahu hopes more deals will follow, setting a goal of increasing exports to India by 25 percent in the next four years. But it may take a while before the Modi-Netanyahu relationship sparks a serious expansion in investment and trade, both of which remain relatively negligible. In many respects export-dependent Israel and India, which is focused on supplying its huge population, are complementary. Israel is a global leader in water and food systems, two critical fields India needs to upgrade. India wants to strengthen its manufacturing base and is looking to do so with technologies coming from Israel. Both countries host major diamond trading and polishing hubs. Diamond Trade Sparkles Slideshow (9 Images)Israeli exports to India last year totaled $1.15 billion, excluding diamonds, just 2.5 percent of total exports. Bilateral trade was less than $2 billion, which jumped to $4.13 billion including diamonds. Israel's foreign direct investment in India totals only $100 million.  It's nothing, it's a blip. Why hasn't the relationship grown to the level it should have?  said A. Didar Singh, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce. Singh said more needed to be done to ease regulations, lower non-tariff barriers and solve licensing problems. Incentives and lifting of red tape could help overcome what diplomats, lobbyists and business owners say is a cultural divide between the breakneck pace of Israel's start-up scene and India's more gradual approach. It can take time to cement negotiations in India, where building trust and a relationship is paramount, said Elias Ghosalkar, a former investment banker from Mumbai who is director of corporate development for OurCrowd after moving to Israel last year.   Israelis on the other hand are quite direct and lack patience in their business approach,  he told Reuters. Israel's ambassador to India, Daniel Carmon, said it is becoming easier to do business between the two countries, even if there may remain some differences in practice.  It could be that the Israeli businessman arrives on a Monday flight and wants to return on Thursday with a deal in hand. I say to him 'forget it'. It's not going to happen. There are processes, the processes take time, not four days,  he said. Editing by Luke Baker and Peter Millership","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/israel-india-modi-idUSL8N1JW19Z"},

German defense officials have said they want a low-risk heavy-lift helicopter that already exists, which means the likely supplier will be one of the two biggest U.S. weapons makers - Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Airbus officials say they do not have a helicopter large enough for Germany's likely military's needs, but want to take a close look at the requirements when they are released by the defense ministry, a move that could occur next year. Europe's biggest aerospace company and seven German firms including engine maker MTU Aero Engines said on Wednesday they had teamed up to push for a management and maintenance role in the project.  This is about the future of the German helicopter industry,  Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland, told Reuters at a helicopter conference in northern Germany. The Defence Ministry has proposed spending 3.84 billion euros ($4.35 billion) for the project through to 2029, although the program must still be approved by parliament. The German firms want the ministry to split the procurement of the helicopters from the work of certifying, managing and maintaining the new aircraft that will go on for decades. This program is  too big for Germany industry not to be involved,  Airbus's Stefan Woelfle told military officials and industry executives at the conference.  There's nothing else on the horizon,  Schoder said, noting that German law did not require a specific amount of German content on major weapons systems, and that many German firms in the sector had been hit hard in recent years by a drop in demand linked to declining oil prices. 'Nothing Ruled Out' Airbus and Boeing worked together for five years on a possible heavy-lift helicopter but dropped their plans in 2012 after realizing the effort would be too costly.  Boeing's CH-47 Chinook, already used by eight other NATO countries, will now square off against Lockheed's Sikorsky CH-53K, a redesigned version of the CH-53G that Germany now flies and which the U.S. Marine Corps plans to start using in combat in 2019. Senior executives from both firms attended the conference. Wednesday's surprise announcement by Airbus follows talks between U.S. and German firms, and reflects growing concerns in German industry about how much work would be left for them. Boeing and Lockheed already work closely with German industry and have said they would seek to form partnerships to build and maintain a future German helicopter. If the ministry decided to award a single contract that included procurement and system maintenance, then Airbus would have to look for a partner and negotiate good terms, but it could also consider submitting a bid of its own, Schoder said. He said Airbus could bid as a prime contractor, offering a U.S.-made helicopter made by a partner, though any future moves would depend on the terms of the contract.  I'm not ruling anything out,  he said.  Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Michael Nienaber and John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/airbus-germany-military-idUSL8N1JW5F4"},

Many analysts say Beijing's deleverging campaign will pressure growth as the property sector cools in response to policy curbs, even as top leaders have pledged to maintain economic stability ahead of a key party meeting later this year.  We expect June's data release to show overall steady growth with industrial production momentum maintained,  economists at UBS said in a research note.  Slower credit growth and higher funding costs due to supervisory tightening are expected to have an effect on fixed-asset investment and activities later in the year.  China's industrial output is seen up 6.5 percent in June from a year earlier, matching the rise in May, according to a Reuters poll of 34 economists. Retail sales were expected to grow 10.6 percent, easing slightly from a 10.7 percent rise in May, while fixed-asset investment was predicted to increase 8.5 percent in January-June from a year earlier, versus a rise of 8.6 percent in the first five months, the poll showed. Authorities have tightened rules to force banks to deleverage - as part of steps to control debt risks, pushing up money market rates that have started to spill over into the real economy. Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating in May, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. Policy insiders say the central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in the coming months to support economic growth and job creation. China's exports are seen up 8.7 percent in June from a year earlier, while imports are set for a 13.1 percent rise, according to the Reuters poll, producing a trade surplus of $42.4 billion. China's exports rose a stronger than expected 8.7 percent in May as global demand improved, while imports jumped 14.8 percent despite falling commodity prices. Gdp Puzzle China will release second-quarter gross domestic product(GDP) on July 17, along with June industrial output, retail sales and January-June fixed asset investment.  Analysts are awaiting a few other June data releases before fine-tuning their April-June GDP forecasts, though some expect it will be slightly weaker than the solid first quarter pace of 6.9 percent. Both the official and private factory surveys painted a robust picture for June thanks to stronger demand, though even here signs of stress were evident in median and small firms. China's producer price index (PPI)) is tipped to rise 5.5 percent in June from a year earlier, flat from May when factory gate inflation eased for the third straight month on tumbling raw materials prices. The consumer price index (CPI) is seen up 1.5 percent year-on-year in June, also matching that in May, when consumer inflation quickened from April's 1.2 percent. Beijing is targeting consumer inflation at 3 percent this year, unchanged from 2016. Besides the campaign to reduce high levels of debt across the economy, authorities have also been busy trying to stabilize the yuan by curbing capital outflows.  That seems to have paid off with the currency pushing higher against the dollar in recent months. And China's foreign exchange reserves are expected to edge up in June to $3.06 trillion, rising for a fifth consecutive month as capital curbs and a weakening dollar helped staunch money outflows.  China is due to announce foreign exchange reserves data on Friday, followed by inflation and trade data on Monday and Thursday respectively, while loan and money data is expected anytime from July 10-15.  Loans Seen Up Amid Shadow Banking Crackdown Loan data will also be closely watched for signs of whether the economy continued to build up more debt, amid signs that banks have shifted more credit back onto their books in response to the shadow financing clampdown. Chinese banks are seen extending 1.2 trillion yuan ($176.47 billion) in new loans in June, up from 1.11 trillion yuan in May. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers' acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, fell sharply to 28.9 billion yuan in May from 177 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data.

Grow a new skin? Chop off a few heads? For Zeng Xiaoxian, that seemed like the best shot. ​Unable to compete with her boyfriend's obsession with the hugely popular and top-grossing online game  Honour of Kings , the unemployed 23-year-old from Zhejiang province figured she might as well join him.  So began Zeng's journey through Tencent Holdings' fantasy world of kings, queens and life-or-death adventures. A journey that has practically become a full-time job.  I'm out of work at the moment, so apart from when I'm eating or sleeping I play  Honour of Kings  non-stop until the system kicks me out. A rough estimate would be at least eight hours,  she said. Honour of Kings, a fantasy multiplayer role-playing battle game, is the most popular mobile game in China with around 55 million daily active users, more than Pokemon Go at its peak, and it's the highest-grossing mobile game in China. Its massive success, however, has drawn scrutiny from China's official media - which described it as  poison  - as well as parents and teachers amid concerns that children are becoming addicted to the game. Half of those playing it are below 24 years of age, according to Chinese mobile data firm Jiguang. The main criticism of  Honour of Kings  is not due to its violent content, but more about concerns over addiction. China's communist party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, cited examples of teenagers stealing money to spend on game features and also a case of alleged suicide.    FILE PHOTO: Tencent's booth is pictured at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason Lee/File PhotoOn Sunday, Tencent, which has a portfolio of more than 200 games, said it would limit  Honour of Kings  players below 12 years of age to one hour of play time each day, while those aged 12 to 18 would be limited to two hours a day.  The secrets to its success include the fact that games are relatively short at around 20 minutes for each and  Honour of Kings  is seen as a social tool, with scores of players telling Reuters it now played a huge part in their social lives.    It's not just a game, but it's now becoming a crucial part of my social life ... It's crazy, like everyone is playing, and I just don't want to be left out, said Crysal Xu, a 20-year-old university student living in Toronto.   I am totally addicted to it. I play it during lunch time, class breaks, bus-waiting periods.   Liu Jie, a 24-year-old who works for a local government was caught red-handed when officials from the local disciplinary inspection department burst into his office only to find him playing  Honour of Kings . For Liu, who said he had to write a letter criticizing his actions, the game is also a spectator sport of sorts.   Sometimes, you log on not to play the game, but also to check which friends of yours are online, to see how well they have been doing in the battles,  Liu said.

Lacking his good stuff, he fought his way into the sixth before four relievers had to weave through a procession of baserunners to complete Colorado's 5-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds. Gray was 7-for-66 (.106) lifetime with 41 strikeouts when he teed off on Scott Feldman's 90 mph sinker and belted it an estimated 467 feet to center field.  You don't want to give up hits, period, to pitchers,  Feldman said.  I feel like you should get the pitcher out every time. So, to pretty much lose the game on that, not a good feeling. But at the same time, I threw the ball right down the middle, and you can't really do that.  The home run was a two-out, two-run shot in the second inning. It was the longest homer hit by a Colorado player this season. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RockiesCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch I was kind of amazed, too,  Gray said.  But I was just thinking to myself, 'Touch every base. Don't do something stupid. Just touch every base, get inside and go get the next three guys out.'  Pat Valaika hit his sixth homer, a two-run shot in the fourth that gave the Rockies a 4-1 lead after Gray yielded a run in the top of the inning. Valaika had a career-high three hits and drove in a third run with a two-out single in the eighth. Closer Greg Holland struck out Arismendy Alcantara but threw a wild pitch on the third strike, allowing Alcantara to reach base to open the ninth. Holland then got speedy Billy Hamilton to ground into a double play. Zack Cozart singled, and Joey Votto walked as Holland carefully pitched around him. Holland then lunged for Scooter Gennett's hard one-hopper, knocked the ball down and threw him out to earn his 28th save in 29 opportunities and seal just the third win in 14 games for the Rockies. The loss was the Reds' 16th in their past 19 road games. Gray (2-0) gave up eight hits and three runs (two earned) in 5 1/3 innings with one walk and five strikeouts. Votto led off the fourth with a triple when left fielder Raimel Tapia misplayed the drive, which went over his head and off the wall. Gennett followed with a run-scoring single, beating the Rockies' shift and grounding the ball to the right of third baseman Nolan Arenado to trim the Rockies' lead to 2-1. Gray yielded three consecutive singles to begin the sixth, the last a run-scoring hit by Eugenio Suarez that cut Colorado's lead to 4-2. Gray then struck out Scott Schebler and Jose Peraza before Tucker Barnhart singled to load the bases, ending the right-hander's 108-pitch outing.  I didn't have a feel for anything, really,  Gray said.  Fastballs were cutting, fading away. Slider wasn't very sharp. But we did the best we can to move locations -- go up and in, go down and away. I think that's what helped out.  Scott Oberg came on to face pinch hitter Adam Duvall and got him to ground to third, but perennial Gold Glove winner Arenado bobbled the ball for his third error, allowing a run to score and make it 4-3. Feldman (7-6) gave up five of Colorado's six hits and four runs in five innings with one walk and six strikeouts.  I didn't have the best stuff, fastball command tonight,  Feldman said.  And it's a battle going up against a good team like that when you don't have your best stuff, your best command. Unfortunately, I gave up a couple of big hits there and lost the game. It's never a good feeling.  NOTES: The game-time temperature was 97 degrees, tied for the second hottest at the start of a game in franchise history.

The price of spot cargoes from Australia's Newcastle port , the world's largest thermal coal export harbour, have jumped 23 percent since mid-May to close on Wednesday at $87.90 a tonne. While still negative for the year, the recent rally has taken Newcastle coal close to the $93.50 a tonne it fetched at the end of last year. The strong gains appear justified by supply and demand fundamentals, with vessel-tracking data showing a tightening of seaborne supplies in June to China, the world's top importer of the polluting fuel. China's seaborne imports totalled 17.77 million tonnes in June, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. This figure is filtered to show only vessels that have discharged cargoes and the final numbers may vary slightly to account for ships that arrived before month-end and are still in the process of unloading. The ship data also doesn't perfectly align with official customs figures given differences as to when cargoes are booked as having unloaded, but the vessel-tracking has proven to be an accurate indicator of trends in China's coal imports. The June figure for seaborne imports is 3.35 million tonnes lower than the 21.12 million reported in May, and is the lowest monthly total since February, according to the data. Shipments from Australia were largely steady in June at 7.84 million tonnes, compared to May's 7.81 million. However, imports from number two supplier Indonesia were sharply lower, dropping to 6.31 million tonnes in June, from May's 9.47 million and April's 9.83 million. While May and April were strong months for Indonesian shipments to China, the decline in June made it the weakest month since February, a month in which imports were affected by the Lunar New Year holidays. Weather's Starring Role Exports from Indonesia, China's largest supplier of seaborne coal, were curbed by heavy rainfall in June, which caused flooding and disruptions to mining operations. A short strike at mines owned by Glencore in Australia's Hunter Valley coal region contributed to sentiment driving prices higher, even if the labour action didn't have much material effect on coal exports. On the demand side in China, a drop in output of as much as two-thirds from hydropower plants because of excessive rains pushing rivers to flood levels has boosted demand for coal-fired power as a replacement. Chinese thermal coal prices have spiked higher in line with those in Australia, with the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange futures gaining almost 16 percent from the recent low in early May to Wednesday's close of 588.2 yuan ($86.50) a tonne. Spot coal at China's Qinhuangdao port SH-QHA-TRMCOAL has also moved higher, reaching 590 yuan a tonne on Wednesday, up 4.4 percent from the recent low of 565 yuan on June 14. It's worth noting that Chinese domestic prices are below the Newcastle spot price, meaning that imports are now more costly, especially once the cost of freight and taxes is added in. This suggests that the spike in Newcastle prices is unlikely to persist, especially if export volumes from Indonesia recover from weather disruptions. At the same time, China is likely to be able to ramp up hydropower once the threat of flood damage recedes, which will likely lower demand for thermal power generation. The rally in coal prices is likely more of a seasonal and temporary factor than a signal that higher prices will be sustained.

This is not good news, but it was expected and markets I think will be neutral because of the ongoing political stand-off,  said a regional equities fund manager. The index is down 10 percent since June 5, when the diplomatic crisis erupted. Fund managers believe further sanctions, such as a pull-out of bank deposits, remain quite possible in coming days or weeks, but they may hurt the Qatari economy rather than cripple it.

Fernandez, 22, is part of a small group of young business people finding opportunities in Venezuela's crisis, building companies in their neighborhoods at a time when many peers are seeking their fortunes abroad.   Right now there is a movement of entrepreneurs who have decided 'we are not going anywhere.' Venezuela will always be our center of operations,  said Fernandez, who markets his products with the slogan  Made with love in Caracas.    Working out of a cramped basement workshop, Fernandez's company Simple Clothing is tiny, selling a few dozen articles a month to the United States, Spain and Britain. But the foreign currency earned goes a long way in a country where many professionals make less than $40 a month. Triple digit inflation, a recession the central bank says shrank the economy almost a fifth last year and chronic shortages mean socialist-run Venezuela is not the first place that springs to mind to start a company. The World Bank lists it the fourth-hardest place to do business among 190 countries, ranked between Libya and war-ravaged South Sudan. It takes an average of 230 days to open a Venezuelan business, and just six in neighboring Colombia.  Fernandez's designs of the capital's metro map, its shanty towns and the country's favorite candy brands are popular among the growing diaspora of Venezuelans. He has opened his production to other designers to help them earn hard currency and ride out the recession.   Like other young businessmen he sees running a business as a way of helping Venezuela survive its current decline. There are even some upsides in the topsy-turvy economy.  Simple Clothing's individualized export business is viable in part because distortions created by multiple currency and price controls make the cost of sending a package abroad much lower than in nearby countries .   Shipping from Venezuela is currently super cheap, and it is something we can offer our clients,  said Fernandez.  We can send it at no extra cost to them.  For example, to send a small package to Spain from Venezuela by Fedex costs just $1.50 at Venezuela's widely used black market rate.  It would cost $56 to send the same package from Mexico, more than the $36 Fernandez sells his sweatshirts for. In bolivars, his clothes are unaffordable for most Venezuelans at home.  Fifteen seamstresses work by contract for specific orders, giving the company flexibility to adapt to occasional scarcity of the right cloth, as well as riots that force them to shutter up several times a week. The flexible hours also give workers time to scour supermarkets for food.  What Fernandez calls  the Venezuelan factor  means orders are occasionally late. One of the couriers Fernandez uses, DHL, in June postponed flights to and from Venezuela indefinitely. DHL did not give a reason, but several airlines have stopped flying to Venezuela because they are unable to repatriate earnings.  Looking for Alternatives Farmers work at an urban farm in Caracas, Venezuela June 30, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsDespite the challenges, Wayra, a startup accelerator run by Spain's Telefonica, has helped set up 45 tech-oriented companies in Venezuela over five years.  Thirty five are still in business, including MundoSinCola, an app that helps save time in Venezuela's infamous lines at banks and government offices. Wayra's director in Venezuela Gustavo Reyes estimated there were now 20 startups a year in Venezuela, and with better conditions there could be 10 times that.  Startup Weekend, an organization that runs boot camps for entrepreneurs, held six events in four cities in Venezuela last year but has postponed this year because of the crisis. Ideas at Startup Weekend last year included a mobile application to tell you which supermarkets contained scarce products, said Karina Taboelle, a speaker at the events.  The crisis has had a positive side in that it has pushed people to look for alternatives, to find solutions focused on the situation in the country,  she said. Slideshow (6 Images) Out Into the Street  To weather shortages, chef Carlos Garcia, who trained at Spain's legendary El Bulli restaurant, travels deep into Venezuela for supplies for his eatery, Alto, the only Venezuelan business on the coveted 50 Best Latin American restaurants list.  I used to pick up the phone and the things arrived,  Garcia said at a recent lunchtime.  The crisis made us go out into the street and work directly with producers.   Now, Alto buys produce from an urban farm in Caracas, from the Andean state of Merida and the tropical hills of Carora. His meat comes from the Orinoco Delta region of Monagas.   Only the olive oil and some sugars are imported,  Garcia said as waiters served meticulously placed vegetables and local staples such as black beans blended into a delicately spiced soup. A degustation menu, in which patrons sample various foods, costs 35,000 bolivars, or about $4 at the black market rate.   Critics find it offensive that Caracas' high-end restaurants are bustling at a time when it is common to see families looking though garbage for food and malnutrition has soared.  Garcia says the restaurant gives work to 32 people, who are fed twice a day. He points to a giant pot bubbling in the kitchen, cooking a soup that will feed 250 children at a local hospital. Like Fernandez, he sees building a business at a time of crisis as patriotic, calling it an act of  resistance.  The wave of anti-government protests that began in early April have taken their toll on his business located in an area that often sees clashes between protesters and police. Teargas sometimes drifts between cocoa plants in the restaurant garden.  There will be no profits this year, the goal is to break even,  he said.   Some mornings I wake up full of hope and belief that this will work out, but today for example I woke up saying, 'I'm not sure if we'll make it.'

The dual investment mandate for the new ICD Global Sustainable Fund highlights a trend among Islamic financial firms, which are gradually embracing the concept of socially responsible investing. Islamic funds have predominantly followed passive filters that exclude sectors such as alcohol and gambling, but environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria could see them take a more proactive investment approach. The fund has $36 million in seed capital, with around $30 million coming from an unidentified Malaysian institutional investor. The rest is split between Saturna and the Jeddah-based Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD). Monem Salam, president of Saturna and the fund's portfolio manager, said it will invest in global equities screened for sharia-compliance, while integrating a proprietary ESG rating system. He said the initial focus is distributing the fund in Malaysia, but through the ASEAN fund passport - a regional agreement on cross-border investment fund marketing - the goal is to also tap Singapore and later Thailand. Growth in Islamic asset management may have slowed in some areas, but the new fund could help tap into a wider audience in the responsible investment sector, said Salam.  Over the next few years, we hope the fund can reach $100 million in size, and we would like that to be majority sourced outside of Malaysia,  the manager said. ICD will help distribute the fund in markets including the Middle East, Salam said. Saturna is a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S.-based Saturna Capital Corporation, which has $3.3 billion in assets under management.

Animal tourism in Asia has drawn increased scrutiny over the past year, partly because of a scandal involving a tiger attraction in Thailand, where wildlife authorities discovered scores of dead tiger cubs. Almost 80 percent of about 3,000 elephants at tourist venues in Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand endure poor living conditions and diets and are overworked, the non-profit said in a report.     Thailand alone has an estimated 4,000 domesticated elephants, many working in the tourism trade, along with about 2,500 wild elephants.  We want to change the demand from elephant riding and elephant shows toward activities that are elephant-friendly, such as observing elephants,  said Jan Schmidt-Burbach, a wildlife expert at World Animal Protection.  If you can ride or have a selfie with the animal, chances are that is cruel to the animal,  he told Reuters. Thailand, which registered record foreign tourist arrivals last year, has seen a rise of 30 percent in new elephant tourism venues since 2010. Ittipan Khaolamai, manager of the Royal Elephant Kraal in Ayutthaya province, north of Bangkok, which is home to around 90 elephants, defended the use of elephants as tourist attractions, saying caretakers treated the animals well.  Most mahouts look after the animals well because their livelihood also depends on the welfare of the elephant,  Ittipan added.

European markets were set for a steady open, with financial spreadbetters expecting Britain's FTSE 100 to be unchanged, Germany's DAX to open up 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 to start the day 0.1 percent higher. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.5 percent as a stronger yen depressed the outlook for export earnings. South Korea's KOSPI and Australian shares both lost 0.1 percent. China's bluechip CSI 300 index fell 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.3 percent. Trading in Asia has been buffeted this week by tensions on the Korean peninsula after North Korea fired a missile, which U.S. officials concluded was an intercontinental ballistic missile, into Japanese waters. The United States said on Wednesday it was ready to use force if needed to stop North Korea's nuclear missile programme but said it preferred global diplomatic action against Pyongyang. The Nasdaq closed up 0.7 percent on Wednesday as technology shares recovered. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat and the S&P; 500 gained just 0.15 percent. Fed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises, according to minutes released on Wednesday of the central bank's June 13-14 policy meeting. Several officials also wanted to announce a start to the process of reducing the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities by the end of August, but others preferred to wait until later in the year.  With the mixed tone from the minutes and the essential delay to the announcement of balance sheet reduction timing, there is no surprise why we are seeing the muted reaction from the markets,  Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore, wrote in a note. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dipped to 2.3232 percent, but remained near a seven-week high touched on Wednesday. The dollar retreated 0.3 percent to 112.92 yen on Thursday. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of trade-weighted peers, was little changed at 96.259.  The minutes from the June 13-14 FOMC meeting underscore that the start of the balance sheet reduction is on course for this year,  Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. macro investor services at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note.  On the interest rate front, we believe rising concerns that the slowdown in the inflation rate could be long-lasting will lead policymakers to forgo additional rate hikes this year and to only raise rates twice (total 50 basis points) in 2018.  Markets are waiting for the release of U.S. non-farm payrolls data for June, due on Friday, for a steer on Fed policy. The euro pulled back 0.1 percent to $1.13385 on Thursday. U.S. crude was up 0.75 percent at $45.47 a barrel on Thursday, on strong demand in the U.S., after tumbling by as much as 5.4 percent on Wednesday. The steep decline on Wednesday came on the back of data showing rising OPEC exports. That snapped an eight-day winning streak for U.S. oil, the longest rally in more than five years. Brent added 0.8 percent to $48.17 on Thursday, after losing as much as 5.3 percent on Wednesday. Gold prices were flat at $1,226.69 an ounce.

LOUIS -- On Monday night, the Miami Marlins will have half of the National League's representatives in the All-Star Home Run Derby in their ballpark. Giancarlo Stanton and Justin Bour got an early start on the competition Wednesday night, combining forces with teammate Marcell Ozuna to slug more than 1,600 feet of long balls. Stanton's two got Miami off to a quick 6-0 lead, then Ozuna and Bour added solo shots that provided cushion in a 9-6 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. Stanton and Ozuna each have 23 homers, and Bour has 19. Stanton and Ozuna are the first Marlins teammates to reach 20 before the All-Star break since Hanley Ramirez and Dan Uggla each clouted 23 in 2008.  For me, it's fun,  Ozuna said of matching Stanton.  He has more power than me, for sure. He can hit seven homers in a week. But it feels good to be up there with him.  Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at CardinalsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchIt took Stanton all of five pitches to set the tone Wednesday. He lined a 407-foot 1-iron off the back wall of the Miami bullpen in left-center, off Mike Leake. An inning later, Stanton drilled a 3-0 pitch 415 feet to the seats in left-center, capping a five-run rally. Miami did derive plenty of help in the second inning. Second baseman Matt Carpenter and first baseman Luke Voit lost one-on-one battles with bouncers hit hard and right at them. The errors forced Leake to get five outs, and all of the inning's runs were unearned. Ozuna, who lost the team's homer lead after Stanton's second blast, pulled even on the first pitch of the third inning. He ripped a 411-foot shot to left-center to make it 7-0, eliciting scattered boos from the crowd of 40,204.  When you go up there with a good approach and doing the right things, it feels good,  Bour said.  We have fun with this when we win; but, if we're hitting homers and we're losing, it's not fun at all.  The Marlins (38-45) crept dangerously close to no-fun zone as St. Louis (40-44) constructed a mid-game rally against ailing starter Edinson Volquez and the middle relievers. The Cardinals scored three runs in the third, getting an RBI double from Tommy Pham and a two-strike, two-out RBI single from Stephen Piscotty. After Ozuna's two-out RBI double in the fourth knocked out Leake, St. Louis responded with a sacrifice fly from pinch-hitter Jedd Gyorko in its half of the inning. Pham grounded a two-run double down the right-field line in the sixth, drawing St. Louis within 8-6 and getting the tying run to scoring position. But Piscotty bounced out to third, stranding two. That was it for the Cardinals' offense. The front-line Miami relievers -- David Phelps, Kyle Barraclough and AJ Ramos -- combined to retire nine of 10 men. Ramos pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 15th save in 16 chances. Dustin McGowan (5-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings after the departure of Volquez because of a knee injury. Volquez lasted just four innings, giving up six hits and four runs, with two walks and a strikeout.  His knee was barking on him,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  It's something that I guess he's had in the past.  Leake (6-7) left after a season-low 3 2/3 innings, yielding nine hits and eight runs, only three of them earned. He walked one and fanned two.  Leake didn't have his best stuff, but he pitched well enough to let us win,  Pham said.  That's all you can ask from your pitcher. We have to do a better job of going out there and just playing great, mistake-free baseball.  NOTES: St. Louis 3B Jedd Gyorko (left groin strain) missed his second straight start Wednesday night, with Greg Garcia again taking his place. Gyorko could return for the series finale with Miami on Thursday. ... Cardinals CF Dexter Fowler (right heel spur) went through pregame drills while wearing his cleats, an important step as he tries to return to the lineup. Fowler hadn't been able to work out in his cleats before Wednesday due to intense pain when he tried to wear them. ...

George Springer, Jose Altuve and Josh Reddick went a combined 8-for-15 with six RBIs as the Astros routed the Braves 10-4 on Wednesday night. The same trio went 10-for-16 with nine RBIs the previous game. Houston, which has the best record in the majors at 58-27, amassed 16 hits after recording 19 in a 16-4 victory that started the two-game set.  They just keep coming at you and coming at you,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  They won't let you get away with anything. The two-out and two-strike RBIs. They are a really good ballclub.  Springer, who scored three times Wednesday, and Altuve each had three hits, and Reddick drove in three runs with a pair of doubles. Springer was 7-for-10 at SunTrust Park, scoring six runs and driving in three. The center fielder is the first Astro to score at least three runs two games in a row since 2003.  It's as good as I've seen George swing the bat in my time with him,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of his leadoff man.  Everyone looks at power numbers, but these two-strike base hits are exactly what he needs to do to take his offense to the next level. ... He's got to be as dangerous a hitter as anyone in the league right now.  Related CoveragePreview: Astros at BravesHouston Astros - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchSpringer has scored 70 runs in 79 games and is batting .300 with a .374 on-base percentage, 25 homers and 55 RBIs.  I've got guys behind me swinging the bat well. It doesn't matter who it is,  Springer said.  I know if I can get to first base, that's all that matters.  The Astros had seven doubles for the third consecutive game, and Marwin Gonzalez joined Reddick with three RBIs. Braves starter Jaime Garcia (2-7) allowed 10 hits and five runs while striking out five and walking none in six-plus innings.  That's a lineup that is pretty hot right now, and you can't make one mistake,  said Garcia, who hasn't won since May 26.  I didn't get the job done again. I've got to be better.  Garcia was pulled after allowing a leadoff double to Nori Aoki in the Astros' three-run seventh inning. Jason Motte gave up an RBI single to Springer and an RBI double to Altuve before Sam Freeman surrendered a run-scoring single to Gonzalez. Gonzalez added a two-run double in the eighth off Matt Wisler as both the starters and relievers continued to struggle for the Braves (40-43). Astros starter Joe Musgrove, who had allowed nine runs over 3 2/3 innings against Seattle on June 23 before being sent to the minors, dominated in his return until wilting in the fifth inning and giving up a tying homer to Ender Inciarte. Musgrove ended up working 5 2/3 innings and allowing four runs on five hits in a no-decision. The right-hander struck out six and walked none.  I thought he was exceptional early,  Hinch said.  They came up with some big hits to tie the game, but all in all, I was very pleased with his performance. He was executing a much more aggressive game plan, relying more on his fastball, which was good to see.  Chris Devenski (6-3) got credit for the victory, striking out two and giving up a walk in 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief. Musgrove had allowed just a first-inning single by Freddie Freeman until the Braves scored four times with two outs in the fifth on four straight hits, climaxed by Inciarte's two-run homer. Garcia was allowed to hit with two runners on and delivered a two-run single to keep the inning alive for Inciarte's tying home run. Three of the first four Astros hitters singled, with Evan Gattis getting the RBI. After retiring 10 straight, Garcia gave up three runs after two outs in the top of the fifth. Springer singled in Jake Marisnick, who had doubled, and Reddick delivered a two-run double after a hit by Altuve.  We swung the bats extraordinarily well. We also pitched well,  Hinch said.  They had the one big inning, but we played as complete a baseball as we can do. There's always ways to get better, but when we get going on all cylinders, it's fun to watch.  NOTES: SS Carlos Correa was out of the Astros' lineup for what manager A.J. Hinch termed a  precautionary day off  after the All-Star Game starter jammed his left thumb on a play at the plate Tuesday.  He's doing fine. He wanted to play,  Hinch said. ... The Astros optioned LHP Ashur Tolliver to Triple-A Fresno, opening the roster spot for RHP Joe Musgrove. ... The start of the game was delayed 26 minutes because of rain. ... The Braves placed RHP Arodys Vizcaino on the 10-day disabled list because of a finger strain and recalled RHP Matt Wisler from Triple-A Gwinnett. ... As the Astros open a four-game series in Toronto on Thursday, RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (7-1, 2.69 ERA) will make his third start since a DL stint with lower back discomfort. ...

The right-hander knew what needed to be fixed and went about what he said was the toughest work week of his career. Bridwell lived up to his promise and helped the Los Angeles Angels bounce back from a disappointing stretch. Kole Calhoun homered and Cameron Maybin stole home on a delayed steal in support of Bridwell's six scoreless innings as Los Angeles avoided a sweep with a 2-1 win against the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday.  It's just kind of my mentality,  Bridwell said of his determination to come back strong from a five-run loss to the Seattle Mariners in his last start.  There's a fine line between that and just being stubborn. If it's something I legitimately believe or had to have fixed in the past, I'm going to do everything I can in my four days to get it fixed. Those four days were the hardest work week I've had in my career and I'm glad it paid off. Just kind of feels good to feel good again. I'm glad I bounced back.  Bridwell (3-1) cruised through his outing, surrendering four hits and three walks. He struck out a career-high five batters. Bud Norris pitched a perfect ninth to record his 12th save in 14 chances. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at TwinsLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchCalhoun had two hits and homered for the second straight day for the Angels, who snapped a three-game losing streak and won for the first time in seven games Minnesota dating back to 2015. Ervin Santana (10-6) posted his major league-leading fourth complete game of the year but took the loss while yielding seven hits and two walks with five strikeouts.  Those are the toughest games for a manager,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  You see some things get ugly and times and you maybe get blown out of the water. But you get an effort like that, it's hard to squander those away. They're hard to come by.  Calhoun wasted little time putting Los Angeles in front, hitting the third pitch of the game from Santana deep into the upper deck in right field for his 12th homer of the season. Runs were hard to come by with the All-Star Santana and the surprising rookie Bridwell on the mound. Santana allowed just three more hits over the next 4 2/3 innings before the Angels manufactured a run in the sixth. Maybin walked and went to third on a single by Calhoun. With two outs, Calhoun stole second base, drawing a throw, and Maybin broke for home on the delayed steal. Shortstop Jorge Polanco's return throw home was late as Maybin scored standing up with his league-leading 25th stolen base.  Mike, he's always been aggressive,  Molitor said of Angels manager Mike Scioscia.  Their team knows how to run the bases. Not surprising that they're looking to do those things in a well-pitched game to try and find a way to steal runs. We didn't execute well enough on the first and third.  Bridwell, acquired from Baltimore in April, stranded Max Kepler at third base after a leadoff walk in the second. Byron Buxton led off the third with a single and didn't advance any further as the Twins began the game 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position. Bridwell was making his fifth major league start, all this season. He allowed three runs or fewer in four of the starts, but had the five-run, 11-hit outing in six innings at home in his last start against Seattle.  He's pitched enough, not so much up here but for his career, to know that each start is a whole new world and each bullpen in between starts a whole new world to get back on track,  Scioscia said. Bridwell said he needed to stay on line with the catcher and avoid falling off to either side.  With a performance, five runs like that, I'm not going to be happy with it. That's why those four days were a hard work week for me. ... There's nothing in this game that's easy mentally, not one thing.  The Angels' Yunel Escobar was thrown out of the game after a sixth-inning strikeout, apparently upset that plate umpire Doug Eddings didn't appeal down to first base on a called check swing earlier in the at-bat. NOTES: The power went out momentarily during the fourth inning, knocking out the big video boards in the park for several minutes and causing the television broadcasts to go off air. ... Twins 2B Brian Dozier returned to the lineup after missing two games with lower back tightness. ... Angels CF Mike Trout (thumb) began a rehab assignment Class A Inland Empire on Wednesday, serving as the designated hitter. He was hitless through two at-bats. ... Los Angeles put RHP Huston Street on the 10-day disabled list with a right adductor/groin strain. The team recalled RHP Eduardo Paredes. Scioscia said the team hopes Street misses just the minimum time. ... Angels RHP Matt Shoemaker (right forearm extensor strain) had his rehab put on hold after he felt pain in his forearm during his rehab start on Tuesday. Shoemaker pitched three innings and gave up two hits, throwing 24 of his 38 pitches for strikes.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-twins-writethru-idUSMTZED76NG4667"},

The defensive consumer and health care sectors slid in the morning, losing 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, after enjoying a robust rally this year. While some doubt the strong trend in blue chips will continue, many analysts see little chance for a major downturn in stocks with solid fundamentals. Resource stocks outperformed the broader market, underpinned by expectations of greatly improved profitability amid an industry recovery and a weaker dollar, with many starting to issue upbeat forecasts for mid-year performance.

It was not immediately clear if Wanda was referring to contract or operating revenue. The company, owned by Wang Jianlin who is one of China's richest men, said at the beginning of the year it would report only operating revenue rather than contract revenue as it had done in the past.

It is Cleveland's worst start against the National League since interleague play began in 1997. Cleveland banged out 14 hits but only produced two runs. It was the first time the Indians had that many hits and scored fewer than three runs since Aug. 17, 1949, when they collected 14 hits in a 5-2 loss to the St. Louis Browns. In losing the first two games of the series, Cleveland has gone 4-for-25 (.160) with runners in scoring position. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at IndiansSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch I think some guys might be putting some pressure on themselves, and they maybe expand the zone,  said Cleveland bench coach Brad Mills, who is the acting manager in place of Terry Francona, who was in the Cleveland Clinic undergoing tests for a rapid heartbeat.  We had some pretty good at-bats, and it showed in the 14 hits and that we had more extra-base hits than them,  Mills said.  But when you don't get the hits with runners in scoring position, it can bite you.  San Diego starter Luis Perdomo (4-4) lasted five innings, giving up two runs (one earned) and nine hits with four strikeouts and no walks.  He was in battle mode the whole day,  Green said.  He had to work out of some trouble in the fifth inning, and then I thought that was enough for him.  Perdomo has worked five or more innings in 13 of his 15 starts this year and has held opponents to two or fewer runs in five of those games.  I battled, and was able to get out of some jams, so I feel pretty good about my start,  he said. Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer (7-7) pitched five-plus innings and allowed four runs (three earned) on eight hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. Francisco Lindor and Abraham Almonte each had three hits for the Indians. Leading 3-2, the Padres increased their lead in the sixth inning when they knocked Bauer out of the game. Three consecutive singles by Erick Aybar, Matt Szczur and Asuaje did the job. The Padres (36-48) added two runs in the seventh inning on a two-run homer by Spangenberg off Zach McAllister, making it 6-2. Cleveland took a 1-0 lead on an RBI single by Lindor in the first inning. That snapped the Indians' streak of 14 scoreless innings. San Diego tied it in the fourth inning on a two-out single by Asuaje. The Padres took the lead in the fifth inning. Luis Torrens led off with a single and scored on a triple off the center field wall by Pirela. Two outs later, Hunter Renfroe hit a line drive directly to shortstop Lindor. The ball glanced off Lindor's glove and into left field for an error, scoring Pirela and giving San Diego a 3-1 lead. In the bottom of the fifth, an RBI single by Lindor cut the San Diego lead to 3-2. However, four Padres relievers combined to pitch four scoreless innings to preserve the lead.  We've gone to the bullpen after five innings two nights in a row, and they've done the job,  Green said. NOTES: Indians 2B Jason Kipnis was scratched from the lineup due to neck spasms. Kipnis was replaced by INF Erik Gonzalez at second base and by CF Bradley Zimmer in the leadoff spot of the order. ... Indians 1B Carlos Santana was placed on the paternity list.

Wanda has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance [ANBANG.UL] and Fosun (0656.HK).     The property developer, which has businesses stretching from theme parks and shopping malls to sports clubs and cinema chains, said in a statement its January-June revenue reached 134.85 billion yuan ($19.8 billion), exceeding its own targets. It was not immediately clear if Wanda was referring to contract or operating revenue. The company, owned by Wang Jianlin who is one of China's richest men, said at the beginning of the year it would report only operating revenue rather than contract revenue as it had done in the past. Its operating revenue was up 3.4 percent in 2016.  The company does not provide profit figures. In the first half of this year, revenue from Wanda Commercial Properties climbed 14.2 percent to 73.5 billion yuan, while its cultural industry unit that includes entertainment companies saw sales rise 5.9 percent to 30.8 billion yuan.  Its financial group's revenue rose 46.8 percent to 20.6 billion yuan.     Dalian Wanda has purchased a slew of cinema assets globally, acquiring AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) in the United States and taking a controlling stake in U.S. film studio Legendary Entertainment last year.

Dyson mowed down three Detroit hitters in the ninth inning Wednesday night for his third save since joining the Giants from the Rangers, sealing San Francisco's 5-4 victory and pushing the Tigers one step closer to a potential payroll pruning. Hunter Pence drove in three runs with a groundout and a triple to help the Giants improve to 7-1 over their last eight games. San Francisco (34-52) is 4-1 with one game remaining on its road trip, clinching its first winning trip since the middle of last season.  This was a great win. We're just getting better all around,  San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said.  (Starting pitcher Ty) Blach did a great job. Hunter swung the bat well.  Dyson has made a good contribution. He throws strikes. It was a great move for us. He's been a big help.  Bochy eased Dyson back into a closer role, which he may have to relinquish when Mark Melancon returns from the disabled list. Detroit rallied for four runs in the seventh, but Cory Gearrin, the last of four pitchers used in the inning, struck out Justin Upton with two on to end the burst. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at TigersSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch In the seventh inning, I thought we were going to make a full comeback,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. Blach was cruising with a three-hit shutout through six innings but gave up three consecutive hits and exited without retiring a batter in the seventh. Miguel Cabrera singled to center, J.D. Martinez doubled near the line in right, and both scored when Victor Martinez bounced a single up the middle. Gearrin walked Jose Iglesias with one out and gave up an RBI single to Ian Kinsler that hit the pitcher's leg and ricocheted to third. Nicholas Castellanos hit a sacrifice fly to right to make it 5-4.  Getting hit by a ball is never fun,  Gearrin said.  Whether it turned up the intensity, I don't know, but I wanted to stay out there. I knew it wasn't going to feel good in about 20 minutes. It definitely has tightened up a bit now.  Hunter Strickland pitched the eighth, and Dyson, who was 1-6 with the Rangers, worked a perfect ninth. Gorkys Hernandez had three hits for San Francisco. Blach (6-5) walked one and struck out two and was charged with three runs. Pence drove in his first run in the third, breaking a scoreless tie on a sharp groundout to Daniel Norris (4-7) with runners on second and third and one out. Norris checked the runner and probably would have caught Kelby Tomlinson moving toward the plate but was too quick to throw to first. Jae-Gyun Hwang then lined a soft RBI single to center with two out to make it 2-0. Pence tripled home a pair of runs with a line shot to right-center in the fourth after Brandon Belt singled home a run with two outs. Nick Hundley doubled with one out and Tomlinson walked prior to Belt's single up the middle. Norris lasted four innings, allowing five runs and seven hits with two strikeouts and four walks (two intentional). There has been speculation Detroit would option Norris to Triple-A Toledo during the All-Star break since he wouldn't be starting until the week after the All-Star Game -- and Ausmus sounded as if that might occur.  Clearly we need better results than that,  Ausmus said.  For a number of reasons. It doesn't help us win games, and puts undue stress on the bullpen.  He does have a bit of a groin issue. We'll have to address that as well.  At some point we've got to mature and get past it and find a way to calm ourselves in situations that are tough or tight. You've got to be able to get through it. People that succeed at this level as pitchers learn to get through it.  The Tigers (37-46) need to get hot over the final six games prior to the All-Star break to stay out of the seller's pool. J.D. Martinez, Justin Verlander, Justin Wilson and Alex Avila have been the subject of trade rumors over the last few days. NOTES: RHP Alex Faedo, Detroit's first choice and the 18th overall selection in the June draft, signed a contract worth an estimated $3.5 million. He will report to Detroit's spring training base but won't pitch, having thrown some 130 innings for Florida this year. ... San Francisco LHP Madison Bumgarner (ribs, shoulder) gave up nine runs on nine hits in four innings for Class A San Jose on Wednesday in his third rehab start. ... Giants 3B Conor Gillaspie (back spasms) also made a rehab appearance with San Jose and could be activated Friday, manager Bruce Bochy said. ... OF Alex Presley was activated off the concussion list, with Detroit sending OF Matt den Dekker back to Triple-A Toledo.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-giants-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED76NEL44K"},

Chevrolet Impala, Ford Motor Co's Taurus and Tesla's Model S were the three sedans that got  only an acceptable rating  in a test designed to simulate what happens when the front driver-side corner of a vehicle strikes a tree or another vehicle, the IIHS said. Ford's Lincoln Continental, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp's Avalon received the highest rating overall, the agency said. In the test, the seat belt in  Tesla's Model S was not effective and could lead to the driver's head striking the steering wheel hard through the air bag, according to the report. Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email.  IIHS and dozens of other private industry groups around the world have methods and motivations that suit their own subjective purposes,  the spokesperson said. Tesla said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested. In order to get the top IIHS rating, automakers must have a frontal crash prevention system with automatic braking capabilities to prevent a rear-end collision. The vehicles must stop or slow down without driver intervention before hitting a target in tests at 12 or 25 miles per hour among other factors, IIHS said. Toyota said in a statement it is committed to developing safe and reliable vehicles. General Motors Co declined to comment, while Ford and Mercedes were not immediately available for comment. The IIHS is a research arm of the insurance industry, and its crash tests are increasingly influential in guiding vehicle safety design. Automakers strive for top ratings in IIHS tests as they do on federal crash tests.

Scandinavian countries are leading the way among 157 nations ranked by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German social responsibility foundation.  But income inequality, high consumption levels and carbon emissions put the United States at No. 42 in the list while   Russia was ranked 62nd and China 71st. The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, were approved in September 2015 by the 193 U.N. members as a roadmap to tackle the world's most troubling problems by 2030. The 17 goals, and their accompanying 169 targets, range from  halting deforestation to raising living standards, reducing child mortality and promoting global peace. The cost of their enactment has been estimated at $3 trillion a year. The SDSN, a U.N.-connected group that promotes the SDGs, said the world's most powerful nations are failing to lead the way.  A rising 'my country first' approach by many heads of government threatens the realization of the SDGs,  it said in a statement released with the report.  Not only does a rising trend of nationalism and protectionism impede the implementation of the goals, but as the report shows, industrialized countries are not serving as role models,  it said.  Many of the richest countries in the world are nowhere near achieving the global policy objectives.  Using extensive data and information submitted by nations, the report noted so-called spillovers have a major impact on measuring progress among nations. For example pollution caused in one nation can harm water quality in another or weapons production in one nation affects peace and security elsewhere. At the top of the list were Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway, with Germany and France also in the top ten. Britain  was 16th and Canada 17th. At the bottom were Central African Republic, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along with a cluster of developing nations plagued by food insecurity, extreme poverty, lack of education and violent conflict. Release of the report comes ahead of the G20 summit on Friday in Hamburg, a global forum where German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The progress report's results  highlight the need for urgent action on the part of G20 countries in making sustainable development a reality both within and beyond their borders,  said Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN director, in a statement.  If the world is to achieve the SDGs, all countries must take up the goals as part of their national development strategies and ensure that they take responsibility for their impact on the rest of the world.
