The proposed Medicaid freeze, which would deny coverage to hundreds of thousands of Ohio residents who lack job-related health insurance and cannot afford to purchase their own, was adopted as part of a $65 billion two-year budget plan. The measure, approved by mostly party-line votes in both chambers of the state Legislature, would prohibit enrollment of new Medicaid recipients, or re-enrollment of lapsed beneficiaries, after July 2018. Republicans, especially hard-line conservatives, say the Medicaid freeze is needed to help reduce costs. Democrats say halting the Medicaid expansion, begun in Ohio under the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act, would leave the state's neediest residents without coverage and ultimately raise healthcare costs for everyone. Kasich, a moderate Republican who sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and has been a vocal supporter of Medicaid expansion, could use a line-item veto against the freeze while he considers signing the broader budget legislation before a Friday deadline, his office said. Republican lawmakers could then attempt to muster enough votes to override Kasich's veto, although Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat in the state's House of Representatives, said on Wednesday she doubted whether there were enough votes to override a Kasich veto.  Instead of providing a path to the middle class for those struggling with underemployment, drug addiction and low wages, Republican leaders are gutting Medicaid, threatening healthcare access to over 700,000 Ohioans,  Clyde said in a statement after the vote. Ohio is among more than 20 U.S. states that have expanded Medicaid enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, largely with funding through federal dollars, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Congressional Republicans in Washington have sought for years to repeal the law, and Kasich has been a vocal critic of legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and a similar bill awaiting a vote in the Senate that would dismantle Obamacare.  The U.S. Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office, said this week that 22 million Americans would lose insurance over the next decade under the U.S. Senate Republican healthcare bill. Insurance losses are expected to grow beyond 22 million due to deep cuts to the Medicaid insurance program that are not scheduled to go into effect until 2025. Kasich told the New York Times earlier this month he could accept a gradual phase-out of expanded Medicaid if Congress provided states with more money than the House-passed healthcare bill would furnish with more flexibility for the state to manage its own program.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rival currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 95.843, plumbing its lowest levels since October and well below highs above 97.0 hit earlier this week. Sterling added to gains made after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that the central bank is likely to need to raise interest rates as the British economy comes closer to operating at full capacity. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi sparked the euro's rally on Tuesday, when he hinted that the ECB could trim its stimulus this year. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates this month and left the door open for further increases later in the year, though a batch of mixed economic data recently has had investors wondering whether the Fed would be able to stay on its planned tightening path. The dollar's decline  is broadly due to the re-evaluation by market participants of the relative speed of the central banks to take away easing,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bancorp Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.  The ECB and the BoE might be moving more rapidly than before, and stubbornly low inflation in the U.S. might lead the Fed to revaluate its pace as well,  he said. The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.1410 after scaling a peak of $1.1420, despite evidence that positioning for a dramatic scaling-back of stimulus might have been overdone. Draghi's remarks were intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening, and set up September as the earliest the bank would discuss rolling back stimulus, according to sources familiar with the ECB chief's thinking. The pound was up 0.2 percent at $1.2955 after rising to $1.2977 earlier, its highest since June 9. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee were split 5-3 earlier this month on whether to raise British interest rates from their record-low 0.25 percent. By contrast, Bank of Japan policymakers believed their best approach would be to maintain their current ultra-loose policy, with inflation well shy of their 2 percent target, according to a summary of the BOJ's latest meeting issued on Monday. The divergent monetary policy outlooks helped bolster the dollar against the yen, but it still edged down 0.1 percent to 112.28 after rising as high as 112.495 earlier in the session, its highest since May 17. The euro was up 0.2 percent at 128.08 yen. Earlier, it rose as high as 128.13 yen. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.7656 after earlier touching $0.7664, its highest since late March.  It looks to me as if the Aussie's benefiting from a softer dollar, but also the bounce in commodities,  said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia macro strategy for Barclays in Singapore.  Iron ore in particular has rallied, and it seems to be giving some pretty good support to the Aussie dollar,  Kotecha said. Iron ore prices continued their rise after rallying more than 3 percent on Wednesday.

Kepler smacked a 409-foot, two-run blast off the struggling Red Sox ace, and he finished with three RBIs on the night to lead the Minnesota Twins to a 4-1 win on Wednesday night at Fenway Park.  He hits 1-irons out of the ballpark,  Twins right fielder Robbie Grossman said of Kepler's power swing.  It's pretty special the kind of juice that he creates.  Kepler's big night was supplemented by a strong outing from starter Adalberto Mejia (3-3), who tossed 5 2/3 scoreless innings, allowing five hits and a walk while striking out three. The 24-year-old left-hander has not given up a run in 10 2/3 innings over his past two starts.  Similarly to his last start, he kept walking off the field with zeros,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  We needed a little bit of a pick-me-up from our starter, and he was able to provide that.  Related CoveragePreview: Twins at Red SoxMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchMiguel Sano also drove in his team-leading 53rd run of the season for Minnesota (40-36), which was outscored 13-3 in losing the first two contests of the four-game series. Xander Bogaerts drove in the lone run for Boston (43-35), which went 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position and had its modest two-game winning streak snapped.  Whether it was a breaking ball off the plate or down low in the zone, we did chase a little more tonight than we have in other ballgames,  Boston manager John Farrell said. Porcello (4-10) failed in a bid to win back-to-back games for the first time this season, giving up four runs on six hits and two walks with six strikeouts in six frames.  Six innings, four runs. It's not like they're beating the cover off the ball,  Porcello said.  It's just a couple things here and there that I got to clean up.  I'm not making excuses for myself. I definitely hold myself accountable for the loss tonight. But in the grand scheme of things, got to keep building off of what I'm doing and what we're doing.  Porcello retired the game's first two batters before Joe Mauer doubled and Sano brought him in with an RBI double. Kepler's ensuing RBI single gave Minnesota a 2-0 lead. With one on and no outs in the sixth, Kepler doubled the lead with his line-drive homer off an 0-1 fastball from Porcello that sailed into the Boston bullpen in right field.  On a night where we're scuffling to get anything going offensively, that's unfortunately looking like a big lead -- a 4-0 lead,  Farrell said. Boston brought the tying run to the plate with one away in the seventh as Dustin Pedroia walked to load the bases for Bogaerts, whose groundout to short scored a run. Mitch Moreland struck out swinging to end the threat. Mookie Betts doubled with one out in the ninth against Twins closer Brandon Kintzler, but Pedroia grounded out and Bogaerts struck out swinging to lock up Kintzler's 21st save. With the Indians' 5-3 win over the Texas Rangers, the Twins remain a half-game behind Cleveland for first place in the American League Central. NOTES: Boston DH Hanley Ramirez (left knee soreness) was not in the lineup for a third straight game.  I think the second half (of the season) is coming and I'm ready for that,  Ramirez told MLB.com. ... Red Sox manager John Farrell returned to the dugout after serving a one-game suspension for arguing a balk call and making contact with crew chief Bill Miller on Saturday. Farrell was also fined an undisclosed amount. ... Minnesota placed LHP Craig Breslow (thoracic rib soreness) on the 10-day disabled list. Breslow (1-1, 5.28 ERA) had not been on the DL since 2013, and he told the St. Paul Pioneer Press it  wouldn't be fair  to the team to try to pitch through the injury. ... The Twins also activated RHP Phil Hughes, who had been sidelined with right arm soreness, from the DL. ...

Just ask Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona.  We got a couple tack-on runs (in the seventh inning) that made the ninth inning not as nerve wracking as it could have been,  Francona said. Michael Brantley had two hits and two RBIs and Trevor Bauer pitched into the seventh inning as the Indians beat the Texas Rangers 5-3 on Wednesday night at Progressive Field. Bauer (7-6) worked 6 1/3 innings, giving up one run and four hits with three strikeouts and one walk. Texas starter Yu Darvish (6-6) pitched six innings, allowing three runs (two earned) and seven hits with six strikeouts and one walk. Leading 3-1, Cleveland added those two huge runs in the seventh inning, which began with Bradley Zimmer and Roberto Perez drawing walks from reliever Ernesto Frieri. Jason Kipnis moved the runners to second and third with a sacrifice bunt, and Francisco Lindor was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Dario Alvarez relieved Frieri, and Alvarez was greeted by consecutive RBI singles from Brantley and Edwin Encarnacion to extend the Cleveland lead to 5-1. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at IndiansTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch Those two runs really put us in a tough situation because then we had to face (Andrew) Miller and (Cody) Allen,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  We were able to chip Allen, but not enough.  Elvis Andrus' homer leading off the ninth inning against Allen made it 5-2, and an RBI single by Rougned Odor cut it to 5-3. But Allen struck out Robinson Chirinos to end the game. The Indians also had several outstanding defensive plays, the biggest coming in the sixth inning. With Cleveland leading 3-1, the Rangers had runners at first and second with one out. Adrian Beltre hit a wicked ground ball down the third base line. It looked like it was headed for the left field corner as a potential double, but Cleveland third baseman Jose Ramirez made a diving stop and threw out Beltre at first.  That play saved the inning. If Jose doesn't make that play, it's one run, maybe two,  Bauer said.  Wow,  Francona said of the play.  When Trevor is throwing the ball the way he did tonight, and we're making plays behind him, we've got a good chance to win.  Cleveland scored an unearned run in the first inning, which began with Rangers left fielder Nomar Mazara being charged with an error after failing to catch Kipnis' fly ball hit onto the warning track, allowing Kipnis to reach second base.  He got turned around, and the ball glanced off his glove,  Banister said. Lindor followed with a single to right field, scoring Kipnis with the first run of the game. The Indians added two runs in the third inning. Kipnis led off with a walk and went to third on a single to center by Lindor. Brantley followed with a single, scoring Kipnis and moving Lindor went to third. One out later, Ramirez singled home Lindor, giving Cleveland a 3-0 lead. Texas made it 3-1 in the fifth inning on a solo home run by Chirinos, who hit a 3-2 pitch from Bauer over the center field wall for his 12th home run of the season and second in as many nights, estimated at 430 feet. It's the fourth straight game in which Chirinos has homered. Bauer was removed from the game after retiring the first batter in the seventh inning. He threw 103 pitches.  He was really good, and that's against a really good lineup,  Francona said.  He really competed and got us to the point in the game where we could hand the ball to Andrew Miller, which is always a good thing.  Miller pitched a dominating 1 2/3 innings, retiring all five batters he faced, four of them on strikeouts.

On Wednesday night, the Cincinnati Reds manager nearly ran out of space.  It's just been sensational,  Price said.  Not everyone's afforded a defense like we have. While you have it, you have to exploit it. Let the defense work for you.  Scooter Gennett hit a two-run home run, and Adam Duvall added a solo shot, lifting the Reds to a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Great American Ball Park.  The night was about the defense,  Price said.  A lot of good, exciting baseball.  Right fielder Scott Schebler started things by robbing Stephen Vogt of a three-run home run in the second inning. Then, a rally-killing throw by left fielder Adam Duvall in the sixth, and a heads-up tag by second baseman Scooter Gennett to complete a game-ending double play. Cincinnati (33-44) scored the go-ahead run in the eighth when Billy Hamilton walked, stole second and third, then raced home when third baseman Travis Shaw couldn't gather Duvall's hard grounder that went for an infield hit. Ryan Braun homered for Milwaukee (41-39) in his second consecutive start since coming off the disabled list. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at RedsMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchRookie right-hander Luis Castillo made his second career start for Cincinnati and allowed two runs on five hits in 5 2/3 innings with three walks and nine strikeouts.  His stuff was electric,  Reds catcher Tucker Barnhart said.  He's working on running the ball into righties. It's going to open up so much more.  Castillo was in line for his first major league win until Shaw tied the score 3-3 with a solo homer off Tony Cingrani with two outs in the eighth. The loss was costly for Milwaukee, as right-hander Chase Anderson left the game with a strained left oblique after only one inning. The injury occurred while he was batting. Coming into Wednesday, Anderson was 11-3 with a 2.87 ERA in his previous 27 starts dating to last July.  Anytime you lose one of your five starters, it's a big blow,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  We're probably going to lose him for a pretty good bit of time here. The guy's pitching very, very well, and we'll have to cover in his absence. It's going to be difficult.  Duvall threw out Hernan Perez trying for a double in the sixth, and the tying run was left stranded at third. It was Duvall's sixth outfield assist this season, tying him with Hamilton for the National League lead. Milwaukee then had runners on first and third with one out in the ninth. Raisel Iglesias struck out Jesus Aguilar, and Orlando Arcia was caught stealing to complete a game-ending double play. Iglesias earned his 14th save. Arcia was supposed to stop, allowing Jonathan Villar to score the tying run from third, but Gennett applied the tag quickly.  Yeah, that was the play, Orlando's got to stop,  Counsell said.  For me, it was going to work, and Orlando didn't stop in time and they got a tag.  Drew Storen (2-2) got the win after striking out the only batter he faced. Corey Knebel (0-1) took the loss, walking three and allowing one run in his lone inning. After a quick 1-2-3 first inning, Castillo allowed a single and a walk to begin the second. However, Schebler made one of the finest catches of the season when he robbed Vogt of a three-run homer in the second with an over-the-head leaping grab above the right field wall. It resulted in a sacrifice fly as Shaw jogged home with the game's first run while the crowd roared for Schebler. Two batters later, Anderson struck out swinging and appeared to grab his left side.  I swung and it literally feels like somebody stabbed me in the left side,  Anderson said.  Not a good feeling. One of those injuries where you can't really pinpoint a time. It could be a month, it could be two months, hopefully nothing longer than that.  Anderson was replaced by Paolo Espino, who allowed a solo homer by Duvall leading off the second and a two-run shot by Gennett in the third that put the Reds ahead 3-2. Anderson needed just eight pitches to get through the first inning, retiring the Reds in order with one strikeout. But that was all for him. Espino settled down to retire the Reds in order in the fourth. He pitched three innings, allowing three runs and two hits with 55 pitches.

Finnegan had been on the DL since April 16 only to return Monday before leaving in the fourth inning with another injury. ...

After coming off the disabled list June 23, Cabrera, a 31-year-old veteran of more than 1,000 major-league games at shortstop, was moved to second base by Mets manager Terry Collins. Cabrera was not happy and asked for a trade. Since then, however, he has hit .476 (10-for-21).  That (trade request) was in the moment,  Cabrera, a native of Venezuela, said in Spanish.  It was a problem of communication. But that's in the past, my brother. I'm going to do my job at any position.  Cabrera, who has played 214 career games at second base, also addressed the issue in English.  I'm a professional,  said Cabrera, who also made an impressive diving catch at second base and left the game in the late innings because of what he described as minor cramping in his legs.  I've played that position before. You can see my numbers when I play second.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at MarlinsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchYou can also check the home run numbers for the Mets (35-42), who have hit a franchise-record 50 long balls this month. The last National League team to accomplish that feat was the 2006 Atlanta Braves. Meanwhile, the Marlins (35-41) had their two-game win streak snapped. They are 14-11 this month, 5-4 on this homestand and 7-5 this year against the Mets. Matz (2-1) lasted at least six innings for a ninth consecutive start, his career-best streak. He allowed six singles and one walk. Perhaps he was extra comfortable in Miami -- in three career starts at Marlins Park, he is 2-0 with a 0.99 ERA. Matz said he threw more curveballs than normal in this start.  My pitch mix is different every start based on the scouting report,  Matz said.  I'm going to stick to my strengths, but I'm also going to look to where they can do damage against me.  Miami's Jeff Locke (0-4, 5.52) took the loss, allowing three runs in 5 2/3 innings. He has yet to win in his brief Marlins career, consisting of six starts. Locke got off to a poor start as New York scored three runs in the first inning. Cabrera drilled a two-run homer to left, and Jose Reyes slapped an RBI single between third and short. It was Cabrera's seventh homer of the season.  When you give up that blast to Cabrera and that becomes the deciding factor in the game,  Locke said,  it makes you want to take that lap again.  There were no do-overs, however. And Miami, which had scored three runs in each of its past three first innings, went down 1-2-3 in the first. That, as it turned out, was indicative of what was to come.  We didn't have too many opportunities against Matz,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. The Mets extended their lead to 6-0 in the seventh. Travis d'Arnaud doubled and Jose Reyes singled to set up the rally. T.J. Rivera hit an RBI groundout, and Granderson pulled his two-run homer to right-center field for his 12th homer of the season. He has homered in three straight games, one short of his career best. New York made it 8-0 in the eighth on a two-run pinch-hit single by Brandon Nimmo. That was more than enough for the Mets, thanks to Matz and Cabrera, who gave them that quick lead two batters into the game and also played solid defense, involved in two double plays.  He can play second base -- there's no big adjustment,  Collins said of Cabrera.  He's a tremendous infielder with great hands. I'm hoping he relaxes a little bit, and he goes off on the offensive side. We need his bat.  NOTES: Miami removed LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 4.95 ERA) from the rotation, sending him to the bullpen where he allowed one run in one-third of an inning. The Marlins will need a starter on Saturday, and it could be RHP Tom Koehler, who is on a minor-league rehab assignment. ...

Mets OF prospect and ex-NFL QB Tim Tebow struck out on three pitches in his first at-bat since being promoted to High-A St. Lucie. But he later homered. ...

Ricketts invited President Trump to see his team play the first-place Washington Nationals as the series comes to an end Thursday.  We're going to run into these guys in the playoffs, and you'll come down and you'll see them crumble,  Ricketts told Trump of the Nationals, according to published reports. That was certainly not the case Wednesday, as the Nationals led by five runs after two innings and defeated the defending World Series champions 8-4 as Stephen Strasburg struck out 13 Cubs in seven innings while dealing with back spasms.  My arm feels really good. I am just taking it one start at a time,  said Strasburg (9-2), who is pitching out of the stretch this year even with no runners on base. The Nationals hit three homers and four doubles in support of Strasburg, who appeared to get negative feedback from Cubs catcher Willson Contreras at one point.  I don't know what he was talking about,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said of Contreras. It was not a good day for the Cubs, who designated veteran catcher Miguel Montero for assignment before the game then saw reigning National League MVP Kris Bryant leave the game in the fifth inning after he rolled his ankle on third base following a catch in foul territory. Bryant has a moderate right ankle sprain. X-rays were negative, according to a team spokesman. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at NationalsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchMaddon said Bryant will not play in the series finale Thursday, and that he  obviously  will stay off his feet a few days.  I was watching closely. It was more painful than you would think,  Maddon said.  I wanted to get him off the field quickly and get it iced as quickly as possible.  The losing pitcher was John Lackey (5-9). He gave up a season-high eight earned runs on nine hits (three homers) with two walks, a wild pitch and hit batter in 5 1/3 innings.  I think it was a matter of location and lack of execution,  Maddon said. Anthony Rendon was 3-for-3 with a homer and Bryce Harper was 2-for-4 with two RBIs. They helped Washington score in five of the first six innings.  He is a very good player,  Harper said of Rendon.  He plays a great third base.  Harper, good friends with fellow Las Vegas product Bryant, had an RBI double off reliever Brian Duensing in the sixth to give the Nationals an 8-3 lead. Chicago's Anthony Rizzo hit a long homer to right off reliever Enny Romero to trim the lead to 8-4 in the eighth, but Matt Albers got the last three outs in the ninth. Trea Turner also had two hits for Washington (47-31), and Ryan Zimmerman drove in two runs. The Cubs (39-39) are at .500 for the first time since June 18. One night after the Nationals stole seven bases, Washington used a more standard approach to score early. Zimmerman had an RBI single in the first inning with two outs to score Harper, who had doubled to right-center field. Washington scored four earned runs in the second against Lackey to make it 5-0. Rendon and Matt Wieters hit back-to-back homers to start the inning. It was the 15th homer for Rendon and seventh for Wieters. Harper then walked with the bases loaded to force in Strasburg, who had singled with one out. Turner scored with the bases loaded as Zimmerman got credit for an RBI when he reached on an error by Bryant at third to make it 5-0. Rendon doubled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Michael A. Taylor in the third as the Nationals forged ahead 6-0. Contreras hit a two-run homer off Strasburg to trim the Cubs' deficit to 6-2 in the fourth. Albert Almora Jr. doubled and scored in the fifth when Zimmerman couldn't come up with a grounder at first to pull the Cubs within 6-3. Washington's Daniel Murphy led off the sixth with a homer for a 7-3 advantage. The series finale is Thursday, and Baker would like to see more Nationals fans in the stands.  We relish and need sellouts, and if the Cubs fans weren't here, we would probably have a half-filled stadium,  said Baker, who estimated 40 percent of the crowd of 31,072 was Cubs fans. NOTES: To replace C Miguel Montero, who was taken off the roster one day after he blasted RHP Jake Arrieta for not holding runners on well, the Cubs called up C Victor Caratini from Triple-A Iowa. He was retired as a pinch hitter in the ninth. ... Cubs LHP Jon Lester (5-4, 3.83 ERA) will face Washington RHP Joe Ross (4-3, 5.40 ERA) in the series finale Thursday. ...

Stroman was around long enough to help the Blue Jays win for just the second time in six games, shutting down the Baltimore Orioles 4-0.  I worked extremely hard between starts to put my body in a position where I'm able to go deep in games and maintain velocity,  said Stroman, who avoided a third straight loss.  I credit that to the work everyone puts in: the training staff, the strength and conditioning staff here has been unbelievable, so my body feels great.  I felt like I could've gone another inning or two. I feel great where I'm at right now.  Jose Bautista and Justin Smoak hit solo home runs off Orioles starter Wade Miley as the Blue Jays (37-40) improved to 3-8 against the Orioles (38-39) this season. Baltimore saw its three-game win streak end. The rubber match between the American League East opponents is Thursday night.

The 26-year-old right-hander entered the game 0-2 with an 8.44 ERA in his past three starts against Baltimore. He has now pitched at least seven innings in a team-leading six games this season.  He was good, he was really good. I thought he got stronger as the game went on against a dangerous team,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  It's tough to shut down their hitters, and we needed that, we needed that desperately.  Orioles manager Buck Showalter added,  He was really good, he was the difference.  Danny Barnes got the last out in the eighth, and Roberto Osuna struck out the side in the ninth. Bautista got the Blue Jays on the board in the bottom of the first inning, taking Miley's 0-1 offering over the wall in right field for his 14th homer of the season. It was the first leadoff home run by a Toronto player this year and the ninth of Bautista's career. Toronto added to its lead in the fourth inning. Smoak got things started by taking Miley's two-seam fastball over the wall in center field for his career-high 21st home run. The homers hit by Smoak are the most by any switch hitter before the All-Star break since Mark Teixeira hit 22 in 2015.  I've had a great first half, but it's not about how you start, it's how you finish,  he said.  But it's an honor to be with those names and just got to keep it going.  You always want to beat career highs, and I was able to do that tonight.  After Kevin Pillar singled to load the bases, Baltimore shortstop Paul Janish mishandled a sharply hit ball by Bautista, allowing two runners to score and giving the Blue Jays a 4-0 lead. Miley (3-6) went five innings, allowing four runs (three earned) and six hits while striking out five and walking three.  What did me in was falling behind guys right out of the gate,  said Miley, who entered with a 1-1 record and a 2.08 ERA in two starts against Toronto this season.  I think I was 8-for-24 on first pitch strikes. That's not going to cut it at this level.  I've got to figure something out. I've got to figure out how to get the fastball back over the plate.

Moments later, the score was 3-0, and the Kansas City Royals were on their way to a lopsided victory. Perez and Mike Moustakas hit back-to-back homers during a four-run fourth, and Perez and Alex Gordon drove in three runs apiece to power the Kansas City Royals past the Detroit Tigers 8-2 on Wednesday at Comerica Park. Perez crushed a 3-0 offering from Daniel Norris that bounced off the brick wall beyond the left-center-field stands. The distance was estimated at 451 feet.  I hit it pretty good. I didn't feel (it off) my hands,  the Royals catcher said.  That kind of situation right there, it's a pretty good pitch to see. I got a 3-0 count, and I didn't miss the opportunity. One home run is good, and back-to-back feels better.  Royals manager Ned Yost didn't hesitate to let Perez swing on 3-0. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at TigersKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch I feel he's got the chance to do some damage,  Yost said.  We've been utilizing the 3-0 green light for a number of guys, and it paid off tonight.  Perez also doubled home a run. Alcides Escobar had three hits and scored twice for the Royals (38-38), while Moustakas, Gordon and Lorenzo Cain contributed two hits apiece. Jorge Soler, promoted from Triple-A Omaha earlier in the day, added an RBI single. Ian Kennedy (2-6) won for just the second time in 14 starts, allowing two runs on five hits and one walk with five strikeouts in seven innings.  He had a really, really good curveball tonight and utilized it well,  Yost said.  He managed his pitch count, was ahead in the count for a majority of the night and had really good off-speed stuff.  Alex Avila and Miguel Cabrera hit solo homers for the Tigers (34-43). Norris (4-6) gave up five runs on eight hits in 3 2/3 innings, his shortest start of the season.  I've been working on a lot of things, and I've just got to simplify, go out there and throw the baseball,  Norris said.  I'm just thinking too much right now. Got to go out there and trust my stuff. Get ahead of guys and put them away when I can, instead of trying to not walk guys and stuff like that.  Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez went 1-for-4 after being activated from the 10-day disabled list. Martinez, who had been sidelined with an irregular heartbeat, was dropped from his usual cleanup spot to No. 6 in the order. Kansas City took the lead on Escobar's leadoff double and Gordon's RBI single in the third. The Royals then sent 10 batters to the plate and knocked out Norris the following inning. Perez's two-run shot sparked the big inning. Moustakas followed two pitches later with his 20th homer, a blast into the right field stands. Gordon's two-out RBI double made it 5-0.  I've got to figure out a way to not let a big inning happen like that,  Norris said.  A 3-0 fastball (to Perez), down and away, and he just got extended on it. The one to Moustakas, I just completely missed. I tried to go down and away, and it went up and in. Wasn't really a good release on that. Just a pretty rough day. Hard to swallow.  Avila got the Tigers on the board in the bottom of the fourth with his 11th homer of the season. NOTES: Royals RF/DH Jorge Soler batted .324 with 11 home runs and 31 RBIs for Triple-A Omaha prior to his recall on Wednesday. Soler, who was acquired from the Chicago Cubs in exchange for RHP Wade Davis during the offseason, was demoted after hitting just .164 in his first 18 games. ... Kansas City INF Cheslor Cuthbert was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 26, with a left wrist sprain. Cuthbert was batting .196 with one homer and 10 RBIs. ... Tigers C/1B John Hicks was optioned to Triple-A Toledo to make room for DH Victor Martinez, who was activated from the DL. Hicks was batting .299 with three home runs and 12 RBIs. ... Detroit RHP Justin Verlander notched his 23rd career victory over Kansas City on Tuesday. That is the most by any pitcher against any opponent over the past 12 seasons.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED6TAEKYTB"},

Payne tested positive for Phentermine after submitting a urine sample at a regional meeting in Swan Hill in Australia's southern state of Victoria on June 11. The 31-year-old faced a stewards inquiry in Melbourne on Thursday after being stood down by racing stewards this week. She pleaded guilty at the inquiry, which heard she had been prescribed the suppressant after a serious fall last year. Payne said she took  full responsibility  for the failed test and had not sought proper medical guidance on the usage of the suppressant. “This is 100 percent my fault,” local media quoted her as saying after the hearing. Payne had surgery after the fall during a ride in Mildura and had a long period of rehabilitation before returning to the track last September. Payne shot to international fame in 2015 when she won Australia's richest and most famous horse race on 100-1 shot Prince of Penzance. Her remarks after the race also went down in local sporting folklore, telling  chauvinists  in Australia's racing industry to  get stuffed .

The Nikkei gained 0.5 percent to 20,238.75 in midmorning trade, moving closer to 20,318.11 hit last week, the highest level since August 2015. Meanwhile, the broader Topix gained 0.8 percent to its near two-year high of 1,627.54. Tech shares, which stumbled on the previous day, rebounded after the Nasdaq posted its best session since Nov. 7 overnight. Gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also bolstered sentiment in the Japanese tech sector. Advantest rose 1.0 percent, Hitachi Ltd added 1.3 percent and Shin-Etsu Chemical Co, a top maker of semiconductor silicon wafers, leapt 1.4 percent.  We see reversals in some sectors today. For the overall market, investors are still waiting for major catalysts from next week as well as this weekend's Tokyo poll,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities, referring to Sunday's Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, its ratings slipping over suspicions of favouritism, has suffered a fresh embarrassment after his defense minister made politically sensitive remarks just days ahead of a key local election.  It's not like the market is deeply worried about the election. But from foreign investors' standpoint, political stability was one of the reasons to invest in the Japanese market, so we don't want a negative surprise on the weekend,  Mizuho's Kuramochi said. Next week, the market is focused on the Bank of Japan's 'tankan' business sentiment survey as well as U.S. economic indicators which include ISM Manufacturing PMI and unemployment data. Bucking the strength, Nitori Holdings tumbled 6.7 percent after the furniture retailer saw its operating profit decline by 5.6 percent to 25.72 billion yen ($229 million) in March-May, hurt by a weaker yen and expenses related to new store openings.

The territory has seen tumultuous times since July 1, 1997, with economic turmoil, outbreaks of disease and more recently, pro-democracy protests casting shadows over the city, its stunning harbor and the New Territories up to the border with the mainland. Hong Kong's reputation as a free-market haven was challenged during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, while the 2008 global financial crisis tested the health of its banks. The city of 7.3 million people suffered badly during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS as it is known, in 2003, when 299 people died from the flu-like virus.  It was also among the places hardest hit by bird flu. A rush of money from mainland China vaulted Hong Kong into the ranks of the world's most expensive property markets. It also fueled public anger over high living costs and a widening wealth gap.         Falun Gong followers meditate in Hong Kong, May 9, 2001. Members of the spiritual movement have over the years protested in Hong Kong after Beijing banned the group on the mainland in 1999, declaring it a  cult . While largely tolerated in Hong Kong, 16 members were convicted in 2002 for protesting outside Beijing's liaison office in the territory. Eight of those convictions were later overturned by Hong Kong's highest court.Kin Cheung/File photo My priority will be to heal the divide and to ease the frustration – and to unite our society to move forward,  Chief Executive-elect Carrie Lam said in March after her selection by a 1,200-person election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists.

As part of the handover, a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law promised that Hong Kong would retain a high degree of autonomy under a  one country, two systems  formula, with full democracy an  ultimate aim . But two decades later, there's no sign of that aim. China declined to make any concessions to student protesters demanding universal suffrage in  Occupy  street demonstrations in 2014.

Republican leaders hope to agree on changes to the legislation by Friday so lawmakers can take it up after next week's Independence Day recess.. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to seek passage of it this week because Republicans did not have 50 votes to pass the bill. For seven years, Republicans have led a quest to undo the 2010 law known as Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Trump made dismantling it a top campaign promise during last year's presidential campaign but policy differences within the party have raised doubts Republicans can achieve a repeal. Democrats have unified against the bill and Republicans control the Senate by a slim 52-48 margin, which means McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans. So far at least 10  - including moderates and hard-line conservatives - have expressed opposition to the current bill, although some indicated they would vote for it with certain changes. McConnell, with his reputation as a strategist on the line, met with a procession of Republican senators in his office on Wednesday. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said party leaders will talk to every Republican senator who has concerns about the bill or is undecided. The House of Representatives passed its healthcare bill last month, only after striking a balance between the center of the party and the right wing. Now McConnell must find a similar sweet spot. During a lunch meeting on Wednesday Republicans made presentations on potential fixes. Senator Rand Paul called for jettisoning more parts of Obamacare to get conservatives on board. Related CoverageStates' Medicaid spending to increase under Senate bill: reportDespite healthcare setback, Trump says big surprise on bill could comeTax Issue Senator Mike Rounds suggested keeping a 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on high earners' investment income, which the current bill would eliminate. Rounds said the tax could pay for more Americans to receive the tax credits that help pay for health insurance. Senator Bob Corker, who also supports keeping the tax, said one of the issues he was focused on was helping lower-income Americans pay for health plans.  My sense is there's a good chance that issue and other issues people are trying to get addressed can be addressed,  Corker told reporters. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to the media about plans to repeal and replace Obamacare on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinTrump said the bill was moving along well and predicted a  great, great surprise  but did not elaborate. Maine Senator Susan Collins, a moderate, said it would be  very difficult  to reach agreement by Friday. Collins and other centrists were put off by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's projection on Monday that 22 million people would lose medical insurance under the existing bill. Finishing the legislation's revisions by Friday would be  optimal,  Cornyn said, so the CBO can analyze the new version.. Slideshow (5 Images)Even then, Democrats could mount a forceful resistance. They have repeatedly said they will not discuss a repeal but have expressed openness to negotiating improvements. The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, proposed Trump call all 100 senators to Blair House across the street from the White House to craft a bipartisan bill fixing Obamacare but Trump said did not think Schumer's offer was serious. McConnell said Democrats had refused  to work with us in a serious way to comprehensively address Obamacare's failures in the seven years since they passed it.  The legislation has triggered protests at the Capitol and police said they arrested 40 people, including cancer survivors, on Wednesday for blocking Senate offices. Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without Republican support, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people but Republicans call it a costly government intrusion. The Senate bill rolls back Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid government insurance for the poor and cuts planned Medicaid spending starting in 2025. It also repeals most of Obamacare's taxes, ends a penalty for not obtaining insurance and overhauls subsidies that help people buy insurance with tax credits.

New York-based Blue Apron said late on Wednesday its initial public offering of 30 million shares of class A common stock was priced at $10 per share, at the low end of the $10 to $11 per share range issued earlier in the day. It lowered the estimate from a range of $15 to $17 after potential investors expressed concerns about the $13.7 billion Amazon deal as well as Blue Apron's marketing costs and lack of profitability, people familiar with the matter said. They requested anonymity because the pricing negotiations were confidential. Blue Apron is the first U.S. meal-kit company to go public. Smaller peers and their venture capital investors were hoping it would pave the way for them to also go public or be acquired at rich valuations. The IPO values Blue Apron at $1.89 billion, below the $3.2 billion implied by its previous estimate and the $2.2 billion by its last private fundraising round two years ago. Amazon already has a small meal-kit business, delivering ingredients and recipes to customers in a handful of U.S. cities. The Whole Foods deal announced in mid-June would hand the e-commerce company a ready-made distribution system for food delivery in the form of brick-and-mortar grocery stores.  Amazon's deal for Whole Foods earlier this month added to concerns, but Blue Apron's high marketing costs were a negative factor. Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) IPO earlier this year has shown investors that growth at all costs is a mistake,  said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital LLC, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. Snap went public in March and surged in its first day of trading, but shares are now just above their IPO price after declining revenue growth and widening losses raised questions about whether the Snapchat app owner would ever be profitable.  Like other meal-kit companies, Blue Apron has spent heavily on marketing to compete for customers who often switch service providers, or cancel their subscriptions altogether. The company spent roughly 18 percent of its $795.4 million revenue in 2016 on marketing, posting a net loss of $54.9 million. It has also faced steep costs of building out delivery infrastructure for fresh food. While meal kits have not been a focus for Amazon, it started investing in the sector earlier this year and has launched a partnership with Martha Stewart's meal kit service, Martha & Marley Spoon, to deliver Stewart-designed meals in New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, Seattle and Los Angeles. Amazon has not specified its plans for Whole Foods stores, but industry insiders believe they could serve as distribution points for fresh food delivery. Amazon's significant investment in automation is also likely to give it a leg-up in managing costs. The Blue Apron logo is pictured ahead of the company's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., June 29, 2017.Lucas Jackson With Amazon as their potential main competitor, this may make that long-term profit target more difficult than before the (Whole Foods) merger,  said Eric Kim, co-founder and managing partner of venture capital firm Goodwater Capital.  A meal-kit delivery company hoping to follow Blue Apron was Sun Basket, which Reuters reported earlier this year had hired banks to prepare for an IPO. Green Chef and Home Chef are two other meal-kit companies reviewing options, including a sale or raising funds, Reuters has reported. The challenge of balancing marketing and operational costs with affordable pricing has already claimed victims in the industry. Startup Maple said it was shutting down earlier this year, while SpoonRocket made a similar announcement last year. Slideshow (5 Images)Shares in the broader consumer sector have shown signs of weakness in the past month. The S&P; index of consumer discretionary companies .SPLRCD rose 13 percent over the first five months of 2017, but is down about 2.5 percent since its peak on June 2. Valued at a Discount to E-Commerce Firms Online sales represented only $12 billion, or 2.2 percent, of the U.S. restaurant market in 2016, but are expected to grow about 22.6 percent annually from 2017 to 2020, Blue Apron has said, citing a Euromonitor study it commissioned. During an IPO road show last week, Blue Apron sought to convince investors it was well positioned to benefit from growing consumer interest in cooking and where their food comes from. Following the negative investor feedback, Blue Apron slashed its pricing estimate. The IPO puts Blue Apron's valuation at roughly 1.6 times the revenue, according to Goodwater Capital. While that would represent a discount to e-commerce companies which on average command 3.1 times 2017 revenue, it would still mark a premium to grocery players, which trade at roughly 0.7 times 2017 revenue, Goodwater said. Bessemer Venture Partners, Stripes Group and Fidelity are among Blue Apron's investors. Blue Apron shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol APRN.

The White House said Trump would name Brendan Carr, a Republican who previously served as an adviser to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, to an open seat. Carr currently is general counsel at the FCC and also has worked at the Wiley Rein LLP law firm. Carr did not respond to a request for comment. The five-seat FCC currently has only three members. Earlier this month, Trump nominated Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, to another open seat at the FCC. The U.S. Senate must confirm both Carr and Rosenworcel before they can be seated. Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama, giving Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. The FCC is working to reverse a number of Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic president's landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. Pai, chosen by Trump in January to head the agency, also has said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai also has proposed significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations. Pai praised Carr's appointment.  Brendan’s expertise on wireless policy and public safety will be a tremendous asset to the commission,  he said in a statement.   Republican Michael O'Rielly and Democrat Mignon Clyburn also serve on the commission. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm O'Rielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Pai would be forced to leave the commission if he is not reconfirmed by the Senate by the end of the year. Under Pai, the FCC chose not to review AT&T; Inc's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The FCC must review Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc's proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, one of the largest U.S. TV station operators.

But for a quiet revolution that took place on the Wimbledon turf two years previously, however, Laver's feat would be absent from the record books and tennis may never have flourished into the global spectacle it is today. Fifty years ago, the traditionalism of the All England Club hardly appeared fertile ground for radical thinking. But maverick chairman Herman David decided it was time to bring the professionals, then regarded by many as self-serving mercenaries, back in from the cold. Thanks to David's  lightbulb  moment, a few weeks after the conclusion of the still staunchly amateur championships of 1967, eight pros were invited in through the gates to contest the  Wimbledon Pro . Laver was joined by fellow Australians Ken Rosewall, Lew Hoad and Fred Stolle, Spain's Andres Gimeno and Americans Pancho Gonzales, Dennis Ralston and Butch Buchholz. Enthusiastic crowds turned out for the four-day event, the BBC cameras rolled and, unthinkably, prize money totaled $45,000. The invasion of  big-time tennis  had begun. 'Food on the Table'  What Herman did was exciting and a brave move,  Laver, 78, told Reuters in an interview.  I think (Open tennis) was something people had been thinking about. The game was split and people were asking why did it have to be that way?  A lot of those amateur officials must be turning over in their graves now thinking what a bad decision it was not to have started Open tennis earlier.  The event proved a great success as Laver, who also achieved the calendar slam in 1962 before leaving the amateur ranks, played as if he had never been away, beating Rosewall in the final.  I thought the tennis was pretty amazing,  Laver said.  And for me it just was unbelievable to be back.  When I turned professional in 1963 I told myself I will never see Wimbledon again, nor the U.S. Open, the Australian, the French. There was no way I could live on amateur tennis.  We had all won Wimbledons and been at the top in amateur tennis. We knew we would have a lot of history and trophies but that doesn't put food on the table. That's why we went pro.  The genie was out of the bottle. The shackles of amateurism fell away and the next year, following Wimbledon's audacious lead, all four grand slams opened to professionals. David, inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1998, hatched his plan after watching Laver win the World Professional title on the fast wooden boards of Wembley Stadium. Laver recalls a conversation they had.  He said you guys come and fill up Wimbledon at the weekend and you can come and play in our tournament next year,  he said.  I think he knew it had to be broken up. He knew amateur tennis wasn't the answer. I think he thought if the All England Club do it, it will force Open tennis.  It was genius on the part of Wimbledon.  'Think of Those Slams' Laver's first match at Wimbledon for five years was against Stolle -- which he won 6-4 6-2.  It was a thrill walking on to Centre Court, all the memories came flashing back,  Laver said. Stolle recalls it fondly too.  It was pretty special. I knew I was creating history,  Stolle, who turned pro in 1966 after reaching the Wimbledon final in 1964 and 1965, told Reuters.  Rocket (Laver) dispensed with me and I remember rushing back to get changed so I could watch my idol Lew play Pancho. I remember match point and Lew put a lob on to the baseline, chalk went everywhere. Pancho took a ball and smashed it over the stands.  The next day Muscles (Rosewall) destroyed him.  Stolle believes the Open era should have happened sooner and that Laver, who won 11 grand slam titles, would have been way ahead of the 18 of Roger Federer had he not missed five years.  We always thought it might come about but it always missed by a couple of votes,  he said.  I think someone had to use the bathroom whenever they took the vote, that kind of stuff!  Think of those slams that Rocket missed out on.  Ralston joined the pro ranks in 1967 having reached the Wimbledon final in 1966 when he lost to Manuel Santana. He said the amateurs always knew the pros were superior.  I knew they were better players, anyone that had any sense knew that,  Ralston told Reuters.  I wanted to have a shot at playing against them and thankfully in '67 I could.  Wimbledon had the courage to let those 'horrible pros' who were playing for money come in and play.  It was a huge turning point... Back then we were happy to have anywhere to play. We had no clue the door was about to open, we were just happy, especially guys like Pancho, Rod and Muscles who had been away so long.  Boy it was great to be back at Wimbledon -- and we were getting paid!

The impact on India's debt dynamics and capital spending will depend on the total size of loans waived, how the scheme is financed, and whether there are possible offsets from cuts to other forms of spending, including capital projects. Larger state deficits would delay an expected gradual reduction in general government debt, which includes central and state government debt. When India's rating was affirmed at 'BBB-'/Stable in May, Fitch forecast general government debt to fall to 64.9% of GDP by FY21, from 67.9% in FY17, and we highlighted that potential changes to India's fiscal position are a rating sensitivity. Public finances are a key weakness in India's sovereign credit profile, with general government debt well above the 'BBB' median of 40.9% and the fiscal deficit of 6.6% of GDP in FY17 much higher than the 'BBB' median of 2.7%. India's central government has gradually consolidated its fiscal position in recent years, and has indicated it will not participate in the waivers. However, the combined finances of the states - which are included in general government debt and deficits - have been under pressure. Public pay hikes, election spending and higher interest costs stemming from the UDAY scheme - under which state governments have taken on debt from power distribution companies - are all likely to add to expenditure. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/indias_general_government_balance?src=embe d  title= India's General Government Balance  width= 550  height= 647  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > There is a risk that farm loan waivers - which we have not previously factored into our assumptions - will lead to further fiscal slippage at the state level or will reduce the funds available for public investment. The central government has the authority to block states from borrowing to finance persistently large deficits, but it could be reluctant ahead of approaching elections in some states, and with the 2019 Lok Sabha election drawing nearer. The last widespread farm loan-waiver scheme was rolled out in 2008 by the central government, and covered 43 million farmers. It reportedly cost around 1.3% of GDP. The combined cost to the states could also become large this time. Schemes have already been announced in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka, which account for around one-third of India's population. Other governments are likely to feel pressure to implement similar policies, particularly in states with upcoming elections. A roll-out across much of India is not unthinkable. Banks could also be affected by the waiver schemes. The schemes will benefit banks to the extent that they offload farm loans with weak repayment prospects to state governments. Uniform farm loan waivers could lead to moral hazard and weaken the general repayment culture among financially healthy farmers, but they will still have an incentive to repay loans in order to retain access to future funding. Agricultural loans account for 14% of total bank lending, according to the Reserve Bank of India, and are equivalent to around 6.5% of GDP.

With Serena Williams out of the picture, the 25-year-old is favorite with bookmakers to claim a maiden grand slam trophy at the All England Club, and she certainly has the tools to make an impact on Wimbledon's slick lawns. Armed with a bullet serve, a thunderous array of groundstrokes and an ice cool on-court demeanor, she has become a serious threat at the majors over the last 12 months. She made her grand slam breakthrough with a run to the U.S. Open final last year, beating Serena along the way, and followed up by making the quarter-finals in Australia and claiming two tour titles before going to the French Open. There she reached the last four and was only a painful semi-final defeat to Simona Halep away from becoming world number one.  It has been a remarkable turnaround for a player who did not get past the third round at a major in her first 17 main-draw appearances, and it is testament to the work she has put in grinding her way up the rankings.  Nothing comes easy. Maybe some players who are playing the first grand slam in their life can go far,  the world number three said at the French Open.  But with me, it was just different. So I had to first play a few more before I could go far.  While she may have had an impact at the other three slams, she is still waiting for her breakthrough moment at Wimbledon, having never made it into the second week in singles.

She hammered down the most aces on the WTA Tour last year with 530 from 61 matches, while she downed Serena in New York by winning 84 percent of points on her first serve.  Her whipped forehand can also cause serious damage even if it is not always pin-point accurate as she showed in her semi-final defeat to Halep in Paris.

Pliskova made 55 unforced errors, with 24 coming in the first set alone, against Halep, who was overwhelmed by the Czech's power in the second set, but still came out on top.  And despite her icy demeanor, Pliskova can be hard on herself when things start going wrong.   I'm too negative sometimes,  she said after reaching the fourth round in Paris.  So I want too much sometimes, and then I'm even missing even more than I would be missing. But we are trying to change this.   When her game clicks, however, there are few more damaging players currently in the women's game and after a long wait to get to the top, she looks ready take the next step to becoming a grand slam champion.    It took me some time (to challenge at the majors),  she said at the French Open.  I'm just happy that I'm there now.

Production of the superchilled gas has been outpacing demand as new supplies come online in Australia and the United States, driving down Asian spot prices LNG-AS by more than 70 percent since 2014.  In the short-term, the market is still oversupplied,  Engie Executive Vice President Didier Holleaux told Reuters.  Fortunately only a fraction of LNG globally is sold in the short-term market, a significant part of it is still on long-term contracts ... We have new long-term contracts coming onstream in Asia next year and also the year after.  Engie a few years ago locked in 20-year deals to supply Japanese utility Tohoku Electric Power and Taiwanese state firm CPC Corp from its U.S. Cameron LNG project that will start production in 2018. The project will add 4 million tonnes per year of U.S. LNG to Engie's global portfolio of 16.4 million tpy.  It's a significant diversification for us because for the first time we'll have LNG coming from the U.S.,  Holleaux said late last week. Meanwhile, Engie, previously known as GDF Suez, is in talks to supply gas to Thailand and Myanmar and to build floating storage regasification units (FSRUs) that will supply smaller volumes of gas to power plants on Indonesian islands.  Most of the new (regasification) capacity will be in Southeast Asia,  Holleaux said, adding that Indonesia could soon become a net LNG importer as  their needs are increasing and they have not had such big discoveries recently . Engie in June supplied its first LNG cargo to Indonesia's Pertamina from the local Jangkrik field, its joint venture with Italy's Eni. In China, after inking an LNG supply agreement with Beijing Gas, Engie is looking at opportunities in the underground gas storage needed to hold stocks to meet seasonal demand, Holleaux said.  Chinese players have now reached a technical level where they don't necessarily need us,  Holleaux said.  It's different in underground storage where we have specific skills and know-how and we may still help them.  China, the world's largest energy consumer, plans to generate more electricity from gas instead of coal as it fights pollution.  For a very long time, Asia, mainly Japan and Korea, has been one of the most important markets, one of the most reliable ones, in many years the best priced market. But times are changing and we will adjust,  Holleaux said. (Reporting by Florence Tan; Editing by Joseph Radford)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/asia-lng-engie-idUSL3N1JO2MV"},

The White House said Trump would name Brendan Carr, a Republican who previously served as an adviser to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, to an open seat. Carr currently is general counsel at the FCC and also has worked at the Wiley Rein LLP law firm. Carr did not respond to a request for comment. The five-seat FCC currently has only three members. Earlier this month, Trump nominated Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, to another open seat at the FCC. The U.S. Senate must confirm both Carr and Rosenworcel before they can be seated. Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama, giving Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. The FCC is working to reverse a number of Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic president's landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. Pai, chosen by Trump in January to head the agency, also has said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai also has proposed significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations. Pai praised Carr's appointment.  Brendan’s expertise on wireless policy and public safety will be a tremendous asset to the commission,  he said in a statement.   Republican Michael O'Rielly and Democrat Mignon Clyburn also serve on the commission. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm O'Rielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Pai would be forced to leave the commission if he is not reconfirmed by the Senate by the end of the year. Under Pai, the FCC chose not to review AT&T; Inc's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The FCC must review Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc's proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, one of the largest U.S. TV station operators.

The state supreme court did not issue a written opinion on the program itself but declined take up the case on appeal from a lower court.  This is the final step in this case to affirm California’s innovative climate program, including its carbon auctions, which serves as a vital safeguard to ensure polluters are held accountable for their pollution,  Erica Morehouse, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a written statement.Representatives for the state Chamber of Commerce, which led the legal challenge, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. California's program to cap emissions and trade carbon permits is a crucial component of a broader effort to reduce the state's output of heat-trapping greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the end of the decade. The carbon market sets a steadily declining cap on the state's carbon output and then sells or gives permits that businesses are required to submit every three years to the state to cover their emissions.  The program has come under fire from critics who have said a glut of permits reduced the incentive for businesses to cut emissions. Businesses have been uncertain about the future of the program, which as originally passed was scheduled to end in 2020. The lawsuit by business groups had also threatened to scuttle the program entirely.  With this Supreme Court victory, now it’s up to us to take action extending California’s cap-and-trade system on a more permanent basis,  California Governor Jerry Brown said in a written statement following the ruling.

There is no dumping.  Argentina is the world's No. 3 exporter of soybeans and is a top global exporter of soy oil, which is a main ingredient in biodiesel, and soymeal.  Dreyfus, which sells Argentine biodiesel, is part of the so-called ABCD quartet of global agricultural traders along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill [CAR.UL]. Ramirez Martiarena said Argentina had done a good job defending itself from dumping allegations in Europe. In September, a European Union court annulled anti-dumping tariffs the bloc had applied to Argentine biodiesel imports. The WTO had  ruled in favor of the South American country, calling the measures protectionist.     In the U.S. I'm confident that the case will be won,  Ramirez Martiarena said.  On the other hand, the executive warned the Argentine government needed to further cut export taxes on soybeans or it risked losing market share to Brazil. Days after taking office in 2015, President Mauricio Macri cut 5 percentage points off the export tax on soybeans and cut export taxes on corn and wheat. The farm sector cheered the measure, which was aimed at attracting investment. Macri promised to keep lowering the tax by 5 percentage points per year. But faced with a wide fiscal deficit announced in October, he has instead said he would lower the tax on soybeans by 0.5 percentage points per month starting in 2018, a pace Ramirez Martiarena called  too slow.    If Argentina does not accelerate the process of cutting soy taxes, it runs the risk of losing competitive advantage against what Brazil is developing in logistics,  he said.

The state supreme court did not issue a written opinion on the program itself but declined take up the case on appeal from a lower court.  This is the final step in this case to affirm California’s innovative climate program, including its carbon auctions, which serves as a vital safeguard to ensure polluters are held accountable for their pollution,  Erica Morehouse, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a written statement.Representatives for the state Chamber of Commerce, which led the legal challenge, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. California's program to cap emissions and trade carbon permits is a crucial component of a broader effort to reduce the state's output of heat-trapping greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the end of the decade. The carbon market sets a steadily declining cap on the state's carbon output and then sells or gives permits that businesses are required to submit every three years to the state to cover their emissions.  The program has come under fire from critics who have said a glut of permits reduced the incentive for businesses to cut emissions. Businesses have been uncertain about the future of the program, which as originally passed was scheduled to end in 2020. The lawsuit by business groups had also threatened to scuttle the program entirely.  With this Supreme Court victory, now it’s up to us to take action extending California’s cap-and-trade system on a more permanent basis,  California Governor Jerry Brown said in a written statement following the ruling.

Thaddeus Bereday, indicted along with four other former WellCare executives in 2011, had been scheduled to face trial in September after not going on trial in 2013 with the other defendants for health reasons, prosecutors said. Bereday, 52, faces a maximum of five years in prison.  Due to his health issues, Mr. Bereday needed to conclude this matter after almost a decade,  Sandy Weinberg, Bereday's lawyer, said in an email. Bereday's plea came after the U.S. Supreme Court in April declined to hear an appeal by former WellCare Chief Executive Todd Farha of his fraud conviction for his role in a scheme to cheat the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. Prosecutors said Farha and others engaged in a scheme to file false Medicaid expense reports to Florida's healthcare administration overstating the amount the company's subsidiaries spent on mental health services for Medicaid patients. Under a 2002 Florida law, companies were required to spend 80 percent of Medicaid dollars they received for mental health services, and return the difference if they spend less. According to court papers, Tampa-based WellCare created a new unit to pay mental health care providers while retaining millions of dollars in Medicaid funds that should have been refunded. A federal jury in 2013 convicted Farha, former WellCare Chief Financial Officer Paul Behrens, and former vice presidents William Kale and Peter Clay. A federal judge in 2014 imposed prison terms of three years for Farha, two years for Behrens and one year for Kale. Clay was sentenced to five years of probation. WellCare in 2009 agreed to pay $80 million and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with the investigation. The case is U.S. v.

He said that in spite of a 12 percent decrease in global trade over the last five years, bilateral trade had risen by this amount.

When Laver cleaned up all four grand slam titles in 1962 it seemed ludicrous to suggest he could get any better. But the man nicknamed Rocket was in for a shock when he joined the professional ranks a year later -- a move that put his grand slam collection on hold until 1968 when tennis entered a new Open era.  When I look back, when I turned pro I was shellshocked,  Laver, who will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the groundbreaking 1967 Wimbledon Pro tournament at the All England Club next week, told Reuters.  I played Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad and all these guys and I realized that my game was so bad against the pros that I almost had to re-learn so much of the tennis.  I could win in the amateurs and not really have to improve so much. When I turned pro I thought to myself I'm pretty good but I had a shock, I got beaten all the time.  I played Lew Hoad 12 or 13 times when I first turned pro and couldn't beat him once.  Before 1968, tennis was split between amateurs, who were allowed to play in the grand slams, and professionals - like Rosewall, Pancho Gonzales, Hoad and Laver - who could not. They played instead on a professional circuit that included the World Professional Championships at Wembley. The 1967 Wimbledon Pro event, which took place a few weeks after the actual Championships that year, paved the way for the decision to allow professionals to play in the slams. Laver, now 78, returned with a vengeance winning Wimbledon in 1968 before going on to win another calendar slam in 1969 -- the only player to achieve the feat twice.  I improved 100 percent as a professional while I was unable to play in the majors,  Laver said.  I know that a lot of amateur officials and players thought that the pros couldn't be very good because we just played against ourselves all the time... so I told them they shouldn't believe that.  The pros were tough and fast and you needed a big first serve and good second serve. You had to play more of a percentage game that we see today. As an amateur you didn't need to do that and you would still win.  We didn't have to practise much either because we just played matches. I remember playing 28 days in a row in Europe.  While Laver says the brave move of Wimbledon to invite professionals helped transform tennis into the success story it now is, he says it would be wrong to discount the amateur era as any less important.  You can't forget people like (Bill) Tilden, (Don) Budge and (Fred) Perry because they are the ones that made the game,  he said.

The computer worm was first seen in Ukraine on Tuesday, going on to affect port facilities ranging from Mumbai to Los Angeles. It hit Argentina on Wednesday, slowing wheat and fertilizer shipments and threatening to impact the flow of soybeans to the country's main client, China, at the height of export season.  Cofco's system has been affected by the global attack. It has been infected by a virus. So they are working mechanically, not connected to their regular information system,  Guillermo Wade, head of Argentina's CAPyM port operators' chamber, told Reuters in a telephone interview. A local Cofco representative did not respond to a request for comment. The company's Brazil unit declined to comment.  In 2014 Cofco agreed to buy Dutch grain trader Nidera and the agribusiness of Noble Group for more than $3 billion. The deal propelled Cofco to the No. 2 spot among exporters of Argentine grains, oilseeds and byproducts.  So far we've heard only Nidera and Noble were hit,  said a senior Buenos Aires-based grains trader, who requested anonymity.  One of several ships scheduled to unload fertilizer at a Cofco port facility in Rosario had been halted since Tuesday, Wade said, while a vessel loading wheat produced in the vast Pampas grains belt was interrupted for hours until local operators found a mechanical work-around to the attack.  It is affecting all of Cofco's port operations in Rosario,  Wade added.  The cargo ship that was unloading fertilizer is still stopped. This has caused a backup in the line of other ships that have cargo to unload.  Cofco is one of 43 export and port service companies that belong to the CAPyM chamber. Cofco operates two ports in Rosario. Each has two berths used to load grains, oilseeds and byproducts, as well as unload fertilizers used by growers across the country. Argentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal livestock feed and the No. 3 supplier of raw soybeans, as well as a major global corn supplier. Other major exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) have operations in Rosario. The port complex is located on the banks of the Parana River, which leads out to the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic.

Thaddeus Bereday, indicted along with four other former WellCare executives in 2011, had been scheduled to face trial in September after not going on trial in 2013 with the other defendants for health reasons, prosecutors said.  Bereday, 52, faces a maximum of five years in prison.  Due to his health issues, Mr. Bereday needed to conclude this matter after almost a decade,  Sandy Weinberg, Bereday's lawyer, said in an email.

Prosecutors said Farha and others engaged in a scheme to file false Medicaid expense reports to Florida's healthcare administration overstating the amount the company's subsidiaries spent on mental health services for Medicaid patients. Under a 2002 Florida law, companies were required to spend 80 percent of Medicaid dollars they received for mental health services, and return the difference if they spend less.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rival currencies, was steady on the day at 96.019, but well below highs above 97.0 hit earlier this week. Sterling added to gains made after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that the central bank is likely to need to raise interest rates as the British economy comes closer to operating at full capacity. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi sparked the euro's rally on Tuesday, when he hinted that the ECB could trim its stimulus this year. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates this month and left the door open for further increases later in the year, though a batch of mixed economic data recently has given investors' pause as to whether the Fed would be able to stay on its planned tightening path. The dollar's decline  is broadly due to the reevaluation by market participants of the relative speed of the central banks to take away easing,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bancorp Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.  The ECB and the BoE might be moving more rapidly than before, and stubbornly low inflation in the U.S. might lead the Fed to revaluate its pace as well,  he said. The euro was slightly higher on the day at $1.13795 after scaling a peak of $1.13915 on Wednesday, despite evidence that positioning for a dramatic stimulus scale-back might have been overdone. Draghi's remarks were intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening, and set up September as the earliest the bank would discuss rolling back stimulus, according to sources familiar with the ECB chief's thinking. The pound was up 0.1 percent at $1.2940 after spiking to $1.2971 on Wednesday, its highest since June 9. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee were split 5-3 earlier this month on whether to raise British interest rates from their record-low 0.25 percent. By contrast, Bank of Japan policy members believed their best approach would be maintaining their current ultra-loose policy, with inflation well shy of their 2 percent target, according to a summary of the BOJ's latest meeting released on Monday. The divergent monetary policy outlooks helped bolster the dollar against the yen, but it still edged down 0.1 percent to 112.28 after rising as high as 112.495 earlier in the session, its highest since May 17.

Maybe next time, he insisted.  I don't plan it (beforehand),  the Korean standout explained after his first major league hit, a solo home run in the sixth inning, proved to be the difference-maker as the San Francisco Giants completed a three-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies with a 5-3 victory. Left-hander Ty Blach overcame his own defensive miscues to take a lead into the seventh inning, and the San Francisco bullpen took it from there to finish off the club's first three-game sweep of the season and the first of the Rockies since 2013.  This game's about picking each other up,  Blach insisted.  That's what we did in this series. Everybody contributed. That was an awesome win for us.  The loss was Colorado's eighth in a row. The Rockies had begun the series with a 10-1 record against the Giants this season.  If our record in the second half of the season is just like the first half, we'll take it,  Rockies manager Bud Black insisted of his 47-34 club.  In the present, it's rough. It's rough sledding right now. But the big body of work has been solid.  Promoted from Triple-A Sacramento earlier in the day after having played the past 10 seasons in his native South Korea, Hwang belted a 2-0 pitch from Rockies rookie left-hander Kyle Freeland well into the left field bleachers to snap a 3-3 tie. The 29-year-old, who accumulated 115 home runs in 1,184 games abroad before hitting seven in 68 games at Triple-A this season, became the 17th Giant since 1919 to hit a home run for his first hit in his major league debut. Adam Duvall had been the last to do so in 2014. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at GiantsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch The only thing I imagined was setting my feet on the field here at AT&T; Park,  he said of his expectations in his debut.  I never imagined hitting a home run.  I've had some great moments (in my career). Hitting a home run in my first (Major League Baseball) game ... it's unreal.  The Giants celebrated both in the dugout after the go-ahead homer and in the clubhouse after the win.  It's a special moment,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  You have tough times in this game. But there are special moments you try to savor.  Nick Hundley had a two-run homer in a three-run fourth inning, helping the Giants rally from an early 2-0 hole. Hundley's third homer of the season came after Freeland had dropped Hwang's one-hopper back to the mound, preventing a potential inning-ending double play and allowing the Giants' first run to score. Hwang was awarded with his first RBI on the play. The Rockies tied the score in the sixth with the help of Blach's second throwing error of the game. This one, on a bunt single by Pat Valaika, went into the right field corner, allowing the Colorado second baseman to reach third base. He scored when Mike Tauchman, who had been promoted from Triple-A Albuquerque on Tuesday, lined a single to center field for his first career hit and RBI. Blach was pulled with one on and one out in the seventh. Right-hander George Kontos, lefty Steven Okert and righty Hunter Strickland retired eight of the nine batters they faced in the final 2 2/3 innings. Strickland posted his first save of the season. The Giants gave their bullpen an insurance run after Gorkys Hernandez scored on Brandon Belt's fielder's choice grounder in the eighth to increase the San Francisco lead to 5-3. Blach (5-5) allowed seven hits and three runs (one earned) in 6 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out six.  He hurt himself,  Bochy noted afterward.  His command was worse throwing to first base than anywhere.  Freeland (8-6) gave up four runs and seven hits in six innings. He walked one and struck out two. The Rockies scored two runs in the top of the first after Belt, the Giants' first baseman, couldn't handle Blach's wide throw on Charlie Blackmon's game-opening dribbler. Nolan Arenado put Colorado up 2-0 when he plated Blackmon and Ian Desmond with a two-run single.  If we continue to play the way we're playing, we're not going to be anywhere we want to be,  Arenado said.  The Giants, (Los Angeles) Dodgers and (Arizona) Diamondbacks, the way we've played against them (in the past week and a half), they know we're better than that.  Hwang had two RBIs and Hundley two hits for the Giants, who hadn't won three in a row since May 14-16. Desmond and Arenado collected two hits apiece for the Rockies, who out-hit the Giants 8-7. Colorado is now 0-6 on its nine-game trip. NOTES: Both teams reached the midpoint of the season. The Rockies (47-34) are 10 games ahead of where they were last season; the Giants (30-51) are 20 games behind last year's pace. ... Giants closer RHP Mark Melancon (straight right pronator) had a PRP injection in his right forearm. He and 3B Conor Gillaspie (back spasms) were placed on the 10-day disabled list, creating roster spots for 3B Jae-Gyun Hwang and RHP Dan Slania, who was promoted from Double-A Richmond. ... Both teams are off Thursday. The Rockies complete a nine-game trip with a three-game series beginning Friday at Arizona. The Giants open six-game trip Friday at Pittsburgh. ... The Giants have scheduled LHP Madison Bumgarner (separated left shoulder) for an injury-rehab start Friday night at Triple-A Sacramento.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-giants-writethru-idUSMTZED6TA5TRFZ"},

Official data for domestic production, imports via pipelines and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) show the total amount of natural gas available in China in the first five months of the year was the equivalent of 72.01 million tonnes of LNG. This was up nine percent, or 5.94 million tonnes, on the 66.07 million tonnes that were either pumped domestically or imported in the first five months of 2016. China has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in energy consumption from 5.9 percent in 2015 to 10 percent in 2020, an average annual increase of 4.1 percent. So far this year, China's output and imports of the fuel are running at more than double the annual rate needed to reach the official target. The biggest gainer has been imports of LNG, which are up 38.4 percent in the first five months of 2017 to 12.86 million tonnes, while pipeline imports have dropped 4.4 percent to 12.65 million tonnes. Domestic natural gas production has been a strong gainer, rising almost 7 percent in the January to May period to 62.88 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 46.5 million tonnes of LNG. The rise in natural gas output stands in sharp contrast to the decline in crude oil production, which fell to the lowest on record in May as output declines from older fields. Natural gas has also outperformed coal, with domestic output of the polluting fuel up 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes in the first five months of the year. The jump in imports of LNG shows how the super-chilled fuel is becoming more competitive with pipeline imports from central Asia. Customs data from May shows that the average landed cost of LNG was $7.28 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This is higher than the $5.25 per mmBtu of pipeline imports, however, the customs price excludes the cost of internal pipeline and distribution, meaning imports from central Asia still have to pay to get from the border to demand centers. In contrast, much of the LNG is consumed near to where it is offloaded and re-gasified, meaning it doesn't suffer from the additional costs associated with the pipeline imports. Lng from Australia Surges Among China's LNG suppliers Australia has fared best, with imports rising 42.7 percent in the first five months to 5.39 million tonnes, almost double that of second-placed Qatar at 2.84 million tonnes. Malaysia is the third-biggest supplier to China, with 1.82 million tonnes in the first five months, up 90 percent from the same period in 2016. The price being paid by China for LNG tells part of the story, with cargoes from Australia landing at $6.80 per mmBtu in May, well below the $8.95 for Qatar and slightly ahead of the $6.49 for Malaysia. Australia's price advantage is still largely tied to the 25-year supply deal from the North West Shelf venture, signed in 2002 at a fixed price of $3.80 per mmBtu. At the time it was Australia's biggest export deal and hailed as a breakthrough in accessing China's markets, with former prime minister John Howard calling deal a  gold medal performance.  Since then, as spot LNG prices first rose dramatically to peak at over $20 per mmBtu in 2014, the deal was seen as too generous to the Chinese, given it lacked any mechanism for re-negotiation or linking the price to crude oil, as is common in most long-term LNG contracts. The spot price of Asian LNG was $5.40 per mmBtu in the week to June 23, down from the northern winter peak this year of $9.40 in early January. This means China is still paying more for its LNG than the spot price, but not so much as to make LNG imports uncompetitive against pipeline supplies. LNG imports in June appear set to remain robust, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts showing 2.7 million tonnes has already been discharged, or is discharging, at Chinese ports as of Tuesday. With three days still remaining in the month, the data suggests that an additional eight vessels carrying 560,000 tonnes may discharge before the end of June, taking total imports for the month to around 3.26 million tonnes. While natural gas has policy support boosting its use in China, it remains more expensive than coal when used to generate electricity. The best chance for natural gas to continue to make inroads is not only for LNG prices to remain relatively low, but also for the authorities in Beijing to push for natural gas to be used more in areas like residential heating and smaller factories, many of which still use coal.

On his way to the G20 summit in Germany, Trump is slated to speak in Poland - which received its first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) this month - to a group of leaders eager to reduce their dependence on Moscow for energy.  There are people who use supply almost as a political weapon, in threatening to cut off supply in the coldest parts of the year - in the winter, when people need gas to heat their homes,  Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview.  Our intention is to be a force for good and make gas readily available for anyone who needs it,  Cohn said. Moscow cut off gas shipments during pricing disputes in 2006 and 2009, causing shortages during winter months in Ukraine and many other European nations. The United States has looked at boosting its LNG exports for years, since drilling advances vastly expanded its domestic supplies. The Trump administration sees growth in LNG exports as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations and expand the economy. Trump is set to outline his plans to help expand natural gas production and expedite LNG exports in a speech in Washington on Thursday. The White House does not have projections for how quickly exports could ramp up, noting those decisions will be driven by market conditions and made by independent producers and exporters rather than the government.  Trump has also vowed to do what he can to boost the U.S. manufacturing sector. Some manufacturers, including Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) and Nucor Corp (NUE.N), had long fought to prevent a flood of exports, arguing that cheap domestic energy has helped them compete in world markets. But the White House has rejected that view, instead pushing for infrastructure renewal and regulatory reforms. Cohn said abundant reserves of natural gas should satisfy the needs of domestic users and exporters alike  as long as the infrastructure and the backbone of our natural gas system works.

The price of copper [CMCU3], by far Chile's most important export, started to slowly recover in October, after years of weak demand for the red metal. So far in 2017, prices have risen 7 percent, and analysts expect further increases as the copper market moves toward a deficit. That, in turn, is causing miners to slowly examine projects put on the back burner years ago when prices begin to slide from historic 2011 highs.  One perceives more movement from the projects that were, one way or another, delayed by price,  Chilean Mining Minister Aurora Williams told Reuters in a recent interview.  But even as prices rise, miners are wary of a relatively unsettled policy landscape in the South American country, various industry sources told Reuters in recent weeks. During the past three years, center-left President Michelle Bachelet has pushed through a series of reforms to the nation's tax and labor code. While supporters say they have been necessary to lessen the nation's biting inequality, many industry leaders say they are squeezing business, and new labor laws contributed to a massive strike at BHP Billiton's Escondida mine earlier this year that led to $1 billion in lost production for the company.  [The reforms] have made the sector timid to announce new investments. There's been a loss of confidence,  said one high-ranking source in a foreign miner, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. While a business-friendly ex-president, Sebastian Pinera, is the favorite in the November presidential election, leftist independent Alejandro Guillier is close at his heels, and a win by him would unsettle the already-leery industry. Miners Look, but Don't Leap In the meantime, miners are taking a gradual approach to any potential expansions. Former Antofagasta Minerals CEO Diego Hernandez, who now heads Chile's mining industry body Sonami, said firms were  eyeing expansion plans, though brick-and-mortar investments would probably be delayed until the second half of 2018. Canada's Teck Resources, for instance, is taking steps in the permitting process for a potential $4.7 billion expansion at its Quebrada Blanca mine, while BHP has said it would analyze a $2.2 billion expansion of its Spence mine this August. U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan and Chile's state-run Codelco [COBRE.UL], meanwhile, are currently carrying out studies to determine the viability of a $5 billion expansion at their El Abra mine. Still, some projects that were shelved are unlikely to be revived any time soon. Proposed major expansions at Anglo American and Glencore's Collahuasi mine and Antofagasta's Los Pelambres, for instance, show no medium-term signs of going forward.

Wednesday afternoon's game at Safeco Field certainly qualifies as one. Andrew Knapp drove in the go-ahead run with two outs in the top of the ninth inning as the Phillies rallied to defeat the Seattle Mariners 5-4 and sweep the two-game series. Tommy Joseph tied it leading off the ninth against Seattle closer Edwin Diaz (2-3), hitting a 3-2 pitch over the Phillies' bullpen in left field for a solo home run, his 13th of the season -- tying Aaron Altherr for the team lead. After striking out the next two batters, Diaz walked Cameron Perkins and then balked him to second. Knapp came up and lined a single into right field to score Perkins. Knapp said his approach changed during the at-bat, after Perkins reached second.  I wanted to try to get something to drive into the gap, but when he got to second I was just trying to get him in,  Knapp said. Philadelphia's Ricardo Pinto (1-0) pitched three scoreless innings of relief for his first major league victory, and Hector Neris worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his seventh save of the season.  Certainly, Pinto was the key to that game,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He gave us three strong innings, kept the game close and really pitched well for a young kid.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MarinersPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchThe Phillies (26-51) won a road series for the first time since April 18-20 against the New York Mets and posted a road sweep for the first time since June 27-29, 2016, at Arizona.  I think the guys are tired of losing,  Mackanin said.  They've been in so many games ... it's like, 'C'mon, let's win some.'  Seattle (39-41) lost its fourth in a row and failed in its bid to return to the .500 mark.  Usually a one-run lead in the ninth with Eddie Diaz out there, you're feeling pretty good,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  He wasn't on top of his game.  That's the life of a closer. When you don't get the job done, there's no worse feeling than to let your teammates down.  Diaz's blown save spoiled a solid outing from Mariners ace Felix Hernandez Making his second start since spending nearly two months on the disabled list with inflammation in his right shoulder, the right-hander allowed three runs on five hits in six innings. He walked three and struck out five. All three runs against Hernandez came in the third inning, two on a home run by Ty Kelly, a former Mariners farmhand.  Felix regathered (himself) and got deep in the game,  Servais said.  It was a good effort by him.  James Pazos and Nick Vincent each pitched a perfect inning of relief of Hernandez before Diaz blew it in the ninth. Kyle Seager, Danny Valencia and Robinson Cano hit solo shots for the Mariners, all against Phillies starter Mark Leiter Jr. Cano's 413-foot homer to right-center field leading off the bottom of the fifth inning snapped a 3-3 tie. Cano's 14th home run of the season tied him with Nelson Cruz for the team lead. The Mariners had evened the score an inning earlier, as Seager led off with a 400-foot shot, his ninth of the season, that landed halfway up the lower level in right field. An out later, Valencia blasted a 431-foot homer into the second deck in left field make it 3-3. It was Valencia's eighth home run of the season. The Mariners took a 1-0 lead in the first as Jean Segura led off with a single, stole second and moved to third on a throwing error by catcher Knapp, who was trying to nab Segura at second. With two outs, Cruz hit a run-scoring single up the middle.  We won, so great,  said Leiter, who allowed four runs on nine hits in five innings.  Really, the goal as a starting pitcher is to try to keep the team in the game as long as you can.  The Phillies answered in the third, as Knapp reached on an infield single and No. 9 hitter Kelly hit a two-run homer to right field. It was Kelly's first home run of the season and the second of his major league career. Philadelphia wasn't done, as Daniel Nava and Freddy Galvis hit back-to-back singles. A one-out walk to Joseph loaded the bases. Odubel Herrera grounded to second baseman Cano, who flipped to Valencia at first for one out as Nava scored to make it 3-1.  This gives us confidence to know we're able to come back,  Knapp said.  We don't have to try to do too much, just keep putting together good innings.  It's been a tough stretch, but we have some good ballplayers.  NOTES: Phillies RF Aaron Altherr doubled in the first inning to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. ... Mariners RHP Felix Hernandez moved into 50th place in major league history in strikeouts with 2,297, surpassing Dwight Gooden (2,293). ... Seattle completed a 5-4 homestand, winning the first five games and losing the last four. ...

It's a change to the open wood fire she normally uses, a change that is helping to ease tensions between refugees and locals over increasingly scarce wood in Mbile village in eastern Cameroon. Mbile's population of 5,000 swelled to nearly 16,500 between 2012 and 2014, as thousands of refugees fleeing violence in CAR found shelter in the village and its refugee camp, said Halpha Emmanuel, prefect of Kadey department in east Cameroon. The country hosts nearly 370,000 refugees, 274,000 of them from CAR where conflict spiraled in 2013, driven by ethnic and religious grievances and vying over vast diamond resources. Issa was forced to flee for her life when an armed group broke into her home while she was sleeping, and killed several of her relatives.  Three years ago when I arrived here, we found wood nearby, five minutes on foot from here. But, with time, wood became more and more scarce,  said Issa, who cooks for her family of seven.  Sometimes the search for wood took the whole morning, she said.  On our way, we usually met women from the village also searching for firewood. Some fights broke out in the bush because the villagers said we are responsible of the loss of wood at Mbile,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Mamadou Lamine, president of the Mbile Young Refugees' Association decided that his two wives would start buying firewood when one of them returned from the bush wounded.  She had been attacked while cutting wood in the bush, by a woman from the village accusing her of trespassing on her farm.  But buying firewood proved too costly and two months later, his wives had to return to the forest.   These briquettes are very welcome. I used to spend XAF 5,000 ($8.5) per month just for firewood. Now I have bricks that are not only easier to light but also free,  said the father of four children. Although the new stoves, made by the refugees, were initially designed for the refugees, villagers have also embraced them.  Mbile now has ten centers making the fuel - five in the refugee camp and five in the village, each producing 8,000 briquettes per day. The briquettes are made with clay and sawdust from local saw mills. Nearly 70 percent of Mbile's population no longer searches for wood in the bush, said Rodrigue Djakou, who runs the project in Mbile for the German development agency GIZ.   The use of ... briquettes helps to save about 16 tons of dried wood per day around Mbile,  said Djakou.  In one year, about 6,000 tons of dry wood around Mbile will be protected from being cut down as a result, he added.  According to Jean Rodrigue Mbarga, environmental expert at Cameroon's Ministry of Forests, about one hectare of forest is cut down per person per year to supply enough wood or charcoal to burn. That amounts to about 1.6 kgs of wood per inhabitant per day.   The most recent national data on the use of wood as firewood or charcoal is more than five years old, said Mbarga. But  if 70 percent of Mbile population stops using wood, then about 70 percent of the region's wood is preserved , he said.   These briquettes are a good thing for us,  said Benoit Gbandjo, one of Mbile's village chiefs.   We welcomed refugees, we gave them our lands free of charge. Then conflicts broke out because the few resources available were not even enough for us. It became difficult to share these resources,  he said. GIZ hopes to roll out the new stoves across Kadey department, home to 130,000 locals and 150,000 CAR refugees, all now using firewood.    Marie Mbone, a Mbile villager who is using the new fuel, said:  I am very happy ... Today, there is no more fighting. No need to go to the bush for wood - the briquettes are at home.

Qiu Xiaoqi, China's ambassador to Mexico, said China was willing to discuss a free-trade agreement, although no discussions had been held so far, Xinhua said. Qiu was speaking at an academic event in Mexico City.  If we negotiate a free-trade agreement, this will greatly favor trade exchanges between our two countries. There is no difficulty from China's side,  he said.  Mexico is China's second-largest trading partner in Latin America and China is Mexico's second-largest trading partner in the world. This is a highly important relationship and we have great interest in deepening and broadening these ties.  Mexico is keen to cut its economic reliance on the United States out of concern that access to its top trade partner may be restricted the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pledged to protect U.S. jobs from going outside the country. China and Mexico have been strengthening ties since late last year as the United States has stepped back from global trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).  Trump previously also threatened to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, United States and Canada, raising pressure on Mexico to reduce dependency on the United States, where it sends 80 percent of its goods exports. The Trump administration has recently become more conciliatory, and Mexico and the United States have expressed confidence that the renegotiation of NAFTA, expected to begin in August, could benefit both nations. Qiu's comments are nonetheless a potential boost for President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose attitude toward China has been mixed - leading to an off-and-on trade relationship.  I think any agreement to make trade easier is very worthy,  Qiu told the media after a speech at the National Autonomous University of Mexico to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.

The measures, which European and U.S. officials said would begin taking effect within three weeks, could require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives. The measures would affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. The United States in March banned laptops on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey, to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with a similar set of restrictions. The decision not to impose new laptop restrictions eases U.S. and European airlines' concern that expanding the ban to Europe or other locations could cause major logistical problems and deter travel.   Inaction is not an option,  U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told a news briefing, adding that he believed airlines would comply with the new screening. But he said the measures were not the last step to tighten security. U.S. carriers said they would follow the new security directive, but industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A), criticized Homeland Security for not working more closely with them on the new policies.       The development of the security directive should have been subject to a greater degree of collaboration and coordination to avoid the significant operational disruptions and unnecessarily frustrating consequences for the traveling public that appear likely to happen,  A4A Chief Executive Nicholas E. Calio said in a statement.  Kelly had been saying since April he thought an expansion of the laptop ban was  likely.  He said in late May the government could potentially expand the ban worldwide.     A TSA official removes a laptop from a bag for scanning using the Transport Security Administration's new Automated Screening Lane technology at Terminal 4 of JFK airport in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2017.Joe PenneyHomeland Security officials told reporters they expected more than 99 percent of airlines would comply, a move that would effectively end the controversial electronics ban.     Airlines that fail to satisfy new security requirements could still face in-cabin electronics restrictions, Kelly said.  We expect all airlines will work with us to keep their aircraft, their crew and their passengers safe,  he said. European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines have 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and have 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers.     U.S. authorities want increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas, expanded canine screening and  additional places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart.     Since laptops are widely used in flight by business class passengers - who pay double or more than the average ticket price - the airline industry had feared expanding the ban could cut into revenue.     Airline officials told Reuters they were concerned about adding enhanced security measures to all airports worldwide that have direct flights to the United States rather than focus them on airports where threats are highest.    European airline groups said in a document reviewed by Reuters that if the threats are confirmed, the restrictions should be deployed to cover all EU departing flights, not just U.S.-bound flights.     Homeland security officials said Wednesday that those 10 airports can get off the list if they meet the new security requirements, but did not say how long it will take.     U.S. airline stocks rose on Wednesday, with United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) closing up 1 percent, Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) up 2 percent and American Airlines Group (AAL.O) up 1.6 percent.     Kelly said last week he planned a  step by step  security enhancement plan that included short, medium-term and longer-term improvements that would take at least a year to implement fully.

Federal Bureau of Investigation agents visited the homes of Kaspersky employees late on Tuesday in multiple U.S. cities, although no search warrants were served, according to two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the FBI probe. Kaspersky Lab confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that FBI agents have had  brief interactions  with some of its U.S. employees, discussions that the company described as  due diligence  chats. The FBI declined to comment. The interviews were followed on Wednesday by the release of a defense spending policy bill passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would prohibit the U.S. Defense Department from using Kaspersky software platforms because the company  might be vulnerable to Russian government influence,  according to a summary of the legislation. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who amended the spending bill to include the Kaspersky language, said in a statement that  ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are very alarming.  A consensus in Congress and among Trump administration officials believed Kaspersky  cannot be trusted to protect critical infrastructure, particularly computer systems vital to our nation’s security,  Shaheen said. The bill would need to pass the full Senate and House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump in order to become law. Last month, senior U.S. intelligence officials said in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that they were reviewing government use of software from Kaspersky Lab. Lawmakers raised concerns that Moscow might use the firm's products to attack American computer networks, a particularly sensitive issue given allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked and leaked emails of Democratic Party political groups to interfere in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Russia denies the allegations. It was unclear whether the probe into Kaspersky Lab was related to an investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election meddling and possible collusion with associates of then-Republican Party candidate Donald Trump. In response to U.S. lawmakers' concerns, Kaspersky founder and Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky had said during a question-and-answer session on Reddit that he would be willing to appear before the Senate to dispel any concerns about his company's products. Kaspersky's anti-virus software is popular in the United States and around the world, though U.S. officials have long been suspicious that the company may have ties to Russian intelligence agencies. Kaspersky has said repeatedly it has no ties to any government and that allegations about its products being used to support Russian espionage are unfounded. In a separate statement on Wednesday, the company said,  Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations.  It said that in its 20-year history, the company has abided by  the highest ethical business practices.  U.S. intelligence agencies believe that the company and its president have had close ties to Russian political and intelligence officials since at least 2012, when a major shakeup of the firm’s executive ranks brought in new members with ties to Russia's three main intelligence agencies, said one U.S. official familiar with the investigation.

The measures, which European and U.S. officials said would begin taking effect within three weeks, could require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives. The measures would affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. The United States in March banned laptops on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey, to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with a similar set of restrictions.

The committee included the additional visas in its version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a must-pass piece of legislation that sets priorities for the Department of Defense budget for fiscal 2018, which will be about $650 billion. The Senate and House of Representatives are currently working on separate versions of the legislation, which must be reconciled and passed by both chambers and signed by President Donald Trump before it can become law. The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program allows Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, often risking their lives, to move to the United States after a rigorous vetting process. Bipartisan pushes by U.S. lawmakers this year for more SIV visas have come against the backdrop of efforts by the Trump administration to clamp down on immigration from majority-Muslim countries. In March, the U.S. embassy in Kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for SIV applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, but lawmakers included 2,500 more in a  spending bill in April to preserve the program. “Our nation owes a great debt to the civilians who have provided essential assistance to the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, and I am very pleased that this legislation authorizes the necessary visas for these brave men and women,” said Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led the push for the legislation with Republican Senator John McCain, the Armed Services Committee's chairman.

In 2016, revenue reached more than $3 billion in all activity linked to tourism in the country,  Jose Alonso, the Tourism Ministry's business director, told state-run media.  We think that, given the growth the country is seeing at the moment, we will beat that figure this year,  Alonso said. Tourism revenue totaled $2.6 billion in 2015. The number of foreign visitors to Cuba was up 22 percent in the first half of 2017 compared with the same period last year, according to Alonso, who said that put it on  track to reach its target for a record 4.2 million visits this year. Tourism has been one of the few bright spots recently in Cuba's economy, as it struggles with a decline in exports and subsidized oil shipments from its key ally Venezuela. Tourists pose for pictures at the Cathedral Square in Havana, Cuba June 17, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniA surge in American visitors has helped boost the sector since the 2014 U.S.-Cuban detente under the Obama administration and its easing of U.S. travel restrictions, even as a longtime ban on tourism remained in effect. But Trump earlier this month ordered a renewed tightening of travel restrictions, saying he was canceling former President Barack Obama's  terrible and misguided deal  with Havana. Many details of the policy change are still unknown. But independent travel to Cuba from the United States, by solo travelers and families, will likely be much more restricted. Alonso said he was confident  an important number of Americans  would still be able to visit the island. But an announcement by Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) on Wednesday that it was reducing its number of flights to Cuba cast shadow over his upbeat comments.  There is not a clear path to sustainability serving these markets, particularly with the continuing prohibition in U.S. law on tourism to Cuba for American citizens,  Southwest said in a statement.  Southwest joined other U.S. airlines that have cut flights to Cuba over past months or pulled out of the market altogether.

Domain, the real estate classifieds section of Fairfax, will form a joint venture (JV) with Sydney-based start-up Lendi in what Domain's CEO Antony Catalano said was a  very important strategic announcement . The JV, Domain Loan Finder, will be launched in early July, offering services from more than 30 lenders including the four major banks - Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank. Mortgage lending and broking are highly lucrative businesses, with Australia's home loan broking market alone generating A$2 billion ($1.53 billion) a year in commissions. However, the nation's biggest lenders have been forced to slow down lending, mainly to speculative property investors, as regulators fret over financial stability risks amid rising housing prices and record-high household debt. Policy makers are worried excessive debt in the property market will hurt spending elsewhere in the economy and lead to financial stability risks as the household debt-to-income ratio has climbed to an all-time peak of 189 percent. Earlier this week, Domain's biggest rival REA Group - owned by News Corp - said it had spent A$67 million to buy an 80 percent stake in mortgage broking franchise Smartline. Fairfax is subject to two takeover proposals from U.S.-based private equity firms, Hellman & Freidman and TPG Capital.

A growing corruption scandal has fueled bets about delays to the implementation of planned reforms to Brazil's pension system and labor laws, which investors say are necessary to help end the country's worst recession ever.     The real gained 1 percent after news that Senator Renan Calheiros had quit. He had led the ruling party in the Senate, but said he could not back the labor reform bill from a president in the middle of a corruption scandal.      The labor revamp is expected to pass a vote in a congressional committee on Thursday, paving the way final vote in the Senate next week.     The country's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose nearly 0.6 percent.     Mexican stocks and the peso firmed, tracking gains on Wall Street, where financial and technology stocks led a broad market rebound.      The Mexican peso firmed 0.8 percent to 17.87 per dollar. The peso broke past the psychological barrier of 18 per greenback earlier this month and it hit a more than 13-month high on Monday.

In 2016, revenue reached more than $3 billion in all activity linked to tourism in the country,  Jose Alonso, the Tourism Ministry's business director, told state-run media.  We think that, given the growth the country is seeing at the moment, we will beat that figure this year,  Alonso said. Tourism revenue totaled $2.6 billion in 2015. The number of foreign visitors to Cuba was up 22 percent in the first half of 2017 compared with the same period last year, according to Alonso, who said that put it on  track to reach its target for a record 4.2 million visits this year. Tourism has been one of the few bright spots recently in Cuba's economy, as it struggles with a decline in exports and subsidized oil shipments from its key ally Venezuela. Tourists pose for pictures at the Cathedral Square in Havana, Cuba June 17, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniA surge in American visitors has helped boost the sector since the 2014 U.S.-Cuban detente under the Obama administration and its easing of U.S. travel restrictions, even as a longtime ban on tourism remained in effect. But Trump earlier this month ordered a renewed tightening of travel restrictions, saying he was canceling former President Barack Obama's  terrible and misguided deal  with Havana. Many details of the policy change are still unknown. But independent travel to Cuba from the United States, by solo travelers and families, will likely be much more restricted. Alonso said he was confident  an important number of Americans  would still be able to visit the island. But an announcement by Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) on Wednesday that it was reducing its number of flights to Cuba cast shadow over his upbeat comments.  There is not a clear path to sustainability serving these markets, particularly with the continuing prohibition in U.S. law on tourism to Cuba for American citizens,  Southwest said in a statement.  Southwest joined other U.S. airlines that have cut flights to Cuba over past months or pulled out of the market altogether.

Chala comes from Ginchi, a town 72 km (45 miles) from Addis Ababa where protests began in November 2015, initially over a government plan to allocate large swathes of farmland to the capital city for urban development.  The plan would have displaced thousands of Oromo farmers, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia.  There were reports that people were killed in the protests and no one was reporting about it. No one cared who these people are,  Chala told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  The information was all over the internet, not well organized. I just wanted to give perspective.  While the land re-allocation project was officially scrapped by authorities, protests and conflict reignited over the continued arrest and jailing of opposition demonstrators with full-scale protests over everything from Facebook to economics. Several hundred protesters were killed in the 11 months to October 2016 when the government declared a state of emergency and shut down communications, including the internet.  More than 50 people died at a single demonstration that month, after a stampede was triggered by police use of teargas to disperse anti-government protesters at a religious festival. Witnesses also reported security forces firing live rounds into crowds of protesters at multiple locations. A government report presented to parliament in April acknowledged a death toll 669 people - 33 of them security personnel - although activists believe it could be much higher. For the government shutting off the internet for periods all but ended online contact across Ethiopia, leaving it to the Ethiopian diasporas to pull together the facts. Diaspora's Database Enter Chala, a PhD student in Oregon, the United States, who decided to log every death he could on an interactive map, inspired by a similar Palestinian project.  I started to collect the information from the internet: Facebook, Twitter and blogs. And I started to contact the people who had put that information out,  he said. Once word spread that Chala was collating the deaths, Ethiopian friends and activists began to send details, including photographs of those injured and killed. They contacted Chala via social media and instant messaging applications like Viber. Chala learned that Ethiopians in rural areas were driving miles to put evidence of the killings online, but he still feared there were information black holes. In its report of 669 deaths presented to parliament, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission - which works for the government - blamed protesters for damaging land and property. In the report, seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the Commission said the disturbances had damaged public services, private property and government institutions. It also cited harm to investment and development infrastructure. However the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, criticized the government for a lack of accountability and called for access to protest sites. Neither the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission nor the Ethiopian government responded to requests for comment. Facebook Leads to Jail  In a country where fear of reprisals is common place, it is easier for those living outside Ethiopia to speak out, said Felix Horne, Ethiopia researcher at Human Rights Watch.  Any time victims of human rights abuses share information with outside groups, with journalists – either domestic or international - there's often repercussions, quite often from local security officials,  he said. Horne said Facebook was a key source of information in the early stages of the protests but this was quickly seized on by the government and security officials checked students' phones. Last month, an opposition politician was sentenced to 6-1/2 years in prison because of comments he wrote on Facebook. Horne, whose organization also attempted to document the deaths, agreed that numbers are important for accountability, but said a focus on the death toll alone can be dehumanizing.  We've talked to so many people who were shot by security forces. Many of them children. Many of them students. The numbers sort of dehumanizes these individuals.  Cost of Free Thinking  Benta, a 29-year-old veterinarian and former government employee who took part in the protests, saw nine people shot. Speaking to the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Kenya, his new home, he recalled how a soldier fired directly on a car in Aje town, West Arsi on Feb. 15 last year. Five people were shot, two died and three were wounded, he said. Six months later, on Aug. 6, Benta was participating in another protest in Shashamane in the Oromia region, when he saw four people shot. He says he was detained and tortured for nearly two months and has now made a new life in Nairobi.   If you're expressing your freedom, you'll be shot, and if you're asking for your rights, you'll be detained,  he said. Chala said bullet wounds were the most common injuries visible on the photos that flooded in to him from Ethiopia and the brutality he witnessed has stayed with him.   It really hit me very hard,  he said.   People will forget. They'll bottleneck their emotions and grievances and the government will just extend and buy some time, and there will be another bubble sometime in the future. That's a vicious circle.

Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday postponed the vote on the bill, which they hoped would take place before their July 4 recess. According to credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, the legislation would negatively impact states because of changes to the core funding of Medicaid and the phasing out of the Medicaid expansion plan. The Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, issued a report on Wednesday estimating state Medicaid spending  would increase by $565 million in 2022 under the proposed  legislation. It also estimated federal funding for Medicaid, which funds medical care for the poor and indigent, would be $102.2 billion lower in that year. The National Governor's Association, which on Monday advocated for more time to review the financial impact of the bill, welcomed the delay. Members of the Senate Republicans' own party resisted the measure, which the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade and reduce federal outlays for Medicaid by $772 billion over that time. Protesters demonstrate the Republican healthcare bill outside Republican Congressman Darrell Issa's office in Vista, California, June 27, 2017.Mike BlakeMoody's senior analyst Genevieve Nolan told Reuters the legislation in its current form would be a credit negative for states, mainly because of reduced federal funding for Medicaid.  Obviously this bill is ACA (Affordable Care Act) repeal and replace, but even more than that, it’s Medicaid repeal and replace. Medicaid is a more than 50-year-old program, a  partnership between states and the federal government, and both the Senate bill and the House bill propose really fundamental restructuring of how that program is funded,  Eric Kim, Fitch's director of U.S. Public finance, told Reuters. State Impacts A mix of Republican and Democratic governors criticized or strongly opposed the bill, including Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management said in a report on Tuesday the bill could cost the state about $2.9 billion per year by 2026. The report also said the cap to federal payments would  force  states, including Connecticut, to assume costs, limit benefits, decrease the number of people served or reduce rates to providers. In Virginia, the bill would cost the state's Medicaid program at least $1.4 billion over seven years, according to  Governor Terry McAuliffe's office. It would  blow a hole in Virginia's budget,  McAuliffe said in a statement.

The central bank, according to the sources, wants a formula that imposes limits on the amount available to clients and the days of usage of the overdraft credit.  According to central bank data, the banks charged an average 328 percent annual interest rate in May. The central bank declined to comment. Banks had discussed the issue within a self-regulating group but did not reach any agreement, the sources said.  Thus, they said the central bank has decided to take the lead in discussions with financial institutions.  The central bank has already changed rules governing  revolving credit lines offered by credit cards. The use of revolving credit - which could amount to up to 500 percent in annual interest rates - was limited to one month.  After that, banks are required to transfer debts to lower-cost credit products. Brazilian interest rates for consumer credit are among the highest in the world, providing a drag on economic growth.

It's a change to the open wood fire she normally uses, a change that is helping to ease tensions between refugees and locals over increasingly scarce wood in Mbile village in eastern Cameroon. Mbile's population of 5,000 swelled to nearly 16,500 between 2012 and 2014, as thousands of refugees fleeing violence in CAR found shelter in the village and its refugee camp, said Halpha Emmanuel, prefect of Kadey department in east Cameroon. The country hosts nearly 370,000 refugees, 274,000 of them from CAR where conflict spiraled in 2013, driven by ethnic and religious grievances and vying over vast diamond resources. Issa was forced to flee for her life when an armed group broke into her home while she was sleeping, and killed several of her relatives.  Three years ago when I arrived here, we found wood nearby, five minutes on foot from here. But, with time, wood became more and more scarce,  said Issa, who cooks for her family of seven.  Sometimes the search for wood took the whole morning, she said.  On our way, we usually met women from the village also searching for firewood. Some fights broke out in the bush because the villagers said we are responsible of the loss of wood at Mbile,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Mamadou Lamine, president of the Mbile Young Refugees' Association decided that his two wives would start buying firewood when one of them returned from the bush wounded.  She had been attacked while cutting wood in the bush, by a woman from the village accusing her of trespassing on her farm.  But buying firewood proved too costly and two months later, his wives had to return to the forest.   These briquettes are very welcome. I used to spend XAF 5,000 ($8.5) per month just for firewood. Now I have bricks that are not only easier to light but also free,  said the father of four children. Although the new stoves, made by the refugees, were initially designed for the refugees, villagers have also embraced them.  Mbile now has ten centers making the fuel - five in the refugee camp and five in the village, each producing 8,000 briquettes per day. The briquettes are made with clay and sawdust from local saw mills. Nearly 70 percent of Mbile's population no longer searches for wood in the bush, said Rodrigue Djakou, who runs the project in Mbile for the German development agency GIZ.   The use of ... briquettes helps to save about 16 tons of dried wood per day around Mbile,  said Djakou.  In one year, about 6,000 tons of dry wood around Mbile will be protected from being cut down as a result, he added.  According to Jean Rodrigue Mbarga, environmental expert at Cameroon's Ministry of Forests, about one hectare of forest is cut down per person per year to supply enough wood or charcoal to burn. That amounts to about 1.6 kgs of wood per inhabitant per day.   The most recent national data on the use of wood as firewood or charcoal is more than five years old, said Mbarga. But  if 70 percent of Mbile population stops using wood, then about 70 percent of the region's wood is preserved , he said.   These briquettes are a good thing for us,  said Benoit Gbandjo, one of Mbile's village chiefs.   We welcomed refugees, we gave them our lands free of charge. Then conflicts broke out because the few resources available were not even enough for us. It became difficult to share these resources,  he said. GIZ hopes to roll out the new stoves across Kadey department, home to 130,000 locals and 150,000 CAR refugees, all now using firewood.    Marie Mbone, a Mbile villager who is using the new fuel, said:  I am very happy ... Today, there is no more fighting. No need to go to the bush for wood - the briquettes are at home.

Stephen Hodge, a former senior vice president of sales at StarKist, pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information that was filed on May 30 in federal court in San Francisco. A criminal information is a type of charging document prosecutors tend to use in connection with people who are negotiating plea deals. Hodge, who agreed to pay a fine and cooperate with the investigation by the department's antitrust division, will be sentenced by the court later, the statement said. Hodge is one of three executives to plead guilty in the conspiracy. The Justice Department said he met with officials from other canned seafood companies, which were not named,  to fix, raise and maintain the prices  of canned seafood. Bumble Bee Foods agreed in May to plead guilty to one count of fixing the prices of canned tuna and to pay a criminal fine of $25 million. Two of its executives agreed to plead guilty to price-fixing in December. The U.S. canned tuna market has long been dominated by three companies. Thai Union Group's Chicken of the Sea is the largest, followed by Bumble Bee and StarKist. In December 2015, the Justice Department stopped Thai Union Group from buying Bumble Bee. StarKist is a subsidiary of the Dongwon Group of South Korea. (Additional reporting by Diane Bartz)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/starkist-antitrust-idUSL1N1JP2A0"},

Bush,James Comey,Jared Kushner,Jim Comey,Lindsey Graham,Mark Warner,Nicholas Burns,Richard Burr,Robert Mueller,USA,CYBER/CONGRESS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday they had reached an agreement that would allow them to see memos written by former FBI Director James Comey about his meetings with President Donald Trump. Comey's relationship with Trump has been central to ongoing investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Lawmakers have raised questions about whether Trump fired Comey on May 9 in order to interfere with the Russia probe. Russia has denied such assertions. Trump, a Republican, has dismissed them as sour grapes voiced by Democrats disappointed by his victory and called them a  witch hunt.   We have a commitment to get appropriate access to the Comey memos,  Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat, told reporters at the Senate.  I'm pleased. I think it's critical information that we have to have as part of our review process.  He said he expected to have the memos  soon.  Warner declined to say much about the progress of the investigation or provide a timeline for when it might be concluded.  I would have thought we would have been further along, but I would never have expected the administration to fire Jim Comey. You can't make this stuff up,  he said. When asked, he said he expected that Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, would appear before the committee as promised despite having recently hired a lawyer. Politico first reported that Richard Burr, the committee's Republican chairman, said the panel would be obtaining memos Comey wrote documenting his conversations with Trump. Comey Testimony Comey testified to the intelligence committee this month that he decided to keep detailed records because he felt so uncomfortable after meetings with the president that he feared Trump might lie about them. The Russia investigations, by Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees, have dogged the first months of Trump's presidency and distracted from his policy goals such as repealing President Barack Obama's healthcare law. Trump has also faced criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats over his administration's failure to do more to investigate charges that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and concerns that it might do so again.  Russia's our most dangerous adversary in the world today, and if he continues to refuse to act, it's a dereliction of the basic duty to defend the country,  Nicholas Burns, an undersecretary of state under Republican President George W. Bush, testified to the Senate panel on Wednesday. At a hearing last week that focused on the U.S. election, a Homeland Security official testified that Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and that a small number were breached. Warner said the panel had asked officials in 21 states to release information about the hacking.  I do not see how Americans are made safer when they do not know which state elections systems Russia tried to hack,  he said.

Comey's relationship with Trump has been central to ongoing investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Lawmakers have raised questions about whether Trump fired Comey on May 9 in order to interfere with the Russia probe. Russia has denied such assertions. Trump, a Republican, has dismissed them as sour grapes voiced by Democrats disappointed by his victory and called them a  witch hunt.   We have a commitment to get appropriate access to the Comey memos,  Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat, told reporters at the Senate.  I'm pleased. I think it's critical information that we have to have as part of our review process.  He said he expected to have the memos  soon.  Warner declined to say much about the progress of the investigation or provide a timeline for when it might be concluded.  I would have thought we would have been further along, but I would never have expected the administration to fire Jim Comey. You can't make this stuff up,  he said. When asked, he said he expected that Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, would appear before the committee as promised despite having recently hired a lawyer. Politico first reported that Richard Burr, the committee's Republican chairman, said the panel would be obtaining memos Comey wrote documenting his conversations with Trump.

The Russia investigations, by Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees, have dogged the first months of Trump's presidency and distracted from his policy goals such as repealing President Barack Obama's healthcare law. FILE PHOTO - U.S. Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns is interviewed by Reuters at the U.S. State Department in Washington February 8, 2008.Susan CornwellTrump has also faced criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats over his administration's failure to do more to investigate charges that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and concerns that it might do so again.  Russia's our most dangerous adversary in the world today, and if he continues to refuse to act, it's a dereliction of the basic duty to defend the country,  Nicholas Burns, an undersecretary of state under Republican President George W. Bush, testified to the Senate panel on Wednesday.  At a hearing last week that focused on the U.S. election, a Homeland Security official testified that Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and that a small number were breached. Warner said the panel had asked officials in 21 states to release information about the hacking.  I do not see how Americans are made safer when they do not know which state elections systems Russia tried to hack,  he said.

She heads a stellar field for the second major on the women’s calendar at Olympia Fields, the scene of Jim Furyk’s victory at the 2003 U.S Open. Ryu became the third number one in as many weeks with her victory at the Arkansas Championship on Sunday, supplanting Thai Ariya Jutanugarn, who only a week earlier had displaced New Zealander Lydia Ko. Ryu, who celebrates her 27th birthday on Thursday, is going for consecutive major victories, after winning the ANA Inspiration in a playoff with Lexi Thompson.  I’m living a dream,  she said.  I want to keep this position as much as I can, as long as I can ... The (career) grand slam is one of my best goals right now. I still need to knock down three more tournaments.  Ryu, the 2011 U.S. Women’s Open champion, has tightened her swing recently which she says has helped reduce the damage of loose shots. She certainly did not hit many poor shots in her second-round 61 last week, a score she knows will be difficult to accomplish at Olympia Fields, where she says the severely sloping greens will demand precise approach shots that stop under the hole. Not that she is ready to plan her victory speech just yet. “I’m not a robot, so sometimes I play bad, sometimes great,” she said. Ryu is part of a never-ending Korean juggernaut that currently has five players ranked among the world’s top 10, with Chun In-gee, Park In-bee, Park Sung-hyun and Amy Yang also high on the list. But the Korean contingent is unlikely to have it all its own way this week, with many players running into form at the right time, among them former child prodigy Michelle Wie, who has finished third, second and fourth in her past three starts. And Canadian Brooke Henderson is not ready to surrender her title without a fight, coming off a victory at the Meijer LPGA Classic. “I feel like my game is in a great place right now,” Henderson said on Wednesday. “I’ve been saying that all year but then I won (and) proved to some of the naysayers and proved to myself that I am in a great position.” Editing by Ian Ransom","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-pgachamp-idUSKBN19J32N"},

The Nasdaq posted its best session since Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. presidential election. The S&P; 500 had suffered its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks on Tuesday after a healthcare bill was delayed in the U.S. Senate.  The healthcare legislation is the first major plank of President Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Investors may be reevaluating the impact of the Senate's delay on the market and Trump's agenda, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The market has had trouble really appreciating, but it has had even more trouble declining,  Meckler said.  It seems like any negative period is very quickly met with new buyers.   Interest rates are still very low and a lot of investors see little opportunity to invest anywhere but in stocks,  he added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 143.95 points, or 0.68 percent, to 21,454.61, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 21.31 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,440.69 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 87.79 points, or 1.43 percent, to 6,234.41. The small-cap Russell 2000  ended up 1.6 percent. Financials .SPSY were the best performing S&P; sector, rising 1.6 percent. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., June 27, 2017.Lucas JacksonBank stocks including JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) helped boost the S&P; 500, both rising more than 2.0 percent. The interest rate-sensitive group was helped by an increase in yields for 10-year Treasuries and by a widening spread between shorter- and longer-dated U.S. bonds.  We have had the statements from various Fed officials that they are still on board with the tightening cycle and that has been a big driver for finance names,  said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. Bank stocks also were higher ahead of stress test results from the Federal Reserve and added to those gains in after-hours trading as the Fed approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes. Tech stocks .SPLRCT gained 1.3 percent, surging back from their worst day in more than two weeks. The sector has led the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain this year, but has pulled back recently as some investors question whether the group is too expensive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced off its 50-day moving average. With second-quarter U.S. corporate earnings reporting set to begin in earnest in July, investors are looking for results to support equity valuations. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15 times. In earnings news, General Mills (GIS.N) shares rose 1.6 percent after the Cheerios cereal maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Staples (SPLS.O) shares rose 8.4 percent. The company will announce its sale to private equity firm Sycamore Partners, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Through television attack ads and online campaigns normally seen only during the tumult of an election, the groups are helping Trump to strike back against his perceived enemies and boost his agenda, adding to the firepower of his Twitter account and the bully pulpit of the White House. On Tuesday, one of the groups, America First Policies, launched an attack ad against a senator from Trump's own Republican Party who had balked at a Senate plan to overhaul healthcare that would leave millions more Americans uninsured. The attack angered Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who is struggling to rustle up the votes for the plan. It is the first time that a U.S. president has had Super PACs - political action committees that can raise unlimited amounts of money and typically operate during elections - or political non-profits, which do not have to disclose their donors or where they spend their money, actively working to support him after the dust of campaigning has cleared.  The pro-Trump groups are prohibited from coordinating with the White House, which declined to comment for this story. The New York Times reported that McConnell had complained to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus about America First Policies' ad. The group later pulled the ad. America First Policies and the other pro-Trump groups were set up to promote Trump and his legislative agenda - healthcare reform, building a wall along the Mexican border, and pushing for lower taxation and deregulation. They are not allied to the Republican Party, which can pose a problem for Republican leaders as Tuesday's attack ad showed. With Trump's approval ratings sagging and his agenda now overshadowed by a federal investigation into his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia, the groups are pouring resources into protecting Trump’s image, demonizing his opponents and amplifying his message that he is the victim of a witch-hunt.  The establishment is shaken, angry, losing control,  begins another new ad by America First Policies, which says on its website that it is a non-profit organization  supporting key policy initiatives.  Images of the U.S. Capitol, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow flash in the background.   Desperately waging an all-out war to protect their interest,  the narrator continues.  They lie, they leak, they leech onto power.  America First Policies is comprised of more traditionally conservative Republicans and was founded after the election by a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence, Nick Ayers.  The group said in a statement their mission was to promote Trump's agenda and that they were not afraid to push House Republicans through grassroots and advertising to support the healthcare overhaul. The groups' shift from policy promotion to attack mode, does not surprise Marjorie Hershey, a political science professor at Indiana University. The websites of the three largest Political Action Committee (PAC) groups supporting U.S. President Donald Trump and his agenda, including (L-R) the sites of  America First Policies ,  Committee to Defend the President  and  Great America PAC  are seen on computer screens in this photo illustration taken in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017.Jim Bourg/Illustration A lot of research tells us that negative ads tend to be more attention-getting than positive ads, and because Super PACs themselves aren't on the ballot, they can afford to risk the unsavory reputation that negative advertisers often get,” Hershey said.  Strategists and political scientists say it is hard to know if the groups are actually moving public opinion. But the groups point to their fundraising as evidence of their success – much of it raised not from millionaires, but in small donations from voters.  Just Another Dc Insider   Great America Alliance  - which was set up as a sister organization to a Super PAC created by Trump supporters Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich - has spent $400,000 on an ad attacking former FBI Director James Comey, the group's director, Eric Beach, told Reuters.     Slideshow (2 Images)The video tried to discredit Comey, who was fired by Trump over his handling of the Russia probe, the week he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Just another DC insider in it for himself,  the ad concludes. The group launched a new ad this week featuring conservative media star Tomi Lahren attacking Robert Mueller, the special counsel now leading the Russia investigation. Mueller is investigating whether Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice by pressuring Comey to drop his inquiry.  On its website the group says its mission is  to advocate for a stronger economy, a more secure nation, and a society with less government intrusion and more freedom for American citizens.  Asked to reconcile its stated mission with the attack ads, the group's director, Eric Beach, said, “Our goal is to really get on the ground and fight back. Our supporters want to get out there and fight ... the mischaracterization of not just Donald Trump’s rhetoric but also his policies.”  Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University who specializes in Super PACS, said the well-resourced groups play a key role in spreading Trump's message that what his supporters are reading or seeing in the media is false.  “They’re saying we see what’s happening now and you shouldn’t believe it.  The Committee to Defend the President, another Super PAC, launched an ad calling on supporters to “defend” Trump. The group’s leader, Ted Harvey, said unfair attacks on Trump had forced his group to shift their focus to defending the president instead of promoting his policies.  “Certainly, I would rather be talking about policies than talking about made-up lies that the Democrats and the mainstream media cabal have put together to discredit the administration from moving forward on its agenda,” said Harvey.

Nobody was injured. Officials said special forces were seeking Oscar Perez, 36, a police pilot named as the mastermind of the raid by the helicopter that carried a banner saying  Freedom!  In 2015, Perez co-produced and starred in  Death Suspended,  an action film in which he played the lead role as a government agent rescuing a kidnapped businessman. There was no sign on Wednesday of Perez, whom officials condemned as a  psychopath , but the helicopter was found on Venezuela's northern Caribbean coastline.  We ask for maximum support to find this fanatic, extremist terrorist,  vice president Tareck El Aissami said. The attack exacerbated an already full-blown political crisis in Venezuela after three months of opposition protests demanding general elections and fixes for the sinking economy. At least 76 people have died in the unrest since April, the latest a 25-year-old man shot in the head near a protest in the Petare slum of Caracas, authorities said on Wednesday.  Hundreds more people have been injured and arrested in what Maduro terms an ongoing coup attempt with U.S. encouragement.

The helicopter raid also coincided with a judicial measure weakening the powers of dissident chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has emerged as a major challenger to Maduro.  It seems like a movie,  said Julio Borges, leader of the opposition-controlled legislature, of the helicopter raid.  Some people say it is a set-up, some that it is real ... Yesterday was full of contradictions ... A thousand things are happening, but I summarize it like this: a government is decaying and rotting, while a nation is fighting for dignity.   Though Perez posted a video on social media showing himself in front of four hooded armed men and claiming to represent a coalition of security and civilian officials rising up against  tyranny,  there was no evidence of deeper support.   Cheap Show  FILE PHOTO: Police official Oscar Perez poses for photographs during an event of the Body of Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation (CICPC) in Caracas, Venezuela March 1, 2015.Christian VeronThe government, however, accused the policemen of links to the CIA and to Miguel Rodriguez, a former interior minister and intelligence chief under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, who recently broke with the government.  I'm not at all convinced by the helicopter incident,  Rodriguez told Reuters on Wednesday, saying the figures behind Perez in the video looked like dummies and expressing surprise the helicopter could fly freely and also not injure anyone.  Conclusion: a cheap show. Who gains from this? Only Nicolas for two reasons: to give credibility to his coup d'etat talk, and to blame Rodriguez,  he added, referring to himself. Around the time of the attack, the pro-government Supreme Court expanded the role of the state ombudsman, a human rights guarantor who is closely allied with Maduro, by giving him powers previously held only by the state prosecutor's office.     Opposition leaders described that as an attempt to supplant chief prosecutor Ortega, who has confronted both Maduro and the Supreme Court this year after splitting ranks. Slideshow (16 Images)The Supreme Court on Wednesday evening said it approved a measure blocking Ortega from leaving the country, freezing her bank accounts, and summoning her to a July 4 hearing to discuss whether she has committed  serious offenses.   Adding to Venezuela's tinder-box atmosphere, opposition supporters again took to the streets nationwide on Wednesday to barricade roads.  One opposition lawmaker, Juan Guaido, filmed himself bleeding from wounds he said were inflicted by rubber bullets.  Opposition supporters hope that cracks within government may swing the crisis their way, and have been delighted to see heavyweights like Ortega and Rodriguez oppose Maduro. Their main focus is to stop a July 30 vote called by Maduro to form a super-body known as a Constituent Assembly, with powers to rewrite the constitution and supersede other institutions. Maduro says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela, but opponents say it is a sham vote intended solely to keep an unpopular government in power.   We can't let July 30 happen, we mustn't,  said children's health worker Rosa Toro, 52, blocking a road with friends.  We're being governed by criminals, traffickers and thieves,  added lawyer Matias Perez, 40, protesting with a plastic trumpet. Government officials lined up on Wednesday to condemn the helicopter attack, insisting it was the work of a few individuals and not representative of wider dissent.  Foreign Minister Samuel Moncada complained about the lack of international condemnation of the attack, saying it contrasted with the barrage of foreign criticism of the government.  In Europe it's now eight at night, but we've not had any reaction from European Union countries,  he said of a bloc that has been strongly critical of Maduro in recent months. The minister rejected accusations that the attack was carried out by the government for its own purposes.   Who can believe we are that sophisticated? Sending someone to throw grenades, who can believe that?  he asked.

The agent, Joseph Astarita, was charged with three counts of making false statements and two counts of obstruction of justice in an indictment handed down in U.S. District Court in Oregon on June 20.  According to the court papers, Astarita falsely told investigators he did not open fire at Robert  LaVoy  Finicum during a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement on a snow-covered road near the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 26, 2016.  Astarita, who is a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's hostage rescue team based in Quantico, Virginia, is not accused of killing Finicum or striking him with any bullets.  Finicum, a 54-year-old rancher who acted as a spokesman for the refuge's lands-rights occupiers, was shot dead by Oregon State police in an incident caught on videotape taken by a law enforcement aircraft. A county prosecutor later found the shooting justified, saying Finicum appeared to have been reaching for a weapon. Finicum's family members have accused law enforcement of covering up the circumstances surrounding his death. Billy Williams, the U.S. attorney for Oregon, told reporters on Wednesday the indictment does not call into question the local prosecutor's finding that officers were justified in using deadly force against Finicum. An autopsy found that the rancher was killed by three rounds fired by Oregon State Police officers that struck him in the neck, shoulder and lower back. Astarita also faces two counts of obstruction of justice for failing to disclose to Oregon State police officers that he fired two rounds during the attempted arrest, the indictment said. Astarita was arraigned Wednesday in Portland, Williams said. He pleaded not guilty to all counts and was released pending future court appearances. It was not immediately clear if Astarita had retained an attorney. The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The takeover of the wildlife refuge was initially sparked by outrage over the plight of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers the occupiers believed had been unfairly treated in an arson case. But the militants said they were also protesting larger grievances at what they saw as government tyranny. The leaders of the occupation, Ammon and Ryan Bundy, were taken into custody at the roadside where Finicum was shot dead. Both Bundys and five of their followers were acquitted by a federal jury in October of conspiracy charges.   The Bundys still face assault, conspiracy and other charges from a separate armed standoff in 2014 at the Nevada ranch of their father, Cliven Bundy, triggered when federal agents seized his cattle for failure to pay grazing fees to the government.

The report said if the women had reliable contraceptives, there would be a sharp drop in the number of unwanted pregnancies, down from about 89 million a year to 22 million.  Meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of women in developing regions is an achievable and affordable goal,  said Ann Starrs, whose Guttmacher Institute produced the report. Many women in Africa, Asia and Latin America lack the resources and facilities to get hold of modern contraceptives,  according to the U.S.-based research group. Additionally, when they do get pregnant, millions of women do not receive the care they need, the report added. Here are some facts about contraception and maternal health in the world's poor regions: - 214 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method. This includes condoms, pills and implants. Of these, 155 million use nothing, while the rest use unreliable birth control such as withdrawal. - Almost half of pregnancies in the developing world are unintended, coming too soon or to women who do not want babies. - Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia are home to almost 60 percent of the women who want to avoid pregnancy but cannot access proper contraception. - Globally, 21.6 million women have unsafe abortions each year, nine out of 10 of which take place in developing countries, according the World Health Organization. - Many women do not use contraceptives for fear of side effects or because they do not think they are at risk of getting pregnant if they don't have sex often.  - Some 35 million women giving birth in 2017 will not deliver in a health facility, according to the Institute.   - In 2017, an estimated 300,000 women in poor countries will die from pregnancy-related causes and 2.7 million babies will die in the first month of life, the report said.

McEnroe previously said that Williams, a record 23-times grand slam champion in the professional era, was the best female player ever but then declined to label her the best player overall, prompting Williams to ask McEnroe for  respect .   It would have been better not to have said it. I didn't realize it would create something like this,  he told reporters on an ESPN conference call ahead of the July 3 start of the Wimbledon championships, the third grand slam event of the year.   It would have been easier to leave it. Look, she's a great player and it's apples and oranges.   But McEnroe, a seven-times grand slam winner and current ESPN broadcaster, did not retract his earlier statement about where Williams would rank if she competed against men.  This is not something that has been earth shattering, that I feel there's a difference in the level of the women and the men,  he said. Williams, who has taken a break from tennis to have her first child, due in late August, responded testily to McEnroe on Twitter after his initial comments.  Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based,  she wrote.   I've never played anyone ranked 'there' nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.

Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday postponed the vote on the bill, which they hoped would take place before their July 4 recess. According to credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, the legislation would negatively impact states because of changes to the core funding of Medicaid and the phasing out of the Medicaid expansion plan. The Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, issued a report on Wednesday estimating state Medicaid spending would increase by $565 million in 2022 under the proposed legislation. It also estimated federal funding for Medicaid, which funds medical care for the poor and indigent, would be $102.2 billion lower in that year. The National Governor's Association, which on Monday advocated for more time to review the financial impact of the bill, welcomed the delay. Members of the Senate Republicans' own party resisted the measure, which the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade and reduce federal outlays for Medicaid by $772 billion over that time. Moody's senior analyst Genevieve Nolan told Reuters the legislation in its current form would be a credit negative for states, mainly because of reduced federal funding for Medicaid.  Obviously this bill is ACA (Affordable Care Act) repeal and replace, but even more than that, it’s Medicaid repeal and replace. Medicaid is a more than 50-year-old program, a partnership between states and the federal government, and both the Senate bill and the House bill propose really fundamental restructuring of how that program is funded,  Eric Kim, Fitch's director of U.S. Public finance, told Reuters. State Impacts A mix of Republican and Democratic governors criticized or strongly opposed the bill, including Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management said in a report on Tuesday the bill could cost the state about $2.9 billion per year by 2026. The report also said the cap to federal payments would  force  states, including Connecticut, to assume costs, limit benefits, decrease the number of people served or reduce rates to providers. In Virginia, the bill would cost the state's Medicaid program at least $1.4 billion over seven years, according to Governor Terry McAuliffe's office. It would  blow a hole in Virginia's budget,  McAuliffe said in a statement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-states-idUSL1N1JP28E"},

Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), often fatal without medical care, has  skyrocketed  to more than three times the emergency threshold of two percent in Hiraan region's Mataban District, a survey by Save the Children found.  Scaling up to provide services to everyone affected is a challenge because we have around two million people living in al Shabaab controlled areas,  said Hassan Noor Saadi, Save the Children's Somalia country director.   Getting aid to them is not easy.   Al Shabaab militants ruled most of south-central Somalia until 2011, when they were driven out of the capital Mogadishu by African Union troops, and still carry out major attacks. In 2011, some 260,000 Somalis died of famine caused by drought, conflict and lack of access to humanitarian aid.  Somali's erratic spring rains were not good enough to guarantee crop growth, while livestock continue to die, leaving families with little to feed their children, Saadi said.  When animals die, there is no food, no milk, and no assets to make money off and subsequently buy food,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. More than 275,000 children potentially face suffer life-threatening severe acute malnutrition this year, according to the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF. [nL8N1I42FP]  If these children are not given special foods to help them recover, their immunity will go down and they will become prone to opportunistic diseases,  Saadi said.  They can either die from these diseases or from hunger.  Some 714,000 Somalis have fled their homes due to drought and failed crops since last November, joining 1 million previously internally displaced Somalis, the U.N. says. Aid agencies are also struggling to save lives across the border in Ethiopia's Somali region, where nomads whose livestock have been killed by drought have settled in informal camps. Medecins Sans Frontieres teams have treated more than 6,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in the area since January, a tenfold increase on 2016, the medical charity said on Monday.  These numbers are the highest our teams there have seen in ten years,  MSF spokeswoman Rosie Slater said in emailed comments, adding that 67 children died in June.

Alphabet's Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber has fired Levandowski. He is not a defendant in the case, but his actions, and what Uber executives knew about them, are at the center of Waymo's lawsuit. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets. A trial is scheduled for October. In a court filing on Wednesday, Uber said Levandowski's downloads had nothing to do with his future employment at Uber.  This is consistent with the complete lack of evidence that such files exist at, or have ever been used by, Uber,  the company said. Instead, Uber said it believes Levandowski took the files to ensure an expected $120 million bonus payment from Waymo. Uber did not detail how it believes the downloads would have helped Levandowski accomplish that objective. At one point while Uber was negotiating to buy Levandowski's company, Levandowski told Uber executives including former CEO Travis Kalanick that he found five discs in his home that contained Google information.  Kalanick emphatically told Levandowski that Uber did not want any such information,  Uber said in the court filing, adding Levandowski said he destroyed the discs. In a separate court filing, Waymo said the incident with the discs proved Uber executives knew he possessed Google information before he came to Uber.  And even after finding out that he had Waymo materials in his possession...Uber never took any steps to prohibit Levandowski from using his 'treasure trove of files' in his work at Uber,  Waymo said. Waymo also said it has not been able to review all the correspondence Levandowski had with Uber executives. For instance, Waymo said it could not find text messages from Kalanick to Levandowski even though it did find messages from Levandowski to Kalanick,  suggesting that the former were deleted.  Uber had hoped Levandowski, one the most respected self-driving engineers in Silicon Valley, would help the ride services company catch up to rivals including Waymo, in the race for self-driving technology.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-alphabet-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JP28A"},

Children in Mali who benefited from these three measures from their teachers were 95 percent less likely to be infected with malaria parasites and 44 percent less at risk of being anemic than those who only received bed nets, according to the study. The pupils' ability to pay attention for longer also improved, found the research, conducted by Save the Children, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and the National Institute for Public Health Research in Mali.   While malaria kills thousands of young African children each year, many others harbor the parasites that cause the disease without displaying symptoms. These infections frequently go unrecognized and untreated, leading to anemia, which can cause tiredness and affect children's cognitive and physical development.  This low-cost three-pronged approach delivered through schools had significant health benefits and could potentially improve educational performance,  Sian Clarke, lead researcher of the study and LSTHM senior lecturer, said in a statement. The study showed these benefits lasted until the beginning of the next malaria transmission season, suggesting a single annual dose of antimalarial drugs could help protect children from anemia during the entire school year, she added. By reducing the number of malaria parasites in pupils, this approach could also help to cut infections in their communities, according to the researchers, who said malaria control strategies should be a formal part of education health plans. Preventing anemia in schoolgirls is particularly important in countries such as Mali because teenage marriage and pregnancy is so common, said Natalie Roschnik, senior nutrition advisor at Save the Children and study co-author.  A girl who is anemic when pregnant is more likely to have a low birth weight child with developmental delays and is at greater risk of dying too,  Roschnik said as the study was published in the London-based medical journal BMJ Global Health. The world has made huge strides against malaria since 2000, with death rates plunging by 60 percent and at least six million lives saved globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But efforts to end one of the world's deadliest diseases - which kills about 430,000 people a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa - are under threat as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to measures such as bed nets and drugs.

Buffett,USA,BANKS/STRESS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes beyond being a cushion against catastrophe. On Wednesday, the Fed said those lenders, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, had passed the second, tougher part of its annual stress test. The results showed that many have not only built up adequate capital buffers, but improved risk management procedures as well. One bank, Capital One Financial Corp, must resubmit its scheme by year-end, though the Fed is still allowing it to go forward with its capital plan in the meantime. Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is acting as regulatory lead for the U.S. central bank, said the process  has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and most to substantially improve their capital planning processes.  Altogether, banks that went through the tests will be able to pay out 100 percent of their projected net income over the next four quarters, compared with 65 percent after last year’s results, a senior Fed official said. It would be the first time since the 2008 financial crisis that banks return at least as much money to shareholders as they produce in annual profit. The verdict marks a significant victory for the banking industry, which has worked for years to regain its stature. The green light could also serve as a watershed moment for Wall Street, which is eager to get a lighter regulatory touch from policymakers in Washington. After the Fed's announcement, banks began to release details on how they plan to use their extra capital. Apart from Capital One, bank stocks rose in after-hours trading. Citigroup Inc won a particularly notable victory, gaining permission to return nearly $19 billion to shareholders, or about 125 percent of projected earnings over the next four quarters - a big bump from last year, and more than analysts had expected. Capital One must resubmit plans because it did not appropriately account for risks in  one of its most material businesses,  the Fed said. Concerns centered around internal controls and whether senior management and the bank’s board of directors would be informed about problems in a timely and appropriate way, the Fed official said. The Fed did not identify which business was ill-prepared. Capital One's most significant business is credit card lending. It has also built up a presence in auto lending. Both areas have been flagged by bankers and analysts as showing signs of weakness lately. Capital One has until year-end to deliver an improved submission. In the interim, the bank can go ahead with its plan to repurchase up to $1.85 billion worth of stock, but the Fed can still object if the problems are not fixed. Capital One had already reduced its capital request after the first set of stress-test results was released last week. American Express Co had also resubmitted a plan with reduced requests, which was approved. Other big banks, including Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, also cleared the Fed's bar, and most issued press releases detailing big increases in shareholder payouts. In a twist, Bank of America's planned dividend hike could lead Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc to convert a large preferred stake into common stock, which would turn it into the bank's largest shareholder. This year was the first time all banks undergoing stress tests passed, although it was also the first time most were excluded from the  qualitative  component that Capital One failed. Only 13 of the 34 lenders were subject to that part, which bankers have criticized as being too opaque and subjective. In response to those complaints, the Fed has now started to give banks more specific details on why they fail or where they need to improve, even if they sail through the tests. To offer clarity to the public, the Fed also cited examples of where unnamed banks had stumbled in the past. For instance, one lender failed the qualitative component in a prior year because senior management had told the board of directors and the Fed that a problem related to capital planning had been solved when it had not. Another management team had relied too heavily on experiences during the financial crisis, even though the bank's business and risk profile had changed dramatically since then. Although all the banks passed, some came close to missing a key financial hurdle known as the supplementary leverage ratio in the toughest part of the exam. That metric fell to as low as 3.1 percent at Goldman Sachs, just above the required minimum of 3 percent. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and State Street Corp also reported ratios below 4 percent. The ratio's requirements are not fully phased in, but the minimum is slated to move even higher over time. Wall Street has slammed the capital rule as overly burdensome, and it is being watched closely for change as part of the broader deregulation push in Washington.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-stress-idUSL1N1JP1YR"},

The so-called Goodwin Fire, roaring through dense, sun-baked chaparral, has destroyed a number of homes in an area close to where flames erupted on Saturday in the Prescott National Forest, about 70 miles north of Phoenix. But the full extent of property losses has yet to be determined because of continued fierce fire activity in the vicinity, said Tiffany Davila, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire.  We know there's losses back in there, but we don't know how bad it is,  she told Reuters. As of Wednesday, the wind-whipped blaze had charred 21,000 acres, while firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around just 1 percent of the perimeter.  A force of about 1,000 fire personnel, backed by airplane tankers dumping payloads of flame-retardant chemicals, focused on trying to safeguard the most heavily populated areas lying in harm's way on the northeastern fringe of the blaze, Davila said. Yavapai County spokesman David McAtee said an estimated 3,000 homes and other buildings were under threat, with evacuations expanded to cover the entire town of Mayer, parts of Dewey-Humboldt and at least 10 other communities or subdivisions. Mayer alone is home to about 1,400 residents, and Davila said as many as 3,000 people in all were believed to be under evacuation orders or advisories warning them to be prepared to flee at a moment's notice. Governor Doug Ducey issued state of emergency for Yavapai County, freeing up extra funds to help fight the blaze there. Davila said Goodwin was the most severe of 35 wildfires burning across Arizona on Wednesday, from smaller, isolated blazes to a 60-square-mile conflagration in the southeastern corner of the state reported to be 43 percent contained. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, reported nearly 30  active large  fires in Arizona and eight other Western states on Wednesday that have engulfed nearly 180,000 acres. Heavy rainfall in parts of the West over the winter and spring helped delay the onset of wildfires, but spurred the growth of dense vegetation that has now dried out and was fueling fire activity as summertime heat sets in.   In the neighboring state of Utah, another fierce wildfire that has destroyed more than a dozen homes and forced the evacuation of 1,500 residents raged for a 12th day on Wednesday about 300 miles (483 km) south of Salt Lake City. That fire has scorched more than 54,000 acres (21,853 hectares), an increase of about 4,000 acres since Tuesday.  In California, several smaller wildfires were burning on Wednesday, including a new blaze threatening hillside homes in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, and the so-called Hill Fire along the state's central coast that destroyed the home of  The Big Bang Theory  actor Johnny Galecki and two other structures.

Britain's greenhouse gas emissions are around 42 percent lower than in 1990, which is around half way towards the government's legally binding target to slash them by 80 percent by 2050 from 1990 levels, the Committee on Climate Change report said.  The progress so far has been achieved even though gross domestic product has risen by more than 65 percent since 1990. However, most of the emissions reductions have occurred in the power and waste sectors. Emissions in the transport and building sectors are rising and infrastructure remains vulnerable to severe weather.  The good news is we have got half way. But the way we have achieved this is almost entirely focused on the power sector,  Matthew Bell, chief executive of the committee, told Reuters.  We cannot extrapolate that to 2050. Power sector emissions have been lowered so much ... We won't get the remaining distance we need if other sectors don't start contributing,  he said.  Earlier this week, Britain's new climate change minister, Claire Perry, said the government would publish its Clean Growth Plan - a framework for how Britain will reduce emissions in the 2020s and 2030s - after the parliamentary summer recess. Parliament closes on July 20 and reconvenes on Sept. 5. The plan's release was originally scheduled for late 2016. The delay has been criticized by investors who are looking for policy certainty.  Under current policies, Britain is on track to miss its legally-binding emission reduction targets for the mid-2020s onwards, prompting calls for more action in the heat, buildings, industry, transport and agriculture sectors. The government also needs to present Parliament with detailed measures to address climate risks, such as risks to households and businesses from flooding, so its national adaptation program can be published early next year, the report said.  Britain has experienced significant political upheaval over the past year after a referendum resulted in the move to leave the European Union.  There is concern Brexit negotiations divert a lot of attention and resources but we also need to think about climate change issues,  Bell added.

Canada's second-biggest public pension fund has been an enthusiastic investor in Britain and earlier this year agreed to finance the expansion of London's Heathrow airport in which it is one of the biggest shareholders. Until recently, London was one of the cities the Caisse was most committed to investing in along with New York and Shanghai.  That is still certainly true for Shanghai, true for New York,  Caisse Chief Executive Michael Sabia told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. However, the Caisse has turned more cautious on Britain's capital after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority in a parliamentary election in early June, giving her a weaker hand in negotiating Britain's exit from the EU.      We're pretty cautious right now about making meaningful and significant investments in London real estate,  Sabia said.     The Caisse has not seen any impact yet on valuations of its existing real estate portfolio in London which is primarily in high-end office buildings. However, Sabia said valuations of less desirable properties were being affected.      The question is how far does this go, does it spread? That is why we're being careful until we have a better sense.      Sabia also said Britain's economy, which initially withstood the shock of the Brexit vote, was starting to hurt.      I think you're going to see slowing in the UK as the reality of Brexit begins to affect decision making more, I think we're already seeing some of that.  The Caisse, which manages public pensions for retirees in Quebec, has a duel mandate both to maximize returns for depositors and support economic growth in the Canadian province. A $1.5 billion investment in Bombardier (BA.N), headquartered in Quebec, has been slammed by U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) as an unfair subsidy but Sabia rejected that characterization as  absolute nonsense  on Wednesday. [L8N1JP68N]  Khaki Projects        Caisse is embarking this year on the construction of the world's third-biggest public transit system in its home city of Montreal, a groundbreaking project which will see the pension fund take responsibility for both the funding and construction.      The C$6 billion project, which has also received funding from the Quebec government and Canada's federal government, is seen as a test case by other pension funds which normally prefer to invest in 'brownfield' infrastructure that has already been built rather than take on the construction risk through a 'greenfield' project.     But competition for assets such as roads, bridges and tunnels that have already been built has intensified as investors look for alternatives to low-yielding government bonds and volatile equity markets.     Sabia said he believes the Caisse will have an advantage over rivals from developing the skills in-house to manage the construction of new infrastructure and wants to replicate the model in the United States and Europe if it succeeds.     He also argued that much infrastructure development falls between the two, citing Heathrow Airport, where the infrastructure is being expanded, labeling them 'khaki' projects.      You've got to have the capacity to work across that spectrum, to have a full product offering is something that's going to differentiate yourself in the market.        The Caisse invests money on behalf of workers and retirees in the province of Quebec and Sabia admitted that there would be reputational risk if money was lost on the Montreal transit project.      Doing things differently and some degree of innovation always comes with some risk. If those reputational issues are so big in your mind then you're condemned to live in the status quo for ever.      In an investment world that's changing as much as we think it is changing, staying in the status quo means you're toast.

And he was one of the lucky ones.  For weeks later, Solomon was back on two feet with the aid of an artificial leg, fitted at a hectic hospital cum limb-making factory in the South Sudanese capital of Juba. The hospital is in horribly high demand in a country born of war that remains littered with mines and explosive devices, with civil war still raging all around.  Most of South Sudan’s approximately 60,000 amputees have suffered war-related injuries, be it gunshot or landmine wounds. As civil war devastates the world’s youngest country - it celebrates its sixth anniversary next month - it has become increasingly difficult for amputees to gain good treatment.  Second Chance Solomon came to his first artificial limb after an open fracture turned into a life-threatening infection, which forced doctors to amputate.  When he woke from surgery in a remote hospital in South Sudan’s Bentiu, he was far away from the capital with little chance of rehabilitation or help adjusting to his new life.  ”I was put on a flight to Juba, where I am receiving a new, artificial leg,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from his current home at the Physical Rehabilitation Reference Centre. It is the country’s biggest hospital for prosthetic orthotic treatment, treating about 30 patients a day. “Amputations have gone up since the beginning of the civil war in 2013, but even with increased need, access to some areas is impossible due to active fighting and many people who have lost limbs might never be able to get out and receive help,” said Emmanuel Lobari, who as head of technicians oversees the production of all the prosthetic limbs. Both hospital and factory, the center produces an average of 50 prostheses each month – all hand-made and custom fit. Durable, Affordable “We use polypropylene to make the limbs, a material that has proved to be both durable and affordable,” said physiotherapist Daniel Odhiambo.  A Kenyan, he is one of a handful of expatriate staff at the hospital, employed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  “The prostheses last for an average of two years and it’s usually the foot, made out of a softer material, that wears out the fastest. The leg itself can last up to ten years.”  Physical therapist Daniel Odhiambo takes time to explain to Solomon how he will learn to use his new prosthetic limb at the Physical Rehabilitation and Reference Center in Juba, South Sudan, June 28, 2017. Thomson Reuters/Stefanie Glinski\nMaking a limb – from melting the plastic-like polypropylene to shaping it into a leg – is a quick process in the hospital’s small, modern factory and can all be done within a day.  “It’s the fitting and the patient’s adaption that take up to ten days,” said Lobari.  Lobari is South Sudanese, like most of the hospital’s 30 staff, all of whom received Red Cross training. The organization first started treating amputations in 1979 during Ethiopia’s civil war, and developed the polypropylene technology that has since spread across all conflict zones.  Odhiambo has worked in many places, including Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq. He recently took up his second mission in Juba. “Here in South Sudan, I mainly see war wounds and they are very different from civilian wounds,” he explained.  Slideshow (6 Images)Nearly 250,000 mines and explosive devices were found and destroyed in South Sudan in 2017 alone, according to the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS). South Sudan slipped into civil war in 2013, just two years after becoming independent from Khartoum, and some 4 million people – one third of the population – have fled to neighboring countries in its wake. For those left behind, risk is part of daily life. The worst case Odhiambo has seen is an 18-year-old boy, who was brought to the clinic with both legs blown off by a landmine, pieces of muscle hanging out of the wound and shrapnel fragments stuck deep in his flesh. “He was in consistent pain and it took months to build the right prosthesis, but I stayed with him through the whole process. I told him not to give up. He had his whole life ahead of him still.”  A Resilient Nation Simon has been coming to the hospital for several months and can still vividly recall the day he was attacked, when several bullets were shot through his leg.  “I thought I was going to die, but my family took me to a small hospital where my leg was amputated,” he said.  Simon is from the north of the country then moved to Juba to get better care. Three in four patients at the center are male. The women and children at the hospital underwent amputations after suffering a range of traumas, such as war injuries, crocodile bites, road accidents or infections. It helps patients such as Solomon - just starting a new life with his first prosthesis - to meet older patients like Simon. “The boy is still young, but he can see that he’s not alone with his injury,” said Odhiambo. “The one difference I’ve noted working in South Sudan is that people here accept their fate easier than any others. They are resilient and want to go on with their lives. I even see it in Solomon,” said Odhiambo. “People have suffered, but they don’t lose their drive and motivation.” Reporting by Stefanie Glinski.

Lance Fritz, chief executive of Union Pacific Corp, said trans-Pacific volumes overall remain one of the company's softer areas because of overcapacity issues, but back-to-school related shipments were showing signs of rebounding.  Our consumption of goods in the United States and in the world took a little bit of a pause, and that's how they got into an overcapacity situation,  Fritz told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  It's exhibiting normal seasonality this year, which is good.  That could augur well for the key back-to-school shopping season as it shows stores have the confidence to build stock. Back-to-school is the second-most important selling season for U.S. retailers after the end-of-year holidays.  Thomson Reuters' Same Store Sales Index, which tracks sales from stores open at least one year, indicates a 1 percent growth rate for the third quarter of 2017, which covers the back-to-school season through August and September. That would match 2016's back-to-school performance and mark the strongest showing so far this year, according to Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. Same-store sales fell by 0.1 percent during the first quarter, and are on pace for a 0.6 percent gain in the second quarter.     About 40 percent of Union Pacific's overall volumes stems from international trade, Fritz said. About 12 percent of that relates to Mexico and most of the rest is associated with trans-Pacific traffic. Inbound shipping container traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the two largest West Coast ports and key hubs for Union Pacific's international intermodal business, also point to recovering volumes.  After slumping in February, traffic has built for three consecutive months. May volumes at Los Angeles were the highest since January and at Long Beach were the highest since August 2015.  Fritz also said the company's energy-related volumes were also seeing strength, particularly demand for shipping of hydraulic fracturing supplies and coal.

Vonn said she had long wanted to test herself against her male counterparts. “I feel like having trained with the men a significant amount over the last few years and being competitive with them almost every single day, I feel like I need that opportunity as an athlete to be able to be able to see what my true potential is,” she said. Vonn’s comments come in the wake of tennis great John McEnroe’s recent remark that 23-times grand slam singles winner Serena Williams would be ranked about 700th if she played on the men’s tennis circuit. Vonn, 32, the 2010 Olympic women’s downhill champion, has won a record 77 World Cup races during her career. The American skier said it was proving difficult to organize an official race against men, which meant an exhibition might be the vehicle to test herself. “My coaches had meetings with the International Ski Federation this spring and they said it would be very difficult to accomplish,  Vonn said.  But if we get blocked out in doing an official race, maybe there’s potential to have some sort of exhibition,” she added, invoking tennis great Billy Jean King’s famous ‘Battle of the Sexes’ clash with Bobby Riggs back in 1973. Vonn said it was difficult to know exactly how she would fare against the world’s best men's skiers. “In women’s skiing and women’s tennis, we lack a certain physicality of (what) men do. Physical strength is not necessarily the same. “Men definitely have that advantage but we have the advantage of grace and a certain amount of finesse that the men don’t always have, more tactics and a different approach. And sometimes in the long run that can end up being faster or better than what the men do.” Vonn was also asked if she had spoken with her former boyfriend Tiger Woods since his arrest for driving while impaired in Florida in May. “Not going to comment,” she said.

Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday postponed the vote on the bill, which they hoped would take place before their July 4 recess. According to credit rating agencies Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, the legislation would negatively impact states because of changes to the core funding of Medicaid and the phasing out of the Medicaid expansion plan. The Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, issued a report on Wednesday estimating state Medicaid spending would increase by $565 million in 2022 under the proposed legislation. It also estimated federal funding for Medicaid, which funds medical care for the poor and indigent, would be $102.2 billion lower in that year. The National Governor's Association, which on Monday advocated for more time to review the financial impact of the bill, welcomed the delay. Members of the Senate Republicans' own party resisted the measure, which the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade and reduce federal outlays for Medicaid by $772 billion over that time. Moody's senior analyst Genevieve Nolan told Reuters the legislation in its current form would be a credit negative for states, mainly because of reduced federal funding for Medicaid.  Obviously this bill is ACA (Affordable Care Act) repeal and replace, but even more than that, it’s Medicaid repeal and replace. Medicaid is a more than 50-year-old program, a partnership between states and the federal government, and both the Senate bill and the House bill propose really fundamental restructuring of how that program is funded,  Eric Kim, Fitch's director of U.S. Public finance, told Reuters. State Impacts A mix of Republican and Democratic governors criticized or strongly opposed the bill, including Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management said in a report on Tuesday the bill could cost the state about $2.9 billion per year by 2026. The report also said the cap to federal payments would  force  states, including Connecticut, to assume costs, limit benefits, decrease the number of people served or reduce rates to providers. In Virginia, the bill would cost the state's Medicaid program at least $1.4 billion over seven years, according to Governor Terry McAuliffe's office. It would  blow a hole in Virginia's budget,  McAuliffe said in a statement.

Wearing a tag round his neck that read  Please look after this bear , Paddington was named after the London railway station of the same name where he was found after a boat journey from  darkest Peru , according to Bond's 1958 story  A Bear called Paddington . Bond said the inspiration for the character came when he spotted a teddy bear in his flat, and wondered what would happen if a real bear arrived at Paddington Station like a World War Two refugee with a label around his neck.  Glancing round in search of inspiration my gaze came to rest on Paddington, who gave me a hard stare from the mantelpiece, and the muse struck,  Bond wrote in the Radio Times magazine in 2014.  I knew exactly how my own parents would react if they saw it, particularly if it had a label round its neck, like a refugee in the last war. There are few things sadder in life than a refugee,  Bond said.  Paddington was taken in by the Brown family and his adventures and mishaps were detailed in more than 20 books, the last of which,  Paddington's Finest Hour , was published in April. The stories invariably saw Paddington, fueled by marmalade sandwiches, caught up in accidental but well-intentioned scrapes, while examples of rudeness were met with one of his  hard stares .  Please Look After This Bear  FILE PHOTO: Michael Bond, who created Paddington Bear, holds his Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) after it was presented to him by Prince William at an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in central London, October 27, 2015.John Stillwell/PoolAnn-Janine Murtagh, executive publisher of children's books at HarperCollins, which sold more than 35 million Paddington books, said Bond was a true gentleman and the most enchanting of writers.  Actor Hugh Bonneville, who played Mr Brown in the 2014 film  Paddington , said it seemed particularly poignant to learn about Bond's death on the last day of filming of a sequel. The new film is due out later this year. Slideshow (12 Images) He leaves a special legacy: long live the bear from darkest Peru,  he said.  Bond, who was born in Newbury, a town west of London, in 1926, wrote another series of children's books about a guinea pig called Olga da Polga and adult detective stores featuring Monsieur Pamplemousse.    He started writing while serving in the British army in Egypt and once said that he could have papered his walls with rejection slips. Paddington, though, was written for his own pleasure.  I didn't intend to write a book at all which was a plus as it happened I think as I didn’t write for any particular age group – I wrote it to please myself,  Bond told the BBC.  In 10 days I had what turned out to be a book on my hands.   Paddington is very real to me.

The United States wants to send 3,000-5,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and other NATO members might send around 1,200. But no decisions have been made. NATO leads some 13,450 multinational troops in Afghanistan, who are training the country's armed forces. About 8,400 are U.S. personnel, some 6,900 of whom come under the NATO command structure. Fifteen members and partners of the military alliance, including Britain and Australia, have said they will contribute more troops and equipment to the training mission for 2018, following a closed-door meeting of military planners this month.  This is nothing like a surge, this is well within the bounds of what is feasible politically,  a senior NATO diplomat said, citing a willingness to meet U.S. President Donald Trump's demands that the alliance do more to fight Islamist militants. A decision by NATO allies to send more troops would reflect alarm about territorial gains by Taliban rebels and military and civilian casualties. However, diplomats said everything hung on the Afghan strategy being devised by Mattis, who will address NATO defence ministers on Thursday, partly because many allies depend on U.S. equipment to be able to carry out their training.  We need clarity from the United States,  a second NATO diplomat said. Some diplomats expressed frustration that the process had dragged out months, saying they had been repeatedly promised the new U.S. strategy, firstly by the NATO leaders' meeting in May in Brussels and then by Thursday's defence ministers' meeting.  The confusion in Washington has had an impact,  a third diplomat said.  How We End This War  The concern about delay extends beyond Brussels. In Washington, Republican Senator John McCain recently scolded Mattis during a televised Senate hearing.  It makes it hard for us to support you when we don't have a strategy,  McCain said. U.S. and allied forces have been fighting for nearly 16 years against Taliban Islamists who harboured al Qaeda militants behind the attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001. For Mattis, the NATO trip will bring him one step closer to an expected mid-July finish line for his long-awaited Afghan war plan, which he hopes will break a stalemate in America's longest war and eventually bring it to a successful conclusion. Speaking to reporters during his flight to Europe, he said he would brief allies about the U.S. assessment of the situation in Afghanistan and his efforts to fill in  any gaps left in the strategy . He declined to say how many troops he expected from NATO allies. Mattis said he aimed to return to Washington to  finish out some things  in consultation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine General Joseph Dunford, who just returned from Afghanistan, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  And then we'll present to the president a strategy that's been informed by our allies, to include Afghanistan of course, and given a framework that is regional in nature and focuses on: how we end this war,  he said.

Britain's greenhouse gas emissions are around 42 percent lower than in 1990, which is around half way towards the government's legally binding target to slash them by 80 percent by 2050 from 1990 levels, the Committee on Climate Change report said.  The progress so far has been achieved even though gross domestic product has risen by more than 65 percent since 1990. However, most of the emissions reductions have occurred in the power and waste sectors. Emissions in the transport and building sectors are rising and infrastructure remains vulnerable to severe weather.  The good news is we have got half way. But the way we have achieved this is almost entirely focused on the power sector,  Matthew Bell, chief executive of the committee, told Reuters.  We cannot extrapolate that to 2050. Power sector emissions have been lowered so much ... We won't get the remaining distance we need if other sectors don't start contributing,  he said.  Earlier this week, Britain's new climate change minister, Claire Perry, said the government would publish its Clean Growth Plan - a framework for how Britain will reduce emissions in the 2020s and 2030s - after the parliamentary summer recess. Parliament closes on July 20 and reconvenes on Sept. 5. The plan's release was originally scheduled for late 2016. The delay has been criticized by investors who are looking for policy certainty.  Under current policies, Britain is on track to miss its legally-binding emission reduction targets for the mid-2020s onwards, prompting calls for more action in the heat, buildings, industry, transport and agriculture sectors. The government also needs to present Parliament with detailed measures to address climate risks, such as risks to households and businesses from flooding, so its national adaptation program can be published early next year, the report said.  Britain has experienced significant political upheaval over the past year after a referendum resulted in the move to leave the European Union.  There is concern Brexit negotiations divert a lot of attention and resources but we also need to think about climate change issues,  Bell added.

On Wednesday, the Fed said those lenders, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, had passed the second, tougher part of its annual stress test. The results showed that many have not only built up adequate capital buffers, but improved risk management procedures as well. One bank, Capital One Financial Corp, must resubmit its scheme by year-end, though the Fed is still allowing it to go forward with its capital plan in the meantime. Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is acting as regulatory lead for the U.S. central bank, said the process  has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and most to substantially improve their capital planning processes.  Altogether, banks that went through the tests will be able to pay out 100 percent of their projected net income over the next four quarters, compared with 65 percent after last year’s results, a senior Fed official said. It would be the first time since the 2008 financial crisis that banks return at least as much money to shareholders as they produce in annual profit. The verdict marks a significant victory for the banking industry, which has worked for years to regain its stature. The green light could also serve as a watershed moment for Wall Street, which is eager to get a lighter regulatory touch from policymakers in Washington.

Capital One must resubmit plans because it did not appropriately account for risks in  one of its most material businesses,  the Fed said. Concerns centered around internal controls and whether senior management and the bank’s board of directors would be informed about problems in a timely and appropriate way, the Fed official said. The Fed did not identify which business was ill-prepared. Capital One's most significant business is credit card lending. It has also built up a presence in auto lending. Both areas have been flagged by bankers and analysts as showing signs of weakness lately. Capital One has until year-end to deliver an improved submission. In the interim, the bank can go ahead with its plan to repurchase up to $1.85 billion worth of stock, but the Fed can still object if the problems are not fixed. Capital One had already reduced its capital request after the first set of stress-test results was released last week. American Express Co had also resubmitted a plan with reduced requests, which was approved. Other big banks, including Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, also cleared the Fed's bar, and most issued press releases detailing big increases in shareholder payouts. In a twist, Bank of America's planned dividend hike could lead Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc to convert a large preferred stake into common stock, which would turn it into the bank's largest shareholder. This year was the first time all banks undergoing stress tests passed, although it was also the first time most were excluded from the  qualitative  component that Capital One failed. Only 13 of the 34 lenders were subject to that part, which bankers have criticized as being too opaque and subjective. In response to those complaints, the Fed has now started to give banks more specific details on why they fail or where they need to improve, even if they sail through the tests.     To offer clarity to the public, the Fed also cited examples of where unnamed banks had stumbled in the past.     For instance, one lender failed the qualitative component in a prior year because senior management had told the board of directors and the Fed that a problem related to capital planning had been solved when it had not.

The ratio's requirements are not fully phased in, but the minimum is slated to move even higher over time.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a short video clip on Twitter showing possible futuristic technology and wrote:  Mossad will continue to be sophisticated, daring and ground-breaking in its paramount task of ensuring Israel's security.  Mossad's undertaking is not new. In 1999, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency established IQT, a non-profit investment fund aimed at accelerating the development and delivery of new technologies to U.S. government intelligence bodies. Libertad's document said  anyone  could apply, suggesting that the offer was open too to foreign companies though it did not give details. It added that an approved program could be made only with an incorporated company. Israel has over 450 cyber-security firms. In 2016, 78 start-ups raised more than $660 million from investors, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Centre.  Its advanced defense industry, led by Elbit, Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries and Rafael, accounts for about 14 percent of the country's exports.

Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said the current NAFTA 62.5 percent local content requirement was working just fine and  strikes the right balance  for encouraging local manufacturing investment and keeping the industry's costs competitive. Blunt, whose group represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) urged a  very cautions and careful  approach for any origin rule changes and discussed the affects of stricter enforcement.   It could make us less competitive as compared to our international peers and affect our ability to export,  Blunt said.   It could deny us access to supply chains which would drive up costs and could affect sales and ultimately employment within the industry.  Ross has said that NAFTA's rules of origin need tightening to avoid producers from outside the region to benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. He also has noted that vehicles now have many new electronic components that were not contemplated when the pact was negotiated in the early 1990s. But Blunt disputed that the origin rules were allowing China to benefit from NAFTA in a major way, arguing that Chinese components make up less than six percent of the value of North American-built vehicles.

The North's official KCNA said  revelation showed  Park had masterminded a plot to execute its  supreme leadership  in 2015 and it was imposing the  death penalty on traitor Park Geun-hye  and her spy chief, Lee Byung-ho. KCNA did not disclose the source of the  revelation,  but a Japanese newspaper reported this week that Park in 2015 approved a plan to overturn the North Korean regime of leader Kim Jong Un. Park was ousted in March over a corruption scandal and is in detention in South Korea while on trial.  South Korea's National Intelligence Agency (NIS) said it was  unpardonable  that North Korea made threats against its citizens and said the news report of a plot to kill Kim Jong Un  had no grounds.  Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported on Monday, citing sources familiar with Park's North Korea policy, that Park had signed off on a plot to remove the North's leader in 2015 and the plan was orchestrated by the South's spy agency.  We declare at home and abroad that we will impose the death penalty on traitor Park Geun-hye and ex-director of the puppet intelligence service ... criminals of hideous state-sponsored terrorism who hatched and pressed for the heinous plot to hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK,  KCNA said. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.  We declare that in case the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces again attempt at hideous state-sponsored terrorism targeting the supreme leadership ... we will impose summary punishment without advance notice,  KCNA said. KCNA said the statement was issued jointly by the North's Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of People's Security and the Central Public Prosecutors Office. North and South Korea are technically in a state of war under a truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War, and the North routinely warns of annihilating the South Korean government. North Korean government agencies often issue harsh rhetoric in state media over perceived insults, or what they see as threats to the security of their leaders. The trend has intensified under Kim Jong Un. In May, North Korea accused the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the South's spy agency of another plot to assassinate its  supreme leadership  with biochemical weapon. At that time, it also demanded the handover of former NIS chief Lee.

Buyout firms largely have refrained from attempting leveraged buyouts of U.S. retailers in the past two years, amid a wave of bankruptcies in the sector that have included Sports Authority, Rue21, Gymboree and BCBG Max Azria LLC. Sycamore's deal for Staples, however, which Reuters was first to report would come this week, illustrates that some buyout firms are distinguishing between mall-based fashion retailers, which are vulnerable to changing consumer tastes, from retailers with a niche and rich cash flow, such as Staples.  The acquisition also shows that Sycamore, whose buyout fund is dedicated to retail deals, is willing to take on the risk of falling store sales at Staples because of the potential it sees in Staples' delivery unit, which supplies businesses directly.  Sycamore said it would pay $10.25 per share in cash for Staples. The shares ended trading at $9.93 on Wednesday after Reuters reported the exact deal price. Staples said the deal was expected to close by December. Shira Goodman will remain as Staples CEO. FILE PHOTO: A Staples office supply store is seen in New York City, U.S., April 4, 2017.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoSycamore will be organizing Staples along three lines: its stronger delivery business, its weaker retail business and its business in Canada, two sources familiar with the deal said. This structure will give Sycamore the option to shed Staples' retail business in the future, one of the sources said. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples, which made its name selling paper, pens and other supplies, has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada. It previously tried to merge with rival retailer Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) but the deal was thwarted by a U.S. federal judge on antitrust grounds last year. A shopping cart is seen outside a Staples office supplies store in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, Illinois, February 4, 2015. No. 1 office supply chain Staples and smaller rival Office Depot Inc said on May 10, 2016, they would terminate their planned merger after a U.S. federal judge ordered the deal temporarily halted because of antitrust concerns.Jim Young/File PhotoStaples has the largest share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent, according to Euromonitor, and generated $889 million of adjusted free cash flow in 2016. Sycamore has a reputation amongst private equity peers for taking bets on retail investments others might eschew. Its previous investments include regional department store operator Belk Inc, discount general merchandise retailer Dollar Express and mall and web-based specialty retailer Hot Topic. Barclays and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are acting as financial advisors and Wilmer Hale LLP is acting as legal advisor to Staples. BofA Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc are acting as financial advisors and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is acting as legal advisor to Sycamore Partners.

Terms of the settlement, which also covered the Beef Products Inc (BPI) claims against ABC reporter Jim Avila, were not disclosed. Privately-held BPI had claimed that the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Avila defamed the company by calling its processed beef product “pink slime” and making errors and omissions in a series of 2012 reports. BPI calls the product  lean finely textured beef.  BPI attorney Dan Webb told Reuters the settlement came together  quickly this week,  but declined to provide details, citing a confidentiality agreement signed by both parties. The settlement came 3-1/2 weeks after the trial in the case got under way in Elk Point, South Dakota, around 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Sioux City, Iowa. BPI is based in nearby Dakota Dunes, South Dakota. ABC said in a statement that it stood by its reporting. Avila said after the case was settled that the company was not retracting his stories or apologizing, and his 2012  pink slime  reports remained on the ABC News website. BPI's signature product, commonly mixed into ground beef, is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill E. coli and other contaminants. A former microbiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture is credited with having coined the term  pink slime.   While this has not been an easy road to travel, it was necessary to begin rectifying the harm we suffered as a result of what we believed to be biased and baseless reporting in 2012,  BPI said in a statement.  Through this process, we have again established what we all know to be true about Lean Finely Textured Beef: it is beef, and is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.  ABC maintains its reports were correct and has said its reporting deserved protection under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press.  Throughout this case, we have maintained that our reports accurately presented the facts and views of knowledgeable people about this product,  ABC said in a statement, saying that it agreed to the settlement because  continued litigation of this case is not in the company's interests.  Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for ABC and Avila, did not immediately respond to request for comment.  We're not retracting anything. We're not apologizing for anything,  Avila told reporters outside of the Union County Courthouse where the trial was being held, in a report posted on the website of the local NBC affiliate. The trial had been expected to last eight weeks. BPI had claimed up to $1.9 billion in damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. During its reports, ABC used the term  pink slime  more than 350 times across six different media platforms including TV and online, Webb said during opening statements on June 5. In the aftermath of ABC's broadcasts, BPI closed three of its four processing plants and said its revenue dropped 80 percent to $130 million. The company had around 1,300 employees before the reports. Some 700 were let go shortly after, Erik Connolly, a BPI attorney, told Reuters on Wednesday.  If inaccurate information is being put out there by a news organization, particularly one with a powerful reach, it can cause tremendous damage,  he said.  There are real consequences to that for real people.  Attorneys for ABC countered in opening arguments that the term was commonly used before ABC's reports and said that BPI's business was already suffering. Sonja West, a professor of First Amendment law at the University of Georgia School of Law, said the case did not set a precedent because it ended in a settlement. However, it could have a chilling effect on coverage of sensitive stories.  If that happens, it's the public who suffers by missing out on valuable information about important matters.

Risk-modeling firm Cyence said economic losses from this week's attack and one last month from a virus dubbed WannaCry would likely total $8 billion. That estimate highlights the steep tolls businesses around the globe face from growth in cyber attacks that knock critical computer networks offline.  When systems are down and can't generate revenue, that really gets the attention of executives and board members,  said George Kurtz, chief executive of security software maker CrowdStrike.  This has heightened awareness of the need for resiliency and better security in networks.  The virus, which researchers are calling GoldenEye or Petya, began its spread on Tuesday in Ukraine. It infected machines of visitors to a local news site and computers downloading tainted updates of a popular tax accounting package, according to national police and cyber experts. It shut down a cargo booking system at Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, causing congestion at some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary.. Maersk said late on Wednesday that the system was back online:  Booking confirmation will take a little longer than usual but we are delighted to carry your cargo,  it said via Twitter. U.S. delivery firm FedEx said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco. The malicious code encrypted data on machines and demanded victims $300 ransoms for recovery, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. Security experts said they believed that the goal was to disrupt computer systems across Ukraine, not extortion, saying the attack used powerful wiping software that made it impossible to recover lost data.  It was a wiper disguised as ransomware. They had no intention of obtaining money from the attack,  said Tom Kellermann, chief executive of Strategic Cyber Ventures. Brian Lord, a former official with Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) who is now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber, said he believed the campaign was an  experiment  in using ransomware to cause destruction.  This starts to look like a state operating through a proxy,  he said. Eternal Blue The malware appeared to leverage code known as  Eternal Blue  believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency. Eternal Blue was part of a trove of hacking tools stolen from the NSA and leaked online in April by a group that calls itself Shadow Brokers, which security researchers believe is linked to the Russian government. That attack was noted by NSA critics, who say the agency puts the public at risk by keeping information about software vulnerabilities secret so that it can use them in cyber operations. U.S. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat, on Wednesday called for the NSA to immediately disclose any information it may have about Eternal Blue that would help stop attacks. “If the NSA has a kill switch for this new malware attack, the NSA should deploy it now,” Lieu wrote in a letter to NSA Director Mike Rogers. The NSA did not respond to a request for comment and has not publicly acknowledged that it developed the hacking tools leaked by Shadow Brokers. The target of the campaign appeared to be Ukraine, an enemy of Russia that has suffered two cyber attacks on its power grid that it has blamed on Moscow. ESET, a Slovakian cyber-security software firm, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, followed by Italy with about 10 percent. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Moscow of orchestrating cyber attacks on its computer networks and infrastructure since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the attack, which also struck Russian companies including oil giant Rosneft and a steelmaker.  Unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,  said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said  a small number  of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Microsoft, Cisco Systems Inc and Symantec Corp said they believed the first infections occurred in Ukraine when malware was transmitted to users of a tax software program. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a news site for the Ukraine city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware. A number of the victims were international firms with have operations in Ukraine. They include French construction materials company Saint Gobain, BNP Paribas Real Estate, and Mondelez International Inc, which owns Cadbury chocolate. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down.

Senator Renan Calheiros announced his resignation as party leader saying that, unlike most of his party members, he could not give his backing to proposals that hurt Brazilian workers, especially if they came from a president lacking credibility in the middle of a corruption scandal. Temer, whose government has an approval rating in the single digits, has resisted repeated calls to resign after executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA, accused him of discussing bribe payments. While Calheiros gave his speech, the Senate's committee on constitutional affairs prepared to vote on Temer's proposal to revamp the labor code, in what was expected to be a close decision.   I don't hate Temer,  Calheiros said.  What I don't tolerate is his cowardice as the labor code is dismantled.  Calheiros was partly responsible for a surprising setback for the bill earlier this month at the Senate's social affairs committee. Investors feared Temer had lost support for an economic measure regarded as fundamental for Brazil as it tries to shake off its worst recession ever. Despite the possibility of another setback at the constitutional committee, approval of the labor overhaul seemed likely on the Senate floor soon, analysts with Eurasia Group wrote in a note earlier on Wednesday. The labor reform bill has already been approved by the lower house, but faces fierce opposition from labor unions that will lose power over workplaces. The bill allows more temporary work contracts and outsourcing, eliminating mandatory union dues. Temer was charged Monday night by Brazil's top prosecutor with taking multimillion-dollar bribes. He must retain support of at least one third of the House of Deputies to stop a formal trial by the Supreme Court, during which he would be suspended from office.

Under Brazilian law, it is now up to the House of Deputies to decide whether to allow the Supreme Court to try Temer, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year. Two-thirds of the lower house must vote against Temer for his trial to occur.

Children in Mali who benefited from these three measures from their teachers were 95 percent less likely to be infected with malaria parasites and 44 percent less at risk of being anemic than those who only received bed nets, according to the study. The pupils' ability to pay attention for longer also improved, found the research, conducted by Save the Children, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and the National Institute for Public Health Research in Mali.   While malaria kills thousands of young African children each year, many others harbor the parasites that cause the disease without displaying symptoms. These infections frequently go unrecognized and untreated, leading to anemia, which can cause tiredness and affect children's cognitive and physical development.  This low-cost three-pronged approach delivered through schools had significant health benefits and could potentially improve educational performance,  Sian Clarke, lead researcher of the study and LSTHM senior lecturer, said in a statement. The study showed these benefits lasted until the beginning of the next malaria transmission season, suggesting a single annual dose of antimalarial drugs could help protect children from anemia during the entire school year, she added. By reducing the number of malaria parasites in pupils, this approach could also help to cut infections in their communities, according to the researchers, who said malaria control strategies should be a formal part of education health plans. Preventing anemia in schoolgirls is particularly important in countries such as Mali because teenage marriage and pregnancy is so common, said Natalie Roschnik, senior nutrition advisor at Save the Children and study co-author.  A girl who is anemic when pregnant is more likely to have a low birth weight child with developmental delays and is at greater risk of dying too,  Roschnik said as the study was published in the London-based medical journal BMJ Global Health. The world has made huge strides against malaria since 2000, with death rates plunging by 60 percent and at least six million lives saved globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But efforts to end one of the world's deadliest diseases - which kills about 430,000 people a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa - are under threat as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to measures such as bed nets and drugs.

Northern Ireland politics has been in crisis since the collapse in January of the compulsory coalition between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists mandated under a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence. The Irish and British governments - guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement - sought to facilitate a compromise, warning that a failure to do so would have  profound and serious  implications and limit the province's influence in Brexit talks.  Talks continuing - efforts intensified to find agreement on outstanding issues before tomorrow's deadline. Expect very late night,  Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted from the talks at Stormont, the seat of the Northern Irish Assembly. Northern Ireland risks reverting to direct rule from London for the first time in a decade if power-sharing is not restored, a step backwards in the delicate balance between mainly Catholic Irish nationalists seeking union with Ireland and predominantly Protestant unionists who want to remain in the United Kingdom. If Thursday's deadline of 1500 GMT is missed, it would be the fourth such deadline set by the British government to pass without agreement since a snap regional election in March. A further extension would be highly likely. The talks are mainly stuck on a disagreement between the two largest parties, Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), over Sinn Fein's demand to give the Irish language legal status in the province. The two rival parties shared power for a decade until Sinn Fein pulled out of government in January.  Negotiations also stalled until early this week while the DUP agreed a pact to prop up British Prime Minister Theresa May in her Westminster parliament, securing over 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funds for the province in the process. Some analysts said the deal between May and the DUP could ultimately motivate Sinn Fein to return to devolved government but that they may take time to see how it works out first.

In a statement, Boulogne Billancourt-based Carrefour (CARR.PA) suggested a price tag of 15 to 19 reais per common share of Grupo Carrefour Brasil SA. The IPO will take place in São Paulo Stock Exchange's strictest governance listing chapter. At the top of the range, Carrefour Brasil would be worth 37.6 billion reais, twice the market value of GPA SA, controlled by archrival Casino Guichard Perrachon & Cie (CASP.PA). Reuters reported in January that Carrefour aimed to price the unit's IPO at a minimum 25 percent premium to GPA. The IPO should help Carrefour Brasil add financial muscle to take on GPA, whose food division has recovered amid sliding sales of appliances. Carrefour Brasil recently trumped GPA as Brazil's No. 1 diversified retailer. The transaction, slated to price July 18, seals the first phase of an association between Carrefour and Brazilian retail tycoon Abilio Diniz that started in 2014 and involved revamping the unit's business model. Trading in Carrefour Brasil's shares is slated to start on July 20 under the symbol CRFB3. Under terms of the offering, parent company Carrefour and Diniz's Península Participações SA will offer about 91 million existing common shares of Carrefour Brasil in a secondary offering, with proceeds going to shareholders. Diniz could trigger a supplementary allotment of 59 million shares. Carrefour Brasil plans to sell 205.882 million new shares in a primary offering whose proceeds will go to the company's coffers. Diniz Family Diniz, whose family founded GPA, is Carrefour's third largest shareholder and has a board seat. Diniz and his family bought a 10 percent stake in Carrefour's Brazilian unit through Peninsula in December 2015. Carrefour hired the investment-banking unit of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) to underwrite the offering alongside JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Other advisors include BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA), Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA) and Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA).  The Carrefour Brasil IPO would be Brazil's biggest since the 11.475 billion-reais debut of state-controlled insurer BB Seguridade Participações SA(BBSE3.SA) in April 2013. This year, three IPOs have been priced, the most in four years. Brazil's busiest pipeline of bond and equity offerings in at least six years comes as investors have grown more confident that the country can emerge from its steepest recession ever.

Connecticut will likely start a new fiscal year on Saturday without a budget as it faces high fixed costs, flagging income tax revenues and grim economic prospects. Lawmakers and Governor Dannel Malloy disagree over how to close a $5.1 billion deficit over the next two years, including whether to cram some pension costs down onto municipalities. The state, with median income levels among the highest of all states yet one of the lowest ratings, was downgraded by all three of the big Wall Street credit rating agencies in May. For municipal bond investors, it could be a minefield. Connecticut's credit spreads have widened to 92 basis points over top-rated muni bonds, Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data shows, especially after lawmakers ended their regular legislative session June 7 without a two-year budget for fiscal 2018 and 2019. Connecticut muni bond funds have not performed well. Of 21 different share classes run by six different fund managers, 17 have underperformed other state debt fund averages over the past year, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.  Spread widening as a result of the credit deterioration makes long-term debt that much more expensive, and you lock it in forever,  said Tom Metzold, senior managing director at muni bond pricing vendor Best Credit Data. Wednesday's deal is the last for Connecticut's fiscal year. The new money variable-rate tax-exempt 7-year general obligation bonds priced at 90 basis points over the benchmark variable rate set by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The interest rate resets weekly and Moody's Investors Service rates the bonds A1. Proceeds will fund capital improvements to state universities and colleges, grants to towns, housing programs, and technology upgrades, according to Sarah Sanders, assistant treasurer for debt management. It also sold $135 million of refunding bonds to JP Morgan Chase & Co at 70 percent of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 70 basis points. That deal matures in 7 years, she said. Both series have some call features. The state requested proposals for the deal from its general obligation senior managing firms, and selected the direct placement option with Barclays because it was easier to accomplish and cost competitive, Sanders said.

The felony charge was filed on June 15. If convicted, Pickett faces up to five years in prison.   Pickett's attorney, Thomas Gabel, could not immediately be  reached for comment.     U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Williams ordered Pickett held in custody until his jury trial at the end of August. That location was not disclosed.

Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since June 29, 2007, but the first iPhone, which launched without an App Store and was restricted to the AT&T; Inc network (T.N), was limited compared to today's version. After sluggish initial sales, Apple slashed the price to spur holiday sales that year.   The business model for year one of the iPhone was a disaster,  Tony Fadell, one of the Apple developers of the device, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  We pivoted and figured it out in year two.   The very concept of the iPhone came as a surprise to some of Apple's suppliers a decade ago, even though Apple, led by CEO Steve Jobs, had already expanded beyond computers with the iPod.  We still have the voicemail from Steve Jobs when he called the CEO and founder here,  said David Bairstow at Skyhook, the company that supplied location technology to early iPhones.  He thought he was being pranked by someone in the office and it took him two days to call Steve Jobs back.  The iPhone hit its stride in 2008 when Apple introduced the App Store, which allowed developers to make and distribute their mobile applications with Apple taking a cut of any revenue.  FILE PHOTO - A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016.Adnan Abidi/File photoTen years later, services revenue is a crucial area of growth for Apple, bringing in $24.3 billion in revenue last year. New Model Fans and investors are now looking forward to the 10th anniversary iPhone 8, expected this fall, asking whether it will deliver enough new features to spark a new generation to turn to Apple. Slideshow (4 Images)That new phone may have 3-D mapping sensors, support for  augmented reality  apps that would merge virtual and real worlds, and a new display with organic LEDs, which are light and flexible, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. A decade after launching into a market largely occupied by BlackBerry and Microsoft devices, the iPhone now competes chiefly with phones running Google's Android software, which is distributed to Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and other manufacturers around the world. Even though most of the world's smartphones now run on Android, Apple still garners most of the profit in the industry with its generally higher-priced devices.  More than 2 billion people now have smartphones, according to data from eMarketer, and Fadell, who has worked for both Apple and Alphabet, sees that as the hallmark of success.  Being able to democratize computing and communication across the entire world is absolutely astounding to me,  Fadell said.  It warms my heart because that's something Steve tried to do with the Apple II and the Mac, which was the computer for the rest of us. It's finally here, 30 years later.

The 2015 traffic stop by former trooper Brian Encinia that resulted in the hanging death three days later of Sandra Bland, 28, was one in a series of incidents that raised questions of racial bias in U.S. policing. Encinia was charged by a grand jury in January 2016 with making a false statement on his arrest report for Bland. The charge carried a penalty of up to one year in jail. The prosecution's motion to dismiss, filed in state court in Waller County, said that Encinia agreed to surrender his law enforcement license and  will not pursue or engage in employment, in any capacity, with law enforcement.  Encinia's attorney Chip Lewis said a judge agreed to the motion.  Brian and his family appreciate the thoughtful review by the prosecutors. Dismissal was the right thing to do,  Lewis said in a statement. Last year, Bland's family reached a $1.9 million settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit they filed against law enforcement. Family lawyer Cannon Lambert said on Wednesday he was disappointed that prosecutors decided not to see the case through.  When you have evidence that an officer lies about what happened out in the field in a police report, and it is caught on tape that he is lying, you have to prosecute to ensure the community they are going to get a fair shake,  he said in a telephone interview. Bland was found dead in her cell with a trash bag around her neck. Authorities said she committed suicide. Critics said race was a factor in her being pulled over by Encinia for failing to signal a lane change in Waller County, about 50 miles northwest of Houston, and for her arrest on a charge of assaulting an officer. They said the trooper increased tensions on the scene. The Texas Department of Public Safety faulted Encinia for his conduct during the stop and later fired him. A dashcam video showed him shouting at Bland and failing to answer her when she asked repeatedly why she was being arrested.

Terms of the settlement, which also covered the Beef Products Inc (BPI) claims against ABC reporter Jim Avila, were not disclosed. Privately-held BPI had claimed that the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Avila defamed the company by calling its processed beef product “pink slime” and making errors and omissions in a series of 2012 reports. BPI calls the product  lean finely textured beef.   BPI attorney Dan Webb told Reuters the settlement came together  quickly this week,  but declined to provide details, citing a confidentiality agreement signed by both parties. The settlement came 3-1/2 weeks after the trial in the case got under way in Elk Point, South Dakota, around 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Sioux City, Iowa. BPI is based in nearby Dakota Dunes, South Dakota.  ABC said in a statement that it stood by its reporting. Avila said after the case was settled that the company was not retracting his stories or apologizing, and his 2012  pink slime  reports remained on the ABC News website.     BPI's signature product, commonly mixed into ground beef, is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill E. coli and other contaminants. A former microbiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture is credited with having coined the term  pink slime.   While this has not been an easy road to travel, it was necessary to begin rectifying the harm we suffered as a result of what we believed to be biased and baseless reporting in 2012,  BPI said in a statement.   Through this process, we have again established what we all know to be true about Lean Finely Textured Beef: it is beef, and is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.   ABC maintains its reports were correct and has said its reporting deserved protection under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press.  Throughout this case, we have maintained that our reports accurately presented the facts and views of knowledgeable people about this product,  ABC said in a statement, saying that it agreed to the settlement because  continued litigation of this case is not in the company's interests.  Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for ABC and Avila, did not immediately respond to request for comment.   We're not retracting anything. We're not apologizing for anything,  Avila told reporters outside of the Union County Courthouse where the trial was being held, in a report posted on the website of the local NBC affiliate.    The trial had been expected to last eight weeks. BPI had claimed up to $1.9 billion in damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act.  During its reports, ABC used the term  pink slime  more than 350 times across six different media platforms including TV and online, Webb said during opening statements on June 5.  In the aftermath of ABC's broadcasts, BPI closed three of its four processing plants and said its revenue dropped 80 percent to $130 million. The company had around 1,300 employees before the reports. Some 700 were let go shortly after, Erik Connolly, a BPI attorney, told Reuters on Wednesday.   If inaccurate information is being put out there by a news organization, particularly one with a powerful reach, it can cause tremendous damage,  he said.  There are real consequences to that for real people.

Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, on Wednesday said it plans to repurchase up to $15.6 billion of common stock over the next year and double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share, bringing total payouts to $18.9 billion. The total payout is 54 percent more than the Fed allowed  last year and about 1.25 times the profits that analysts expect Citigroup to earn over the next four quarters. Analysts had expected Citigroup would win the right to increase payouts to roughly 1.12 percent of annual profits. Citigroup announced the details after the U.S. Federal Reserve said the 34 biggest U.S. banks had passed the second component of its annual stress test, and would therefore be able to put capital to work in ways other than fortifying their balance sheets. [L1N1JP1U9] This year's test was an especially crucial rite of passage for Citi, whose shareholders have been keen to see management buy back shares that had been underperforming rivals. Citigroup shares were up 2.3 percent in after-hours trading at $66.68, compared with a stated net worth of $65.94 per share as of March 31.  For some time, we have retained a significant amount of capital in excess of what is needed to prudently operate and invest in the firm,  Corbat said in a statement. Now, he said, the bank can begin  returning a higher level of that capital to our shareholders and improving Citi’s overall returns.   This is another stepping stone in the recovery of Citigroup  from losses in the financial crisis, said Peter Nerby, a senior bank analyst at Moody's Investors Service. Citigroup took three bailout infusions from the government in 2008 and 2009. While trimming Citigroup's capital cushion favors stockholders, Nerby said, scrutiny from years of stress tests has left the bank stronger for bondholders. Citigroup built excess capital through additions from net income and by shedding assets that required capital support. Under Corbat, Citigroup has sold an assortment of ill-fitting assets and pulled out of about 20 consumer markets. Yet the shrinking has discouraged some investors who doubt whether Citigroup's remaining businesses will produce the higher profits needed to keep funding bigger payouts. Bank analyst David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors said if Citigroup continues to shrink, shareholders will not be satisfied for more than another year or two of Citigroup paying out more capital than it earns.  You have to have an operating profile that allows you to maintain your capital and do shareholder payouts,  he said.  They don't really have that. The visibility of growth engines at Citi is de minimis.

Frederico,Ricardo Rossello,PUERTORICO,DEBT/PREPA,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Puerto Rico's financial oversight board said on Wednesday it was still in debt restructuring talks with creditors of the island's power utility, PREPA, a day after rejecting a proposed deal to restructure $9 billion of the utility's bonds. In public documents posted on its website, the board said its main concern about the deal was that it could squeeze consumers as demand at PREPA declines. The board's rejection had riled creditors, and it faced a lawsuit from insurers of PREPA bonds who argued the board, created last year under a federal law enacted by the U.S. Congress, had no legal authority to veto the deal. On Wednesday, the board said it could still be persuaded to embrace the debt restructuring agreement with certain changes, including a cap on charges to customers. A special charge on consumer bills would back new debt issued under the deal. The board is charged with managing the U.S. territory's finances and leading it back to economic growth after a decade of contraction. Puerto Rico is facing a historic economic crisis, marked by $70 billion of debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population as residents flock to the U.S. mainland. Last month, it filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. PREPA, hamstrung by mismanagement and outdated infrastructure, is seen as a microcosm of the island's problems. It began debt restructuring talks with holders of its $9 billion in bonds nearly three years ago, but an initial workout agreement stalled over regulatory concerns and was then rejected by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello. Under a new deal, reached in April, PREPA creditors agreed to accept 15 percent repayment cuts in exchange for new debt backed by a charge on customer bills. Dominic Frederico, chief executive of Assured Guaranty Ltd , which insures nearly $800 million in PREPA bonds, pilloried the board's rejection of the latest deal, saying in a statement on Wednesday it was  yet another example of a rogue oversight board.  But the board said it would continue talks with PREPA's stakeholders, and could accept the deal with caps on the securitization charge. It also wants to impose a more flexible amortization structure, designed to ensure the bonds still pay by their final maturities, even under the caps and PREPA's declining demand forecast. The board said it was not looking to further cut repayments to creditors.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSL1N1JP240"},

Bank of America on Wednesday boosted its annual dividend 60 percent to 48 cents per share from 30 cents, beginning in the third quarter. Buffett has said a boost of that size would likely prompt him to swap Berkshire's preferred shares in the second-largest bank into common shares now worth about $16.7 billion. Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An exchange would made Berkshire the largest shareholder of both Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, and more than triple a $5 billion investment made fewer than six years ago. It would also signal Buffett's confidence in Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive. Moynihan has worked to restore investors' confidence in his Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank after it spent more than $70 billion since the global financial crisis to resolve legal and regulatory matters, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co.  Buffett has said he is very happy with what Moynihan's doing, and it's easy work for him to get more dividends,  said Bill Smead, whose $1.16 billion Smead Value fund includes shares of both companies.  For Bank of America, it would mean a further endorsement by the most spectacular large-cap stock picker of all time.  Buffett is worth $76.1 billion, Forbes magazine says. The dividend increase required approval by the Federal Reserve, which conducts annual  stress tests  of big banks' ability to handle tough economic and market conditions. Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company's annual meeting in Omaha May 4, 2013.Rick Wilking/File PhotoOn Wednesday, the Fed approved capital plans for Bank of America, which also announced a $12 billion stock buyback plan, and 33 other large U.S. banks. Lender of Last Resort Buffett had bought $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock with a 6 percent dividend, or $300 million annually, in August 2011, when investors worried about the bank's capital needs. The purchase included warrants to acquire 700 million common shares at $7.14 each, less than one-third Wednesday's closing price of $23.88.  In his Feb. 25 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he  would anticipate  swapping the preferred stock into common stock if the annual dividend rose above 44 cents per share. If Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire made the swap now, it would have a $11.7 billion paper profit and begin collecting $336 million of annual dividends, on top of roughly $1.7 billion of dividends already paid. A swap would also let Berkshire enjoy gains if Bank of America's stock price rose. In contrast, the value of the preferred shares will not change so long as Bank of America does not collapse. Berkshire's warrants expire in September 2021. Buffett's bet was among more than $25 billion of high-yielding investments he made from 2008 to 2011 in such companies as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). The investments shored up confidence in the companies and helped give Buffett a reputation as a lender of last resort when times were tough.

Chicago Police Department Detective David March and officers Joseph Walsh and Thomas Gaffney were each charged on Tuesday with conspiracy, official misconduct and obstruction of justice.  Kevin Graham, the president of Fraternal Order of Police, Chicago Lodge 7, questioned whether the charges were politically motivated and biased.  These charges are, in our minds, baseless. Our officers are being made the scapegoats,  he said in a statement.  These officers should not have been indicted.  The indictments stem from a 2014 incident in which Laquan McDonald, 17, was shot 16 times by officer Jason Van Dyke, who testified in a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday, local media reports said. March, Walsh and Gaffney, who were on the scene the night of the shooting, conspired to conceal the facts of McDonald's killing in order to protect their fellow officer from criminal investigation and prosecution, the indictment said. A video of the shooting, released in 2015, sparked days of protests and thrust Chicago into a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities. The indictment said the officers created false reports on the killing of McDonald, who was armed with a knife.  How the special prosecutor can construe a 'code of silence' theory defies belief,  Graham said, adding that the union will support the officers' defense.  He said the new indictments raise doubts about whether Van Dyke will get a fair trial. Van Dyke, who said he felt threatened by McDonald, also was charged in March with 16 new counts of aggravated battery and pleaded not guilty to them. March, 58, and Walsh, 48, are no longer with the Chicago police force, police representatives said. Gaffney will have a status hearing at which he is expected to be suspended without pay, a police spokesman said.      Walsh and March were police veterans of more than 30 years and about 20 years, respectively. Gaffney, 43, has about 20 years in the department. All are expected to be arraigned on July 10. Chicago police last month finalized stricter limits on when officers can use firearms and other force, the latest attempt to reform a department roiled by misconduct and criticism in the wake of McDonald's death.

The generic drugmaker announced the vote totals from the meeting in a filing with regulators on Wednesday. Investors also cast more than a quarter of the shares voted against Chief Executive Heather Bresch, in the wake of a scandal over high prices for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. The company had previously said that all its directors had been re-elected. The investors agitating against Mylan's board had a steep threshold to cross as more than two-thirds of the shares voted, as well as more than half of Mylan's outstanding shares, would have needed to be cast against the directors for them to lose. A majority of the shares of the voted at the meeting were cast against Wendy Cameron, head of the company's compensation committee. The other members of the compensation, Neil Dimick and Mark Parrish, had just under 50 percent of the shares voted cast against their re-election. Sharp price increases for the life-saving EpiPen treatment spurred congressional, Justice Department and other government investigations of whether Mylan was overcharging. The shareholder campaign against Mylan's board, led by New York City and State pension funds as well as the California teachers pension fund, picked up steam after Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package was disclosed earlier this year.

Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, on Wednesday said it plans to repurchase up to $15.6 billion of common stock over the next year and double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share, bringing total payouts to $18.9 billion. The total payout is 54 percent more than the Fed allowed  last year and about 1.25 times the profits that analysts expect Citigroup to earn over the next four quarters. Analysts had expected Citigroup would win the right to increase payouts to roughly 1.12 percent of annual profits. Citigroup announced the details after the U.S. Federal Reserve said the 34 biggest U.S. banks had passed the second component of its annual stress test, and would therefore be able to put capital to work in ways other than fortifying their balance sheets. [L1N1JP1U9] This year's test was an especially crucial rite of passage for Citi, whose shareholders have been keen to see management buy back shares that had been underperforming rivals. Citigroup shares were up 2.3 percent in after-hours trading at $66.68, compared with a stated net worth of $65.94 per share as of March 31.  For some time, we have retained a significant amount of capital in excess of what is needed to prudently operate and invest in the firm,  Corbat said in a statement. Now, he said, the bank can begin  returning a higher level of that capital to our shareholders and improving Citi’s overall returns.   This is another stepping stone in the recovery of Citigroup  from losses in the financial crisis, said Peter Nerby, a senior bank analyst at Moody's Investors Service. Citigroup took three bailout infusions from the government in 2008 and 2009. While trimming Citigroup's capital cushion favors stockholders, Nerby said, scrutiny from years of stress tests has left the bank stronger for bondholders. Citigroup built excess capital through additions from net income and by shedding assets that required capital support. Under Corbat, Citigroup has sold an assortment of ill-fitting assets and pulled out of about 20 consumer markets. Yet the shrinking has discouraged some investors who doubt whether Citigroup's remaining businesses will produce the higher profits needed to keep funding bigger payouts. Bank analyst David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors said if Citigroup continues to shrink, shareholders will not be satisfied for more than another year or two of Citigroup paying out more capital than it earns.  You have to have an operating profile that allows you to maintain your capital and do shareholder payouts,  he said.  They don't really have that. The visibility of growth engines at Citi is de minimis.

Joseph Astarita was charged in an indictment handed down in U.S. District Court in Oregon on June 20 with three counts of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. According to the court papers, which were unsealed on Wednesday, Astarita falsely told investigators that he did not open fire at Robert  LaVoy  Finicum during a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement on a snow-covered road near the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 26, 2016. Finicum, a 54-year-old rancher who acted as a spokesman for the lands-rights occupiers of the refuge, was shot dead by Oregon State police in an incident caught on an aerial videotape taken by a law enforcement aircraft. A county prosecutor later found the shooting to be justified, saying that Finicum appeared to have been reaching for a weapon at the time. Family members of the slain man have accused law enforcement of covering up the circumstances surrounding his death. Astarita is not accused of killing Finicum or even striking him with any bullets. An autopsy found that the rancher was killed by three rounds fired by Oregon State Police officers that struck him in the neck, shoulder and lower back. Federal prosecutors and a spokeswoman for the FBI's office in Portland could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if Astarita had retained an attorney. The takeover of the wildlife refuge was initially sparked by outrage over the plight of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers the occupiers believed had been unfairly treated in an arson case. But the militants said they were also protesting larger grievances at what they saw as government tyranny. The leaders of the occupation, Ammon and Ryan Bundy, were taken into custody at the roadside where Finicum was shot dead. In a surprise verdict, both Bundys and five of their followers were acquitted by a federal court jury in October of conspiracy charges. The Bundys still face assault, conspiracy and other charges from a separate armed standoff in 2014 at the Nevada ranch of their father, Cliven Bundy, triggered when federal agents seized his cattle for his failure to pay grazing fees to the government.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/oregon-shooting-idUSL1N1JP23Y"},

Bank of America on Wednesday boosted its annual dividend 60 percent to 48 cents per share from 30 cents, beginning in the third quarter. Buffett has said a boost of that size would likely prompt him to swap Berkshire's preferred shares in the second-largest bank into common shares now worth about $16.7 billion. Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An exchange would made Berkshire the largest shareholder of both Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, and more than triple a $5 billion investment made fewer than six years ago. It would also signal Buffett's confidence in Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive. Moynihan has worked to restore investors' confidence in his Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank after it spent more than $70 billion since the global financial crisis to resolve legal and regulatory matters, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co.  Buffett has said he is very happy with what Moynihan's doing, and it's easy work for him to get more dividends,  said Bill Smead, whose $1.16 billion Smead Value fund includes shares of both companies.  For Bank of America, it would mean a further endorsement by the most spectacular large-cap stock picker of all time.  Buffett is worth $76.1 billion, Forbes magazine says. The dividend increase required approval by the Federal Reserve, which conducts annual  stress tests  of big banks' ability to handle tough economic and market conditions. Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company's annual meeting in Omaha May 4, 2013.Rick Wilking/File PhotoOn Wednesday, the Fed approved capital plans for Bank of America, which also announced a $12 billion stock buyback plan, and 33 other large U.S. banks. Lender of Last Resort Buffett had bought $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock with a 6 percent dividend, or $300 million annually, in August 2011, when investors worried about the bank's capital needs. The purchase included warrants to acquire 700 million common shares at $7.14 each, less than one-third Wednesday's closing price of $23.88.  In his Feb. 25 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he  would anticipate  swapping the preferred stock into common stock if the annual dividend rose above 44 cents per share. If Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire made the swap now, it would have a $11.7 billion paper profit and begin collecting $336 million of annual dividends, on top of roughly $1.7 billion of dividends already paid. A swap would also let Berkshire enjoy gains if Bank of America's stock price rose. In contrast, the value of the preferred shares will not change so long as Bank of America does not collapse. Berkshire's warrants expire in September 2021. Buffett's bet was among more than $25 billion of high-yielding investments he made from 2008 to 2011 in such companies as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). The investments shored up confidence in the companies and helped give Buffett a reputation as a lender of last resort when times were tough. Bank of America's largest shareholder is Vanguard Group, whose 652.4 million shares give it a 6.6 percent stake, Reuters data show.

In public documents posted on its website, the board said its main concern about the deal was that it could squeeze consumers as demand at PREPA declines. The board's rejection had riled creditors, and it faced a lawsuit from insurers of PREPA bonds who argued the board, created last year under a federal law enacted by the U.S. Congress, had no legal authority to veto the deal. On Wednesday, the board said it could still be persuaded to embrace the debt restructuring agreement with certain changes, including a cap on charges to customers. A special charge on consumer bills would back new debt issued under the deal. The board is charged with managing the U.S. territory's finances and leading it back to economic growth after a decade of contraction. Puerto Rico is facing a historic economic crisis, marked by $70 billion of debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population as residents flock to the U.S. mainland. Last month, it filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. PREPA, hamstrung by mismanagement and outdated infrastructure, is seen as a microcosm of the island's problems. It began debt restructuring talks with holders of its $9 billion in bonds nearly three years ago, but an initial workout agreement stalled over regulatory concerns and was then rejected by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello. Under a new deal, reached in April, PREPA creditors agreed to accept 15 percent repayment cuts in exchange for new debt backed by a charge on customer bills. Dominic Frederico, chief executive of Assured Guaranty Ltd , which insures nearly $800 million in PREPA bonds, pilloried the board's rejection of the latest deal, saying in a statement on Wednesday it was  yet another example of a rogue oversight board.  But the board said it would continue talks with PREPA's stakeholders, and could accept the deal with caps on the securitization charge. It also wants to impose a more flexible amortization structure, designed to ensure the bonds still pay by their final maturities, even under the caps and PREPA's declining demand forecast. The board said it was not looking to further cut repayments to creditors.

Interventions, training and policies (are needed) to protect the wellbeing not only of these students, but their fellow students, their neighborhoods and their communities at large,  said lead author Maayan Simckes, of the University of Washington in Seattle. Access to guns is a risk factor for injury and death - and that risk may be exacerbated among youngsters already at high risk for these outcomes, such as bullied teens, Simckes and her colleagues write in the Journal of Adolescent Health. Past studies found bullied teens carry guns more often than those not bullied, but little is known about their access to those weapons, the researchers write. They used data collected from a nationally representative sample of 10,704 adolescents participating in the National Crime Victimization Survey. In addition to asking respondents about past bullying, the survey also asks if the teens have access to a loaded gun without adult permission. That could mean, for example, that the teen knew how to get a gun from a safe and load it without asking an adult for help or a key. Overall, 4.2 percent of teens said they had access to a loaded weapon without adult permission. Nearly 19 percent of students reported traditional bullying that may be faced in school or on the playground, about 2 percent reported cyber bullying over the internet and about 6 percent reported both types of bullying. Among the nearly 74 percent of students who weren't bullied, about 3 percent reported access to a loaded gun without adult permission. That proportion rose to about 5 percent among teens who experienced traditional bullying, and to 9 percent among those who were victims of cyber bullying. In the group of teens who reported both traditional and cyber bullying, 15 percent reported access to a loaded gun without adult permission. Simckes told Reuters Health that the new study can't explain why bullied teens are more likely to have unrestricted access to loaded guns. Future research needs to examine that question. Additionally, people should understand the close relationship between gun access and bullying, Simckes said.  For example, in pediatric offices, when we have conversations about gun access, we should also be discussing bullying,  she said. Dr. Andrew Adesman, of Northwell Health's Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recently found bullied teens are more likely to bring guns to school.  Obviously, you can’t bring a gun to school unless you have access,  he told Reuters Health. The risk that teens will bring a gun to school goes up even more when they face threats of physical violence, said Adesman, who wasn't involved with the new study. He said gun owners need to take precautions.  Parents who are responsible gun owners should make sure they have their weapons secured,  said Adesman.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said in an 18-page order he was allowing claims that VW and then-Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn intentionally or recklessly understated VW's financial liabilities made since May 2014, but dismissing claims for financial statements issued before then. That VW  may have deliberately employed an illegal defeat device does not mean the company knew with reasonable certainty that it was going to get caught,  Breyer wrote in dismissing thee older statements. Breyer also dismissed claims that VW brand chief Herbert Diess understated VW financial liabilities in 2015, but Breyer rejected a bid to throw out a claim against then VW U.S. chief Michael Horn. The plaintiffs, mostly U.S. municipal pension funds, have accused VW of not having informed the market in a timely fashion and understated possible financial liabilities. The lawsuits said VW's market capitalization fell by $63 billion after the diesel cheating scandal became public in September 2015. The plaintiffs had invested in VW through American Depositary Receipts, a form of equity ownership in a non-U.S. company that represents the foreign shares of the company held on deposit by a bank in the company's home country. Volkswagen said in a statement it was pleased  with the court’s decision to limit the scope of the plaintiffs’ allegations, and believes the remaining claims are without merit, which we intend to demonstrate as this case proceeds.  CEO Winterkorn resigned days after the scandal became public and much of the company's management has changed since 2015. VW in September 2015 admitted using sophisticated secret software in its cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in March in a U.S. court to three felonies in connection with the scandal.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday said the Times deliberately  acted with actual malice  toward Palin and that the editorial was  false and defamatory.  It claims the Times violated its policies and procedures. Palin, the former Alaska governor was Republican presidential candidate John McCain's running mate in an unsuccessful 2008 campaign, is seeking in excess of $75,000 for compensatory, special and punitive damages. On June 14 the Times published an editorial commenting on the mass shooting at a Virginia baseball field that injured four people, including Republican Representative Steve Scalise, saying the attack was probably evidence of how vicious American politics has become. The editorial board then recalled a shooting in Arizona in 2011 that targeted U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and killed six people.  Before the shooting, Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs,  the editorial said. The newspaper issued a correction saying the editorial  incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric  and the Giffords shooting. It also corrected its description of the map, saying it depicted electoral districts, not Giffords and individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath cross hairs. The lawsuit called the corrections insufficient and said Palin wanted the Times to remove the article from the newspaper's website, where it still appears with the amended correction.  We will defend against any claim vigorously,  the Times said in a statement on Wednesday. Theodore Boutrous, a Los Angeles lawyer and constitutional law expert, said Palin was unlikely to succeed because she is a public figure.

Even when they don’t smoke themselves, cancer patients who regularly breathe indoor air contaminated by tobacco smoke can have higher death rates and an increased risk of heart attack and strokes, the authors write in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.  For the study, researchers analyzed data on secondhand smoke exposure for 686 cancer survivors in nationally representative surveys done in two-year cycles from 1999 to 2012. Overall, only about 16 percent of participants were exposed to secondhand smoke by the end of the study period, down from roughly 40 percent at the beginning.  While the decline is encouraging, the trouble with the results is that these cancer survivors are being exposed to secondhand smoke at rates similar to the general population, said lead study author Dr. Oladimeji Akinboro, of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.  “It may reflect a lack of appreciation, on the part of patients with certain types of cancer along with their close household and social contacts, of the dangers that ongoing exposure of cancer patients and survivors to tobacco smoke, such as higher death rates,” Akinboro said by email.  “Furthermore, ongoing exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke in the home makes it less likely that smokers who have, or have had cancer, will quit smoking,” Akinboro added.  To examine trends in secondhand exposure, researchers looked at interview data from survey participants and also examined results from blood tests for levels of cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine that marks exposure to tobacco smoke.  Overall, about 28 percent of adult cancer survivors in the study had been exposed to secondhand smoke and about 5 percent reported living in a household where someone smoked. But certain segments of the population had much higher rates of exposure.  For example, 26 percent of white people in the study were exposed to secondhand smoke, compared with 56 percent of black participants.  About 22 percent of people with some education beyond high school breathed secondhand smoke, compared to 42 percent of people who didn’t finish high school.  And, 53 percent of the poorest people in the study had secondhand smoke exposure - more than double the odds for the most affluent individuals.  The risk was also higher for people with lung tumors and other smoking-related cancers: 36 percent had been exposed to secondhand smoke compared with 26 percent of people who had malignancies not linked to smoking.  “It’s difficult to explain the disparities,” said Dr. Maher Karam-Hage, associate medical director of the tobacco treatment program at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  With less education, people might not fully understand the risks, Karam-Hage, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. And with less income, people might not be able to afford to move to avoid secondhand smoke exposure at home.  “In addition, those who are survivors of smoking-related cancers may have been smokers themselves and/or had smokers as household members and therefore continue to be exposed to their household members smoking,” Karam-Hage said. “Patients can use these solid and irrefutable data and findings as evidence to help them advocate with others the need to establish safe and healthy living areas.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2t1BYZG Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, online June 22, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-secondhandsmoke-cancer-survivo-idUSKBN19J2NJ"},

Afghan-American artist Aman Mojadidi and Times Square Arts introduced the interactive art installation  Once Upon a Place,  which allows people to listen to the stories of immigrants in New York through the receivers of old pay phones that once were a common sight on city streets.

I wanted to do sort of an urban project about migration, a storytelling project,  Mojadidi, 47, said on Tuesday when the booths were opened.  For me, the fact that these phone booths were being removed, I immediately thought about bringing them back and putting a different kind of story into them.  The artist reworked three phone booths and collected 70 stories from immigrants who now call New York home. Their stories were recorded in English or in their native languages. Jose Mejia, 22, an immigration rights activist from Mexico, was one of many participants in the project.  What America means to me is the land of opportunities. It's a dream come true,  Mejia said in interview, adding that he was just 2 years old when his mother carried him across the U.S. border from Mexico.  Anyone who wants to work here and better their lives can do so here in America.  Marelisa Morejon, an immigrant from Cuba, decided to step into a booth and listen.  You can hear different histories,  Morejon said.  It's very touching.  The stories can be heard through Sept. 5.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday said the Times deliberately  acted with actual malice  toward Palin and that the editorial was  false and defamatory.  It claims the Times violated its policies and procedures. Palin, the former Alaska governor was Republican presidential candidate John McCain's running mate in an unsuccessful 2008 campaign, is seeking in excess of $75,000 for compensatory, special and punitive damages. On June 14 the Times published an editorial commenting on the mass shooting at a Virginia baseball field that injured four people, including Republican Representative Steve Scalise, saying the attack was probably evidence of how vicious American politics has become. The editorial board then recalled a shooting in Arizona in 2011 that targeted U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and killed six people.  Before the shooting, Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs,  the editorial said. The newspaper issued a correction saying the editorial  incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric  and the Giffords shooting. It also corrected its description of the map, saying it depicted electoral districts, not Giffords and individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath cross hairs. The lawsuit called the corrections insufficient and said Palin wanted the Times to remove the article from the newspaper's website, where it still appears with the amended correction.  We will defend against any claim vigorously,  the Times said in a statement on Wednesday. Theodore Boutrous, a Los Angeles lawyer and constitutional law expert, said Palin was unlikely to succeed because she is a public figure.  The First Amendment protects newspapers and others in terms of speaking out and writing and expressing opinions on important and public issues and that's what The New York Times was doing,  Boutrous said.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said in an 18-page order he was allowing claims that VW and then-Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn intentionally or recklessly understated VW's financial liabilities made since May 2014, but dismissing claims for financial statements issued before then. That VW  may have deliberately employed an illegal defeat device does not mean the company knew with reasonable certainty that it was going to get caught,  Breyer wrote in dismissing thee older statements. Breyer also dismissed claims that VW brand chief Herbert Diess understated VW financial liabilities in 2015, but Breyer  rejected a bid to throw out a claim against then VW U.S. chief Michael Horn. The plaintiffs, mostly U.S. municipal pension funds, have accused VW of not having informed the market in a timely fashion and understated possible financial liabilities. The lawsuits said VW's market capitalization fell by $63 billion after the diesel cheating scandal became public in September 2015. The plaintiffs had invested in VW through American Depositary Receipts, a form of equity ownership in a non-U.S. company that represents the foreign shares of the company held on deposit by a bank in the company's home country. Volkswagen said in a statement it was pleased  with the court’s decision to limit the scope of the plaintiffs’ allegations, and believes the remaining claims are without merit, which we intend to demonstrate as this case proceeds.    CEO Winterkorn resigned days after the scandal became public and much of the company's management has changed since 2015. VW in September 2015 admitted using sophisticated secret software in its cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in March in a U.S. court to three felonies in connection with the scandal. Volkswagen has agreed to spend as much as $25 billion in the United States to resolve claims from owners and regulators over polluting diesel vehicles and has offered to buy back about 500,000 vehicles. Through mid-June, VW has spent $6.3 billion buying back vehicles and compensating U.S. owners.

In an 8-6 ruling, the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned an injunction affirmed in April by a three-judge panel from the court that had delayed executions in Ohio. The state, which has its next execution scheduled in July, appealed that injunction against the use of a three-drug protocol. The appeals court's ruling on Wednesday disputed the lower-court finding that it was likely that Ohio's use of midazolam hydrochloride entailed a  substantial risk  of serious pain that violated prisoners' constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment. Midazolam is used to render condemned inmates unconscious before two other drugs are administered in executions.  The district court's findings thus provide little support for its conclusion that Ohio's three-drug protocol creates an unconstitutional risk of pain,  the majority opinion said. Several U.S. states use midazolam in executions, including Oklahoma and Arizona, where witnesses said inmates during past executions appeared to twist in pain on death row gurneys. Arizona previously agreed to stop using the sedative. In the Wednesday ruling, the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit majority said that while the protocol might cause pain in some cases, plaintiffs did not meet the legal standard showing the method to be sure or very likely to cause serious pain. One dissenting judge said the plaintiffs should be granted a trial on the method's constitutionality before they are executed. Allen Bohnert, one of the attorneys representing the death row prisoners who brought the lawsuit, said in a statement he would seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Ohio should not take the risk of continued botched executions by going back to using these dangerous, unsuitable drugs,  he said. The Ohio governor's office had postponed nine executions because of the injunction including that of Ronald Phillips, who was sentenced to death for the 1993 rape and murder of his girlfriend's 3-year-old daughter. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction has Phillips scheduled for execution on July 26, one of four scheduled for 2017, and 23 more individuals scheduled through 2020. Phillips would be the first execution in Ohio after a pause of more than three years. Department spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said in an email the agency  remains committed to carrying out court-ordered executions in a lawful, humane and dignified manner.

Researchers used 12 years of data - health records from nearly 61 million Medicare beneficiaries, combined with a massive databank of pollution readings - to link specific air quality levels to death rates. They found that for every increase of just 10 micrograms in small-particle pollution known as PM2.5, the death rate went up 7.3 percent. That's the equivalent of 120,000 fatalities among people age 65 and older, lead author Qian Di of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. For every 10 part-per-billion rise in ozone concentration, the mortality rate rose by 1.1 percent, producing an extra 19,000 deaths just among the elderly. Even in years when the concentrations in a region were low,  we continued to see significant associations between exposure and mortality,  Di and his colleagues write in the New England Journal of Medicine. Their conclusion: current U.S. rules are not strict enough to prevent pollution-related deaths and further reductions in pollution will produce a big drop in fatalities.  It is clear from this study that there is not really a safe level of air pollution,  said Dr. Brian W. Christman, vice chair of the department of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who was not involved in the research.  The Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency have done great work, but the data indicates that additional effort to reduce PM2.5 and ozone would save lives,  Christman, who is also a spokesman for the American Lung Association, told Reuters Health by phone.  As a matter of fact, further reduction in PM2.5 below the (federal standard) of 12 micrograms per cubic meter are likely to be even more effective than previous reductions.  Senior study author Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at Harvard, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview that she hoped the findings  will change the course of recent discussions about dismantling EPA and EPA research and leaving the Paris agreement  designed to slow global climate change by reducing pollution levels.  The evidence we're seeing here is very compelling,  she said. The results come at a time when the Trump administration has begun  to dismantle guidelines intended to reduce emissions from coal-fired electricity plants  and may revoke the waiver that allowed California to adopt stricter vehicle emission standards, according to an editorial accompanying the study.  Revoking this waiver could have the effect of exposing more than 100 million Americans to higher levels of automobile emissions,  the Journal warns.  Trump’s proposed budget includes crippling cuts to the EPA, including cuts in funding for both federal and state enforcement of regulations. The increased air pollution that would result from loosening current restrictions would have devastating effects on public health.  The particles studied are dangerous because their tiny size - only visible with an electron microscope - allows them to get deep into the lungs to do damage, and from there they can also enter the bloodstream. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, from 2000 to 2015 the average concentration of PM 2.5 pollution nationally has declined by 37 percent thanks to stricter air standards. According to the new study, the two regions that saw the greatest improvements in air quality were the central and southeastern United States.  Satellite and weather data, computer models and data from 1,928 particle monitoring stations and 1,877 ozone modeling stations were used to estimate exposure over each square kilometer of the country. The task was so massive the number crunching had to be done by supercomputer over Harvard's Christmas break, Di noted. Because the database was so large, Di and his colleagues were also able to determine that subgroups, including men, blacks, Asians, Hispanics and people eligible for the Medicaid health plan for the poor faced the highest risk from small particle pollution. It shows  this is not just a health issue, but a social equality issue as well,  said Di, a doctoral student in Harvard's department of environmental health.

The proposed legislation by Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Sherrod Brown would permit Roy Woodall, the independent insurance expert on the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to remain in his job until a replacement can be nominated and confirmed, or for an additional 18 months. The FSOC is a panel of regulators with the power to dub large financial firms, including insurers, as systemic, a tag that carries additional oversight by the Federal Reserve. The panel has designated a number of insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc, American International Group Inc and Metlife. Metlife fought the designation in court and won. The other two still carry the designation, though Prudential is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded. A two-thirds majority vote of FSOC's sitting members is needed to rescind a designation. Woodall, who previously voted against designating Metlife and Prudential, is the only person on the panel with insurance expertise. But his six-year term expires in September. As there is no federal insurance regulator, Woodall is effectively the most important figure in U.S. regulation of large insurers. The FSOC is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All of the FSOC's other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms, or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy. But due to a quirk in the Dodd-Frank law, Woodall cannot be held over or temporarily replaced after his term expires - a problem that could leave a gap on the FSOC. Wednesday's proposed bill will provide  much-needed clarity regarding the independent insurance member’s term,  Crapo said. Brown added that the fix represents a  commonsense  bipartisan measure. It is also backed by a large list of other Republicans and Democrats on the panel  - a sign it will likely win broad support by lawmakers in Congress.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-senate-idUSL1N1JP20V"},

The catastrophe bond, which will pay out depending on the size of the outbreak, its growth rate and the number of countries affected, is the first of its kind for epidemics. It should mean money is disbursed much faster than during West Africa's Ebola crisis. Ebola spread across the region in the early months of 2014. Michael Bennett, head of derivatives and structured finance at the World Bank's capital markets department, said that if the pandemic emergency financing facility (PEF) had existed in 2014, some $100 million could have been mobilised as early as July. In reality, money did not begin to flow on this scale until three months later, by which time the number of deaths from Ebola had increased tenfold.   In the end about 11,000 people died in that pandemic and it's estimated that the cost to the countries most affected – Guinea, Liberia and Sierre Leone - was about $2.8 billion,  Bennett said. The PEF will offer coverage to all countries eligible for financing from the International Development Agency (IDA), the arm of the World Bank dedicated to the world's poorest countries. It covers outbreaks of infectious diseases most likely to cause major epidemics, including pandemic influenza strains; coronaviruses, including SARS; filoviruses, which include Ebola and Marburg; plus others such as Crimean Congo fever, Rift Valley fever and Lassa fever. Bennett said the PEF as a whole would provide more than $500 million of coverage against pandemics over the next five years. This includes today's $425 million transaction, comprising $320 million raised through the bond market and $105 million through swaps transactions.  The transaction was oversubscribed by 200 percent, attracting interest from dedicated cat bond investors, asset managers, pension funds and endowments, the World Bank said.  For the pandemic bond, the World Bank will pay bondholders a coupon that replicates an insurance premium plus a funding spread, in return for a payout if the bond is triggered.   If a trigger event occurs, instead of repaying the bond in full, some or all of the principal is transferred to the PEF trust fund,  Bennett said.  So essentially the investors are acting like insurance companies.   Under the swaps transactions, the swaps counterparty pays out if a trigger event occurs.   The objective of offering the risk in both forms is that the bonds and swaps appeal to different types of investors, and therefore … we are creating the broadest possible investor pool for this risk,  said Bennett. That helped drive down prices.  A replenishable cash window available from 2018 will provide funding for diseases that may not meet the activation criteria for the bond, whilst future donor commitments may be used to purchase additional coverage from the market.

In an 8-6 ruling, the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned an injunction affirmed in April by a three-judge panel from the court that had delayed executions in Ohio. The state, which has its next execution scheduled in July, appealed that injunction against the use of a three-drug protocol. The appeals court's ruling on Wednesday disputed the lower-court finding that it was likely that Ohio's use of midazolam hydrochloride entailed a  substantial risk  of serious pain that violated prisoners' constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment. Midazolam is used to render condemned inmates unconscious before two other drugs are administered in executions.  The district court's findings thus provide little support for its conclusion that Ohio's three-drug protocol creates an unconstitutional risk of pain,  the majority opinion said. Several U.S. states use midazolam in executions, including Oklahoma and Arizona, where witnesses said inmates during past executions appeared to twist in pain on death row gurneys. Arizona previously agreed to stop using the sedative. In the Wednesday ruling, the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit majority said that while the protocol might cause pain in some cases, plaintiffs did not meet the legal standard showing the method to be sure or very likely to cause serious pain. One dissenting judge said the plaintiffs should be granted a trial on the method's constitutionality before they are executed. Allen Bohnert, one of the attorneys representing the death row prisoners who brought the lawsuit, said in a statement he would seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Ohio should not take the risk of continued botched executions by going back to using these dangerous, unsuitable drugs,  he said. The Ohio governor's office had postponed nine executions because of the injunction including that of Ronald Phillips, who was sentenced to death for the 1993 rape and murder of his girlfriend's 3-year-old daughter. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction has Phillips scheduled for execution on July 26, one of four scheduled for 2017, and 23 more individuals scheduled through 2020. Phillips would be the first execution in Ohio after a pause of more than three years. Department spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said in an email the agency  remains committed to carrying out court-ordered executions in a lawful, humane and dignified manner.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said in an 18-page order he was allowing claims that VW and then-Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn intentionally or recklessly understated VW's financial liabilities made since May 2014, but dismissing claims for financial statements issued before then. That VW  may have deliberately employed an illegal defeat device does not mean the company knew with reasonable certainty that it was going to get caught,  Breyer wrote in dismissing thee older statements. Breyer also dismissed claims that VW brand chief Herbert Diess understated VW financial liabilities in 2015, but Breyer  rejected a bid to throw out a claim against then VW U.S. chief Michael Horn. The plaintiffs, mostly U.S. municipal pension funds, have accused VW of not having informed the market in a timely fashion and understated possible financial liabilities. The lawsuits said VW's market capitalization fell by $63 billion after the diesel cheating scandal became public in September 2015. The plaintiffs had invested in VW through American Depositary Receipts, a form of equity ownership in a non-U.S. company that represents the foreign shares of the company held on deposit by a bank in the company's home country. Volkswagen said in a statement it was pleased  with the court’s decision to limit the scope of the plaintiffs’ allegations, and believes the remaining claims are without merit, which we intend to demonstrate as this case proceeds.    CEO Winterkorn resigned days after the scandal became public and much of the company's management has changed since 2015. VW in September 2015 admitted using sophisticated secret software in its cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in March in a U.S. court to three felonies in connection with the scandal. Volkswagen has agreed to spend as much as $25 billion in the United States to resolve claims from owners and regulators over polluting diesel vehicles and has offered to buy back about 500,000 vehicles. Through mid-June, VW has spent $6.3 billion buying back vehicles and compensating U.S. owners.

The proposed legislation by Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Sherrod Brown would permit Roy Woodall, the independent insurance expert on the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to remain in his job until a replacement can be nominated and confirmed, or for an additional 18 months. The FSOC is a panel of regulators with the power to dub large financial firms, including insurers, as systemic, a tag that carries additional oversight by the Federal Reserve.  The panel has designated a number of insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc, American International Group Inc and Metlife.  Metlife fought the designation in court and won.  The other two still carry the designation, though Prudential is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded. A two-thirds majority vote of FSOC's sitting members is needed to rescind a designation. FILE PHOTO - Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) speaks with the media following the weekly policy luncheons on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 6, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinWoodall, who previously voted against designating Metlife and Prudential, is the only person on the panel with insurance expertise. But his six-year term expires in September.  As there is no federal insurance regulator, Woodall is effectively the most important figure in U.S. regulation of large insurers. The FSOC is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All of the FSOC's other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms, or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy.  But due to a quirk in the Dodd-Frank law, Woodall cannot be held over or temporarily replaced after his term expires - a problem that could leave a gap on the FSOC. Wednesday's proposed bill will provide  much-needed clarity regarding the independent insurance member’s term,  Crapo said.  Brown added that the fix represents a  commonsense  bipartisan measure. It is also backed by a large list of other Republicans and Democrats on the panel  - a sign it will likely win broad support by lawmakers in Congress. Reporting by Sarah N.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 143.95 points, or 0.68 percent, to 21,454.61, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 21.31 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,440.69 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 87.79 points, or 1.43 percent, to 6,234.41. The small-cap Russell 2000  ended up 1.6 percent. Financials .SPSY were the best performing S&P; sector, rising 1.6 percent. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., June 27, 2017.Lucas JacksonBank stocks including JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) helped boost the S&P; 500, both rising more than 2.0 percent. The interest rate-sensitive group was helped by an increase in yields for 10-year Treasuries and by a widening spread between shorter- and longer-dated U.S. bonds.  We have had the statements from various Fed officials that they are still on board with the tightening cycle and that has been a big driver for finance names,  said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. Bank stocks also were higher ahead of stress test results from the Federal Reserve and added to those gains in after-hours trading as the Fed approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes. Tech stocks .SPLRCT gained 1.3 percent, surging back from their worst day in more than two weeks. The sector has led the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain this year, but has pulled back recently as some investors question whether the group is too expensive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced off its 50-day moving average. With second-quarter U.S. corporate earnings reporting set to begin in earnest in July, investors are looking for results to support equity valuations. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15 times. In earnings news, General Mills (GIS.N) shares rose 1.6 percent after the Cheerios cereal maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Staples (SPLS.O) shares rose 8.4 percent. The company will announce its sale to private equity firm Sycamore Partners, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Nonetheless, the blog's authors concluded that liquidity remained resilient after examining the effects of the 2013  taper tantrum  in the Treasury market, the Oct. 15, 2014  flash rally  in the Treasury market and the liquidation of the Third Avenue's high-yield bond fund in December 2015. A deterioration in liquidity, or how easily bonds are bought and sold, has concerned investors and regulators in the aftermath of those stress events. Some market participants blamed the episodes on smaller dealer balance sheets due to regulations aimed at safeguarding the financial system.  We find that dealer balance sheets have continued to stagnate and that various measures point to less abundant funding liquidity,  Tobias Adrian, an analyst at the International Monetary Fund, and New York Fed economists Michael Fleming and Or Shachar, wrote in their article,  Market Liquidity after the Financial Crisis.  Dealers' assets fell to $3.0 trillion at the end of 2016, down from a peak of about $5 trillion in early 2008 prior to the height of the financial crisis. Tougher capital rules  have made it more expensive for bond dealers to carry bond inventory,  said Sharon Stark, fixed income strategist at Incapital LLC in Boca Raton, Florida. Because of this, dealers have become more reluctant to stake big bond positions, the blog's analysts said. Possibly due to less dealer support, there has been a decline in the  depth  of the $14 trillion U.S. Treasury market, they said. The average quantity of these government bonds that can be traded at the best bid and offer prices remained below levels seen before the crisis and 2013  taper tantrum  but above levels during the crisis, they said. In the $8.5 trillion U.S. corporate bond sector, the average bid-ask spreads on institutional-sized trades remained above pre-crisis levels, they noted. While these measures signal some decline in liquidity, the deterioration was not widespread, they said.  Although liquidity under normal market conditions may not have significantly worsened, it might be that it has become more fragile, or prone to disappearing under stress,  Adrian, Fleming and Shachar wrote. Based on the market episodes examined in their blog,  the degree of deterioration in market liquidity was within historical norms, suggesting that liquidity remained resilient even during stress events,” they wrote.

The proposed legislation by Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Sherrod Brown would permit Roy Woodall, the independent insurance expert on the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to remain in his job until a replacement can be nominated and confirmed, or for an additional 18 months. The FSOC is a panel of regulators with the power to dub large financial firms, including insurers, as systemic, a tag that carries additional oversight by the Federal Reserve.  The panel has designated a number of insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc, American International Group Inc and Metlife.  Metlife fought the designation in court and won.  The other two still carry the designation, though Prudential is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded. A two-thirds majority vote of FSOC's sitting members is needed to rescind a designation. FILE PHOTO - Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) speaks with the media following the weekly policy luncheons on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 6, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinWoodall, who previously voted against designating Metlife and Prudential, is the only person on the panel with insurance expertise. But his six-year term expires in September.  As there is no federal insurance regulator, Woodall is effectively the most important figure in U.S. regulation of large insurers. The FSOC is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All of the FSOC's other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms, or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy.  But due to a quirk in the Dodd-Frank law, Woodall cannot be held over or temporarily replaced after his term expires - a problem that could leave a gap on the FSOC. Wednesday's proposed bill will provide  much-needed clarity regarding the independent insurance member’s term,  Crapo said.  Brown added that the fix represents a  commonsense  bipartisan measure. It is also backed by a large list of other Republicans and Democrats on the panel  - a sign it will likely win broad support by lawmakers in Congress. Reporting by Sarah N.

Like many American families, the humble hot dog can trace its roots to New York's Ellis Island, where an exhibit called  Hot Out of the Melting Pot: A History of the Hot Dog in America  is set to run through July at the National Museum of Immigration. Twelve million people took their first steps on U.S. soil at that island's immigration processing center from 1892 through 1954, including those who went on to found hot dog makers Hebrew National, Nathan's Famous, Sabrett, Vienna Beef, and Walter's.   The focus is on the American hot dog, which would not exist if our forefathers had not come over here from Europe,  said Scott Ladany, Vienna Beef's vice president of sales and grandson of the company's Hungarian founder. Samuel Ladany and business partner Emil Reichel came through Ellis Island from Hungary in 1893 before introducing the first Vienna Beef hot dog at that year's Chicago World's Fair. Hot dogs from the vendor Vienna Beef rest on a platter during the opening of an exhibit at Ellis Island highlighting the immigrant history behind the  Hot Dog  in New York City, U.S., June 28, 2017.Lucas JacksonCalled wieners, frankfurters, and dachshund sausages in their native countries, hot dogs came with the great wave of European immigrants in the late nineteenth century. The American hot dog was born when these immigrants began selling their sausages in buns. They found eager eaters. Americans are expected to consume some 7 billion hot dogs from Memorial Day in May through Labor Day in early September, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. Slideshow (15 Images)Some of the most enthusiastic -- and fastest -- hot dog eaters can be found each July 4 at Nathan's Famous hot dog stand in New York's Coney Island. The 101-year-old beachfront shop, started by Polish immigrant Nathan Handwerker four years after he landed at Ellis Island, now hosts an annual hot dog eating contest that draws competitors from around the world. The founders of Sabrett and Hebrew National were Greek, German and Russian immigrants to Ellis Island and also started business in the early 1900s. For Gene-Christian Baca, whose great grandfather Walter founded Walter's Hot Dogs when he came through Ellis Island from Italy in 1919, the exhibit celebrates an important family legacy.   It is an overwhelming feeling,  Baca said.  Just to know the history behind it and to know what he went through and that he came here virtually with nothing from Italy as a three-year-old boy.

The much larger surplus in the Western Canadian province was driven by higher-than-expected economic growth, marked by strong employment, retail sales and housing starts, provincial finance minister Michael de Jong said. British Columbia's preliminary real 2016 GDP growth came in at 3.7 percent, ahead of a budgeted 2.4 percent, the highest among Canada's provinces. British Columbia is Canada's third most populous province. The fiscal update is usually only released in July once the figures have been audited, leading government critics to accuse the Liberals of trying to burnish their credentials as they prepare to leave office.  I thought it appropriate on the eve of the transfer of power to disclose to British Columbians the state of the books,  de Jong told reporters. The Liberals are expected to be defeated on Thursday in a non-confidence vote brought by the left-leaning New Democrats and backed by the Green Party. The Liberals, in power for 16 years, lost their majority in a May election. But with only one seat more than the Liberals in the legislative assembly, an NDP-Green government could become unworkable, resulting in a new election being called.  It is encouraging to hear that B.C's economy is doing well,  Green Party leader Andrew Weaver said.  However, releasing this information out of political calculation is inappropriate,  he said in a statement. Meanwhile, in the Vancouver region, Canada's most expensive housing market, foreigners were responsible for 2.8 percent of real estate purchases between Aug. 2 last year and the end of May, de Jong said. The province introduced a foreign property transfer tax on Aug. 2 following an outcry from residents and housing advocates that foreigners, especially from China, were buying real estate in droves and pushing prices out of locals' reach. De Jong said the tax raised C$102 million in the 2016-2017 financial year ending March 31.

Apollo Global Management just accumulated the largest single pool of capital earmarked for buyouts, at $23.5 billion. The haul adds to a growing stockpile of dry powder that could make outsized returns harder to come by. With yields so low across most markets, however, it should be easier to make fund investors happy. Cash is being raised at a rate not seen since 2008. London-based CVC Capital hauled in more than $18 billion for Europe's largest buyout vehicle earlier this year, Silver Lake pulled together $15 billion for tech deals and KKR set a record in Asia with a $9.3 billion fund while also putting the finishing touches on a $13.9 billion U.S. fund. With so much money sloshing around, it’s getting harder to imagine how it all will be invested profitably. Research outfit Preqin estimates there’s some $920 billion available in private equity. With leverage, that’s more than $3 trillion to deploy. Apollo itself still has nearly 30 percent of the $18.4 billion fund it raised four years ago to invest, executives said in an analysts’ earnings call in late April. The deluge will inevitably weigh on returns. Apollo’s 2013 fund, which has acquired home security operator ADT and cloud-computing company Rackspace, has generated a net internal rate of return of 16 percent as of March 31. There’s still plenty of time, but that’s less than the 26 percent rate of its 2008 mega-fund and far below the 44 percent IRR generated on a $3.7 billion buyout fund of 2001. Apollo co-founder Leon Black is like the proverbial hiker who encounters a bear in the woods. He only needs to outrun his peers, not the bear. Slow economic growth, historically low interest rates and massive bond buying by central banks have depressed returns across all asset classes. Hedge funds, one of the closest comparisons, have generated annual gains of just 4.9 percent over the past five years, according to Hedge Fund Research's Fund Weighted Composite Index. Even shrunken returns appeal on a relative basis. According to Greenwich Associates, a net 12 percent of big fund managers plan to significantly increase their private-equity allocations over the next three years, more than any other investment except direct real estate. That suggests Black and his fellow buyout barons have considerable room for error built into their mega-funds.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The delay put the future of a longtime top Republican priority in doubt amid concerns about the Senate bill from both moderate and conservative Republicans. With Democrats united in their opposition, Republicans can afford to lose only two votes among their own ranks in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been pushing for a vote ahead of the July 4 recess that starts at the end of the week. The legislation would repeal major elements of Obamacare and shrink the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor.  We're going to press on,  McConnell said after announcing the delay, adding that leaders would keep working to make senators  comfortable  with the bill.  We're optimistic we're going to get to a result that is better than the status quo.  At the White House meeting with most of the 52 Republican senators, Trump said it was vital to reach agreement on the Senate healthcare measure because Obamacare was  melting down.   So we're going to talk and we're going to see what we can do. We're getting very close,  Trump told the senators. But he added,  If we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like, and that's okay.  McConnell, whose party has a razor-thin majority in the 100-member Senate, told reporters that Republican leaders would work through the week to win over the 50 senators needed to pass the bill, with a vote planned after the recess. Vice President Mike Pence could provide the crucial vote needed to break a tie.  I think we can get 50 votes to yes by the end of the week,  Republican Senator Roger Wicker said after the White House meeting. Republican Opposition Grows The House of Representatives last month passed its own version of a healthcare bill, but the Senate bill has been criticized from both the left and the right. Moderate Republicans worried millions of people would lose their insurance. Conservatives said the bill does not do enough to erase Obamacare. The bill's prospects were not helped by a Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday saying it would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade, although it would reduce the federal deficit by $321 billion over that period. The report prompted Senator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, to say she could not support the bill as it stands. At least four conservative Republican senators said they were still opposed after the CBO analysis. Three more Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said after the delay was announced that they oppose the current draft. Portman and Capito cited the bill's Medicaid cutbacks and how that would hurt efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that has taken a heavy toll in their states. The Medicaid program was expanded under former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.  I think giving time to digest is a good thing,  Republican Senator Bob Corker said after the delay was announced.  Uncertainy  on Wall Street U.S. stock prices fell, as the decision to postpone the vote added to investor worries about Trump's ability to deliver on his promises of tax reform and deregulation, as well as changes to the health sector. Those expected changes have driven a rally in U.S. stocks this year. The benchmark S&P; 500 index closed down 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.46 percent. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty. What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration?  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions Inc. Passing the measure would be a win for Trump as he seeks to shift attention after weeks of questions over Russia's role in last year's U.S. presidential election. McConnell has promised since 2010 that Republicans, who view Obamacare as a costly government intrusion, would destroy the law  root and branch  if they controlled Congress and the White House. Republicans worry a failure to deliver will cost them votes in next year's congressional elections. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, it will either have to be approved by the House or the two chambers would reconcile the differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and send it back to the Senate. Lawmakers are expected to leave town by Friday for their July 4 holiday break, which runs all next week.

Like many American families, the humble hot dog can trace its roots to New York's Ellis Island, where an exhibit called  Hot Out of the Melting Pot: A History of the Hot Dog in America  is set to run through July at the National Museum of Immigration. Twelve million people took their first steps on U.S. soil at that island's immigration processing center from 1892 through 1954, including those who went on to found hot dog makers Hebrew National, Nathan's Famous, Sabrett, Vienna Beef, and Walter's.   The focus is on the American hot dog, which would not exist if our forefathers had not come over here from Europe,  said Scott Ladany, Vienna Beef's vice president of sales and grandson of the company's Hungarian founder. Samuel Ladany and business partner Emil Reichel came through Ellis Island from Hungary in 1893 before introducing the first Vienna Beef hot dog at that year's Chicago World's Fair. Hot dogs from the vendor Vienna Beef rest on a platter during the opening of an exhibit at Ellis Island highlighting the immigrant history behind the  Hot Dog  in New York City, U.S., June 28, 2017.Lucas JacksonCalled wieners, frankfurters, and dachshund sausages in their native countries, hot dogs came with the great wave of European immigrants in the late nineteenth century. The American hot dog was born when these immigrants began selling their sausages in buns. They found eager eaters. Americans are expected to consume some 7 billion hot dogs from Memorial Day in May through Labor Day in early September, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. Slideshow (15 Images)Some of the most enthusiastic -- and fastest -- hot dog eaters can be found each July 4 at Nathan's Famous hot dog stand in New York's Coney Island. The 101-year-old beachfront shop, started by Polish immigrant Nathan Handwerker four years after he landed at Ellis Island, now hosts an annual hot dog eating contest that draws competitors from around the world. The founders of Sabrett and Hebrew National were Greek, German and Russian immigrants to Ellis Island and also started business in the early 1900s. For Gene-Christian Baca, whose great grandfather Walter founded Walter's Hot Dogs when he came through Ellis Island from Italy in 1919, the exhibit celebrates an important family legacy.   It is an overwhelming feeling,  Baca said.  Just to know the history behind it and to know what he went through and that he came here virtually with nothing from Italy as a three-year-old boy.

For many Poles,  The Chairman's Ear  accurately represents how their country is governed, with all real power in the hands of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, even though he holds no government post. Since the privately-funded show began to air on YouTube in January, some of its episodes have received up to 10 million clicks, compared to an average of six million viewers of the most popular TV program, a long-running family drama.  The Chairman's Ear  appears to resonate both with critics of Kaczynski, who accuse him of tilting Poland toward authoritarianism, and with supporters who warm to its portrayal of the  Chairman  as a cat-loving, slightly other-worldly bachelor who needs help using the phone and reheating dinner.  It's no secret that the (PiS) chairman is the true leader of the country and that the prime minister and president are subordinate to him,  said Robert Gorski, 46, the show's creator and lead actor.  Getting access to him is power.   Everybody whispers in his ear and he needs to decide whom to trust. Like any ruler, he is to some extent a tragic figure.  Arguably Poland's most polarizing politician since the end of communism in 1989, Kaczynski's nationalist, eurosceptic views have hardened since the death of his twin brother Lech, then Poland's president, in a plane crash over Russia in 2010.  The PiS government remains broadly popular 20 months after sweeping to power, despite concerns among liberal Poles and in the European Union about its conservative social policies and efforts to tighten control over state media and the judiciary. For many voters, Kaczynski, 68, represents Poland's best hope of protecting its traditional Catholic identity and national sovereignty in the face of globalization and EU pressures. Robert Gorski, 46, creator and lead actor of the show  The Chairman's Ear  during filming in Warsaw, Poland February 2, 2017. Karolina Grabowska/Ucho Prezesa/Handout via REUTERS Letting Off Steam  Some say  The Chairman's Ear  provides a healthy safety valve for Poles, allowing them to have a good laugh at themselves amid the serious challenges the country faces.  Every time when the atmosphere gets tense, people try to let off steam with laughter and jokes,  said Andrzej Mleczko, one of Poland's most popular cartoonists since the 1980s.      Slideshow (4 Images) Like many others, I wonder if these shows are true criticism of the government, or an intended or unintended effort to soften Kaczynski's image,  he added. The show - bought by the video streaming service ShowMax - doesn't pull its punches when it comes to mocking Kaczynski's scepticism toward the EU and his deep distrust of Germany. In one episode, ahead of a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Chairman's assistant - resembling Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak - pulls an EU flag out of a rubber boot to decorate the office. The assistant says he usually uses the flag to keep his feet warm while picking mushrooms in the forest. A globe showing a huge Poland surrounded by the oceans adorns the Chairman's desk - a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that Poland is indeed the whole world for Kaczynski. Merkel is only able to meet the Chairman after his formidable secretary grants her clearance.  The real Kaczynski appears to be taking the show in his stride.  It's good (people) are laughing, you need to laugh,  Kaczynski said in a radio interview.  And the fact that they are laughing at me? Well, you can say its my own fault.

This week's cyber attack hit targets from Ukraine to the United States and more than 60 other countries. Human error enables hacking of today's network setups. A shift to the cloud reduces that danger, but brings others.  The latest rogue software, a variant of something called Petya, locks computers and posts a message demanding $300 in bitcoins to recover the data. Like the WannaCry virus last month that hit National Health Service computers in the UK, among others, it gets into PCs using code known as Eternal Blue, which security experts believe was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency.  Monday's attack hit Ukraine's international airport, Russian oil group Rosneft, advertising giant WPP and FedEx's TNT Express unit, among others. Its spread may have been limited, though, because after WannaCry many firms patched software including older Microsoft operating systems.  The fact that this wasn't done earlier is a reminder that current IT architecture depends on people to maintain it. And people can let the bad guys in, too. Malevolent phishing emails abound. Though it was done in fun, the fact that the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Barclays – not to mention the head of the Bank of England – recently responded to prank emails purporting to be from colleagues underlines the human factor.  The cloud, comprising infrastructure managed by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft, ought to be immune from much of this. Protection should be cutting-edge, for example, and advanced detection tools should be in place. Software run in the cloud doesn't need users to update it. Data should be recoverable even if one copy is corrupted.  Yet there are new concerns, too. With today's hybrid system, cloud-based software can propagate Petya or other malicious agents rapidly. A cloud outage can affect far more users than a cyber attack, as customers of Amazon found out in March when part of the company's cloud went dark. Companies may need to hire multiple cloud-services providers to minimize this risk.  And of course cyber criminals and unfriendly state actors will simply set their sights higher. After all, holding the entire cloud to ransom sounds a lot more lucrative than targeting any number of individual computers.

The subscription will cost $5 per month. Currently, the NYT Cooking app offers unlimited free access to all recipes on the site. But with the introduction of the subscription, non-paying users will not be able to access a majority of the site's recipes and will lose access to any previously saved recipes, which will be moved behind a paywall, Amanda Rottier, product director for NYT Cooking, told Reuters. Newspapers have seen substantial declines in print advertising revenue as readers migrate to the web for content. To offset those losses, The New York Times and other newspapers are looking to leverage their digital presence. The New York Times last month reported first-quarter print revenue was down 17.9 percent, while digital advertising revenue was up 18.9 percent and digital subscribers also grew. The paywall is the latest of NYT Cooking's efforts to make money from the site, which was launched in 2014 and has about 10 million users per month. In May 2016, it partnered with Chef'd, a meal kit company, to create kits for selected NYT Cooking recipes. Rottier said the Chef'd partnership was meeting NYT Cooking's expectations, but she declined to discuss the number of meal kit purchases. New York Times subscribers will have full access to NYT Cooking for a limited time, though there is no timeline for when the subscriptions will be separated, Rottier said. One consultant said that a NYT Cooking subscription could be a tough sell to readers who are accustomed to free content.  The volume for food content on the web is very high and much of it is free,  said Merrill Brown, founder and principal at MMB Media, which has worked with clients such as NPR and The Washington Post. Rottier declined to comment on how many subscribers are expected in the initial launch. NYT Cooking subscribers will be able to use all of the site's recipe box tools, such as private notes and adding recipes from third parties. The site is exploring ways to integrate voice-activated devices such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, Rottier said.

The order accompanies the settlement of a federal class action lawsuit challenging one county's practice of detaining people who cannot afford a lawyer for as long as a year without formal charges and appointment of counsel, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center said in a statement. The settlement and court order require Scott, Neshoba, Newton and Leake counties to hire a chief public defender, a rarity in rural Mississippi, to ensure that defense lawyers no longer serve at judges' whims, the statement said. The chief public defender, not judges, would supervise all public defenders, the statement said. A spokeswoman for Attorney General Jim Hood, whose office handled the case, did not respond to a request for comment. The ACLU and MacArthur Center sued Scott County in 2014 on behalf of Josh Bassett and Octavious Burks, who were detained there for eight and 10 months, respectively, without being indicted or being appointed a lawyer. Unlike in federal courts and most other states, Mississippi places no limit on how long a person can be held in jail before prosecutors get an indictment. Obtaining an indictment in the four counties often takes up to a year, the statement said. The order, issued this week by U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate, mandates that the four counties, which make up  Mississippi's Eighth Circuit Court district, appoint public defenders at the time people are arrested. Mark Duncan, who was sued while district attorney for the four counties and is now a circuit judge, said by telephone that he was unaware of the settlement.

Interest rate cuts made in 2015 have done their job and the Bank of Canada needs to consider its options at its upcoming policy meeting as excess capacity is used up, Poloz said in a CNBC interview in Europe.                   That's a pretty solid signal that a July rate hike is very much on the table,  Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a research note.     Chances of a rate hike next month rose to 45 percent from 30 percent on Tuesday, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                 The market is clearing a path for him to hike, so that makes it in my opinion more likely he takes that window,  said Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins.     At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3030 to the greenback, or 76.75 U.S. cents, up 1.3 percent, its biggest advance since mid-March.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3198, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 16 at C$1.3010.     Adding to support for the loonie, prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, climbed to their highest in more than a week as buyers were encouraged by a small weekly decrease in U.S. production.               Strengthening of the loonie could pressure speculators to further reduce bearish bets on the currency, which had reached a record high in May.     Speculators have cut bearish bets on the loonie for a fourth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday.                  Conversations with market participants and business surveys are invaluable for the Bank of Canada's decision-making, Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson said in a speech that reiterated the hawkish sentiment that rate cuts had done their work.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across a flatter yield curve. The two-year notes            fell 10.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.039 percent, the first move above 1 percent in nearly 2-1/2 years, while the 10-year             declined 38 Canadian cents to yield 1.614 percent.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 7.1 basis points to a spread of -31.7 basis points, its narrowest since Nov. 10, as Canadian government bonds underperformed.

Energy stocks pushed higher, helped by rising oil prices, while grocery operator Empire Co Ltd added to the overall gains, jumping 10 percent to C$21.00 a share. The parent of the Sobeys grocery chain, which is in the midst of a turnaround effort, posted adjusted earnings that beat expectations and increased its dividend payout. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index ended up 74.36 points, or 0.49 percent, at 15,355.58.  We're starting to see a little bit of support  for the TSX after having underperformed U.S. indices so far this year, said Stan Wong, a portfolio manager at Scotia Wealth Management.  We could be seeing a bit of a catch up in the back half of the year  helped by energy and financial stocks as oil prices pick up and investors position for higher interest rates. The most influential movers on the day were the big financial stocks, which rose as investors increased their bets that the country's central bank may hike interest rates as soon as next month. Royal Bank of Canada gained 1 percent at C$95.06 and Bank of Montreal rose 1.4 percent to C$95.58. The financials group, which accounts for over a third of the index's weight, gained 0.9 percent overall. Interest rate cuts in 2015 have done their job and the Bank of Canada needs to consider its options as excess capacity is used up, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a CNBC interview from Europe. On the other side of the ledger, Gildan Activewear shares fell 3.4 percent to C$40.01 after one of its directors resigned to take up the chief operating officer role at Under Armour, and as CIBC downgraded the stock to  neutral  from  outperform.  Eldorado Gold Corp lost 5.9 percent to C$3.49 after revising downward its 2017 outlook for production from its Kisladag operations in Turkey, while larger gold miners also fell. The energy group climbed 0.8 percent, with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd up 1.8 percent at C$38.26, as oil prices hit their highest point in a week after a small weekly decrease in U.S. production. Eight of the index's 10 main groups were in positive territory, with advancers outnumbering decliners by a 2.8-to-1 ratio overall.

The ordinance would put payments for the city's municipal and laborers' pensions on a five-year ramp to reach actuarial levels that would make the retirement systems 90 percent funded by the end of 2058. The city has already put into place a tax on water and sewer usage and a telephone surcharge to fund the higher payments. Without the additional money, the two pension funds would become insolvent within 10 years. The mayor told reporters he decided to seek city action on pension payments to send a positive signal to credit ratings agencies and to ease city workers' possible concerns about their retirement security.      Emanuel said using this “home-rule” option offers a way to address the city’s pension problem given opposition from Governor Bruce Rauner.     “We are taking steps to wall ourselves economically and financially and fiscally off from Springfield - and specifically Governor Rauner’s chaos,” he said, referring to the state capital. The Republican governor vetoed a bill in March that would have mandated the payment plan in state law, saying it would lead to a city tax hike and that a fix for Chicago needed to be part of broader, statewide pension funding changes. Those cost-saving changes are a factor in Illinois' ongoing political impasse that has left the state without a complete budget for two years.  A second identical bill for Chicago was subsequently passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature but has not been sent to Rauner. Molly Poppe, a city spokeswoman, said the mayor still wants to codify the payment plan in Illinois law, and needs the state to enact a bill requiring higher pension contributions from some employees. Credit ratings for the nation's third-largest city have tumbled into the low investment grade to junk levels due largely to an unfunded pension liability that stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for its four retirement systems. S&P; Global Ratings, which rates Chicago BBB-plus, earlier this year called pension funding  critical  to the city's budget stability and said a delay in boosting pension contributions could lead to a downgrade.

Edward Pennings, a former senior managing director in State Street's London office, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, prosecutors said.

A second former executive, Richard Boomgaardt, who lives in Britain and was head of State Street's transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, is expected to plead guilty on July 12, according to court records. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions.

For me, the fact that these phone booths were being removed, I immediately thought about bringing them back and putting a different kind of story into them.

Omega plans to sell an undefined number of units, a blend of one common share and two preferred shares, at the offering, the person added. Omega's press representatives declined to comment. The company's IPO would be the first for any Brazilian power firm in four years, underscoring the extent to which the image of a sector long marred by erratic policy moves and a deep recession has changed in recent months.

The U.N. Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) confirms that a U.N. convoy was hit today traveling between Surman and Tripoli,  a statement from the mission said, adding there were no reports of casualties among U.N. staff. A member of parliament for Zawiya, Abdallah Alafi, said five male U.N. staff and two female staff had been held briefly and then released and would be transferred to Tripoli.  It was not clear why the convoy was hit and whether the staff had been detained or held for their own protection. A picture circulating on social media showed an unmarked white vehicle of the kind used by U.N. staff in Libya apparently immobilized on the edge of a road, with the front wheel casing badly damaged and shatter marks on two of the windows.   UNSMIL thanks the Government of National Accord, House of Representative Members from Zawiya and local authorities for their help in ensuring the safety of U.N. staff and is looking forward to their safe return to Tripoli,  the U.N. statement said.    Surman is just west of the city of Zawiya. A number of militias have a presence in the area and the road is often closed because of local disputes. Kidnappings are common.  UNSMIL along with most diplomatic missions evacuated from Tripoli to neighboring Tunisia in 2014 as rival factions battled for control of the Libyan capital. Since last year, when the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) arrived in Tripoli, the mission and U.N. agencies have gradually been increasing their presence in Libya with regular visits by international staff. Diplomatic staff have also been visiting more frequently, and the Italian and Turkish embassies reopened in Tripoli earlier this year. However, the security situation in and around capital remains fragile, with armed groups retaining the power that they have held since the NATO-backed uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The move came after ING earlier this month publicly disavowed Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's Trans Mountain expansion project, but did not name any other Canadian projects. While ING has a policy of not financing the extraction of oil sands globally, it had been unclear whether that included the Canadian pipelines. ING said it wanted to clarify its position after being targeted in June by activists who asked the bank to back away from Trans Mountain.  Processing oil sands is known to be energy intensive, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions,  the bank said in an undated statement this week on its website.  This is in addition to potential social impacts, such as on the local native tribes historically using the land.  The bank could not immediately confirm the precise date of this week's statement posted on its website. ING's decision comes after Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, sold investments in six companies in June that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, including TransCanada, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind. Building pipelines in North America has come under fierce opposition from aboriginal communities and environmental groups, who have put pressure on banks to stop financing such projects. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental organizations in June called on 28 major banks - including ING - to back away from Trans Mountain. Weeks later, Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Kinder Morgan Inc  of Houston, said it had raised C$5.5 billion ($4.16 billion) in credit, with the largest lenders being four of Canada's biggest banks.

On Wednesday, the Fed said all of the 34 banks had passed the second, tougher part of its annual stress test, showing that many of the biggest lenders have not only built up adequate capital levels but also improved their risk management procedures. One bank, Capital One Financial Corp, must resubmit its scheme by year-end, though the Fed is still allowing it to go forward with its capital plan in the meantime. Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is acting as regulatory lead for the U.S. central bank, said the process  has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and most to substantially improve their capital planning processes.  The banks' own plans on how they will use extra capital will not be known until they make their own announcements. The verdict marks a significant victory for the banking industry, which has worked for years to regain its stature following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The green light could also serve as a watershed moment for Wall Street, which is eager to get a lighter regulatory touch from policymakers in Washington. Capital One must resubmit plans because it did not appropriately account for risks in  one of its most material businesses,  the Fed said. The Fed did not specify which business. Capital One's most significant business is credit card lending. It has also built up a presence in auto lending. Both areas have been flagged by bankers and analysts as showing signs of weakness. Capital One has until year-end to deliver an improved submission, but the Fed gave it permission to move forward with its plan until then. Capital One had already resubmitted a plan with a reduced capital request since the first set of stress-test results was released last week. American Express Co had also resubmitted a plan with reduced requests, improving its capital ratios, and the Fed did not require it to resubmit again. Other big banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley also cleared the Fed's bar.

The ordinance would put payments for the city's municipal and laborers' pensions on a five-year ramp to reach actuarial levels that would make the retirement systems 90 percent funded by the end of 2058. The city has already put into place a tax on water and sewer usage and a telephone surcharge to fund the higher payments. Without the additional money, the two pension funds would become insolvent within 10 years. The mayor told reporters he decided to seek city action on pension payments to send a positive signal to credit ratings agencies and to ease city workers' possible concerns about their retirement security.      Emanuel said using this “home-rule” option offers a way to address the city’s pension problem given opposition from Governor Bruce Rauner.     “We are taking steps to wall ourselves economically and financially and fiscally off from Springfield - and specifically Governor Rauner’s chaos,” he said, referring to the state capital. The Republican governor vetoed a bill in March that would have mandated the payment plan in state law, saying it would lead to a city tax hike and that a fix for Chicago needed to be part of broader, statewide pension funding changes. Those cost-saving changes are a factor in Illinois' ongoing political impasse that has left the state without a complete budget for two years.  A second identical bill for Chicago was subsequently passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature but has not been sent to Rauner. Molly Poppe, a city spokeswoman, said the mayor still wants to codify the payment plan in Illinois law, and needs the state to enact a bill requiring higher pension contributions from some employees. Credit ratings for the nation's third-largest city have tumbled into the low investment grade to junk levels due largely to an unfunded pension liability that stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for its four retirement systems. S&P; Global Ratings, which rates Chicago BBB-plus, earlier this year called pension funding  critical  to the city's budget stability and said a delay in boosting pension contributions could lead to a downgrade.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain, at a hearing in San Juan, denied the proposal by the federal board in charge of managing Puerto Rico's finances, giving credence to concerns of some creditors that the board cannot be objective in certain investor disputes. Puerto Rico, battling more than $70 billion of debt and a decade of economic contraction, last month filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. A major clash in the case is between creditors of Puerto Rico's central government and creditors of its sales tax authority, COFINA. Together, they own about half the island's debt, and each side claims an ironclad right to repayment from Puerto Rico's sales tax revenue. The board had proposed appointing agents to advocate for each side in settlement talks, but the plan would have given the board a hand in selecting the agents. This riled COFINA holders who believe the board plans to side with GO creditors, and feared the COFINA agent would not be independent. Swain, in her bench ruling, raised similar concerns, in a nod to the board's delicate position. The board's job is to help Puerto Rico's government grow its economy and regain access to bond markets. Swain suggested a COFINA agent beholden to the board might not be able to advocate for the best possible recoveries for COFINA, if doing so could squeeze Puerto Rico's government long-term.  Maximizing the return for COFINA might get tied up in the notion that Puerto Rico needs to be healthy in years, and is not solely a question of grabbing everything that’s on the table,  Swain said, instructing sides to confer on a new approach. Separately at Wednesday's hearing, federal Judge Barbara Houser, who is leading a team of mediators in Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, set an initial meeting with the U.S. territory and its creditors for July 12 in New York. Houser, addressing the court at the opening of the hearing, said the meeting would be introductory, not substantive, and would be mandatory for all stakeholders. Houser said mediation could save time and money in the case. Professional fees in the massive bankruptcy are expected to reach the hundreds of millions of dollars.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-idUSL1N1JP0WT"},

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan on Wednesday said investors who bought the German bank's securities in the United States failed to specify how Deutsche Bank materially misled or intended to mislead them about its controls. Though the 158-page complaint offers  evidence that the bank's anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures were deficient at identifying the mirror trades, statements concerning the adequacy of the bank's internal controls are not actionable,  Torres wrote. The proposed class-action case was brought on behalf of Deutsche Bank investors, led by Andrei Sfiraiala, from Jan. 31, 2013 to July 26, 2016. Their lawyer Jeremy Lieberman said in an email that the investors intend to appeal, and that their claims  readily meet  the requirements to show securities law violations. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment. Torres' decision followed Deutsche Bank's Jan. 31 agreement to pay close to $630 million of fines to settle U.S. and British regulatory charges it allowed $10 billion of trades from 2011 to 2015 that could have evaded Russian controls. A  mirror trade  involves paired trades that can appear to serve no economic purpose, such as where a Russian customer buys a Russian security in rubles and a non-Russian customer sells the same security in U.S. dollars. Deutsche Bank curbed its activities in Russia after the suspicious trades were uncovered. January's settlement was part of Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan's bid to end a slew of litigation, following the global financial crisis, that has at times raised concern about whether the bank had enough capital. Cryan was among 12 current and former Deutsche Bank officials, including former co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain, named as defendants in the Manhattan lawsuit. Torres dismissed all claims against those officials.

The Nasdaq posted its best session since Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. presidential election. The benchmark S&P; had suffered its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks on Tuesday after a healthcare bill was delayed in the U.S. Senate. The healthcare legislation is the first major plank of President Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Investors may be reevaluating the impact of the Senate's delay on the market and Trump's agenda, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The market has had trouble really appreciating, but it has had even more trouble declining,  Meckler said.  It seems like any negative period is very quickly met with new buyers.   Interest rates are still very low and a lot of investors see little opportunity to invest anywhere but in stocks,  he added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.95 points, or 0.68 percent, to 21,454.61, the S&P; 500 gained 21.31 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,440.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 87.79 points, or 1.43 percent, to 6,234.41. The small-cap Russell 2000 ended up 1.6 percent. Financials were the best performing S&P; sector, rising 1.6 percent. Bank stocks including JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America helped boost the S&P; 500, both rising more than 2 percent. The interest rate-sensitive group was helped by an increase in yields for 10-year Treasuries and by a widening spread between shorter- and longer-dated U.S. bonds.  We have had the statements from various Fed officials that they are still on board with the tightening cycle and that has been a big driver for finance names,  said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The stocks were also rising ahead of stress test results expected from the Federal Reserve that could pave the way for the banks to return more capital to shareholders. Tech stocks gained 1.3 percent, surging back from their worst day in more than two weeks. The sector has led the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain this year, but has pulled back recently as some investors question whether the group is too expensive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced off its 50-day moving average. With second-quarter corporate earnings set to begin in earnest, investors are looking for results to support equity valuations. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15 times. In earnings news, General Mills shares rose 1.6 percent after the Cheerios cereal maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Staples shares rose 8.4 percent. The company will announce its sale to private equity firm Sycamore Partners, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The order accompanies the settlement of a federal class action lawsuit challenging one county's practice of detaining people who cannot afford a lawyer for as long as a year without formal charges and appointment of counsel, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center said in a statement. The settlement and court order require Scott, Neshoba, Newton and Leake counties to hire a chief public defender, a rarity in rural Mississippi, to ensure that defense lawyers no longer serve at judges' whims, the statement said. The chief public defender, not judges, would supervise all public defenders, the statement said. A spokeswoman for Attorney General Jim Hood, whose office handled the case, did not respond to a request for comment. The ACLU and MacArthur Center sued Scott County in 2014 on behalf of Josh Bassett and Octavious Burks, who were detained there for eight and 10 months, respectively, without being indicted or being appointed a lawyer. Unlike in federal courts and most other states, Mississippi places no limit on how long a person can be held in jail before prosecutors get an indictment. Obtaining an indictment in the four counties often takes up to a year, the statement said. The order, issued this week by U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate, mandates that the four counties, which make up Mississippi's Eighth Circuit Court district, appoint public defenders at the time people are arrested. Mark Duncan, who was sued while district attorney for the four counties and is now a circuit judge, said by telephone that he was unaware of the settlement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mississippi-settlement-idUSL1N1JP1SV"},

Flint switched its water supply in 2014, sparking a crisis that was linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease and at least 12 deaths, as well as exposure of residents to dangerously high lead levels. Since October 2015, the city has obtained its water from the Great Lakes Water Authority. But the Flint city council's refusal this week to approve a long-term agreement with the supplier, negotiated by the city's mayor, without proposing a reasonable alternative, will  cause an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health in Flint,  according to the lawsuit filed by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in U.S. District Court in Detroit. The state is asking the court to bar Flint from changing water sources and adopt the long-term agreement.  While disappointing that the state and federal government are now involved in making a decision we as city leaders should be making for Flint, I cannot say that I am surprised,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in a statement. She added that her plan was best option. Instead of approving the long-term agreement, the city council voted on Monday to extend until September its contract with the Great Lakes Water Authority, local media reports said. City Council President Kerry Nelson told the Detroit News the state's June 26 deadline was too rushed for council members, who needed more time to examine the deal. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and state officials on Wednesday called on the council to approve the mayor's deal.  The city is well on its way to a full recovery, and to hinder that progress now would be a major and costly setback for residents,  Snyder's spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said. The crisis erupted in 2015 after tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the industrial city of about 100,000, whose population is predominantly black. The city had started using the Flint River for water in 2014. Water to Flint from the Great Lakes Water Authority comes from Lake Huron. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint's drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators. Earlier this month, six current and former Michigan and Flint officials were criminally charged for their roles in the crisis.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/michigan-water-idUSL1N1JP14O"},

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Businesses penned a joint letter calling for lawmakers to adopt a budget for next year that would allow them to begin work on changing the tax code.       In our view, given the historic opportunity before Congress, no other reforms under consideration rise to the importance of pro-growth, comprehensive tax reform,  the letter states. The budget process hit a delay this week after conservative Republicans in the House continued to demand billions of dollars in cuts to the spending outline.     Passing a budget is vital to begin the process of rewriting the tax code because it permits a procedural maneuver that will allow Republicans to pass a tax bill without the support of Democrats. President Donald Trump has made tax reform a key goal for this year. Additionally, Congress has become bogged down in trying to repeal Obamacare, a process that was delayed again this week and has been blamed for the inability to move on to tax reform. The joint letter urged Congress not to let other fights, alluding to health care, prevent tax reform from being completed this year.

The degree of benefit was most surprising: a 17 percent reduction in risk of cardiac arrest (a life-threatening condition where the heart stops pumping) among the middle-aged population for whom health insurance was expanded,” lead author Dr. Eric C. Stecker from Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in Portland said by email. Health insurance plays a big role in how, and whether, people receive adequate healthcare, but it's not clear that better health insurance is associated with a lower risk of major bad health outcomes.  Stecker and his colleagues studied the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests before and after a rapid, community-wide expansion of health insurance coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Rates of uninsurance among middle-aged adults decreased by roughly half after implementation of the law, while rates of uninsurance remained steady and very low among the elderly, according to the report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.  From 2011-2012, before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, to 2014-2015, after its implementation, Medicaid coverage increased from 7 percent of the middle-aged population to 13.5 percent and direct-purchase insurance coverage rose from 8.2 percent to 10 percent. Employer-sponsored insurance rates in this group didn’t change. Among 45 to 64-year-olds, the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests fell by 17 percent after the expansion of health insurance. “Our study reinforces prior studies that have shown improvements in preventive care and a decrease in death rates after insurance was made available to people who had been uninsured,” Stecker said. “I can’t speak for OHSU, but my personal opinion is that lawmakers and voters should carefully consider the proposed healthcare legislation and understand that if it results in more people being uninsured, it may lead to more preventable deaths,” he said. “Both the House and Senate versions would, over time, significantly increase the number of Americans without health insurance.”  Sudden cardiac arrest is responsible for approximately 350,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, more than any individual disease, Stecker noted. “But it is hard to prevent because most people are not aware they are at risk. This pilot study showed that Medicaid expansion may reduce the number of cardiac arrests. Further research is needed to understand any other factors that could be involved.”  There are many important factors that contribute to cardiovascular health, he added. “Healthy diet, regular exercise and not smoking are critical in the long run. But that alone is not enough. It is also important to have access to health care to evaluate concerning symptoms, access preventive care and be able to afford the medications that have been proven to prevent death and improve overall wellbeing.”  Mary Fran Hazinski from Vanderbilt University School of Nursing in Nashville, Tennessee, told Reuters Health it’s important to note that Oregon’s significant decrease in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurred in a state that not only provided expanded Medicaid coverage, but also completed extensive healthcare payment and delivery innovation.  This included establishing patient-centered primary care “homes” (consistent primary care physicians) with “an integrated system of regional coordinated care organizations that were required to follow evidence-based guidelines and monitor quality of care and cost-effectiveness),” said Hazinski, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the new study.  Extrapolating from Stecker’s team’s results, Hazinski said, the elimination of healthcare coverage for 22 million people projected to result from the healthcare bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate would produce an estimated additional 3,740 deaths from OHCA annually. “Healthcare coverage, alone, is not a panacea,” she added. “However, expanded healthcare coverage can save lives when provided in a system that promotes best practices and carefully monitors quality and costs. Conversely, elimination of healthcare coverage is likely to result in lost lives as well as delayed healthcare and, therefore, increased cost of care.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/1f4U4k9 Journal of the American Heart Association, online June 28, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-obamacare-cardiac-arrest-idUSKBN19J2QL"},

The blanket 90-day ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - and a 120-day ban on all refugees was completely blocked by lower courts after Trump issued it on March 6, saying it was needed to prevent terrorism attacks.  On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled the bans could proceed, though only for foreigners with no  bona fide relationship  with an American entity or person, and it did not specify what that meant. The ruling left some in the Middle East wondering if they would be able to enter the United States.  It's a big disappointment for me,  said a 52-year-old Sudanese man in the capital Khartoum, who believed he would now be rejected for a visa to visit relatives in the United States. The man, who declined to be identified, said he wouldn't know the outcome until at least Sunday, when the U.S. Embassy opens again after a string of national holidays.  I've traveled to America before and I don't know why I'm prevented from traveling (now). I didn't violate American law during my previous visits,  he told Reuters.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain, at a hearing in San Juan, denied the proposal by the federal board in charge of managing Puerto Rico's finances, giving credence to concerns of some creditors that the board cannot be objective in certain investor disputes. Puerto Rico, battling more than $70 billion of debt and a decade of economic contraction, last month filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history.  A major clash in the case is between creditors of Puerto Rico's central government and creditors of its sales tax authority, COFINA. Together, they own about half the island's debt, and each side claims an ironclad right to repayment from Puerto Rico's sales tax revenue. The board had proposed appointing agents to advocate for each side in settlement talks, but the plan would have given the board a hand in selecting the agents.  This riled COFINA holders who believe the board plans to side with GO creditors, and feared the COFINA agent would not be independent.  Swain, in her bench ruling, raised similar concerns, in a nod to the board's delicate position. The board's job is to help Puerto Rico's government grow its economy and regain access to bond markets. Swain suggested a COFINA agent beholden to the board might not be able to advocate for the best possible recoveries for COFINA, if doing so could squeeze Puerto Rico's government long-term.      Maximizing the return for COFINA might get tied up in the notion that Puerto Rico needs to be healthy in [later] years, and is not solely a question of grabbing everything that’s on the table,  Swain said, instructing sides to confer on a new approach.  Separately at Wednesday's hearing, federal Judge Barbara Houser, who is leading a team of mediators in Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, set an initial meeting with the U.S. territory and its creditors for July 12 in New York.  Houser, addressing the court at the opening of the hearing, said the meeting would be introductory, not substantive, and would be mandatory for all stakeholders. Houser said mediation could save time and money in the case. Professional fees in the massive bankruptcy are expected to reach the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain, at a hearing in San Juan, denied the proposal by the federal board in charge of managing Puerto Rico's finances, giving credence to concerns of some creditors that the board cannot be objective in certain investor disputes. Puerto Rico, battling more than $70 billion of debt and a decade of economic contraction, last month filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history.  A major clash in the case is between creditors of Puerto Rico's central government and creditors of its sales tax authority, COFINA. Together, they own about half the island's debt, and each side claims an ironclad right to repayment from Puerto Rico's sales tax revenue. The board had proposed appointing agents to advocate for each side in settlement talks, but the plan would have given the board a hand in selecting the agents.  This riled COFINA holders who believe the board plans to side with GO creditors, and feared the COFINA agent would not be independent.  Swain, in her bench ruling, raised similar concerns, in a nod to the board's delicate position. The board's job is to help Puerto Rico's government grow its economy and regain access to bond markets. Swain suggested a COFINA agent beholden to the board might not be able to advocate for the best possible recoveries for COFINA, if doing so could squeeze Puerto Rico's government long-term.      Maximizing the return for COFINA might get tied up in the notion that Puerto Rico needs to be healthy in [later] years, and is not solely a question of grabbing everything that’s on the table,  Swain said, instructing sides to confer on a new approach.  Separately at Wednesday's hearing, federal Judge Barbara Houser, who is leading a team of mediators in Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, set an initial meeting with the U.S. territory and its creditors for July 12 in New York.  Houser, addressing the court at the opening of the hearing, said the meeting would be introductory, not substantive, and would be mandatory for all stakeholders. Houser said mediation could save time and money in the case. Professional fees in the massive bankruptcy are expected to reach the hundreds of millions of dollars.

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan on Wednesday said investors who bought the German bank's securities in the United States failed to specify how Deutsche Bank materially misled or intended to mislead them about its controls. Though the 158-page complaint offers  evidence that the bank's anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures were deficient at identifying the mirror trades, statements concerning the adequacy of the bank's internal controls are not actionable,  Torres wrote.

Their lawyer Jeremy Lieberman said in an email that the investors intend to appeal, and that their claims  readily meet  the requirements to show securities law violations. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment. Torres' decision followed Deutsche Bank's Jan. 31 agreement to pay close to $630 million of fines to settle U.S. and British regulatory charges it allowed $10 billion of trades from 2011 to 2015 that could have evaded Russian controls. A  mirror trade  involves paired trades that can appear to serve no economic purpose, such as where a Russian customer buys a Russian security in rubles and a non-Russian customer sells the same security in U.S. dollars.

Charles Banks, 49, had faced up to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in April to one count of wire fraud regarding an investment he urged Duncan to make in a firm called Gameday Entertainment, which Banks headed.  U.S. District Judge Fred Biery also ordered Banks pay $7.5 million to Duncan in restitution. San Antonio Spurs great Duncan, who is now retired, said in a statement he was afraid that without a strong sentence, financial advisers would feel they were free to prey on young, impressionable and suddenly wealthy athletes.  Judge Biery, you may not understand how difficult it is for me to be in the public light in this horrible way, as the poster child for a dumb athlete whose financial advisor took his money,  Duncan said in a statement read into the court record by prosecutors.   I hate it and am embarrassed by it more than you can imagine.  Several NBA players were in the courtroom to support Duncan, including former teammates Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.  After the hearing, Duncan told reporters he was satisfied with the sentence. In a brief statement before sentencing, Banks apologized to Duncan for  breaking his trust,  by tricking him into agreeing to make loans to a failing sports merchandise company headed by Banks.  According to court documents, Duncan's losses totaled $13.5 million in investments and loan guarantees made to Gameday, which went out of business this year. Prosecutors said much of that money went into Banks' pockets.Defense lawyers said in court in April that some of that money has been forgiven by the banks that provided the original loans. Banks is also the founder of Terroir Capital, a financial management fund that works in the wine and hospitality industry. Duncan retired at the end of last season after 19 seasons with the Spurs. The scam was discovered when Duncan's divorce lawyer consulted a financial planner to put together a property settlement for the basketball star's divorce, court documents said.

Flint switched its water supply in 2014, sparking a crisis that was linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease and at least 12 deaths, as well as exposure of residents to dangerously high lead levels. Since October 2015, the city has obtained its water from the Great Lakes Water Authority. But the Flint city council's refusal this week to approve a long-term agreement with the supplier, negotiated by the city's mayor, without proposing a reasonable alternative, will  cause an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health in Flint,  according to the lawsuit filed by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in U.S. District Court in Detroit. The state is asking the court to bar Flint from changing water sources and adopt the long-term agreement.  While disappointing that the state and federal government are now involved in making a decision we as city leaders should be making for Flint, I cannot say that I am surprised,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in a statement. She added that her plan was best option. Instead of approving the long-term agreement, the city council voted on Monday to extend until September its contract with the Great Lakes Water Authority, local media reports said. City Council President Kerry Nelson told the Detroit News the state's June 26 deadline was too rushed for council members, who needed more time to examine the deal.     Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and state officials on Wednesday called on the council to approve the mayor's deal.  The city is well on its way to a full recovery, and to hinder that progress now would be a major and costly setback for residents,  Snyder's spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said. The crisis erupted in 2015 after tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the industrial city of about 100,000, whose population is predominantly black.  The city had started using the Flint River for water in 2014. Water to Flint from the Great Lakes Water Authority comes from Lake Huron.  The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint's drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators. Earlier this month, six current and former Michigan and Flint officials were criminally charged for their roles in the crisis.

The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and a steelmaker.  No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,  said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Eternal Blue The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,  Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect.

MIKHAIL GOLUB via REUTERSBushiness that installed Microsoft's (MSFT.O) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (MSFT.O) security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said  a small number  of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's (CSCO.O) Talos and Symantec (SYMC.O) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc. Slideshow (11 Images)The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.  Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,  it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate (BNPP.PA), a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.  The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered  serious consequences  but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

Governor Stephen Poloz and Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson both said the worst is now behind Canada after the central bank's rate cuts two years ago helped the economy weather weak oil prices, suggesting it is now time to end the ultra-low interest rate environment.  It does look as though those cuts have done their job. But we're just approaching a new interest rate decision so I don't want to prejudge,  Poloz said in a European interview published by CNBC on Wednesday.  But certainly we need to be at least considering that whole situation now that the ... excess capacity is being used up steadily.  The bank will make an interest rate announcement July 12. Policymakers have shifted to a dramatically more hawkish tone in recent weeks, startling many analysts who had not expected a hike until 2018. Chances of a rate increase in July rose to 43 percent on Wednesday from 30 percent the day before , while the loonie surged to a four-month high after the Poloz comments. In a speech to financial analysts in Calgary, Patterson said intelligence gathered in conversations and surveys was playing an invaluable role in the bank's decision-making, adding that tools like the Business Outlook Survey, to be released Friday, gave the bank timely information that it cannot get elsewhere.  I can't emphasize enough how critical these real-time perspectives are to our overall understanding of economic developments, particularly during periods of heightened uncertainty,  she said. A strong Business Outlook Survey could be one reason for the bank's shift to a more hawkish stance, even as inflation data released last week showed the annual inflation rate was just 1.3 percent, well below the bank's 2 percent inflation target. While some analysts said the weak inflation data would stay the bank's hand in July, Patterson noted there were interesting divergences in inflation measures beyond the headline number.  Certainly recently we've seen some inflation below our two percent target,  she said in response to a question after the speech.  It's interesting, even in the last data we got last week, you are seeing quite a differentiation between services inflation and goods inflation.  CIBC Economist Nick Exarhos said service sector inflation is running closer to 2 percent to 2.5 percent.

Kaplinsky,Ballard Spahr,Don Hawthorne,Donald J. Trump,Elizabeth Warren,Kaplinksy,Richard Cordray,BC,FINREG,CFPB,TREASURY,REVAMP","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - There is much for critics of the U.S.  administrative state  to like about the Treasury Department’s case for curbing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The long-awaited study is short, however, on the kind of practical, political vision needed to reform an agency that the Trump administration appears to have grudgingly accepted as here to stay in one form or another. The U.S. Treasury’s report was seen as making a case that the CFPB has too much unchecked power. It proposes ways to peel back the bureau's authority by cutting its supervisory role, eliminating duplication with other agencies and ceding non-bank regulation to states.  The report sounds the political notes of the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda by charging the agency has abused its power, but it is short on tactics. Still, legislative experts said, the plan has a chance to spur Congress to move on smaller and more practical approaches. Treasury Plan Could  Chip Away  at Cfpb “Most of the these things have to be changed by legislation and it is going to run into resistance,” said Don Hawthorne from Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, who predicted that the plan to change the agency “will be less a headlong assault than a chipping away at its authority.” The blueprint the administration laid out for revamping the CFPB will require lawmakers to lend significant support. Democrats led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped establish the agency after its creation under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, will be strongly opposed. Even some Republicans may be skeptical about the political wisdom of taking on an agency that has recorded some high-profile wins against big banks and other financial services firms. Even legislators favoring the changes are likely to await resolution of a court challenge over the agency’s constitutionality before revamping the agency. Cfpb Could Face Budget Fight Among the potential paths for curbing the agency, the administration could try to curb the CFPB by fighting in Congress to take control of its budget and possibly move to dismiss its director, Richard Cordray.  “The budget is the only piece of the Treasury recommendation that is potentially viable,” said Alan S. Kaplinsky, who heads Ballard Spahr’s consumer finance practice. “Everything else requires a filibuster-proof majority.”  The agency is now funded independently by the Federal Reserve, although legislators could attempt during the overall budget process to challenge the funding.  Treasury Tries Consumer Spin  The agency's success in winning a settlement with Wells Fargo over the mass creation of phantom customer accounts helped give it ammunition against critics. But in Congress, the threat of sharp budget cutbacks could be used by Republicans as an opening bid to pressure Democrats to join a compromise plan to retool the agency’s structure. Government sources say that there is room to enact some bipartisan reforms, particularly in the unusual single-director governance of CFPB. Members of both parties are said to be supportive of a plan that would give Congress more oversight and create a board similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The document hints that the political support for a consumer finance overseer remains.  It critiqued the bureau with a vague charge that it “has hindered consumer choice and access to credit” by imposing too many rules on lenders. Both parties have questioned the strict mortgage lending standards the bureau has set down, arguing the standards have shut some credit-worthy borrowers out of the housing market. Criticisms of CFPB regulation on smaller banks and lenders has also been voiced by members of both parties.  However, the report appeared to recognize the difficulty of eliminating the consumer finance agency entirely, as much as some critics might wish to see it gone. The CFPB has “an important mission,” the Treasury report said, in “protecting consumers’ interests.” There was no revival of the campaign-trail vows President Donald Trump made to eliminate the agency.  Ending Non-Bank Oversight  Un-Levels  Field  The Treasury Department did take a strong swipe at one of the biggest powers of the CFPB in deciding to push for the elimination of its oversight of non-bank financial services firms, such as payday lenders, mortgage originators and debt collectors. The Treasury report said,  Supervision of non-banks should be returned to state regulators, who have proven experience in this field and an existing process for interstate regulatory cooperation.” That will win fans among those who want to trim back the federal government's administrative role, but banks will be less pleased, said Kaplinsky. Banks have seen the CFPB oversight of non-banks as  a way to level the playing field,” said Kaplinksy, since the agency imposed regulations on the growing non-bank sector.  Phh Case Argues Against Cfpb Powers  Many in the financial services industry would like to see the CFPB brought down a few notches, and the Treasury’s conclusion that the CFPB’s mandate is “unduly broad, ill-defined, and susceptible to abuse” will win support from bankers. But much of what remains of the Treasury study goes over the familiar ground of the legal challenge that mortgage lender PHH took when it sued the agency on constitutional grounds. The case involves what the plaintiffs see as an egregious overstep by the agency’s director, who overruled the agency staff, which had decided PHH should pay $6.4 million for alleged kickbacks on mortgage insurance. Cordray decided a far higher $109 million penalty was appropriate.  The Treasury report makes the same argument as PHH— that the CFPB’s power is unchecked by any board, and places excessive compliance burdens on banks. Its independent structure allows it to decide unilaterally what rules banks must follow and “its unaccountable structure and broad, unchecked regulatory power is unprecedented.” But the Treasury does not follow PHH's legal case to have the agency declared unconstitutional, and instead calls for reforms to curb its power. Cordray Could Again Be in Sights  The Trump administration remains committed to getting rid of the single directorship, and its present director. “Getting rid of Cordray would do much of what they want,” said Hawthorne. “It’s one of the most effective ways to slow down rule making and enforcement. Enforcement is based on who is running agencies. The tone is set at the top.” Broader curbs will have to wait, say analysts and experts. “It is becoming more likely that it will take the form of multiple smaller bills targeting relief for specific segments of the financial sector as opposed to a single, comprehensive bill,” said Fitch Ratings report.  In the bigger picture, the difficulty of waging a battle in Congress to eliminate a politically protected agency is unlikely to gain much backing or momentum at a time when the administration is struggling with every part of its agenda. “The Trump administration has bigger fish to fry,” said Kaplinksy. “In the great scheme this is really quite minor.  -- U.S. Treasury report:here -- Fitch ratings report:here (Richard Satran is a financial journalist covering daily and emerging issues for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.)

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said on Wednesday that the tighter inspection standards it enacted in April have resulted in checks on nearly every shipment from Brazil. The new Canadian protocols involve full inspection - including tests for pathogens and chemical residues - of all Brazilian meat imports on five consecutive shipments from each approved plant and for each product category, CFIA spokeswoman Maria Kubacki said.  Previously, CFIA conducted one full inspection randomly out of 10 consecutive shipments from each Brazilian plant.  The tougher reviews highlight concerns about the safety of Brazilian meat even among countries that still accept its products. The United States last week banned imports of fresh Brazilian beef after a high percentage of shipments failed safety checks.  Brazilian police raided the premises of global meatpacking companies JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) and BRF SA (BRFS3.SA) in March, as well as dozens of smaller rivals, over suspected bribery of health officials.. Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has re-inspected shipments of raw beef and ready-to-eat food products from Brazil and tested them for pathogens. All beef trimmings are now tested for salmonella and E. coli. The checks have uncovered problems in fresh beef, including abscesses, blood clots, bones and lymphoid tissue, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service Re-inspections at U.S. ports are directed by a centralized computer database that stores past inspection results from each foreign establishment. Better-performing foreign plants are subject to less frequent re-inspections, according to the USDA. To meet the stiffer inspection requirements from importers, Brazil has raised its own standards for meat exported from the country. Meat-processing plants in Brazil are now blocked from shipping the front part of a cow as a whole piece, and must instead process it into cuts, a step that makes it easier to detect defects but adds cost for packers, Luis Rangel, Brazil's plant and animal health secretary, said in an interview on Tuesday. “We had to raise the bar because of the United States, and ... you do not raise the bar for only one export market, you raise it for all of them,  Rangel said.  Processing costs will rise, but that is necessary to preserve the markets.  Enforcing the higher standards is complicated, however, by a shortage of inspectors in Brazil. In Europe, authorities now conduct physical checks of all animal-related shipments from Brazil, and perform laboratory tests on 20 percent of them, at the importers' cost, according to a document issued by the Council of the European Union on June 9. The EU requires Brazil to conduct microbiological checks on poultry and other meats before they are shipped.  Hong Kong has since March boosted surveillance on Brazil's meat and poultry, including sampling for meat deterioration and other food safety concerns, a spokesman for Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety said. As of June 23, a total of 369 samples were tested and all were satisfactory, he said.

The dollar also was weaker in the wake of a decision on Tuesday to delay a U.S. Senate vote on a bill to repeal and replace Democratic former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law. The euro extended the prior session's rally against the dollar, which had sent it to its strongest one-day percentage gain against the greenback in more than a year. Sterling also jumped after BoE Governor Mark Carney said the central bank is likely to need to raise interest rates as the British economy comes closer to operating at full capacity. Speaking at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, Carney said the BoE will debate that matter  in the coming months.  Carney's remarks convinced traders that European monetary policy was shifting in a more hawkish direction, analysts said, just a day after ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the central bank's stimulus policy, fuelling market expectations that the ECB will announce a reduction of stimulus as soon as September. Analysts said Draghi's comments continued to support the euro even as sources familiar with the ECB chief's thinking said Wednesday he intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening.  There is a bit of a concern in the markets about the fact that the balance of monetary policy expectations is moving a little bit in a more hawkish direction in Europe,  said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. The euro rose as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar to a one-year high of $1.1390 after jumping 1.4 percent on Tuesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell as much as 0.4 percent to hit a more than seven-month low of 95.967. The dollar inched lower against the yen after hitting a more than one-month high of 112.46 on Tuesday. The announcement on Tuesday that U.S. Senate Republican leaders had postponed a vote on the healthcare overhaul continued to fuel skepticism that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration would realise pro-growth infrastructure spending and tax cuts, hurting the dollar.

Charles Banks, 49, had faced up to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in April to one count of wire fraud regarding an investment he urged Duncan to make in a firm called Gameday Entertainment, which Banks headed.  U.S. District Judge Fred Biery also ordered Banks pay $7.5 million to Duncan in restitution. San Antonio Spurs great Duncan, who is now retired, said in a statement he was afraid that without a strong sentence, financial advisers would feel they were free to prey on young, impressionable and suddenly wealthy athletes.  Judge Biery, you may not understand how difficult it is for me to be in the public light in this horrible way, as the poster child for a dumb athlete whose financial advisor took his money,  Duncan said in a statement read into the court record by prosecutors.   I hate it and am embarrassed by it more than you can imagine.  Several NBA players were in the courtroom to support Duncan, including former teammates Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.  After the hearing, Duncan told reporters he was satisfied with the sentence. In a brief statement before sentencing, Banks apologized to Duncan for  breaking his trust,  by tricking him into agreeing to make loans to a failing sports merchandise company headed by Banks.  According to court documents, Duncan's losses totaled $13.5 million in investments and loan guarantees made to Gameday, which went out of business this year. Prosecutors said much of that money went into Banks' pockets.Defense lawyers said in court in April that some of that money has been forgiven by the banks that provided the original loans. Banks is also the founder of Terroir Capital, a financial management fund that works in the wine and hospitality industry. Duncan retired at the end of last season after 19 seasons with the Spurs. The scam was discovered when Duncan's divorce lawyer consulted a financial planner to put together a property settlement for the basketball star's divorce, court documents said.

The rate was well below the median forecast in a Reuters poll for 2.0 percent growth.  Economic activity in April was flat compared with March, Indec said. Latin America's No. 3 economy grew a cumulative 0.4 percent in the first four months of the year compared with the same period a year earlier, when Argentina was in the midst of a deep recession.  The government expects growth of around 3 percent this year, after a contraction of 2.2 percent in 2016. President Mauricio Macri has increased infrastructure spending and cut export taxes on the key farming sector to try to boost output, but a promised wave of foreign investment has been slow to arrive.  April's figure marked a deceleration from March, when economic activity grew 1.3 percent year-on-year - revised upwards from the 0.8 percent rate published last month - and 1.5 percent compared with February, revised downwards from the 1.9 percent rate published last month.  The construction sector, linked in part to public works, grew 8.4 percent year-on-year in April and agricultural output grew 4.6 percent. Industrial activity fell 1.9 percent, however, while retail and wholesale commerce declined 2.2 percent as 24 percent 12-month inflation ate into consumers' purchasing power. Indec also said on Wednesday that Argentina posted a $6.871 billion current account deficit in the first quarter of 2017,  larger than the current account deficits posted during each of the four quarters of 2016.

The most interesting thing is crude oil production was down ... which is a significant decline given the increases in previous weeks,  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said.

U.S. output during the week ended June 16 reached almost 9.4 million bpd, the most since August 2015.  Futures rose after the EIA's report, even though data showed a build instead of the 2.6 million-barrel draw that analysts had forecast in a Reuters poll.

Excluding items, the company earned 18 Canadian cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 12 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  We are seeing positive signs with increased tonnage for the first time in 17 quarters, stabilizing margins and disciplined cost containment,  Chief Executive Michael Medline said in a statement.  Having said that, we are not where we want to be and we are most certainly not out of the woods yet.  Empire also raised its quarterly dividend to C$0.42 per share from C$0.41 per share. Total sales declined 7.7 percent to C$5.80 billion in the quarter. Sobey's same-store sales excluding fuel fell 1.6 percent. Empire's shares were up 10.05 percent at C$21.02 in morning trading on Wednesday.

The dollar index slid as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said a debate on the need to raise interest rates is due  in the coming months,  adding to a hawkish tone out of the European Central Bank on Tuesday. Carney's remarks convinced traders that European monetary policy was shifting in a more hawkish direction, analysts said. The monetary policy comments out of Europe and Britain come as the U.S. Senate delayed a healthcare legislation vote, a move seen as pushing back the timeline for other items of President Donald Trump's agenda including a tax overhaul regarded as essential to support lofty stock valuations on Wall Street.  Prospects for infrastructure spending and tax reform are fading by the minute  after the delayed healthcare vote, said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. U.S. economic data released on Wednesday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in May, the third straight monthly decline, while mortgage applications fell the most in six months last week. U.S. stocks recovered most of their broad losses from the previous session, however. Bank stocks led the way, supported by a steeper Treasury yield curve . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 156.59 points, or 0.73 percent, to 21,467.25, the S&P; 500 gained 22.64 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,442.02 and the Nasdaq Composite added 86.74 points, or 1.41 percent, to 6,233.37. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.04 percent with gains in bank shares limiting the loss, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.67 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.31 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.17 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.47 percent. Analysts said comments by ECB President Mario Draghi on Tuesday, seen as hawkish, continued to support the euro even as sources said on Wednesday that he had intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not imminent policy tightening. “There is a bigger story here that has to do with the repricing in general of monetary policy expectations,” said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.  There is a bit of a concern in the markets about the fact that the balance of monetary policy expectations is moving a little bit in a more hawkish direction in Europe, and you've seen that with the BOE, you've seen that with the ECB.  The dollar index fell 0.38 percent, with the euro up 0.36 percent to $1.1378. Sterling rallied against the greenback off of Carney's comments and was last trading at $1.2927, up 0.88 percent on the day. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.10 percent versus the greenback at 112.27 per dollar. Oil futures climbed to their highest in more than a week despite a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories, as buyers were encouraged by a small weekly decrease in U.S. production. U.S. crude rose 1.11 percent to $44.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.54, up 1.32 percent on the day. The back end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve rose after Carney's comments. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.2191 percent, from 2.198 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 21/32 in price to yield 2.7743 percent, from 2.744 percent on Tuesday. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,249.43 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.23 percent to $1,249.80 an ounce. Copper rose 0.36 percent to $5,879.00 a tonne.

In its ruling, the court handed a partial victory to the protesters and said Germany's second-largest city - which argued that the permit request was not covered by the constitutional right to freedom of assembly - should revisit the issue. It said the protest camp should be allowed to the greatest extent possible, albeit with conditions aimed at preventing lasting damage to the park and the cost to public finances. The Hamburg higher regional court last week rejected a request by organizers to set up the camp, citing concerns about damage that overnight camping would cause to the park rather than security concerns. Protestors hold a banner in front of the townhall during a demonstration against the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany June 26, 2017.Fabian BimmerThe constitutional court did not completely rule out moving the camp to another location, or even a total ban based on security considerations, if that were invoked.  The question of whether or to what extent the protest camp could be limited due to public security, or perhaps banned completely, is not part of this ruling,  the court said. It was not immediately clear when the Hamburg court would revisit the matter. German courts continue to review other protest activities planned during the G20 summit, including a decision upheld on Wednesday that would require the relocation of an event where organizers expected 50,000 to 100,000 people on July 8.

His main rivals - an ageing Alberto Contador, a too-cautious Nairo Quintana and an unreliable Richie Porte - all seem short of the combination of ingredients needed to unsettle Froome's Team Sky machine, and Romain Bardet looks a little green to become France's first Tour champion since 1985. The route will suit the most aggressive riders. Only four mountain-top finishes mean the peloton's opportunists will look to launch long-range attacks and cause chaos - of the kind that Contador used to eliminate Froome in the 2016 Vuelta. Team Sky's conservative approach to the race might expose the Briton, who has not won a race this season and was bested by Porte in the time trial and the mountains during this month's Criterium du Dauphine.  Richie has been amazing this season. I think this year's Tour suits Richie really well,  Froome told Reuters. Porte was Froome's lieutenant at Sky from 2012-15 before leaving for American outfit BMC to become a team leader. The Australian, however, has a tendency to suffer bad days that can quickly become liabilities in the grand tours. Froome might wait for the punishing stage ending up the Col d'Izoard at 2,360 meters above sea level in the final week to kill off the opposition. But he showed last year that he was able to take the initiative by attacking in descents and on the flat. Early Offensive? Two early summit finishes suggest Froome's rivals will be on the offensive early on. The opening block of this year's race will end with a grueling mountain stage in the Alps with three out-of-category ascents climbed between Nantua and Chambery.

Having skipped the Giro d'Italia this season, the Spaniard has put all his eggs in the Tour basket. He has not won the Tour since 2009 and his attacks are not as sharp as they used to be, but Contador remains one of the three opponents Froome will be most wary of.  My biggest threats come from guys who did not do the Giro -- Richie Porte, Alberto Contador and Romain Bardet,  said Froome. Cycling - The 104th Tour de France cycling race - News conference ahead of the weekend's start - Duesseldorf, Germany - June 28, 2017 - Team Sky rider's Chris Froome of Britain during a presser.Christian HartmannQuintana, runner-up to the Briton in 2013 and 2015, does not rate a mention, having finished a disappointing second in the Giro.         The Colombian, who will ride in tandem with the in-form Alejandro Valverde of Spain, has tended to slip too easily into the role of play second fiddle to Froome, looking content to settle for a podium finish.  I would love to see Quintana win but he lacks the ability to attack,  said three-time Tour champion Greg LeMond. Other contenders include Italian Fabio Aru, Dane Jakob Fuglsang and Ireland's Dan Martin. But should Froome be spared the repeatedly denied allegations of doping that clouded his 2013 and 2015 rides, he could end up enjoying a relatively smooth passage to Paris. In the points classification, world champion Peter Sagan is expected to pick up a sixth straight green jersey, while France's Thibaut Pinot will target the king of the mountains' polka dot jersey. Sprinters will have several chances to shine and Briton Mark Cavendish, recently recovered from the Epstein-Barr virus that causes glandular fever, will hope to add to his 30 Tour stage wins as he looks to close in on Tour legend Eddy Merckx's all-time record of 34. The race starts in Germany on July 1 with a 14-km (8-mile) time trial in Duesseldorf, where local rider Tony Martin will be one of the favorites to claim the first yellow jersey. That would serve as a powerful symbol in a country that has shunned the race for many years in the wake of doping scandals and only resumed televising it in 2015.

I'd love to find great additions to the company. I think the important thing is that we look at companies that can make us better,  Duperreault told reporters in an interview after the company's annual general meeting in New York. To meet the objective, AIG would slow the pace and frequency of share buybacks, which have been part of the company's two-year turnaround plan launched last year by former CEO Peter Hancock. AIG's goals under the plan have included returning $25 billion of capital to investors by year-end. AIG, which has been the target of activist investors led by billionaire Carl Icahn, has returned $18.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks since announcing the plan.  The likelihood we can continue the pace of share buybacks is low because there are other things I can use the money on,  Duperreault said.  My job is to figure out what’s the best use of the capital and I want a balance,  Duperreault said. AIG named Duperreault, 70, as its CEO in May, selecting a protege of former CEO Hank Greenberg and an industry veteran known for his turnaround expertise. American International Group Inc.

Shareholders voted to award Hancock a total compensation of $9.58 million, including a $1.6 million base salary, longer-term incentive pay in stock worth more than $7.8 million and additional funds.

AIG, the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty policies, reported a better-than-expected first-quarter operating profit in May, helped by investment returns and cost cuts. Duperreault plans to look for acquisitions and business opportunities that would boost AIG's underwriting strengths and revenues, he said. While some of AIG's businesses have potential to increase, there is less chance of growth in AIG's commercial business, Duperreault said.  The so-called  middle market,  or medium-sized companies, could provide some opportunities, Duperreault said.

A full list of the actions taken is detailed at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS- IDRS, VR, NATIONAL RATINGS The RWN reflects the potential risks that Original could face over the short- and medium-term, as a result of recent and upcoming developments regarding the ongoing investigations of its related parties, which could have material negative implications for Original, although Fitch acknowledges this has not happened so far. These possibilities could put pressure on the bank's liquidity over the next few months and gradually increase its debt-refinancing risk, which continues to be well managed as of today. While not immediately impacted, continued negative developments from the investigations at its affiliates could also lead to gradual pressure on the bank's company profile and business model. The RWN also highlights downside risks in the event of Original being involved in the aforementioned investigations, although the bank has not been officially notified of any misconduct or wrongdoing thus far. Despite Original's sound and tested asset-liability management, currently strong cash position and relative operational independence from the group's activities, Fitch believes that the events surrounding its related parties could potentially hamper its ability to execute its strategic plans and meet its previously stated business goals, the cornerstone of which is the ramp-up of its digital retail franchise. Original is ultimately wholly owned by a holding company named J&F; Investimentos S.A., which also controls its shareholders' other companies, including JBS S.A. (JBS; Long-Term IDR 'BB'/RWN). Last month, it was disclosed that some of JBS's executives had signed a plea bargain with the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, which included admitting payments of bribes to various politicians. Fitch reiterates that Original's liquidity so far has remained stable and has been adequately managed. The short-term profile of its loan portfolio, the relatively low proportion of funding with daily liquidity clauses (less than 10%), and the diversified retail portion of Original's funding distribution agreements (covered by FGC) have been critical and sufficient, so far, to ease potential pressures on Original's financial profile. However, concentration per broker/distributor remains high, which could add vulnerability to Original's refinancing ability, if part of these distributors decides to reduce their exposure to Original, or even cancel the ongoing agreements. The top-5 largest investors (all agreements with local securities companies, which, in turn, distribute Original's funding instruments), represented roughly 57% of the bank's funding base as of December 2016. Fitch also expects the bank's strategy execution to be further tested in the future. It is likely that funding costs will gradually increase and revenue generation could be hurt, as lending activity should also be cautiously managed until there is a clearer view of its funding stability. So far, there has been no major reputational impact of the affiliates' events on Original's retail brand. Yet, Fitch understands that the bank could still become increasingly exposed to the developments of the investigations. Should investor confidence worsen, the bank's implementation of its initial business goals and achieving breakeven in 2019 would likely be delayed. These additional challenges arose in a moment when the bank was still aiming to further consolidate its overall franchise, and improve profitability, which remains weak due to its significant investments in the digital banking segment. As of December 2016, the bank's operating loss amounted to BRL331.4 million or -3.6% of its Risk Weighted Assets (positive 1.1% in 2015), while its relative capital cushion has continued declining on the back of sustained growth and weak performance, although still remains adequate, in Fitch's view. Support Rating and Support Rating Floor Original's SR and SRF were affirmed at '5' and 'NF', respectively, in view of the bank's low systemic importance. In Fitch's view, external support cannot be relied upon. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VR AND NATIONAL RATINGS Original's ratings could be downgraded if the current negative pressures surrounding its business and financial profile drive a significant weakening of the bank's liquidity and funding profile, refinancing risk is increases materially very soon, or its profitability and capital adequacy metrics further weaken substantially. The direct involvement of the bank in the scope of the ongoing investigations may also result in a downgrade, a scenario in which the rating downside potential could eventually be multi-notch. The ratings could be affirmed and removed from RWN in the following months if Fitch is comfortable that refinancing risks are considerably reduced and that any potentially negative implications arising from the investigations on its related parties are comfortably absorbed without material negative implications for Original. In such a scenario, the resulting Rating Outlook will depend on Fitch's assessment of the medium-term prospects for the bank's business and financial profile. SR and SRF A potential upgrade of Original's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor is unlikely in the foreseeable future, since this would arise from a material gain in systemic importance. Fitch has placed the following ratings on Rating Watch Negative: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs 'B+'; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs 'B'; --Viability Rating 'b+'; --National Long-Term Rating 'BBB+(bra)'; --National Short-Term Rating 'F2(bra)'. The following ratings were affirmed: --Support Rating at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'.

The ASN considers that there are sufficient safety margins in order to start up the reactor,  ASN Director Pierre-Franck Chevet told reporters on Wednesday.  Following the discovery of carbon concentrations in the Areva-made base and cover of the Flamanville reactor late 2014, ASN had ordered EDF   and reactor maker Areva   to do extensive testing of the reactor's steel and has reviewed the results of these tests in the first half of this year.  The stakes were high for EDF and Areva because it would have cost billions of euros and taken years to repair the vessel if ASN had ruled that the flawed steel would prevent a start-up of the reactor. The ASN's green light for Flamanville, slated for start-up in late 2018, is also a European Commission precondition for approving EDF's planned takeover of Areva's reactor business. The conclusions of the ASN's report, reported by Reuters on Friday, state that the base of the reactor can operate safely over its expected 60-year lifetime given extra monitoring.  But its cover, which has numerous perforations for control rods and instrumentation, could not be tested adequately and unless EDF can devise new tests that will show the reliability of the cover's steel, it will have to replace it by 2024 latest, ASN ruled, going further than the report's advice. New Tests In a call with reporters, the head of EDF's Flamanville 3 project Laurent Thieffry said the utility would comply with the ASN's ruling and would give itself two years to try and come up with new tests.  It also confirmed, as reported by Reuters on Monday, that it had already ordered a new cover which would be forged by Japan Steel Works , not by Areva foundry Creusot Forge, which manufactured the flawed current cover and base.  Thieffry said replacing the cover would take up to nine months and would cost about 100 million euros.  ASN's Chevet said the problems with the Flamanville cover could also impact other European Pressurised Reactors (EPR), notably two EPRs under construction in Taishan, China, whose base and covers have also been manufactured by Creusot Forge.  Chevet said representatives of Chinese utility CGN and its regulator had been present during the discussion of the report by a group of experts on Monday and Tuesday.  EDF's Thieffry said the Chinese would benefit from the French investigation into the reactor's steel, but that it would be up to CGN to decide what course of action to take.  A fourth EPR under construction in Finland is not affected as its reactor vessel components have all been forged in Japan.  EDF plans to build two of the same Areva-designed European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) models in Hinkley Point, Britain. Greenpeace called on energy and environment minister Nicolas Hulot to halt the Flamanville construction.  The ASN is no longer able to decide on safety in all independence and cannot resist industry pressure, simply because the survival of the entire French nuclear industry is at stake with the approval of this reactor vessel,  Greenpeace said.

I'd love to find great additions to the company. I think the important thing is that we look at companies that can make us better,  Duperreault told reporters in an interview after the company's annual general meeting in New York. To meet the objective, AIG would slow the pace and frequency of share buybacks, which have been part of the company's two-year turnaround plan launched last year by former CEO Peter Hancock. AIG's goals under the plan have included returning $25 billion of capital to investors by year-end. AIG, which has been the target of activist investors led by billionaire Carl Icahn, has returned $18.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks since announcing the plan.  The likelihood we can continue the pace of share buybacks is low because there are other things I can use the money on,  Duperreault said.  My job is to figure out what’s the best use of the capital and I want a balance,  Duperreault said. AIG named Duperreault, 70, as its CEO in May, selecting a protege of former CEO Hank Greenberg and an industry veteran known for his turnaround expertise. American International Group Inc.

Shareholders voted to award Hancock a total compensation of $9.58 million, including a $1.6 million base salary, longer-term incentive pay in stock worth more than $7.8 million and additional funds.

AIG, the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial property and casualty policies, reported a better-than-expected first-quarter operating profit in May, helped by investment returns and cost cuts. Duperreault plans to look for acquisitions and business opportunities that would boost AIG's underwriting strengths and revenues, he said. While some of AIG's businesses have potential to increase, there is less chance of growth in AIG's commercial business, Duperreault said.  The so-called  middle market,  or medium-sized companies, could provide some opportunities, Duperreault said.

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said investors who bought the German bank's securities in the United States failed to specify how Deutsche Bank materially misled or intended to mislead them about its controls. Though the 158-page complaint, which sought class-action status, offers  evidence that the bank's anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures were deficient at identifying the mirror trades, statements concerning the adequacy of the bank's internal controls are not actionable,  Torres wrote. Jeremy Lieberman, a lawyer for Deutsche Bank investors from Jan. 31, 2013 to July 26, 2016 led by Andrei Sfiraiala, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment. Torres' decision followed Deutsche Bank's Jan. 31 agreement to pay close to $630 million of fines to settle U.S. and British regulatory charges it allowed $10 billion of trades from 2011 to 2015 that could have evaded Russian controls. A  mirror trade  involves paired trades that can appear to serve no economic purpose, such as where a Russian customer buys a Russian security in rubles and a non-Russian customer sells the same security in U.S. dollars. Deutsche Bank curbed its activities in Russia after the suspicious trades were uncovered. January's settlement was part of Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan's bid to end a slew of litigation, following the global financial crisis, that has at times raised concern about whether the bank had enough capital. Cryan was among 12 current and former Deutsche Bank officials, including former co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain, named as defendants in the Manhattan lawsuit.

They said discounts in deferred months to this week's expected cash prices contributed to market advances.     June        , which will expire on Friday, closed 0.650 cent per pound higher at 120.250 cents. Most actively traded August         ended 0.600 cent higher at 115.625 cents.     A small number of animals at Wednesday morning's Fed Cattle Exchange brought $119 to $120 per cwt, down from $123 a week ago.     Last week market-ready, or cash, cattle in the U.S. Plains brought $118 to $123 per cwt.     Some processors will keep reining in cash spending given the seasonal slump in beef demand and plant closures during the U.S. Independence Day holiday, said traders.                  They said phenomenal packer profits, and fewer cattle for sale than last week, might underpin cash prices in parts of the Plains.                  The weaker dollar, which typically makes U.S. goods more attractive to foreign buyers, provided additional market support.     Recent market volatility might carry over into Thursday as  investors adjust positions ahead of the holiday and end of the quarter, said traders and analysts.     Short-covering, technical buying and subsequent live cattle futures' advances rallied CME feeder cattle from session lows.     August feeders         ended 1.525 cents per pound higher at 146.400 cents.          HOGS CLOSE HIGHER       CME lean hog futures' discounts to the exchange's hog index for June 26 at 91.10 cents attracted buyers, said traders.     Market participants also tweaked positions before Thursday's U.S. Department of Agriculture quarterly hog report.                  Pre-report positioning capped back-month advances but boosted July futures to a new high.      July         ended 1.450 cents per pound higher at 87.925 cents, and hit a fresh high of 88.000 cents. August         finished 0.925 cent lower at 79.475 cents.     Packers cut cash hog bids with a few plants giving employees the day off on Monday prior to Tuesday's holiday, when most facilities will be closed, said traders and analysts.                  They said retailers bought pork to round out Fourth of July  grilling inventories and to offset potential meat shortages due to holiday plant shutdowns.                  Current hog supplies are plentiful as farmers rush pigs to market as cash prices decline, a trader said. But the return of hot summer weather could slow animal weight gains, which makes hogs less available to processors, he said.

Bonds weakened and the euro gained after Draghi indicated the ECB might tweak its stimulus so that it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers.                  Reports on Wednesday said, however, that Draghi intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening, according to sources familiar with his thinking.                              “The big trigger of action this morning has been the walk back of Draghi’s more hawkish comments yesterday,” said Guy Le Bas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.     Bonds pared price losses after the ECB reports, before weakening again after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that a rise in British interest rates is likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity.                  “They are talking about tightening sooner or later so that definitely got the market’s attention,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasuries trading at Credit Agricole in New York.     Benchmark 10-year notes             fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.22 percent, up from 2.20 percent late on Tuesday. The yields rose as high as 2.256 before the ECB reports.     Bond yields rose even as markets approached month-end rebalancing, which typically increases demand for Treasuries.     “The index extension is kind of small so I think that’s one reason why the market hasn’t been trading as well as it normally might do in the week of a month-end,” said Mulholland.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                steepened to 95.8 basis points after falling to 91.9 basis points overnight, the lowest since late 2007.     The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve officials indicated that further monetary policy tightening was likely even as inflation falls below targets.     The Treasury Department on Wednesday sold $28 billion in seven-year notes to moderate demand, in the final sale in $88 billion of new coupon-bearing supply this week.     The notes sold at a high yield of 2.056 percent, just above where the debt had traded before the auction.                     )","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-bonds-idUSL1N1JP1IO"},

The Fed raised its benchmark interest rates to a range between 1 and 1.25 percent, the third consecutive quarterly increase, and the central bank has signaled one more rate hike  this year.      Investors are moving into bonds despite rising interest rates in part because of demographic shifts that now favor stable income streams, said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, which has $40.2 billion in assets under management.       Typically you don't fight the Fed when it starts raising rates, but there's a big demographic push toward older savers that is fooling a lot of traditional cyclical investors,  he said.      The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to almost 10-year lows on June 21st, with the yield of the 30-year bond falling to 2.72 percent, the lowest since Nov. 9.      Stock funds pulled in $684 million in the week, the smallest positive gain since July 2016 and a steep decline from the $27.3 billion in inflows the week before.      Investors pulled about $7.9 billion from U.S.-focused stock funds, while moving about $8.6 billion into international funds.

Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci met in the Swiss Alpine resort of Crans-Montana, joined by senior U.N. and European Union officials and the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey. U.N. mediator Espen Barth Eide said the best outcome in talks tentatively scheduled to last until July 7 would be a comprehensive agreement, which would be hard but not impossible to attain. “If we take our time and we focus on the essentials, it’s not beyond reach, it could happen,” Eide told reporters.  The second-best outcome would be a breakthrough on key issues, confirming a shared intent to reunify the island but requiring more talks in Cyprus to wrap up a final agreement.  “If we don’t have either of those I don’t think we can talk of a success in Crans-Montana, so this is what we are working towards.” Any deal would be put to a referendum in both Cypriot communities simultaneously some time later this year. Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974, triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Turkey supports a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in northern Cyprus.   Going the Final Mile  A woman holds a placard during a demonstration in favour of a peace settlement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on divided Cyprus, at Ledra's checkpoint of the UN-patrolled  green line  in Nicosia, Cyprus June 28, 2017.Yiannis Kourtoglou At the end of the day, of course, it is the responsibility of the conference participants to go that final mile, to think outside of the box, to try out some new ideas so we can go down from this beautiful Swiss mountain with a plan,  Eide said. Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. Under-Secretary for Political Affairs, said he had been pleasantly surprised by the positive start to the talks, which began on the complex and divisive issue of security.   What we heard this morning gave us the hope and the conviction that the leaders and the three guarantors have come to this conference with the determination to overcome challenges and resolve the issues,  Feltman said. Slideshow (21 Images)The talks involve three guarantor states, Greece, Turkey and Britain. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Europe Minister Alan Duncan left by helicopter before the talks had officially opened to head home for a parliamentary session.  UK support for a settlement of the Cyprus issue remains steadfast and the UK will continue to be represented during the Conference on Cyprus in Switzerland,  a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias and Turkey's Mevlut Cavusoglu stayed on. The United Nations is seeking a peace deal which would unite Cyprus under a federal umbrella and which could also define the future of Europe's relations with Turkey, a key player in the conflict. Two issues are especially vexing: Turkish Cypriot demands for a rotating presidency, and Greek Cypriot demands that Turkey withdraws all of its 30,000 troops from the island and renounces its intervention rights. In a statement, the group  Unite Cyprus Now  welcomed the summit  in what we fear could be the last chance to reunite our island .

The benchmark S&P; had suffered its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks on Tuesday after a healthcare bill was delayed in the U.S. Senate. The healthcare legislation is the first major plank of President Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Investors may be reevaluating their assessment of the impact of the Senate's delay on the market and Trump's agenda, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The market has had trouble really appreciating, but it has had even more trouble declining,  Meckler said.  It seems like any negative period is very quickly met with new buyers.   Interest rates are still very low and a lot of investors see little opportunity to invest anywhere but in stocks,  he added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 142.36 points, or 0.67 percent, to 21,453.02, the S&P; 500 gained 20.47 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,439.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 71.94 points, or 1.17 percent, to 6,218.56. Financials were the best performing sector, rising 1.5 percent. Bank stocks including JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America helped boost the S&P; 500, both rising more than 2 percent. The interest rate-sensitive group was helped by an increase in yields for 10-year Treasuries and by a widening spread between shorter- and longer-dated U.S. bonds. The stocks were also rising ahead of stress test results expected later in the day from the Federal Reserve that could pave the way for the banks to return more capital to shareholders. Tech stocks gained 1 percent, bouncing back from their worst day in more than two weeks. The sector has led the S&P; 500's 9 percent gain this year, but has pulled back recently as some investors question whether the group is too expensive. The Nasdaq was posting its second-best day of the month, as the tech-heavy index bounced off its 50-day moving average. With second-quarter corporate earnings set to begin in earnest, investors are looking for results to support equity valuations. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15 times. In earnings news, General Mills shares rose 2.1 percent after the Cheerios cereal maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.48-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Such a joint session of parliament is known as a Congress and takes place at Versailles, the sumptuous palace of France's former monarchy built outside Paris by Louis XIV - the 'Sun King' - to symbolize absolute power. Macron's aides say he wants to set the tone and the direction of his five-year mandate in a ceremony that befits the office of the president.  His rivals said the 39-year-old was  Americanising  the role of president.  It is Emmanuel Macron's role to explain the world we live in, what the nation's challenges are at the onset of the 21st century, and how our institutions work,  a source close to Macron said.  Former conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy addressed a Congress at the 17th-century palace in 2009, at the height of the global financial and banking crisis. Sarkozy's successor, Francois Hollande, did the same in November 2015 after militant Islamists attacked Paris, declaring France  is at war .   Macron has said he wants to embody a  Jupiterian  vision of the presidency - whereby the president, very much like the Roman god of gods, speaks rarely except to issue orders. He has strived to be seen as above daily politics, leaving the running of parliament to his prime minister.

{"news_time":"2017-06-28 14:54:00","news_title":"Stunning drop in federal plaintiffs’ win rate is complete mystery – new study","keywords":"United States,Alexandra Lahav,Peter Siegelman,US,OTC,MYSTERY","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - A genuine mystery has been hiding in 30 years of data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, according to a newly released draft study by University of Connecticut law professors Alexandra Lahav and Peter Siegelman. According to the law profs, the winning rate for plaintiffs in civil litigation in federal courts declined drastically and steadily between 1985 and 1995, from about 70 percent to 30 percent.  Win rates recovered a bit in the late 1990s before dipping again, though not as consistently or precipitously. In 2009, plaintiffs prevailed in only 35 percent of the civil cases in federal court that ended in any kind of judicial determination, including dismissal, summary judgment, default judgment or judgment after a jury verdict. That 2009 rate, according to Lahav and Siegelman, is a drop of more than 50 percent from plaintiffs’ success rate in 1985. If plaintiffs had continued to prevail at 1985 rates across the 24 years the professors evaluated, they would have won 377,000 more cases than they actually did.  So what accounts for a drop Lahav and Siegelman call “astonishing”? That’s the mystery: As the professors explain in the paper, entitled “The Curious Incident of the Falling Win Rate,” there’s no single, testable explanation for the dramatic decrease in favorable outcomes for plaintiffs. And that itself is a reason to worry about what the change means.  “A significant puzzle remains unsolved,” the professors wrote. “We are not arguing that the win rate is ‘too high’ or ‘too low.’ Instead, we are pointing out that something or things caused the win rate to change, and depending on the nature of that cause or causes, we may have grounds for concern. If, for example, the changing win rate is caused by exogenous changes such as new, more restrictive laws or procedures, the change itself would not be a cause for concern, although one might question its normative desirability. If judges suddenly became more defendant-friendly, we might think about the falling win rate quite differently.”  Lahav and Siegelman considered and rejected (with far more quantitative literacy than I possess) some obvious and not-so-obvious possible explanations for the drop in plaintiffs’ win rate. It’s almost certainly not a clerical quirk, for instance, or a shift in the kinds of cases that plaintiffs have filed in the past 30 years. Win rates have declined across almost the entire spectrum of federal civil litigation, the professors found, and no single category of litigation can account for a shift discerned from millions of case outcomes. Even Social Security claims, in which plaintiffs experienced a win rate decline of more than 35 percent between 1985 and 2009, account for only 7 percent of the cases in the data set.  Are plaintiffs' lawyers filing a higher volume of dud cases? Lahav and Siegelman think not, though their explanation is more intuitive than quantitative. “We find that story unconvincing, for several reasons,” the professors wrote. “First, it begs the question of why plaintiffs or their lawyers would suddenly start bringing worse cases in 1985, continue doing so for 30 of the next 40 calendar quarters, and then abruptly decide to stop,” the paper said. “Second, it is far from clear as a matter of theory that a fall in the average quality of filed cases would lead to a drop in the win rate: Some or all of those new low-quality cases might settle out, leaving the ultimate win rate unchanged.”  The professors similarly cast doubt on the hypothesis that defendants are successfully contesting more cases. “What change in the background rules or culture could explain such a change in strategy? We are unaware of any change in the law on the books, or in other factors such as litigation costs, that might predict such a large and consistent decline,” they wrote. Moreover, the adjudication rate has actually fallen since 1980, suggesting that defendants are actually more likely to settle than to fight.  As you’ve probably realized, the elephant in the room (or, in this case, the study) is judicial attitudes. Lahav and Siegelman describe previous legal scholarship identifying “an increasingly hostile view of litigation that began to be seen in judicial decisions in the late 1970s, as well as greater emphasis in the federal courts on settlement.” It’s possible, their paper said, that in the critical time frame of 1985 to 1995 judges were more skeptical of plaintiffs’ claims and more likely to enter judgments for defendants.  In an interview Wednesday, Lahav and Siegelman emphasized the difficulty of measuring the impact – or even proving the existence – of changing judicial attitudes. For that reason, both of the professors said, they are extremely wary of inferring system judicial bias against plaintiffs' claims. “I’m an academic, I don’t like to speculate,” Siegelman said.  Nevertheless, the professors said, it’s worrisome that no other explanation accounts for the marked decline in plaintiffs’ win rates. As Siegelman, the team’s quantitative expert, explained, if systemic developments were occurring randomly, you’d expect some to favor plaintiffs and others to favor defendants. But the data indicate changes in case outcome all point in the same direction – against plaintiffs. That outcome, Siegelman said, is akin to flipping a coin and always coming up heads.  “The thread that runs through is general hostility toward plaintiffs’ claims,” Lahav said. “There could be a lot of drivers, but all of these things seem to be part of theme.”  Lahav and Siegelman said they’d like to come up with a way to quantify any change in judicial attitudes but need additional data from the U.S. courts to do it. The federal court system does not release judge-by-judge case outcome information, the researchers said. That’s an understandable decision, since practicing lawyers would surely use such data to try to steer cases toward particular judges. Lahav and Siegelman said the courts could, however, come up with ways to make data accessible to academics without exposing it to practitioners.  “What our results show is that there’s a need to study the court system to understand what happens in the aggregate,” Lahav said. “There are systemic things going on.”  The professor have not yet submitted their paper to law journals for publication.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-mystery-idUSKBN19J2MB"},

The train struck a tunnel wall and derailed in Harlem because a replacement rail stored on the tracks was not properly bolted down, according to a preliminary investigation by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).  Two supervisors who were responsible for oversight of the work have been suspended without pay pending a formal review process (and final outcome of the investigation),  MTA spokeswoman Beth DeFalco said in a statement. The MTA has said that storing equipment between tracks is often employed by railroads because it can make repairs quicker. Tuesday's crash forced the evacuation of passengers from dark, smoke-filled train carriages. Thirty-four people suffered minor injuries.  Transit inspectors are now checking  every inch of rail to ensure that each and every replacement part is properly stored and secured,  the MTA said.  The cause appears to be human error, not a track defect.

In 2014, the European Union's highest court overthrew a rule that required telecoms companies to store the communications data of EU citizens for up to two years on the grounds it infringed human rights. In 2010, Germany's Constitutional Court blocked a law requiring storage of all data for six months. Privacy is a particularly sensitive issue in Germany because of the surveillance by the Gestapo in the Nazi era and by communist East Germany's Stasi secret police. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about widespread espionage in Germany by the United States caused outrage. German telecoms company Deutsche Telekom welcomed the suspension of the new law.  There must be legal certainty for such a sensitive infringement of the right to privacy,  Telekom board member Thomas Kremer said.

I've grown more convinced that they're reasonable on trade, I probably had more concerns about that three months ago,  Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) Chief Executive Lance Fritz told Reuters in an interview.  We've had good conversations with the administration and I'm confident they're going to do the right thing when it comes to NAFTA.  Renegotiation of NAFTA was a key campaign promise of Trump, who frequently called the 23-year-old trade pact a  disaster  that has drained U.S. factories and sent well-paid manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Trump has pledged to use the upcoming NAFTA talks to shrink goods trade deficits that stood at $63 billion with Mexico and $11 billion with Canada last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Fritz said he plans to talk to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and has already held discussions with Mexican regulators and the Canadian and Mexican ambassadors. The consensus from those talks is that parts of NAFTA concerning e-commerce, intellectual property and country of origin will be  modernized  but that a complete rewrite of the trade agreement is unlikely.  Lightizer informed Congress last month that renegotiations of NAFTA would begin in mid-August. Administration officials have been  clear in their conversations with us what they’re targeting and it makes sense to us,  Fritz said. Lance Fritz, chief executive officer of Union Pacific, looks on during an interview in New York, U.S., June 28, 2017.Shannon StapletonAbout 40 percent of Union Pacific's freight volume is based on international trade and about 12 percent is based on cross-border trade with Mexico. Fritz said although the Trump administration has not yet delivered much in terms of legislation, the railroad has witnessed a significant sea change in the U.S. regulatory environment.  We're getting a more deft touch when it comes to the regulatory burden,  he said.  Under the previous administration it was approaching extreme under some circumstances.  Lance Fritz, chief executive officer of Union Pacific, speaks during an interview in New York, U.S., June 28, 2017.Shannon StapletonFritz said the railroad is discussing waivers to some regulations to test alternative approaches. One such waiver under discussion involves using computers instead of people to conduct daily tests on locomotives.      In one of his first moves after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the United States from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). When asked if that decision provided an opportunity for China to step in and set the agenda in trade, Fritz said:  It's too early to tell, but I think that would be the risk.   I'm chagrined,  he added.  I think TPP was a good idea and I'm disappointed that we didn't continue the process of getting that ratified.   I thought that was a good agreement for the United States,  he said.  Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-union-pacific-ceo-idUSKBN19J2L5"},

In an interview on Wednesday, Smead said value-oriented companies such as those involved with housing will regain favor once investors lose their infatuation with trendier, high-flying names that he called  The Jetsons.  The title of the animated TV show is his shorthand for Amazon.com Inc, electric car maker Tesla Inc, and technology companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc that are often dominant, viewed as on the cusp of the next big thing, or led by charismatic leaders like Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk.  If tech goes back to being mortal, value is going to get hot,  Smead said. He said housing companies will benefit as a growing number of people get married later in life, and more millennials move into the 35-44 age bracket.  It will change from millennials dominating the economy as single people to dominating the economy as married people,  he said. Smead's $1.16 billion Smead Value Fund is up 9.51 percent this year, outperforming 80 percent of its peers, and 15.90 percent annually over five years, outperforming 95 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. Turnover is minimal in the concentrated fund, which owned just 26 stocks on March 31, led by homebuilder NVR Inc. Smead's other investments include homebuilder Lennar Corp, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which owns and invests in a variety of real estate businesses. While Smead's Seattle-based firm invests in hometown companies Nordstrom Inc and Starbucks Corp, an exception is Amazon, which agreed this month to buy Whole Foods Markets Inc for $13.7 billion. Smead favors companies that meet economic needs.  Delivering your groceries to you, the jury is still out on that,  he said.  Does that meet a need?  Many people will continue to enjoy shopping in person, even if only because  humans need something to do,  he added. For that reason, he said, many brick-and-mortar retailers do not deserve the dinosaur reputation pinned on them after a series of recent bankruptcies in the sector.  He said even the net worth of Sears Holdings Corp, whose stock he does not own, could be far greater in bankruptcy than its roughly $8 stock price suggests.  The demise of physical locations of stores is way overblown,  he said.

Hungary's media is increasingly dominated by those close to Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has faced criticism at home and abroad for stifling free speech, including via a crackdown on foreign universities and non-government organisations. Publisher New Wave Media Group told news agency MTI on Wednesday in a statement that the new sole owner and chief executive of the company was Adam Matolcsy. His father is a close ally of Orban, serving as economy minister from 2010 to 2013 and then being picked by the prime minister for the top job at the central bank. A group of businessmen including the elder Matolcsy's cousin launched a media group shortly after he took over at the central bank and acquired and consolidated a large online media portfolio -- partly using central bank cash, a Reuters inquiry found last year. At that time the ties of the group's owners to the central bank were unclear, and neither the central bank nor the company running prominent news web sites Origo.hu and VS.hu said there were direct connections between them and the Matolcsys. Media analysts have expressed concern that Origo, once a leading source of independent news, may now toe the government line more closely.  Origo, which had been known for investigative work before, has become palpably more loyal to the government,  the media analysis centre Mertek wrote in a report last month. Origo declined immediate comment. In the statement to MTI, New Wave Media's outgoing owner and CEO Istvan Szaraz said that the company turned a profit for the first time in 2016, and Adam Matolcsy said that he had ambitious plans to shake up the Hungarian media market with new technology. Neither Szaraz nor Matolcsy were available for further comment. A central bank spokesman declined to comment. Mertek says Origo is the single largest news web site in Hungary, with 2.3 million users in the country of 10 million.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro said Oscar Perez, a strapping pilot, diver and parachutist, was responsible for firing shots and lobbing grenades on the Interior Ministry and the Supreme Court after hijacking the helicopter. In a social media video, Perez said he was fighting a tyrannical, vile government. Perez, 36, produced and starred in a 2015 Venezuelan action movie called  Suspended Death  about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman, which includes scenes of him firing a rifle from a helicopter and emerging from water in scuba gear. He has an unusually public profile for the usually tight-lipped and secretive investigative police. Perez has given interviews about his film and maintained a colorful Instagram feed with images of him riding horseback in combat gear, scuba-diving with rifles and pistols, and jumping out of a helicopter with a dog.  I'm a man who goes out into the streets without knowing whether I'll return home,  Perez told a local television network in an interview about the film in 2015. The movie glorifies Venezuela's investigative police as they stage a complex and action-packed rescue using improbably futuristic technology. Asked what inspired him to make the movie, he said a conversation with a young delinquent led him to believe that movies could help change minds.  (I asked myself) what can we do to create a positive idea, to be a weapon against delinquency? That's how 'Suspended Death' came to be,  said Perez in another TV interview. Reuters was unable to immediately get comment from Perez. Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said on Wednesday he had requested an Interpol alert for Perez's capture. Target Practice Perez's action came during a major national crisis as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months calling for an end to Maduro's presidency, amid food shortages, a collapsing currency and soaring inflation. Critics accuse Maduro of creating a dictatorship by stifling dissent, using security forces to limit the right to protest and arbitrarily jailing demonstrators. Maduro dismisses the protests as a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow him. On Tuesday evening, Perez unfurled a banner from the helicopter with the word,  Freedom!  Though he supposedly claimed to be representing a coalition of disaffected security and civilian officials, there was no immediate evidence that he had further backing. In a 2016 video on Perez's Instagram feed, he stands with his back to a mannequin target and successfully shoots it with the help of a small makeup mirror for aim. He also appeared in several public service videos including one in which a police officer takes a bribe from a driver he has pulled over, only for the driver to later kill the officer's son. Perez at the end of video looks into the camera and says  Corruption affects all of us. Denounce it.  His acting experience and his theatrical photos have spurred opposition criticism that Tuesday's incident, which did not include any reports of injuries or deaths, may have been staged by Maduro as an excuse to clamp down on adversaries.

The price of copper [CMCU3], by far Chile's most important export, started to slowly recover in October, after years of weak demand for the red metal. So far in 2017, prices have risen 7 percent, and analysts expect further increases as the copper market moves toward a deficit. That, in turn, is causing miners to slowly examine projects put on the back burner years ago when prices begin to slide from historic 2011 highs.  One perceives more movement from the projects that were, one way or another, delayed by price,  Chilean Mining Minister Aurora Williams told Reuters in a recent interview.  But even as prices rise, miners are wary of a relatively unsettled policy landscape in the South American country, various industry sources told Reuters in recent weeks. During the past three years, center-left President Michelle Bachelet has pushed through a series of reforms to the nation's tax and labor code. While supporters say they have been necessary to lessen the nation's biting inequality, many industry leaders say they are squeezing business, and new labor laws contributed to a massive strike at BHP Billiton's Escondida mine earlier this year that led to $1 billion in lost production for the company.  [The reforms] have made the sector timid to announce new investments. There's been a loss of confidence,  said one high-ranking source in a foreign miner, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. While a business-friendly ex-president, Sebastian Pinera, is the favorite in the November presidential election, leftist independent Alejandro Guillier is close at his heels, and a win by him would unsettle the already-leery industry. Miners Look, but Don't Leap In the meantime, miners are taking a gradual approach to any potential expansions. Former Antofagasta Minerals CEO Diego Hernandez, who now heads Chile's mining industry body Sonami, said firms were  eyeing expansion plans, though brick-and-mortar investments would probably be delayed until the second half of 2018. Canada's Teck Resources, for instance, is taking steps in the permitting process for a potential $4.7 billion expansion at its Quebrada Blanca mine, while BHP has said it would analyze a $2.2 billion expansion of its Spence mine this August. U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan and Chile's state-run Codelco [COBRE.UL], meanwhile, are currently carrying out studies to determine the viability of a $5 billion expansion at their El Abra mine. Still, some projects that were shelved are unlikely to be revived any time soon. Proposed major expansions at Anglo American and Glencore's Collahuasi mine and Antofagasta's Los Pelambres, for instance, show no medium-term signs of going forward.

The dollar sank to its lowest level since November while the euro hit a one-year high after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Tuesday appeared to hint that stimulus could be trimmed this year, though sources later said he had been misinterpreted.                          A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies and can increase demand.      Spot gold        was up 0.2 percent at $1,249.20 an ounce by 2:09 p.m. EDT (1809 GMT). It was on track to close June down 1.5 percent, but for the second quarter finish little changed.     U.S. gold futures         settled up 0.2 percent at $1,249.10.       For the remainder of this year we expect gold prices to profit slowly but surely from a weaker U.S. dollar and to rise at a modest pace,  ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said.  Our year-end forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are $1,300 and $1,400 per ounce, respectively.      While the weak greenback was seen giving support to gold prices, rising yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were seen preventing stronger gains.     The risk of a deeper stock market correction meant investors now wanted to keep their gold, said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank.      With the selling appetite fading, it gives some room to the upside,  he said.     Stock investors were also on edge after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said shares may be over-valued, Hansen said.                  However, bond yields rose after Draghi's comments on ECB stimulus, limiting the appeal of non-yielding bullion.                       On the technical side, gold rose above its 100-day moving average. Fibonacci resistance was at $1,255.20, analysts at ScotiaMocatta said in a note.       Expect to see prices perking up heading into the latter part of the week, especially if the combination of a weaker dollar and U.S. equity markets stays with us for a little while longer,  said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir in a note.     Spot silver        was up 0.9 percent at $16.81 an ounce.     Platinum        was 0.5 percent higher at $921.30, and palladium        was up 0.05 percent at $857.90.     The platinum market was heading for a third year of global surplus in 2017, consultancy CPM Group said in a report. It also said a surplus was expected in the palladium market.

Fowler, who will be making his sixth start in the event, will be eager to get underway in Thursday's opening round, which will mark his first event since he squandered the chance of a maiden major 10 days ago. The 28-year-old American started the final round of the year's second major two shots off the lead but shot even-par 72 at Erin Hills to finish six shots behind Brooks Koepka and in a tie for fifth place. But Fowler, a four-times winner on the PGA Tour who has been grouped with Australian Marc Leishman and Canadian Adam Hadwin for the first two rounds, is not about to hit the panic button.  I feel like golf-wise I'm playing at the highest level. If you look at the negatives too much, I mean, you're going to be stuck doing that the whole time,  Fowler told reporters after his final round at the U.S. Open.   You have to measure success in different ways, not just by winning, just because that doesn't happen a whole lot. I think Tiger (Woods) had the best winning percentage of all time at 30 percent, and you're lucky to even sniff close to 10.  Fowler arrives at TPC Potomac with six top-10 finishes in 13 events this season, including a win at the Honda Classic in late February. Despite a relatively weak field, there are a number of players who are expected to contend, including Justin Thomas, who is seeking his fourth win of the season and reigning Players Championship winner Kim Si-woo of South Korea. Billy Horschel, the 2014 FedExCup winner who triumphed at last month's AT&T; Byron Nelson, defending champion Billy Hurley III, former winner Bill Haas and Swede David Lingmerth are among the other contenders. One person who will not be at TPC Potomac is Tiger Woods. While the event is run by Woods's foundation, the former world number one is currently receiving professional help on how to manage his medications for back pain and a sleep disorder.

CPPIB said on Wednesday the partnership, Encino Acquisition Partners, would seek non-core assets being sold by global energy majors and would focus on basins already producing oil and gas. Houston-based energy company Encino Energy, which is privately-owned, will operate the assets acquired by the partnership and has committed $25 million.  CPPIB, which manages C$317 billion ($243 billion) of national pension money on behalf of 20 million Canadians, does not have any particular assets or regions in mind, said Toronto-based Avik Dey, the fund's head of natural resources. It is looking to buy assets being sold by large energy companies as they spend money on developing red-hot U.S. shale basins like the Permian and the so-called SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma.  We see an emerging opportunity to buy attractive assets from bigger companies that are remodeling their portfolios to pursue higher growth in the Permian and SCOOP/STACK,  Dey said. International oil majors like ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have this year sold off oil and natural gas assets in both the United States and Canada to trim heir portfolios. CPPIB already holds close to C$4.5 billion of assets in the energy sector, 80 percent of which are in western Canada. In the United States it holds $900-million of Denver Jules Basin assets acquired from Encana Corp (ECA.TO) in 2015. The fund started investing natural resources in 2015 and it is one of the smaller groups in its portfolio. Dey said CPPIB although the partnership with Encino would be specifically focused on buying U.S. assets, it did not signify the fund was moving away from investing in the Canadian energy sector.

The governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) said  on Wednesday that it would take another look at the evidence on Monday.  The FIA will further examine the causes of the incident in order to evaluate whether further action is necessary,  it announced in a statement. The outcome of that process will be made public before the Austrian Grand Prix weekend of July 7-9.  Race stewards imposed a 10 second stop and go penalty on Vettel after he hit the back of race leader Hamilton's car and then angrily pulled alongside and banged wheels while both were behind the safety car. They ruled, after an examination of the video evidence, that Vettel had steered into Hamilton in a  potentially dangerous  maneuver.  Some commentators felt the German had got off lightly, with Vettel ultimately finishing fourth and extending his overall lead to 14 points. Hamilton, who had led comfortably from pole position, finished fifth after having to pit when his headrest material came loose and was angry afterwards.  For him to pretty much get away with driving into another driver is a disgrace,  Hamilton told reporters.  I think he disgraced himself today. Vettel accused Hamilton of 'brake testing' him by suddenly slowing coming out of Turn 16 as the safety car prepared to return to the pits. The FIA said on Sunday, however, that the data showed the Briton had  maintained a consistent speed and behaved in the same manner on that occasion as in all the other re-starts during the race . The incident has been the talk of Formula One, with considerable debate on the severity of the punishment and fans divided.  I think the stewards got it right; I wouldn't have disqualified him or banned him from the next race unless he took Hamilton out of Baku,  said former racer and Sky Sports commentator Martin Brundle.   Others disagreed and highlighted FIA president Jean Todt's road safety campaign and Vettel's past history of losing his cool under pressure. Last October the German escaped sanction after apologizing to race director Charlie Whiting for aiming an expletive-laden Mexican Grand Prix rant at him over the radio. Todt decided then,  on an exceptional basis , to take no disciplinary action against the four-times world champion but the FIA made clear any recurrence would trigger a summons to its International Tribunal. Vettel refused to accept blame after Sunday's race while Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene spoke of  some decisions that were not entirely clear .

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Penn West Petroleum, which changed its name earlier this week to Obsidian Energy, had moved hundreds of millions of dollars from operating expense accounts to capital expenditure accounts. That maneuver, the SEC said, artificially reduced the company's operating costs by as much as 20 percent at times, and improved metrics for oil extraction efficiency. The company issued a statement saying the lawsuit is based on  historic  accounting practices that were discovered and reported to the SEC in July 2014. The company restated its financial statements in September that same year.  We are naturally disappointed that the SEC has chosen to pursue these past matters which we reported to them and fully remediated years ago,  Chief Executive Officer David French said.  This is particularly true since the employees involved in the matters have long since left the company,  he added. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, also charged former Chief Financial Officer Todd Takeyasu, former vice president of accounting and reporting Jeffery Curran, and former operations controller Waldemar Grab. The SEC said the three had manipulated operating expenses to lower a key metric related to the cost of oil extraction. Grab, the SEC said, is cooperating with the agency and has agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Richard Albert, an attorney for Takeyasu, said his client is confident that  the SEC's claims against him are meritless and he looks forward to defending this case vigorously and prevailing in court.  Attorneys for Curran and Grab could not be immediately reached for comment. Separately, the SEC said on Wednesday that two of the company's other former CEOs had reimbursed the company for cash bonuses and stock awards. Neither were found to have engaged in any misconduct. The company said it does not expect the litigation to  materially alter  its business activities.

After threatening to block Telegram, Russian authorities increased pressure on the company on Monday, saying that terrorists had used the Telegram app to carry out a deadly suicide bombing on Russian soil. That suggested the authorities were serious about blocking Telegram on national security grounds unless it met their demands. Durov responded that the app had blocked thousands of terrorism-related channels and that if Russia banned it, terrorists would just switch to a competing service.

CPPIB said on Wednesday the partnership, Encino Acquisition Partners, would seek non-core assets being sold by global energy majors and would focus on basins already producing oil and gas. Houston-based energy company Encino Energy, which is privately-owned, will operate the assets acquired by the partnership and has committed $25 million.  CPPIB, which manages C$317 billion ($243 billion) of national pension money on behalf of 20 million Canadians, does not have any particular assets or regions in mind, said Toronto-based Avik Dey, the fund's head of natural resources. It is looking to buy assets being sold by large energy companies as they spend money on developing red-hot U.S. shale basins like the Permian and the so-called SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma.  We see an emerging opportunity to buy attractive assets from bigger companies that are remodeling their portfolios to pursue higher growth in the Permian and SCOOP/STACK,  Dey said. International oil majors like ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have this year sold off oil and natural gas assets in both the United States and Canada to trim heir portfolios. CPPIB already holds close to C$4.5 billion of assets in the energy sector, 80 percent of which are in western Canada. In the United States it holds $900-million of Denver Jules Basin assets acquired from Encana Corp (ECA.TO) in 2015. The fund started investing natural resources in 2015 and it is one of the smaller groups in its portfolio. Dey said CPPIB although the partnership with Encino would be specifically focused on buying U.S. assets, it did not signify the fund was moving away from investing in the Canadian energy sector.

In an interview on Wednesday, Smead said value-oriented companies such as those involved with housing will regain favor once investors lose their infatuation with trendier, high-flying names that he called  The Jetsons.  The title of the animated TV show is his shorthand for Amazon.com Inc, electric car maker Tesla Inc, and technology companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc that are often dominant, viewed as on the cusp of the next big thing, or led by charismatic leaders like Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk.  If tech goes back to being mortal, value is going to get hot,  Smead said. He said housing companies will benefit as a growing number of people get married later in life, and more millennials move into the 35-44 age bracket.  It will change from millennials dominating the economy as single people to dominating the economy as married people,  he said. Smead's $1.16 billion Smead Value Fund is up 9.51 percent this year, outperforming 80 percent of its peers, and 15.90 percent annually over five years, outperforming 95 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. Turnover is minimal in the concentrated fund, which owned just 26 stocks on March 31, led by homebuilder NVR Inc. Smead's other investments include homebuilder Lennar Corp, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which owns and invests in a variety of real estate businesses. While Smead's Seattle-based firm invests in hometown companies Nordstrom Inc and Starbucks Corp, an exception is Amazon, which agreed this month to buy Whole Foods Markets Inc for $13.7 billion. Smead favors companies that meet economic needs.  Delivering your groceries to you, the jury is still out on that,  he said.  Does that meet a need?  Many people will continue to enjoy shopping in person, even if only because  humans need something to do,  he added. For that reason, he said, many brick-and-mortar retailers do not deserve the dinosaur reputation pinned on them after a series of recent bankruptcies in the sector.  He said even the net worth of Sears Holdings Corp, whose stock he does not own, could be far greater in bankruptcy than its roughly $8 stock price suggests.  The demise of physical locations of stores is way overblown,  he said.

Argentina does not sell the fuel below cost, Dreyfus's Gonzalo Ramirez Martiarena said on the sidelines of the Financial Times Commodities Americas Summit.  The U.S. International Trade Commission voted last month to continue a U.S. Commerce Department investigation into alleged dumping and unfair subsidies of biodiesel fuels from Argentina. The Argentine government denies flooding the U.S. market with biodiesel.   For us it's very important that Argentina defends against this case as it should, until the end... frankly it's an injustice,  Ramirez Martiarena said.  Argentina does not sell biodiesel below cost. There is no dumping.  Argentina is the world's No. 3 exporter of soybeans and is a top global exporter of soy oil, which is a main ingredient in biodiesel, and soymeal.  Dreyfus, which sells Argentine biodiesel, is part of the so-called ABCD quartet of global agricultural traders along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill [CAR.UL]. Ramirez Martiarena said Argentina had done a good job defending itself from dumping allegations in Europe. In September, a European Union court annulled anti-dumping tariffs the bloc had applied to Argentine biodiesel imports. The WTO had  ruled in favor of the South American country, calling the measures protectionist.     In the U.S. I'm confident that the case will be won,  Ramirez Martiarena said.  On the other hand, the executive warned the Argentine government needed to further cut export taxes on soybeans or it risked losing market share to Brazil. Days after taking office in 2015, President Mauricio Macri cut 5 percentage points off the export tax on soybeans and cut export taxes on corn and wheat. The farm sector cheered the measure, which was aimed at attracting investment. Macri promised to keep lowering the tax by 5 percentage points per year. But faced with a wide fiscal deficit announced in October, he has instead said he would lower the tax on soybeans by 0.5 percentage points per month starting in 2018, a pace Ramirez Martiarena called  too slow.    If Argentina does not accelerate the process of cutting soy taxes, it runs the risk of losing competitive advantage against what Brazil is developing in logistics,  he said.

In its 7-2 decision, Canada's Supreme Court found that a court in the country can grant an injunction preventing conduct anywhere in the world when it is necessary to ensure the injunction's effectiveness.  The internet has no borders - its natural habitat is global,  the Supreme Court wrote in its judgment.  The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates - globally.  Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  The case stems from claims by Equustek Solutions Inc, a small technology company in British Columbia that manufactures network devices, that distributor Datalink Technologies Gateways relabeled one of its products and sold it as its own online and acquired trade secrets to design and manufacture a competing product. In 2012, Equustek asked Google to remove Datalink search results until the case against the company was resolved. While Google removed over 300 specific web pages associated with Datalink, it did so only on the Canadian version of its search engine.  The Supreme Court of British Columbia subsequently ordered Google to stop displaying search results in any country for any part of Datalink's websites. FILE PHOTO: A view shows the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa February 6, 2015.Chris Wattie/File PhotoIn its appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, Google had argued that the global reach of the order was unnecessary and that it raised concerns over freedom of expression. The Supreme Court rejected Google's argument that the right to freedom of expression should have prevented the order from being issued.  This is not an order to remove speech that, on its face, engages freedom of expression values,  the court wrote in its ruling.  We have not, to date, accepted that freedom of expression requires the facilitation of the unlawful sale of goods.   The global reach was necessary, according to the court, because if the removed search results were restricted to Canada alone, purchasers both in and out of Canada could easily continue to find and buy from Datalink. OpenMedia, a Canadian group campaigning for open communications, opposed the ruling.  There is great risk that governments and commercial entities will see this ruling as justifying censorship requests that could result in perfectly legal and legitimate content disappearing off the web because of a court order in the opposite corner of the globe,  said OpenMedia spokesman David Christopher. Google cannot appeal the Supreme Court ruling. If the company has evidence that complying with the order would force it to violate other countries' laws, including interfering with freedom of expression, it can apply to the British Columbia court to alter the order, the Supreme Court said, noting Google has not made such an application.

Paul, 32, agreed to opt in to the final year of his $24.2 million contract, clearing the way for the Clippers to execute a sign-and-trade deal with the Rockets and bring back assets for the star player, league sources told The Vertical. The Rockets will send forward Sam Dekker and guards Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams, plus a top-three protected 2018 first-round pick to the Clippers in exchange for Paul, sources told ESPN. Paul had until Wednesday to opt out of the final year of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent. The Clippers risked losing Paul for nothing in free agency. Paul could have signed a new deal with the Clippers that started at $34 million a year had he opted out of his contract. He will now be eligible to sign a five-year, $205 million maximum extension with the Rockets since he is being acquired in a trade. Paul wanted to play alongside Rockets All-Star guard James Harden, according to The Vertical. Paul and Harden reportedly discussed the possibility of a partnership at length and believe they can find a way to thrive together. Paul, who was acquired by the Clippers in a 2011 trade with New Orleans, is a nine-time All-Star, nine-time All-NBA player and a nine-time All-Defensive team member. He played six seasons with Los Angeles after six seasons in New Orleans. For his career, Paul owns averages of 18.7 points, 9.9 assists and 2.3 steals in 834 NBA games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-basketball-nba-hou-paul-idUSKBN19J2I1"},

The U.S.-based China Labor Watch said police in Ganzhou in southeast China notified the families of Su Heng, Li Zhao and Hua Haifeng that they could go to the city and pay bail for their release. It did not say what charges the three were facing. Calls by Reuters to Ganzhou police went unanswered, and a spokeswoman for the Ivanka brand declined to comment. Two U.S. officials said the Chinese may be aiming to embarrass Ivanka Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump's daughter, by releasing the activists so they could talk about their findings. China Labor Watch said the activists had collected evidence that Ivanka Trump  set a bad example  by doing business with factories that exploited workers. The activists' lawyers said their actions were not criminal and they hoped Chinese courts would conduct a fair trial, China Labor Watch said. The group said that between March and May, the three activists entered the Dongguan Huajian and Jiangxi Huajian factories, which have manufactured shoes for Ivanka Trump. Two took jobs in the plants.  The three were detained by police in late May after gathering video, pictures and evidence that illustrated long hours and ill treatment by management for workers at the factories, China Labor Watch said. Ivanka Trump's prominence meant she should be able to check on her suppliers and influence them, Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, said in the statement.  However, based on what we have seen so far, she has left us very disappointed. She has set a bad example,  Li said. Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department called for the immediate release of the three activists. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the department, Anna Richey-Allen, said the United States urged China  to afford them the judicial and fair-trial protections to which they are entitled.  On Tuesday, the State Department placed China on its global list of the worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor. That step could aggravate U.S. tensions with Beijing that had eased under the Trump administration. Ivanka Trump, an adviser to her father, stood beside U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as he presented the report. She has tried to make the fight against human trafficking one of her signature issues. Two U.S. officials familiar with the release of the investigators said China appeared to be retaliating for the state department listing, since the activists would be free to discuss the treatment of workers by Ivanka Trump's suppliers. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ivanka Trump was instrumental in arranging a White House meeting with anti-trafficking activists that Trump attended in the first few weeks of the administration. U.S. officials told Reuters this week that despite his overtures to Beijing, Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and was now considering possible trade actions against the country.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have sent Doha a list of 13 demands, including closing the state-funded Al Jazeera television and reducing ties to Iran, an official of one of the four countries said. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression David Kaye said the move was a blow against media pluralism in the Middle East.  This demand represents a serious threat to media freedom if states, under the pretext of a diplomatic crisis, take measures to force the dismantling of Al Jazeera,  Kaye said in a statement.  I call on the international community to urge these governments not to pursue this demand against Qatar, to resist taking steps to censor media in their own territory and regionally, and to encourage support for independent media in the Middle East,  he added. The four Arab states accuse Al Jazeera of interference in their affairs and fomenting unrest in the Middle East through its reporting -- a charge the satellite channel denies. In a separate statement, Reporters without Borders said it was disturbed by the demand, calling the move  an unacceptable act of blackmail .  This use of pressure and blackmail betrays a clear desire by certain Gulf states to censor the Qatari media and constitutes a grave attack on press freedom and pluralism, and the right of access to information in the region,  said Alexandra El Khazen, the head of RSF’s Middle East desk.  The targeted media outlets must be able to exist freely, without being forced to fall in with the policies of neighboring countries, which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as models of media freedom, as models to be followed.

Agriculture Minister Rumen Porozhanov told reporters after a cabinet meeting that laboratory tests had found different ingredients in seven of 31 identical-brand food items sold in Bulgaria. Experts also found that 16 of the products had been sold at higher prices in the European Union's poorest state, he said.  It definitely causes anxiety,  he said.  The double standards are a fact . Porozhanov declined to name the products or companies involved. Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary have criticized several global food companies, saying it is unethical for products sold under the same brand to be inferior in quality. Porozhanov said Sofia would join their efforts to lobby within the EU to bring an end to the practice. Bulgaria launched a round of testing on different meat, dairy, baby food, chocolate and juice products in May. Consumer groups have complained about the use of different ingredients in identically branded products, but they have made little progress as EU law only requires that packaging contain a clear list of all ingredients. Porozhanov said Bulgaria would send the results of its tests to the European Commission's consumer affairs chief Vera Jourova.

The venture known as Roan Resources will be provided land by the two companies, on an equal basis, in an area which stretches across the SCOOP, STACK and Merge oil-rich shale formations in south and central Oklahoma. By forming the venture, Linn and Citizen aim to accelerate the development of the largely-contiguous acreage, with production reaching more than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of the year, double the output as of May 2017, the statement said. Technology improvements allow companies to drill sideways over a longer distance, meaning oil and gas producers have been seeking out ways to acquire adjacent land to boost production from single oil wells. EQT Corp said last week it had agreed to buy fellow Appalachian gas and oil firm Rice Energy for $6.7 billion, a transaction that would make it the largest U.S. natural gas producer. One of its main rationales was Rice's complementary acreage. Roan Resources is planning an initial public offering in early 2018, subject to market conditions, the statement added. Linn itself only returned to the public market in February, having reformed itself during a Chapter 11 process caused by the slump in oil prices from a peak in mid-2014. It has since sold a number of assets designated as not core to its strategic plan to help raise cash to fund new opportunities, including to Jonah Energy and Denbury Resources. Tulsa-based Citizen is focused on developing oil and gas reserves in the Anadarko basin in Oklahoma. It is backed by investment firm JVL Advisors, run by former Morgan Stanley banker John Lovoi. Jefferies and Citigroup were the respective financial advisers to Linn and Citizen, with Latham & Watkins and Thompson & Knight their respective legal advisers.

Shares in the world's largest foodmaker rose as much as 2 percent on Wednesday, close to the record high touched on Monday after the New York-based hedge fund disclosed a $3.5 billion stake and urged Nestle to buy back shares, set a target for margin growth and shed non-core assets including its stake in L'Oreal (OREP.PA). Investors did not have to wait long for a response, with Nestle announcing late on Tuesday that it would launch a 20 billion Swiss franc ($20.8 billion) share buyback program while leaving room for near-term acquisitions. Nestle also said it would continue adjusting its portfolio and assess opportunities to boost profit margins, stopping short of setting a firm target. It added that the measures were the result of a review instigated at the start of the year after Mark Schneider took over as chief executive.   The moves were welcomed by stakeholders large and small.  This is a new era for Nestle and I'm extremely positive on the prospects for internal and external growth,  said Carine Menache, who runs a Monaco investment firm that owns Nestle shares. She and UBS analysts said the buyback should lift earnings by 6 percent, while increased merger and acquisition (M&A;) activity could provide a further boost.   Nestle may have a poor track record for M&A;, but the new CEO, Schneider, is now in charge and he has a great track record,  she added.  Reaching a 19 percent operating margin, the midpoint of Third Point's recommendation, would lift earnings by another 8 percent, according to UBS, which said Nestle shares now offered the greatest opportunity for growth of all the European packaged goods companies it covers, bolstering its  buy  rating. Of Nestle's plan, which they described as  responsive but not reactionary  to Third Point, UBS said:  We think this sends a strong message to the markets - expect more to come.    Sector Convulsions The global packaged food sector is convulsing as its main players struggle with slowing growth, changing consumer habits and the growing influence of global investment firm 3G Capital. 3G's Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) launched a surprise $143 billion takeover bid for Unilever (ULVR.L) in February, sparking a deep review and new agenda at the target company. Many of the demands laid out in Third Point's letter echo the steps Unilever took in the wake of the Kraft bid.  Investors said the biggest omission from Nestle's response was any reference to its 25 billion euro ($28.4 billion) stake in L'Oreal, which dates back to 1974, when the French heiress Liliane Bettencourt sold a large part of her holding to Nestle. That omission and lack of a margin target means the announcement may not completely satisfy Third Point, which is controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb. Third Point has declined to comment on the announcement at this stage and Nestle is expected to say more at its investor day in September.  It's only a start,  said Mirabaud Asset Management's Nicolas Burki.  It will not be enough.  Nestle has long touted the L'Oreal stake as value-creating, and a source familiar with the company's thinking said there was no change to that view.    The big question, however is what Nestle would do with the cash, besides buybacks, if it sold down the L'Oreal stake. The company did say its capital spending would be focused on higher-growth categories of coffee, pet food, baby food and water. It added consumer health to the list of priorities, potentially making it a competitor to the likes of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L). However, EFG Asset Management's Urs Beck cashed out of his Nestle position on Monday's price spike and is skeptical that it can find acquisitions big enough to move the needle for a company with $93 billion in sales.  The ship is just too big to be steered into different waters through portfolio management,  he said. Victory on Both Sides  Nestle is Europe's most valuable company, with a market value of $263 billion last week, before Loeb's position was made public, adding $10 billion in one day. The positive reaction most likely reflects the bullishness of long-term investors rather than event-driven hedge funds looking for quick turnarounds, says Michael Wegener at Case Equity Partners in Hong Kong.  Wegener said he doubts that many arbitrageurs have moved into Nestle's stock yet, since the Loeb stake remains too soft a catalyst at this stage.  But one London-based manager of an event-driven hedge fund with no involvement with Nestle described the situation as a  victory for both sides.   I suspect (Third Point's) presence actually helps Schneider with his change agenda,  said the manager, who asked not to be named.  I suspect the buyback is not enough, but Third Point is unlikely to feel the need to get shouty.    Swiss activist shareholder Rudolf Bohli said that Loeb, known for campaigns against Yahoo, Sony Corp and the Dow-DuPont merger, is on the right track.   Loeb has set the right tone and his agenda is correct,  said Bohli, who recently exited GAM Holding with a profit after failing to replace the financial company's chief executive.

After threatening to block Telegram, Russian authorities increased pressure on the company on Monday, saying that terrorists had used the Telegram app to carry out a deadly suicide bombing on Russian soil. That suggested the authorities were serious about blocking Telegram on national security grounds unless it met their demands. Durov responded that the app had blocked thousands of terrorism-related channels and that if Russia banned it, terrorists would just switch to a competing service.

The U.S.-based China Labor Watch said police in Ganzhou in southeast China notified the families of Su Heng, Li Zhao and Hua Haifeng that they could go to the city and pay bail for their release. It did not say what charges the three were facing. Calls by Reuters to Ganzhou police went unanswered, and a spokeswoman for the Ivanka brand declined to comment. Two U.S. officials said the Chinese may be aiming to embarrass Ivanka Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump's daughter, by releasing the activists so they could talk about their findings. China Labor Watch said the activists had collected evidence that Ivanka Trump  set a bad example  by doing business with factories that exploited workers. The activists' lawyers said their actions were not criminal and they hoped Chinese courts would conduct a fair trial, China Labor Watch said. The group said that between March and May, the three activists entered the Dongguan Huajian and Jiangxi Huajian factories, which have manufactured shoes for Ivanka Trump. Two took jobs in the plants.  The three were detained by police in late May after gathering video, pictures and evidence that illustrated long hours and ill treatment by management for workers at the factories, China Labor Watch said. Ivanka Trump's prominence meant she should be able to check on her suppliers and influence them, Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, said in the statement.  However, based on what we have seen so far, she has left us very disappointed. She has set a bad example,  Li said. Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department called for the immediate release of the three activists. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the department, Anna Richey-Allen, said the United States urged China  to afford them the judicial and fair-trial protections to which they are entitled.  On Tuesday, the State Department placed China on its global list of the worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor. That step could aggravate U.S. tensions with Beijing that had eased under the Trump administration. Ivanka Trump, an adviser to her father, stood beside U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as he presented the report. She has tried to make the fight against human trafficking one of her signature issues. Two U.S. officials familiar with the release of the investigators said China appeared to be retaliating for the state department listing, since the activists would be free to discuss the treatment of workers by Ivanka Trump's suppliers. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ivanka Trump was instrumental in arranging a White House meeting with anti-trafficking activists that Trump attended in the first few weeks of the administration. U.S. officials told Reuters this week that despite his overtures to Beijing, Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and was now considering possible trade actions against the country.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have sent Doha a list of 13 demands, including closing the state-funded Al Jazeera television and reducing ties to Iran, an official of one of the four countries said. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression David Kaye said the move was a blow against media pluralism in the Middle East.  This demand represents a serious threat to media freedom if states, under the pretext of a diplomatic crisis, take measures to force the dismantling of Al Jazeera,  Kaye said in a statement.  I call on the international community to urge these governments not to pursue this demand against Qatar, to resist taking steps to censor media in their own territory and regionally, and to encourage support for independent media in the Middle East,  he added. The four Arab states accuse Al Jazeera of interference in their affairs and fomenting unrest in the Middle East through its reporting -- a charge the satellite channel denies. In a separate statement, Reporters without Borders said it was disturbed by the demand, calling the move  an unacceptable act of blackmail .  This use of pressure and blackmail betrays a clear desire by certain Gulf states to censor the Qatari media and constitutes a grave attack on press freedom and pluralism, and the right of access to information in the region,  said Alexandra El Khazen, the head of RSF’s Middle East desk.  The targeted media outlets must be able to exist freely, without being forced to fall in with the policies of neighboring countries, which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as models of media freedom, as models to be followed.

The venture known as Roan Resources will be provided land by the two companies, on an equal basis, in an area which stretches across the SCOOP, STACK and Merge oil-rich shale formations in south and central Oklahoma. By forming the venture, Linn and Citizen aim to accelerate the development of the largely-contiguous acreage, with production reaching more than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of the year, double the output as of May 2017, the statement said. Technology improvements allow companies to drill sideways over a longer distance, meaning oil and gas producers have been seeking out ways to acquire adjacent land to boost production from single oil wells. EQT Corp said last week it had agreed to buy fellow Appalachian gas and oil firm Rice Energy for $6.7 billion, a transaction that would make it the largest U.S. natural gas producer. One of its main rationales was Rice's complementary acreage. Roan Resources is planning an initial public offering in early 2018, subject to market conditions, the statement added. Linn itself only returned to the public market in February, having reformed itself during a Chapter 11 process caused by the slump in oil prices from a peak in mid-2014. It has since sold a number of assets designated as not core to its strategic plan to help raise cash to fund new opportunities, including to Jonah Energy and Denbury Resources. Tulsa-based Citizen is focused on developing oil and gas reserves in the Anadarko basin in Oklahoma. It is backed by investment firm JVL Advisors, run by former Morgan Stanley banker John Lovoi.

The protests follow the stabbing to death last week of a 16-year-old boy accused of possessing beef on a train. Several people have been arrested. On Tuesday, a man was beaten and his house set on fire by a mob that accused him of slaughtering a cow in eastern Jharkhand state. Waving  Not in My Name  banners and  Stop Cow Terrorism  placards, actors, writers and young mothers cradling babies braved monsoon rains in Mumbai, Kolkata and other cities, while in Delhi a cast of intellectuals and activists were joined by relatives of recent lynching victims.  I feel afraid. I don't even know if I will be able to reach home safely,  Bashruddin Khandawali, a 24-year-old cousin of Junaid Khan, who was killed last week on the train, told Reuters next to a huge  Lynch Map of India  banner. Critics accuse right-wing Hindu groups, some linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, of fomenting or not doing enough to stop violence against Muslims and lower-caste Hindus who eat beef or work in the meat and leather industries. Modi denies the accusation and has publicly criticized so-called cow vigilantes.  Many Hindus worship the cow as sacred to their religion. Almost all of the 63 attacks since 2010 involving cow-related violence were recorded after Modi and his Hindu nationalist government came to power in 2014, IndiaSpend, a data journalism website, said in a report.

What makes this violence chilling ... is that it is acquiring an atmosphere of a religious communion about it,  he wrote in the Indian Express. Anjali Arondekar, a professor visiting from California, said she had attended the Mumbai protest because  nobody seems to care any more that a young Muslim man is being killed.  India's history is pockmarked by Hindu-Muslim communal clashes, although the vast majority of people live peacefully together. Community leaders called on Modi to do more to protect the 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people who are Muslim.  I fear that if this goes on, there will be a counter-reaction that would be dangerous for peace and tranquillity,  said Navaid Hamid, president of the All India Muslim Majlis–e-Mushawarat.

It was shattered into a lot of pieces,  Chris Powell, a spokesman for the Secretary of State and Capitol Police, said in an interview. The suspect, identified as Michael Reed, 32, was arrested on three charges, including defacing an object of public interest. Police did not release Reed's motive for toppling the monument installed in Little Rock on Tuesday. Republican state Senator Jason Rapert, the main backer of the monument, said a replacement has been ordered.  Frankly this guy was in a state of mind that he could very well have hurt somebody,  he said at a news conference. A Facebook Live video posted to the account of a person named Michael Reed appears to show the slab's destruction. In the vehicle, a person can be heard saying:  Oh my goodness. Freedom,  and driving more than 20 mph (32 kph) until a smashing noise is heard.  He actually was videoing it and broadcasting it live on Facebook as it happened,  police spokesman Powell said, adding an officer patrolling nearby arrested Reed. No lawyer was listed for the suspect in online jail records. In 2014, a person with the same name and age as the suspect used a vehicle to smash a Ten Commandments monument on Oklahoma Capitol grounds, law enforcement in Oklahoma said. Reed then fled the scene and went into a federal building. He made threats against then President Barack Obama, they said. News reports in Oklahoma said he was never formally charged. Arkansas has not officially confirmed whether the same Reed was involved in Wednesday's incident, Powell said. The 6-foot (1.8-meter) monument in Little Rock was funded with $26,000 in private donations. Legislation permitting it on the Capitol grounds was enacted in 2015, and whether that was appropriate has been debated ever since. Courts have ordered the removal of similar religious monuments erected in Alabama and Oklahoma, which had rebuilt its monument after it was destroyed. A civil liberties group has pledged a court challenge in Arkansas, saying the monument showed an unconstitutional government preference for a certain religion. Since Arkansas' Ten Commandments monument act was proposed, satanists and other groups have sought state permission to place markers on Capitol grounds, but their requests were rejected.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/arkansas-commandments-idUSL1N1JP1BY"},

The government of President Nicolas Maduro said Oscar Perez, a strapping pilot, diver and parachutist, was responsible for firing shots and lobbing grenades on the Interior Ministry and the Supreme Court after hijacking the helicopter. In a social media video, Perez said he was fighting a tyrannical, vile government. Perez, 36, directed and starred in a 2015 Venezuelan action movie called  Suspended Death  about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman, which includes scenes of him firing a rifle from a helicopter and emerging from water in scuba gear. He has an unusually public profile for the usually tight-lipped and secretive investigative police. Perez has given interviews about his film and maintained a colorful Instagram feed with images of him riding horseback in combat gear, scuba-diving with rifles and pistols, and jumping out of a helicopter with a dog.  I'm a man who goes out into the streets without knowing whether I'll return home,  Perez told a local television network in an interview about the film in 2015. The movie glorifies Venezuela's investigative police as they stage a complex and action-packed rescue using improbably futuristic technology. Asked what inspired him to make the movie, he said a conversation with a young delinquent led him to believe that movies could help change minds.  (I asked myself) what can we do to create a positive idea, to be a weapon against delinquency? That's how 'Suspended Death' came to be,  said Perez in another TV interview. Reuters was unable to immediately get comment from Perez. Target Practice Perez's action came during a major national crisis as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months calling for an end to Maduro's presidency, amid food shortages, a collapsing currency and soaring inflation. Critics accuse Maduro of creating a dictatorship by stifling dissent, using security forces to limit the right to protest and arbitrarily jailing demonstrators. Maduro dismisses the protests as a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow him. On Tuesday evening, Perez unfurled a banner from the helicopter with the word,  Freedom!  Though he supposedly claimed to be representing a coalition of disaffected security and civilian officials, there was no immediate evidence that he had further backing. In a 2016 video on Perez's Instagram feed, he stands with his back to a mannequin target and successfully shoots it with the help of a small makeup mirror for aim. He also appeared in several public service videos including one in which a police officer takes a bribe from a driver he has pulled over, only for the driver to later kill the officer's son. Perez at the end of video looks into the camera and says  Corruption affects all of us. Denounce it.  His acting experience and his theatrical photos have spurred opposition criticism that Tuesday's incident, which did not include any reports of injuries or deaths, may have been staged by Maduro as an excuse to clamp down on adversaries.

The pound jumped by well over a cent after Carney's comments to hit $1.2971, its strongest since June 9, the day of the results of Britain's parliamentary election. That left it up 1.2 percent on the day.  Speaking at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, Carney said policymakers would need to look at the extent to which stronger business investment offset a slowdown in consumption, as well as growth in wages and labour costs. The remarks showed a shift in emphasis since a speech last week when Carney said now was not the time to raise rates. He did not repeat that phrase on Wednesday, and markets immediately priced in a greater chance of an earlier-than-expected rise. Short sterling interest rate futures <0#FSS:> plunged, particularly across the mid-2018 to 2019 contracts, indicating a steeper path of interest rate hikes.   Our main message would be not to over-interpret the comments – there’s definitely a disconnect when you look at what’s happening in the rates market and the way the FX market is moving,  ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said.   There is a risk that the moves are a bit too aggressive relative to what the central banks are trying to tell us. In the case of the UK, this withdrawal of stimulus could just be one rate hike and not the start of a full-blown hiking cycle. So you’ve got to be careful about overshoots in these currencies.  Having touched a seven-month low against a resurgent euro, sterling jumped 0.9 percent to 87.71 pence.  The euro jumped on Tuesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that the days of the bank's stimulus programme were numbered.  Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 stock index, which tends to move inversely to the pound, extended losses to trade 0.4 percent lower, while mid caps were down 0.2 percent.    Upside (in sterling) may be capped in the near term as Mr Carney has not signalled that the Bank is ready to tighten, only that there is an active debate taking place within the MPC (BoE Monetary Policy Committee),  ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said.   Nevertheless, this was the most explicit signal that we are close to reaching the point at which a hike would be warranted.

Millions of Venezuelans are struggling with shortages and triple-digit inflation during political and economic upheaval that has triggered months of street protests where at least 75 people have been killed. Declining production of oil, a major export, has left the government increasingly short of cash, and lack of everything from food to medical equipment is hitting vulnerable groups like the elderly and children particularly hard. Becerra's mother, Judith Bront, still cries as she discusses her son's death.  Samuel has had chronic renal failure since birth,  said Bront, 53,  He had been receiving dialysis for nine years, and this had never happened.  A dozen other children have the same infection, which doctors traced back to dialysis machines that were improperly maintained due to lack of resources, according to Belén Arteaga, head of the hospital's kidney unit. Surveys conducted in October by Catholic non-profit organization Caritas in poor sectors of Venezuela's four most populous states found that 48 percent of children younger than 5 were malnourished. By April, that figure had risen to 56 percent. Those at high risk of death from malnutrition increased to 11.4 percent of the sample from 8 percent in that time, the surveys showed. Many treatments at J.M. de los Rios are available only because of private donations, according to parents and doctors. Parents routinely clean the rickety rooms, and there is no drinking water. A survey earlier this year by Venezuela's opposition-led Congress showed that nine of the country's 10 main hospitals did not have adequate diagnostic facilities, such as X-ray machines and laboratories, and 64 percent did not offer food to the patients. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry nor the Health Ministry responded to requests for comment. Infant Mortality Of the young patients, infants suffer most. Last year 31 Venezuelan infants died every day on average. Many were victims of diarrhea, bacterial infections and other diseases that, according to the local pediatric society, could have been prevented or easily treated.  There are vaccines and antibiotics available, but Venezuela is so lacking that these illnesses are coming back,  said Dr. Huniades Urbina, president of the Venezuelan Society of Childhood and Pediatrics. Deaths of babies younger than 1 year old jumped 30 percent in Venezuela in 2016, according to government figures. That is a stark contrast to declines across Latin America. Critics blame the problems on strict currency and price controls that reduce incentives to produce food and restrict imports. The government says the opposition and Washington are waging an  economic war  against it. Scavenging Caritas found that Venezuela's highest rate of malnutrition was in the La Guajira region of the western state of Zulia, on the arid and volatile Colombian border. In Caracolito, a tiny settlement of three dirty and crumbling houses containing a total of some 30 people, a woman scavenged for food for her 6-month-old boy at a garbage dump near their home. The child was recovering from a weeks-long stay in a nearby hospital, where he overcame chronic malnutrition. His brother had died in March from the condition.  We were told to take vitamins but couldn't find them,  said their mother, Lideibis Bracho, who is 26 and unemployed.  We went to search in Colombia, but they're too expensive.  Susana Raffalli, a nutritional coordinator at Caritas, said the health crisis was catastrophic.  It's not normal for you to go to a community, weigh 100 children and have 30 of them close to dying,  Raffalli said. The government has been slow to publish data, and the previous health minister was fired shortly after the publication of recent infant mortality figures. Back at the J.M. De Los Rios hospital in Caracas, double the number of children have come in for malnutrition-related issues this year, compared with all of 2016, according to Raffalli. One mother caressed her son, who was suffering from malnutrition, pneumonia, macrocephaly and a severe lack of calcium.  He's nine months old, and he looks like a two-month-old,  said Marisela Huertas, 39.  I was told to give him whole milk, but I can't find it.

(Reuters) - A newly installed Ten Commandments monument on Arkansas state Capitol grounds was destroyed on Wednesday by a man police said drove his vehicle into the granite slab and posted the incident on Facebook.  It was shattered into a lot of pieces,  Chris Powell, a spokesman for the Secretary of State and Capitol Police, said in an interview. The suspect, identified as Michael Reed, 32, was arrested on three charges, including defacing an object of public interest. Police did not release Reed's motive for toppling the monument installed in Little Rock on Tuesday. Republican state Senator Jason Rapert, the main backer of the monument, said a replacement has been ordered.  Frankly this guy was in a state of mind that he could very well have hurt somebody,  he said at a news conference. A Facebook Live video posted to the account of a person named Michael Reed appears to show the slab's destruction.  In the vehicle, a person can be heard saying:  Oh my goodness. Freedom,  and driving more than 20 mph (32 kph) until a smashing noise is heard.  He actually was videoing it and broadcasting it live on Facebook as it happened,  police spokesman Powell said, adding an officer patrolling nearby arrested Reed. A statue of the Ten Commandments is seen after it was installed on the grounds of the state Capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S. June 27, 2017.Steve BarnesNo lawyer was listed for the suspect in online jail records.   In 2014, a person with the same name and age as the suspect used a vehicle to smash a Ten Commandments monument on Oklahoma Capitol grounds, law enforcement in Oklahoma said.  Reed then fled the scene and went into a federal building. He made threats against then President Barack Obama, they said. News reports in Oklahoma said he was never formally charged. Arkansas has not officially confirmed whether the same Reed was involved in Wednesday's incident, Powell said. The 6-foot (1.8-meter) monument in Little Rock was funded with $26,000 in private donations. Legislation permitting it on the Capitol grounds was enacted in 2015, and whether that was appropriate has been debated ever since.  Courts have ordered the removal of similar religious monuments erected in Alabama and Oklahoma, which had rebuilt its monument after it was destroyed. A civil liberties group has pledged a court challenge in Arkansas, saying the monument showed an unconstitutional government preference for a certain religion. Since Arkansas' Ten Commandments monument act was proposed, satanists and other groups have sought state permission to place markers on Capitol grounds, but their requests were rejected.

The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicentre of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbour annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft and a steelmaker.  No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,  said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent. Eternal Blue The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,  Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organisation but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect. Bushiness that installed Microsoft's latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said  a small number  of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's Talos and Symantec said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software programme called MEDoc. The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.  Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,  it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain and Mondelez International Inc, which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate , a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.  The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered  serious consequences  but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

Appointing new cardinals is one of the most significant powers of the papacy, allowing a pontiff to put his stamp on the future of the 1.2 billion-member Church. Cardinals are the pope's closest advisers in the Vatican and around the world and those under 80 years old are known as  cardinal-electors  because they can choose his successor. The new cardinals come from Mali, Spain, Sweden, Laos and El Salvador and all five are under 80 years old. All of those countries, except for Spain, are getting their first cardinal. With their elevation at a ceremony, known as a consistory, in St. Peter's Basilica, Francis has now named nearly 50 cardinal-electors of a total 121.  During the ceremony where the new cardinals received their red hat, known as a  biretta , the pope said they were called to be humble servants of others and not  princes of the Church . They had to  look at reality  and care for  the innocent who suffer and die as victims of war and terrorism . They should combat  the forms of enslavement that continue to violate human dignity even in the age of human rights; the refugee camps which at times seem more like a hell than a purgatory; the systematic discarding of all that is no longer useful, people included . Pope Francis (C) arrives to lead a consistory as he elevate five Roman Catholic prelates to the rank of cardinal, at Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, June 28, 2017.Alessandro BianchiThe new cardinals are Archbishop Jean Zerbo, 73, from Mali, Archbishop Juan José Omella, 71, from Spain, Bishop Anders Arborelius, 67, from Stockholm, Bishop Louis-Marie Ling Mangkhanekhoun, 73, from Laos, and Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chávez, 74, from San Salvador. The Church in Mali has denied recent French media reports about alleged irregularities concerning a bank account reportedly held by the Mali Church in Switzerland. A statement this month denied that it was involved in embezzlement but did not comment directly on the Swiss bank account.  Slideshow (12 Images)The fact that none of the five are Italian and none hold Vatican positions underscores Francis' conviction that the Church must be a global institution that should become increasingly less Italian and Europe-centric. It was Francis' fourth consistory since his election in 2013 and he has used each of them to show support for the Church in countries where Catholics are in a minority, in this case Sweden, Mali and Laos. Chávez, the new cardinal from El Salvador, was a close associate of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated by a right-wing death squad in 1980. Francis is keen to see Romero made a saint during his pontificate. The naming of Arborelius, the Swede, was significant because Sweden is where the Lutheran World Federation was founded in 1947 and because this year marks the 500th anniversary of protestant Martin Luther's Reformation. Francis, who visited Sweden last year, is keen to further Catholic dialogue with Protestant churches. Sweden is also one of the world's most secular countries and the naming of a cardinal there will boost the morale of the tiny Catholic population. After the ceremony in the basilica, the five new cardinals went to pay their respects to 90-year-old former Pope Benedict, who resigned in 2013 and is living on the grounds of the Vatican.

Michael McCarthy, 37, escaped conviction on the more serious charge of first-degree murder for allegedly punching 2-1/2-year-old Bella Bond to death in the apartment he shared with his former girlfriend, Rachelle Bond, and dumping her plastic-wrapped body in Massachusetts Bay. Defense attorney Jonathan Shapiro had tried to undercut Bond's testimony during the trial, which included describing seeing McCarthy punch the child so hard that her body bounced off a bed. He noted that Bond, 41, had repeatedly lied about her daughter's whereabouts in the weeks following her death. She had told some friends that she had been taken by the state, according to witness testimony. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters after the verdict was read that Bond's testimony was truthful.  Rachelle Bond's testimony was clearly valuable and credible because it was corroborated by forensic evidence that she did not know we would obtain,  Conley said, citing cell phone records that corroborated her testimony about the couple's whereabouts in the days following her death.

I don't think there was a shred of evidence that she was the real killer,  Conley said. McCarthy did not testify during his trial. He faces a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Had he been found guilty of first-degree murder as prosecutors had sought, parole would not have been an option. Shapiro vowed to appeal the verdict, calling it  a travesty of justice.  He had earlier expressed outrage at the judge's instructions to the jury that they did not need to conclude that McCarthy had acted entirely on his own. Bond pleaded guilty in February to being an accessory to murder after the fact and testified under a plea deal. A woman walking her dog discovered the child's decomposing remains in a plastic bag on a beach in June 2015.

Crew debt deal","keywords":"Shirley Werner Kornreich,JCREW,CREDITORS/ (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - A New York Supreme Court Justice sided with J. Crew Group Inc in a dispute with some of its senior lenders, allowing the U.S. preppy retailer to move forward with a restructuring deal to cut its $2.1 billion debt pile. The lenders had asked Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich to halt the deal because it unfairly gave collateral in the company, the J. Crew brand, to J. Crew's junior creditors. Kornreich denied the lenders' request because she said they did not show they would have success litigating it moving forward. The lenders can still pursue the case even though they lost an initial battle, but J. Crew is taking steps to dismiss the lawsuit. The small group of lenders is led by Eaton Vance Management and Highland Capital Management LP and they hold about $160 million of the term loan. The restructuring deal is supposed to help J. Crew avoid bankruptcy, a fate many of its peers have faced as retail goes through a major shift stemming from increasing consumer preference to shop online. Restructuring experts have been closely watching J. Crew because its deal could be a blueprint for other retailers with strong brand names to slash their debt without filing for bankruptcy. J. Crew is using its brand name to issue new debt to buy back existing bonds at a discount, helping it de-lever and avoid repayments for an additional two years. Millions in attorney fees had been spent trying to work out the restructuring deal J. Crew has achieved, Kornreich said.  On the other side is 10 to 12 percent of the (lenders) who say 'Blow it up,'  she said. Attorneys for the lenders argued that J. Crew needed approvals from all of the holders before making changes to agreements that permit its restructuring. The retailer had secured 88 percent approval. Moody's Investors Service published a report last month that named leather goods retailer Cole Haan, luxury label VINCE and canvas shoeseller TOMS Shoes as stressed brands that could pursue a path like J. Crew's. J. Crew had said in court papers that if the judge halted the deal by granting the lenders a so-called injunction, it would  devastate J. Crew's restructuring efforts and operations, with dire consequences for J. Crew and all of its stakeholders, including creditors and thousands of employees.

In a big setback to the seven-year Republican quest to undo Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to get the bill passed this week. McConnell, with his reputation as a master strategist on the line, put off a vote until after next week's Independence Day recess, when it became apparent he would not muster the 50 votes needed for passage. Acknowledging demands from fellow Republicans for more input into retooling the legislation, McConnell said on the Senate floor,  Senators will have more opportunities to offer their thoughts as we work toward an agreement.  With Democrats unified against it and Republicans controlling the Senate by a slim 52-48 margin, McConnell can afford to lose only two Republican senators to secure passage, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a tie-breaking vote. But at least nine Republican senators - including moderates, hard-line conservatives and others - have expressed opposition to the bill in its current form. The bill drew criticism from Republican moderates worried about millions of people losing their medical insurance and sharp cuts to the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor, and from conservatives unhappy it did not do enough to erase the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare.  Tinkering will not do it,  Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said of efforts to craft a bill that would pass.  If we do what President Trump suggested, if we put more money back in to try and improve the coverage for those Trump voters who were told on the campaign trail they'd have coverage, their pre-existing (medical) conditions addressed, if we take care of those Trump voters ... then we'll do the right thing,  Cassidy told CNN. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast on Monday that the Senate legislation would lead to some 22 million people losing their healthcare insurance over a decade while cutting the federal deficit by $321 billion over that period. Trump pledged on the campaign trail last year to overturn Obamacare but also promised nobody would lose coverage. 'Over the Line'  I think we're going to get it over the line,  Trump told reporters a day after meeting with most of the Republican senators at the White House to urge them to break the impasse. Republican Senator Rand Paul, a vocal conservative opponent of McConnell's legislation, said Republican leaders have already done a lot to  placate moderates  and that more elements of Obamacare needed to go to get conservatives on board.  Obamacare subsidies, keeping Obamacare regulations and creating a new big bailout of insurance companies - conservatives don't like any of those ideas,  Paul told MSNBC. Republicans have called Obamacare a costly government intrusion, and dismantling it became a top priority after they gained control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in January. The Obamacare law expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part through an expansion of Medicaid. The Senate legislation would drastically cut Medicaid beginning in 2025, phase out Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, repeal most of the law's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. The failure to push the Senate bill through rapidly has exposed frustration among some Republicans over the manner the bill was crafted - by a small group behind closed doors and unveiled only a week ago - and by Trump's changing stances on healthcare legislation. The House of Representatives passed its version of a healthcare bill last month after a similar struggle to get conservatives and moderates on the same page. The CBO has said some 23 million people would lose their coverage under the House bill over a decade. Senator Lindsey Graham was asked this week about Trump embracing the House plan with a White House Rose Garden celebration, only to later call it  mean.   Here's what I would tell any senator: If you're counting on the president to have your back you need to watch it,  Graham said on Monday. Public opinion polls released on Wednesday showed little overall support for the Senate bill. A Marist/National Public Radio/PBS public opinion poll showed 18 percent of U.S. voters supported it. A separate poll by Morning Consult/Politico, also conducted last week before the CBO issued its analysis, found Republicans evenly split over the Senate proposal's cuts to Medicaid. Another poll, by Morning Consult/Politico, found that nearly 20 percent of Republicans said the Senate bill went too far in changing the country's healthcare system while 31 percent said it did not go far enough.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made more expenditure his priority for NATO, using his first alliance meeting in May to scold European leaders about spending, which is at historical lows and does not meet NATO's target of 2 percent of GDP.  This year's 4.3 percent increase represents the fastest  growth since more than a decade of cuts ended in 2014. Spending growth was 1.8 pct in 2015 and 3.3 percent last year, although it was unclear how near that takes members to the target. Stoltenberg said the higher spending by Europe and Canada, some $280 billion this year, was NATO's way of showing Washington that the United States had reliable allies, after Trump repeatedly questioned the alliance's worth and only this month publicly committed to its mutual defense pledge.  For me, America First is not America alone,  Stoltenberg told reporters, referring to the new administration's foreign policy focused on U.S. interests and U.S. national security.  No other great power has that, China, Russia do not have anything like the U.S. has in NATO, 28 allies that stand together with the United States, which provide support.  Vital Capabilities Figures for individual allies will be released on Thursday, after approval by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's envoys, but overall 2017 spending will add to a cumulative $46 billion jump since cuts left Europe without vital capabilities, such as refueling airborne fighter bombers. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg addresses a news conference ahead of a NATO defence ministers meeting at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 28, 2017.Francois LenoirNATO officials stressed that while Trump's tough stance had put the spotlight on defense spending, Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 had a bigger impact. After that annexation, allies agreed to spend 2 percent of economic output on defense every year by 2024 and reverse a trend that saw military research spending in the European Union fall by more than 20 billion euros ($23 billion) since 2006. But only four of NATO's 27 European members - Greece, Britain, Poland and Estonia - met the spending target in 2016. Romania will also do so this year, followed by Latvia and Lithuania in 2018, Stoltenberg said. Slideshow (4 Images)Twenty five of NATO's 29 allies plan to lift spending this year, he said, a day before NATO defense ministers meet in Brussels to discuss greater security spending on rising threats including deterring a resurgent Russia, dealing with failed states on its borders and protecting against cyber attacks. For the first time, NATO governments will produce national plans this year showing how they will reach the 2024 spending pledge, focusing not just on spending increases but also monitoring troop contributions to missions and acquiring technology such as precision-guided munitions.  The new figures are part of a broader rise in military spending in Europe, as the United States commits billions more dollars to return troops and heavy weaponry to the continent to deter Russia, and as the European Union seeks to set up a multi-billion-euro defense fund.      We have really shifted gears, the trend is up and we intend to keep it up,  Stoltenberg said. He said the increase in funds would be spent on more military exercises, training and equipment and to allowing NATO troops to deploy at ever faster notice, as well to pay  salaries and pensions.  It's more about high-end forces, heavier forces and more ready forces, meaning we need forces that are fully equipped, fully manned and fully trained,  Stoltenberg said.

Bank stocks gained as the yield between five-year notes and 30-year bonds steepened, after falling to their lowest level since late 2007 overnight. Bond prices rebounded, following a Reuters report that the market had overinterpreted chief Mario Draghi's comments that the ECB was ready to start withdrawing the emergency stimulus for the economy. The financial index's 1.65 percent rise led the gainers, with Bank of America, JPMorgan boosting the S&P;, while Goldman Sachs helped lift the Dow. At 12:39 p.m. ET (1639 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 156.53 points, or 0.73 percent, at 21,467.19, the S&P; 500 was up 20.43 points, or 0.84 percent, at 2,439.81. The Nasdaq Composite was up 65.84 points, or 1.07 percent, at 6,212.46. The tech sector, which has been under pressure recently due to lofty valuations, was up 0.81 percent. Apple, Amazon and Facebook were the top boosts to the Nasdaq. With investors awaiting second-quarter corporate earnings, equity valuations have come under focus at a time when inflation remains low, recent economic data has been tepid and President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies face delays. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15 times.  Valuations are certainly a little bit elevated and they are a bit of a concern,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  We saw valuations run up in the first quarter but then when earnings came out they were pretty solid so ultimately if earnings continue at the rate we've seen recently, then those valuations will be fine.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that by standard metrics, some asset valuations look high while Vice Chair Stanley Fischer warned that central bank must remain vigilant in monitoring financial stability risks. San Francisco Fed head John Williams said investors may be getting overly complacent about risks and that  the stock market seems to be running pretty much on fumes.  Oil futures climbed to their highest in more than a week despite a surprise build in crude inventories, as buyers were encouraged by a small weekly decrease in U.S. production. KB Home was up 3.7 percent at $23.66 after the homebuilder increased its full-year forecast. General Mills rose 1.6 percent to $56.46 after the Cheerios maker's quarterly profit beat estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,346 to 514. On the Nasdaq, 2,137 issues rose and 634 fell.

Thailand is a regional center for migrant workers who come from poorer, neighboring countries including Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia in search of jobs. Rights groups say millions are vulnerable to abuse, including forced labor, in various Thai sectors including the country's multi billion dollar seafood industry. The 2017 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report said Thailand reported more investigations, prosecutions and convictions of trafficking cases but it did not demonstrate  increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period . It added that Thailand did not  convict officials complicit in trafficking crimes, and official complicity continued to impede anti-trafficking efforts .  What I want to see is perhaps more cooperation from the U.S. and for them to come to study what we have done so far,  government spokesman Weerachon Sukondhapatipak told Reuters on Wednesday.  Maybe they will see our progress differently,  he said. Earlier in the year, Thailand said it hoped to be upgraded from the Tier 2 watch list of nations not meeting minimum standards to end human trafficking. In 2016 the United States removed Thailand from its list of worst human trafficking offenders, known as Tier 3, following efforts by the military government to fight trafficking in response to international criticism, including through reforms of its anti-trafficking laws. In 2015 Southeast Asia saw more than 4,000 migrants land on the shores of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Bangladesh following a Thai crackdown on people-smuggling gangs. Some of those arrested in the crackdown are on trial in Bangkok in what has been called the largest human trafficking trial in Thai history. A verdict is expected next month but rights groups say the arrests were just the tip of an extensive smuggling and trafficking network. Thailand is Washington's oldest ally in the region, but ties were strained by a 2014 military coup that ousted an elected civilian government. Since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, however, relations between the two nations appear to have improved, with Trump inviting Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to visit the White House. In the 2017 TIP report the State Department placed China on its global list of the worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor. It upgraded Myanmar to the Tier 2 Watch List.

Crew Group Inc in a dispute with some of its senior lenders, allowing the U.S. preppy retailer to move forward with a restructuring deal to cut its $2.1 billion debt pile. The lenders had asked Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich to halt the deal because it unfairly gave collateral in the company, the J. Crew brand, to J. Crew's junior creditors. Kornreich denied the lenders' request because she said they did not show they would have success litigating it moving forward. The lenders can still pursue the case even though they lost an initial battle, but J. Crew is taking steps to dismiss the lawsuit. The small group of lenders is led by Eaton Vance Management and Highland Capital Management LP and they hold about $160 million of the term loan. The restructuring deal is supposed to help J. Crew avoid bankruptcy, a fate many of its peers have faced as retail goes through a major shift stemming from increasing consumer preference to shop online. Restructuring experts have been closely watching J. Crew because its deal could be a blueprint for other retailers with strong brand names to slash their debt without filing for bankruptcy. J. Crew is using its brand name to issue new debt to buy back existing bonds at a discount, helping it de-lever and avoid repayments for an additional two years. Millions in attorney fees had been spent trying to work out the restructuring deal J. Crew has achieved, Kornreich said.   On the other side is 10 to 12 percent of the (lenders) who say 'Blow it up,'  she said.  Attorneys for the lenders argued that J. Crew needed approvals from all of the holders before making changes to agreements that permit its restructuring. The retailer had secured 88 percent approval. Moody's Investors Service published a report last month that named leather goods retailer Cole Haan, luxury label VINCE and canvas shoeseller TOMS Shoes as stressed brands that could pursue a path like J. Crew's. J. Crew had said in court papers that if the judge halted the deal by granting the lenders a so-called injunction, it would  devastate J. Crew's restructuring efforts and operations, with dire consequences for J. Crew and all of its stakeholders, including creditors and thousands of employees.

At least 80 people are dead, or missing and presumed dead, from the inferno that gutted the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block in west London on June 14 as families and children slept, and that figure is expected to rise. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack, the officer in charge of the police investigation, said the final death toll would only be known after officers completed a painstaking search and recovery operation which would take until the end of the year to complete.  We are many months from being able to provide a number that we believe accurately represents the total loss of life inside Grenfell Tower,  McCormack said. The authorities have been under pressure to say exactly how many people lost their lives amid accusations from local residents that the true figure is being kept quiet. The blaze in a social housing block close to one of Britain's richest neighborhoods has become a lightning rod for anger at May's government with opponents blaming public spending cuts for the fire having such a devastating effect. McCormack said a list of the tower's occupants from its management company had been inaccurate, and police were using  every imaginable source  - from government agencies to fast food delivery companies - to find out who was in the apartments. Police had spoken to at least one occupant of 106 of the block's 129 apartments and this revealed that 18 people living in those homes had died.                              That means though, and it is a terrible reality, that there are 23 flats where despite huge investigative efforts we have been unable to trace anyone alive who lived there,  McCormack said.  So at this stage we must presume that no one in those 23 flats survived.  She said it was not clear how many people lived in the 23 apartments, although there had been 26 emergency calls made from people who said they were in the properties at the time. However, because of the intense heat, the remains of some victims might never be located and some might never be identified. A small number of apartments remain too unsafe for investigators to enter. Wider Issue The fire broke out in a fridge freezer but spread rapidly, engulfing the entire tower block and police said aluminum tiles and insulation which made up exterior cladding had failed fire safety tests. May told parliament that cladding on 120 other tower blocks has flunked tests, showing there was a wider fire safety issue.  As we have seen from the number of buildings where the cladding has failed the combustibility test..., this is a much wider issue,  she said.  It's an issue that has been continuing for many years, for decades, in terms of cladding being put up in buildings. There are real questions as to how this has happened, why it's happened and how we can ensure that it doesn't happen in the future.  Police have said they will consider manslaughter charges as part of a range of possible criminal offences committed by those responsible for Grenfell Tower and refurbishment work, completed in 2016, which added the cladding. McCormack said 60 firms involved in the refurbishment were assisting the investigation. Editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-fire-idUSKBN19J1VO"},

Crew Group Inc in a dispute with some of its senior lenders, allowing the U.S. preppy retailer to move forward with a restructuring deal to cut its $2.1 billion debt pile. The lenders had asked Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich to halt the deal because it unfairly gave collateral in the company, the J. Crew brand, to J. Crew's junior creditors. Kornreich denied the lenders' request because she said they did not show they would have success litigating it moving forward. The lenders can still pursue the case even though they lost an initial battle, but J. Crew is taking steps to dismiss the lawsuit. The small group of lenders is led by Eaton Vance Management and Highland Capital Management LP and they hold about $160 million of the term loan. The restructuring deal is supposed to help J. Crew avoid bankruptcy, a fate many of its peers have faced as retail goes through a major shift stemming from increasing consumer preference to shop online. Restructuring experts have been closely watching J. Crew because its deal could be a blueprint for other retailers with strong brand names to slash their debt without filing for bankruptcy. J. Crew is using its brand name to issue new debt to buy back existing bonds at a discount, helping it de-lever and avoid repayments for an additional two years. Millions in attorney fees had been spent trying to work out the restructuring deal J. Crew has achieved, Kornreich said.   On the other side is 10 to 12 percent of the (lenders) who say 'Blow it up,'  she said.  Attorneys for the lenders argued that J. Crew needed approvals from all of the holders before making changes to agreements that permit its restructuring. The retailer had secured 88 percent approval. Moody's Investors Service published a report last month that named leather goods retailer Cole Haan, luxury label VINCE and canvas shoeseller TOMS Shoes as stressed brands that could pursue a path like J. Crew's. J. Crew had said in court papers that if the judge halted the deal by granting the lenders a so-called injunction, it would  devastate J. Crew's restructuring efforts and operations, with dire consequences for J. Crew and all of its stakeholders, including creditors and thousands of employees.

At least 80 people are dead, or missing and presumed dead, from the inferno that gutted the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block in west London on June 14 as families and children slept, and that figure is expected to rise. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack, the officer in charge of the police investigation, said the final death toll would only be known after officers completed a painstaking search and recovery operation which would take until the end of the year to complete.  We are many months from being able to provide a number that we believe accurately represents the total loss of life inside Grenfell Tower,  McCormack said. The authorities have been under pressure to say exactly how many people lost their lives amid accusations from local residents that the true figure is being kept quiet. The blaze in a social housing block close to one of Britain's richest neighborhoods has become a lightning rod for anger at May's government with opponents blaming public spending cuts for the fire having such a devastating effect. McCormack said a list of the tower's occupants from its management company had been inaccurate, and police were using  every imaginable source  - from government agencies to fast food delivery companies - to find out who was in the apartments. Police had spoken to at least one occupant of 106 of the block's 129 apartments and this revealed that 18 people living in those homes had died.                              That means though, and it is a terrible reality, that there are 23 flats where despite huge investigative efforts we have been unable to trace anyone alive who lived there,  McCormack said.  So at this stage we must presume that no one in those 23 flats survived.  She said it was not clear how many people lived in the 23 apartments, although there had been 26 emergency calls made from people who said they were in the properties at the time. However, because of the intense heat, the remains of some victims might never be located and some might never be identified. A small number of apartments remain too unsafe for investigators to enter. Wider Issue The fire broke out in a fridge freezer but spread rapidly, engulfing the entire tower block and police said aluminum tiles and insulation which made up exterior cladding had failed fire safety tests. May told parliament that cladding on 120 other tower blocks has flunked tests, showing there was a wider fire safety issue.  As we have seen from the number of buildings where the cladding has failed the combustibility test..., this is a much wider issue,  she said.  It's an issue that has been continuing for many years, for decades, in terms of cladding being put up in buildings. There are real questions as to how this has happened, why it's happened and how we can ensure that it doesn't happen in the future.  Police have said they will consider manslaughter charges as part of a range of possible criminal offences committed by those responsible for Grenfell Tower and refurbishment work, completed in 2016, which added the cladding. McCormack said 60 firms involved in the refurbishment were assisting the investigation. Editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-fire-idUSL8N1JP4FD"},

LendUp's chief executive, Sasha Orloff, said in an interview that the company was planning to use new injection of cash to expand its customer base and was also exploring ways it could work with PayPal. A PayPal employee demonstrates one of the company's options to pay with a mobile device at store within a PayPal office building in San Jose, California May 28, 2014.Beck Diefenbach Dan Schulman has been very vocal about supporting the underserved,  Orloff said, referring to PayPal's chief executive. PayPal has been expanding partnerships and acquiring new services to gain advantage over rivals in a highly competitive digital payments market. LendUp describes its first product, LendUp Ladder, as an alternative to traditional payday loans. It carries a flat fee and allows users to borrow more if they earn points by paying back their loans on time or watching financial education videos.

Researchers examined data on 950 people in Australia and New Zealand with stable coronary artery disease, which happens when plaque accumulates in the arteries supplying the heart and causes them to harden and narrow. Also called atherosclerosis, this process can weaken the heart muscle, cause an irregular heartbeat and lead to heart attacks.  About 4 percent of participants reported regularly suffering from moderate or severe psychological distress over the first four years of the study, and they were roughly four times more likely to die of heart disease and almost three times more likely to die from any cause during the next 12 years compared to people with no distress. The heart patients who reported only occasional or mild distress, however, didn’t appear to have an increased risk of premature death, researchers report in the journal Heart. “This really indicates that over the longer term it is the amount of distress that matters,” said lead author Dr. Ralph Stewart, a cardiologist at Auckland City Hospital and the University of Auckland. “We do not yet know whether treatments for anxiety and distress reduce mortality, but there is enough evidence to recommend that people should look for ways to reduce high levels of persistent distress,” Stewart said by email.  At the start of the study, all of the participants had experienced a heart attack or hospitalization for unstable angina, when the heart doesn’t get enough blood flow or receive enough oxygen, in the previous 3 to 36 months.  They completed a psychological questionnaire when they joined the study, and again after six months and at one year, two years and four years.  Questions to assess depression and anxiety asked, among other things, if participants felt constantly under strain, found life a struggle all the time, got scared or panicky for no good reason, or thought they played a useful part in things.  Overall, 587 people, or 62 percent, were not distressed at any of the psychological assessments. Another 255 individuals, or 27 percent, reported at least mild distress during two or more assessments and 35 people, or about 4 percent, regularly suffered from moderate or severe psychological distress.  Researchers followed half of the participants for at least 12 years. During this monitoring period, 398 people died from all causes and 199 died from cardiovascular disease. The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that depression or anxiety causes premature death for people with heart disease.  Another limitation of the study is that the psychological assessments stopped after four years, so it’s possible the findings might underestimate the impact of persistent distress, the authors note.  The psychological assessment used in the study also doesn’t do a good job of pinpointing the exact nature of stress and is no longer used for assessing it, Dr. Gjin Ndrepepa, a researcher with the German Heart Center Munich at the Technical University of Munich, writes in an accompanying editorial.  But mental distress can activate the body’s so-called flight or fight response, the sympathetic nervous system, and boost levels of stress hormones, Ndrepepa told Reuters Health by email. This might contribute to elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes and prompt unhealthy behaviors like smoking or drinking or being inactive.  “These stress-related internal and external adverse reactions aggravate the progression of the disease and predispose people to poor outcomes including increased odds of death,” Ndrepepa said. “My belief is that depressed patients with coronary heart disease, particularly severely depressed ones, should be treated for depression.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tYpfHi and bit.ly/2tl15Zy Heart, online June 26, 2017.

Judge Joan Lefkow questioned a proposal made by attorneys representing Illinois' 3 million Medicaid recipients that would force the cash-strapped state to send $2 billion to managed-care organizations over four months to pay down a $3.1 billion bill backlog. The attorneys also asked for an additional $586 million in monthly payments to providers starting July 1, noting that federal Medicaid reimbursements would cut Illinois' total outlay about in half. The judge called the proposed funding scheme a  significant jump.  In her June 7 order, which found Illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding Medicaid, Lefkow said plaintiffs were merely seeking sufficient payments to sustain services. But negotiations ordered by the judge failed to reach a deal. Brent Stratton, an assistant Illinois Attorney General, told the judge the plaintiffs were attempting to get  blood from a stone,  given the state's lack of a budget for two years and its $15 billion pile of unpaid bills. Lefkow instructed the state to submit its proposal for a $75 million increase in monthly Medicaid payments that would be matched by $75 million in federal funds, along with a plan to reduce outstanding unpaid bills. She also asked the other side to present evidence that Medicaid recipients were being denied care due to the state's nonpayment of bills. Illinois' payments out of its operating fund for the Medicaid and other federal consent decrees total about $160 million a month. David Chizewer, an attorney for Medicaid recipients, said by accepting federal Medicaid dollars Illinois must comply with the consent decrees that stem from lawsuits filed in 1992 and with federal law.  We are not asking them to print up money that doesn't exist, but for a shift in priorities,  he said. In a court filing on Tuesday, Assistant Illinois Comptroller Kevin Schoeben said increasing the amount of priority payments made out of the state's general fund for Medicaid beyond the proposed additional $75 million would result in insufficient revenue to make full monthly payments to other priorities such as pensions and payroll. Meanwhile, Illinois lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass a budget ahead of the Saturday start of fiscal 2018.

Ireland's export-focussed economy is considered the most vulnerable among the EU's remaining members to Brexit due to its close trade links with Britain, putting tens of thousands of jobs and potential economic growth at risk. Irish exporters are particularly concerned that a  hard Brexit  -- where Britain would leave the EU's single market and customs union -- will lead to a costly rise in tariffs, paperwork and transit times. However, in its annual national risk assessment report, the government said that tariffs could also have a big knock on effect on goods coming the other way given Irish firms reliance on raw materials from Britain and the presence of so many major British-based retail chains on the Irish high street.  As the UK is one of Ireland's most important sources of intermediate and consumption goods, the aforementioned concerns (on tariffs) could increase import costs,  a draft copy of the report that was published on Wednesday said.  In the energy sector, for example, Ireland imports around 88 percent of its total energy requirements, mainly through the UK. This could have an inflationary impact, which would see Irish consumers face higher product prices and the cost base for Irish manufacturers rise.  British household names with a major presence in Ireland include Tesco, the country's second largest supermarket operator, Marks & Spencer, Debenhams and the Sainsbury-owned general merchandise retailer Argos. So far Brexit has had the opposite effect on prices with a sharp fall in the value of sterling against the euro making imports cheaper for those companies to help keep inflation at near non-existent levels despite a rapid economic growth.

The city's Civilian Complaint Review Board cited 346 separate allegations that officers knocked phones out of people's hands, stood in front of their cameras or threatened them with arrest, among other forms of interference. The agency had analyzed 257 complaints it received from 2014 through 2016.  When police interference with civilian recording occurs, it violates core constitutional rights, and diminishes an important tool used to ensure police accountability,  the board wrote in a report released on Wednesday. The allegations represented fewer than 2 percent of the 15,000 complaints the board received in the three-year period. But the report emphasized that civilian video had become an increasingly crucial source of evidence for misconduct claims. In 2012, only 1 percent of complaints filed with the board included video evidence. By 2016, that figure had risen to 18 percent. Several high-profile police killings gained widespread attention in recent years as a direct result of citizen video recordings. For example, a bystander's video of the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, in South Carolina in 2015 led directly to the officer's conviction for federal civil rights violations. And the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Philando Castile in Minnesota last year was streamed live by his girlfriend, drawing national attention. The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, was acquitted earlier this month after he testified that he feared for his life. Federal courts in New York have recognized that civilians have the right to record police activity under the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. The New York City Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report. The board said it had substantiated 28 percent of the complaints, while it concluded there was not enough evidence to make a determination in 42 percent of the cases. In 11 percent of the complaints, the officers' actions were found to be lawful, and the allegations were determined to be unfounded in 6 percent. The report acknowledged that the NYPD had previously instructed officers to allow civilians to record police activity in public places. But the board recommended that the department add a new section to the patrol guide that clearly defines improper interference on an officer's part.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/new-york-police-idUSL1N1JP16A"},

The Brazilian real strengthened 0.6 percent after trading near flat earlier in the session. The country's benchmark Bovespa stock index fell as much as 0.4 percent before rebounding to gain 0.5 percent at its peak.     A growing corruption scandal has fueled bets of delays to the implementation of planned reforms of the country's pension system and labor laws.

Shares of college operator Estácio Participações SA  slid 2 percent, the biggest decliner on the Bovespa index, as regulators looked set to veto a tie-up with larger rival Kroton Educacional SA, whose shares rose 1.2 percent.     A person with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters that Brazil's antitrust watchdog Cade believes the transaction, which would lead to the creation of the world's No. 1 for-profit education company by number of students and market capitalization, is not politically palatable.

Putin's carefully-choreographed trip to the woman's Urals home, with state media on hand to cover, is part of a pre-election Kremlin drive to project the image of a caring leader as poverty rises nationwide and the economy slows. Putin is expected to seek another term next March and, though he is all but certain to be re-elected by a landslide, he has shown he is eager to address mounting social grievances across his vast nation of 146 million. Anastasia Votintseva had complained to the Kremlin leader during a televised question-and-answer session this month that she had to live in unsanitary conditions in a ramshackle wooden house. She said she was afraid the ceiling would one day collapse onto her children. Putin, live on air, promised at the time to personally visit her and help solve her problem. He made good on his promise on Tuesday, dropping in on Votintseva and her neighbors who live in a rickety, barracks-style two-storey house in the Urals mountain city of Izhevsk.  His visit was timed to coincide with the woman's 27th birthday.

The STOXX 600 ended flat as further gains among financials, which benefit from tighter monetary policy, drove the pan-European index off a 2-month low hit in morning trading. Investors remained focused on when the European Central Bank would begin winding down its stimulus after comments on Tuesday from President Mario Draghi that were taken as a hawkish swing, lifting the euro and boosting banks. Europe's broader banking index rose 1.3 percent, leading sectoral gainers in the region. Top gainer was Italy's UniCredit, up 4.1 percent, followed by Bankia , which rose 4 percent, helped by a price target upgrade at Berenberg one day after the Spanish lender bought smaller peer BMN in a $924 million deal. Utilities, which instead benefit from loose monetary policy, fell 0.2 percent but came off lows after media reports that Draghi's remarks on Tuesday had been overinterpreted. German utilities RWE and E.ON were among the worst performers, down 2.4 and 1.3 percent respectively. A trader at a European brokerage said his firm was overweight on banks, autos and consumer cyclicals on bets of economic growth, but underweight on utilities and other sectors like telecoms which suffer when interest rates rise. Technology stocks fell 0.6 percent, taking their cue from losses in U.S. peers in the previous session, with stocks involved in cybersecurity and virus protection failing to get a boost from the latest cyber attack that swept the globe. Anti-virus provider Sophos fell 5.9 percent after a downgrade from Cenkos to hold from buy that followed a 75 percent rally for the stock over the past six months.  It was a 'best idea' and remains a core tech holding for us. However, after such a run the prospect of further outsized returns has significantly diminished in the near term,  Cenkos analyst Martin O'Sullivan said in a note. Nestle rose 1.3 percent, remaining close to record highs, after the Swiss food giant said it planned a 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.84 billion) share buyback, a few days after activist shareholder Third Point began a campaign to boost performance at the group.  Nestle is still not targeting its full potential...This leaves room for further accelerations and means activist shareholders might continue to keep the high pressure on Nestle,  said Baader Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx, who has a buy rating on the stock. Elsewhere, Tullow Oil rose 1.5 percent. The stock had earlier fallen following the release of its first-half results. Business supplies distributor Bunzl bounced 1.5 percent after saying a boost in recent acquisitions would help it increase first-half revenue 7 percent.

The blanket 90-day ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - and a 120-day ban on all refugees was completely blocked by lower courts after Trump issued it on March 6, saying it was needed to prevent terrorism attacks. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled the bans could proceed, though only for foreigners with no  bona fide relationship  with an American entity or person, and it did not specify what that meant. The ruling left some in the Middle East wondering if they would be able to enter the United States.  It's a big disappointment for me,  said a 52-year-old Sudanese man in the capital Khartoum, who believed he would now be rejected for a visa to visit relatives in the United States. The man, who declined to be identified, said he wouldn't know the outcome until at least Sunday, when the U.S. Embassy opens again after a string of national holidays.  I've travelled to America before and I don't know why I'm prevented from travelling (now). I didn't violate American law during my previous visits,  he told Reuters. At the U.S. Consulate in Dubai, where there is normally a queue out the door of people waiting to process visa applications, a Reuters reporter saw few people. Middle East airlines have yet to receive a directive from the United States following the ruling, industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The sources said U.S. flights would continue to operate as normal until guidance is received. Major airlines based in the region include Dubai-based Emirates Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways. Iranian nationals attempting to get visas at the U.S. Embassy in the Turkish capital Ankara - Washington does not have an embassy in Iran - also expressed concern.  What is the reason behind this law? It's all very unclear,  said Masoud, a 28-year-old engineer who was applying for a student visa after being accepted into a doctoral programme at a university in Dallas, Texas.  This is not fair.  Nearby, another Iranian national, 27-year-old Nima, also said he was hoping to get a visa to pursue an advanced degree in the United States.  I just hope that I can get my visa soon and on time,  he told Reuters.  We don't know anything about where this may lead, but I wish they would extract Iran from this country list.

Women are routinely castigated in some countries for exposing their flesh to nurse, even though breastfeeding is considered the best health option for mother and child. “We have allocated a room from which legislators with babies will breastfeed their children,” said Tulia Ackson, deputy speaker of the Tanzania National Assembly. “ We would like to ensure that the babies are in a good health,”  she told the chamber. Some legislators welcomed the new Tanzanian move as a way to help women balance work and family life and as the best option for babies' health.  However advocates say women should be free to nurse openly in the chamber, in defiance of critics who call it indecent.  Last month an Australian senator made history by breastfeeding as she addressed the chamber, months after a Spanish MP provoked criticism for nursing in parliament. Lawmakers are not allowed to feed their babies in the Tanzanian parliament and must now use the set-aside room to nurse when it is in session. Ackson said the move aimed to encourage breastfeeding and was in line with a directive from the country’s health ministry that babies should be breastfed for at least two years. Yet the country has a mixed record when it comes to nursing mothers. Last week, President John Magufuli said that schoolgirls who become mothers would not be let back into school after giving birth, and appeared to mock the young mothers for multitasking.  After calculating some few mathematics, she’d be asking the teacher in the classroom ‘let me go out and breastfeed my crying baby,'  said President Magufuli. The provision for breastfeeding lawmakers won more support. Lucy Mayenga, a so-called special seat legislator - who is nominated by her party rather than elected - said the facility would help lactating MPs do both their jobs. “ I think it is a very good thing, the MPs with children will accomplish two things in one” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In March last year, Kenya's parliament approved a bill forcing companies to set aside special breastfeeding areas for employees with children. Senator Larissa Waters made Australian history in May by becoming the first woman to nurse a baby in parliament, after new rules authorized lawmakers to breastfeed in the chamber. The World Health Organization recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for their first six months then eat a diet of breast milk and other food until they are two years old. Breast milk provides natural antibodies that protect against illness, and is usually more easily digested than formula. Advocates also say it strengthens ties between mother and child and offers health benefits to the nursing mother.  In Britain, Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, brought her four-month-old son to the Commons, breaking her maternity leave to vote for the historic Brexit bill. Speaker of the House John Bercow was quick to allay any fears she had about bringing in her new baby.  I say to the honorable lady, 'don't be sheepish about it!' The little baby is welcome to come in. There's no problem,  he was quoted as saying.

The dollar index slid as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said a debate on the need to raise interest rates is due  in the coming months,  adding to a hawkish tone out of the European Central Bank on Tuesday. Carney's remarks convinced traders that European monetary policy was shifting in a more hawkish direction, analysts said. The monetary policy comments out of Europe and Britain come as the U.S. Senate delayed a healthcare legislation vote, a move seen as pushing back the timeline for other items of President Donald Trump's agenda including a tax overhaul regarded as essential to support lofty stock valuations on Wall Street.  Prospects for infrastructure spending and tax reform are fading by the minute  after the delayed healthcare vote, said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. U.S. economic data released on Wednesday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in May, the third straight monthly decline, while mortgage applications fell the most in six months last week. U.S. stocks recovered most of their broad losses from the previous session, however. Bank stocks led the way, supported by a steeper Treasury yield curve . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 159.1 points, or 0.75 percent, to 21,469.76, the S&P; 500 gained 19.53 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,438.91 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.44 points, or 0.92 percent, to 6,203.07.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.29 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.47 percent. Analysts said comments by ECB President Mario Draghi on Tuesday continued to support the euro even as sources said on Wednesday that he had intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not imminent policy tightening. “There is a bigger story here that has to do with the repricing in general of monetary policy expectations,” said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. “There is a bit of a concern in the markets about the fact that the balance of monetary policy expectations is moving a little bit in a more hawkish direction in Europe, and you’ve seen that with the BOE, you’ve seen that with the ECB.

Oil futures climbed to their highest in more than a week despite a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories, as buyers were encouraged by a small weekly decrease in U.S. production.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Stable. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this commentary. The downgrade follows Nestle's announcement of a CHF20 billion share buy-back programme commencing from 4 July 2017. This will increase funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to around 2.2x by 2020 and  reduce free cash flow (FCF) margin to an average of 2.7%, weakening the group's financial flexibility. Fitch expects the operating environment to remain challenged by innovation, changing consumer habits and slowing organic growth. Positively, the ratings of Nestle continue to reflect the stability and strength of its business as the world's largest food company, benefiting from scale and geographic diversification. The group is well-placed to continue defending its operational scale and market share, despite more subdued growth potential and changes in supply chain dynamics, and to improve margins, thus supporting our Stable Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Weakened Financial Profile: We expect Nestle to fund the announced share buyback programme predominantly from debt, which will increase FFO adjusted net leverage to 2.2x by 2020, above our negative guidance of 2.0x. Such leverage is not commensurate with a 'AA' rating, supporting a downgrade of the rating by one notch to 'AA-'. In our rating case projections, we also factor in the sale of Nestle's US confectionary business in 2018. Scope to Grow Profit Margins:  Fitch conservatively expects profit margins to increase only moderately by 2020. In line with its peer Unilever NV/PLC (A+/Negative), we expect Nestle to be able to identify cost efficiencies and to achieve some margin uplift. However, this will likely take time to deliver and involve execution risk. However, we estimate that FFO margin will decline to 14% through to 2020 from an average of 15% during 2012-2016 due to higher cash interest and tax costs. This, together with by capex (including intangibles) remaining above 5% of sales, will constrain FCF margin (after dividends) to an average 2.7% over 2017- 2020, below our prior negative sensitivity of 3% Organic Revenue Growth Softening: We expect overall group revenue growth to be lower in the range of 3%-4% over 2017-2020 due to a structural shift towards healthier foods, changing consumer habits and increasing competition. Nestle has revised down its organic growth target for 2017 to 2%-4% and to mid-single digits by 2020, from its historical long-term target of 5%-6%. Solid Business Profile: Nestle's organic growth performance remains at the top end of major fast-moving consumer goods peer group and the group continues to achieve market share gains in several categories and countries. This helps keep Nestle's business risk profile in line with the 'AA' rating category for the sector. Diversification Complements Resilient Business: Nestle benefits from high business stability and low capex and R&D; spending requirements, despite operating in highly competitive segments, compared with other highly rated corporations. Furthermore, within its industry Nestle benefits from a portfolio of several high profit margin categories, from ownership of some of the strongest brands as well as from consistent and successful innovation. Balanced geographical diversity between developed and emerging markets further supports the 'AA-' rating. Foreign Exchange Volatility: Although Nestle enjoys balanced geographical diversity between developed and emerging markets, profits are exposed to emerging market currency devaluation. A portion of operating costs is denominated in domestic currencies but translation risks can still erode reported profits. Moreover, while Nestle maintains local currency-denominated debt at many of its emerging markets subsidiaries, the majority of the group's debt is in hard currencies, thus limiting the benefits of these natural hedges. Mitigating this risk is Nestle's track record of gradually increasing prices, albeit with a time lag, in countries suffering from currency devaluation. DERIVATION SUMMARY Nestle is well-positioned as the largest food company in the world by revenue and profit and enjoys balanced geographical diversity between developed and emerging markets. The announced CHF20 billion share buyback programme weakens Nestle's financial profile, which is now more commensurate with a 'AA-' rating relative to other sector peers. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include - Group revenue growth of 3%-4% per annum to 2020 - Operating margin of 15.8% by 2020 - Annual pre-dividend FCF margin averaging 8.8% to 2020 - Capex (including intangibles) averaging 5.2% of revenues to 2019 - Moderate growth of dividend share - CHF20 billion share buyback between 2017 and 2020 - Bolt-on acquisitions totalling CHF500 million in 2017 and CHF1.5 billion-CHF1.6 billion in 2018 and 2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action We do not anticipate an upgrade in the immediate term but future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include - FFO adjusted net leverage consistently below 2.0x (2016: 1.4x) as a result of asset sale proceeds, or improvement in operations. - Renewed commitment to operating with credit metrics consistent with a higher rating Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably above 2.3x - Deterioration in FCF generation after dividends, taking FCF margin below 2.5% (2016: 3.9%) - Significant or prolonged downturn in emerging markets, or in main developed markets, causing a slowdown in organic growth (below 3%) and reduction in profits (EBIT margin below 14%) - FFO fixed charge coverage (including rents) below 9x (2016: 12.9x) LIQUIDITY As of end-2016 Nestle had liquidity of CHF18.4 billion, comprising CHF7.2 billion of Fitch calculated cash and cash equivalents which are readily available for debt service and committed undrawn back-up bank facilities of CHF11.2 billion. This is sufficient to cover 100% of Nestle's short-term debt obligations (CHF12.1 billion) consisting of bonds and bank loans due in the coming 12 months as well as outstanding commercial papers (CHF7.2 billion).

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments -Leases: Fitch has adjusted the debt by adding 8x annual operating lease expense related to an estimate of long-term assets of CHF581 million in 2016. Despite being based in Switzerland, the lease capitalisation multiple of 8x reflects Nestle's asset base spread in various countries around the world. -Adjustment for restricted/not available cash: The restricted cash comprises cash placed in margin accounts for which we do not give any face value to.

Spectranetics uses techniques including lasers and tiny drug-covered balloons to clean the insides of veins and arteries that have become clogged due to heart disease. Philips will pay Spectranetics shareholders $38.50 per share, a 27 percent premium to their closing price on June 27. Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten has transformed the former conglomerate into a focused maker of healthcare equipment over the past five years, spinning off its lighting division (LIGHT.AS) and selling most of its remaining consumer products business. Philips said Spectranetics, which expects sales of around $300 million this year, will continue to grow revenues at double-digit rates and will begin adding to Philips' earnings in 2018. The deal strengthens Philips' position in heart disease therapy following its acquisition of vascular imaging company Volcano in early 2015, van Houten told reporters. A Philips logo is seen at Philips headquarters in Amsterdam, January 28, 2014.Toussaint Kluiters/United Photos/File PhotoAfter the acquisition  we will have quite a nice lineup of devices for both heart, coronary, peripheral, vascular therapies,  he said.  In combination with our image-guided systems which enable doctors to see inside the body and use these tools, we have a very compelling market position.   Philips shares dipped 1.35 percent to 32.1 euros in morning trading in Amsterdam. Analysts from Berenburg, which rates the shares 'Hold', said the acquisition was a good strategic fit but would not increase Philips' return on invested capital for five years.  In our view, this is a nice technology-rich company and adds scale and breadth to Philips’ existing portfolio of mechanical atherectomy and intravascular ultrasound – but clearly this is a punchy price to pay,  they said in a note.      Separately on Wednesday, Philips announced a new 1.5 billion euro share buyback program that will begin in the third quarter and run for two years. CEO van Houten denied that the company had acted under pressure from activist U.S. hedge fund Third Point LLC, which has recently acquired a stake in Philips below the three percent threshold that would require disclosure under Dutch securities law. Van Houten said he has not had any communication with Third Point.

(GIMSA). Gruma recently launched a public offer to acquire up to 14.5% equity stake of GIMSA. The amount of the transaction is estimated at MXN3.3 billion and will be financed with an unsecured committed revolving credit facility for up to USD250 million maturing in 2022. Fitch believes this acquisition is manageable for Gruma's credit profile. Its total debt/EBITDA and net debt/EBITDA, including the acquisition, are estimated by Fitch to increase to 1.6x and 1.2x, respectively, by year end 2017. These leverage metrics are in line with the company's current 'BBB' rating level and are within the range previously expected by Fitch. For the LTM ended March 31, 2017, Gruma's total debt/EBITDA and total net debt/EBITDA calculated by Fitch were 1.2x and 0.9x, respectively. Fitch also views the acquisition as positive for the company as it will have full control of the operating cash flow coming from this subsidiary and will eliminate the dividend leakage to minority shareholders. GIMSA's revenue and EBITDA represents around 26% and 27%, respectively, of its consolidated figures. Gruma's ratings reflect its solid business position as one of the largest producers of corn and flour tortillas in the world with operations in USA, Mexico, Europe, Central America, Asia and Oceania. Its ratings also incorporate the company's good operating performance, solid free cash flow (FCF) generation and sound financial position. The ratings are tempered by the exposure to the volatility in prices of its main raw material (corn) and currency fluctuations. Fitch currently rates Gruma as follows: --Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --Long-Term Local Currency IDR 'BBB'; --USD400 million senior unsecured notes due 2024 'BBB'.

The blanket 90-day ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - and a 120-day ban on all refugees was completely blocked by lower courts after Trump issued it on March 6, saying it was needed to prevent terrorism attacks.  On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled the bans could proceed, though only for foreigners with no  bona fide relationship  with an American entity or person, and it did not specify what that meant. The ruling left some in the Middle East wondering if they would be able to enter the United States.  It's a big disappointment for me,  said a 52-year-old Sudanese man in the capital Khartoum, who believed he would now be rejected for a visa to visit relatives in the United States. The man, who declined to be identified, said he wouldn't know the outcome until at least Sunday, when the U.S. Embassy opens again after a string of national holidays.  I've traveled to America before and I don't know why I'm prevented from traveling (now). I didn't violate American law during my previous visits,  he told Reuters.

Middle East airlines have yet to receive a directive from the United States following the ruling, industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The sources said U.S. flights would continue to operate as normal until guidance is received.

Iranian nationals attempting to get visas at the U.S. Embassy in the Turkish capital Ankara - Washington does not have an embassy in Iran - also expressed concern.   What is the reason behind this law? It's all very unclear,  said Masoud, a 28-year-old engineer who was applying for a student visa after being accepted into a doctoral program at a university in Dallas, Texas.  This is not fair.

Jackson, already a Hall of Fame member after winning a record 11 NBA titles as coach of the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, was touted as a savior but never came close to delivering the Knicks their first championship since 1973. Instead, his tenure will be remembered most for his clashes with leading players and team officials, contract blunders and an insistence on running a complex offensive system known as the triangle offense.  After careful thought and consideration, we mutually agreed that the Knicks will be going in a different direction,  Knicks Executive Chairman Jim Dolan said in a statement. He added that Knicks General Manager Steve Mills would run the day-to-day business of the organization over the short term. The front-office change means Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, who was hired by Jackson in the last off season, should have more freedom with running the team should he remain in his role. Jackson has recently been making headlines for a difference in opinion regarding the future of 10-times All-Star Carmelo Anthony's future with the team. He had also been listening to trade offers for Latvian forward Kristaps Porzingis, who is considered by many to be the future of the franchise. No Quick Fix Jackson, a link to the Knicks' glory days as a defensive-minded role player on teams that won two NBA titles in the early 1970s, moved to New York for his first front-office job three years after retiring from coaching. He was introduced at a packed news conference at Madison Square Garden, the team's home arena, where he said there would be no quick fix, adding there was much work to do in reshaping a team that has relied heavily on the scoring of Anthony. In their three full seasons under Jackson, the Knicks have failed to produce a winning campaign and their record over that dismal span is among the worst in the NBA.  The New York Knicks will always hold a special place in my heart,  said Jackson.  This team and this town launched my NBA career. I will forever be indebted to them. I am grateful to Mr Dolan for giving me the opportunity to return here.  I had hoped, of course, to bring another NBA championship to the Garden.  As someone who treasures winning, I am deeply disappointed that we weren’t able to do that. New York fans deserve nothing less. I wish them and the Knicks organization all the best - today and always.

The delay came as the conglomerate sued its chip business partner Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) for interfering in the sale, one day after the U.S. firm resubmitted a bid for the unit. The lawsuit pushes acrimony between the two to new heights and further complicates prospects for a deal. Scrambling to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit, Toshiba had pledged to have a signed agreement for the sale of the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - by Wednesday, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. The hotly contested auction has seen a consortium, led by Japanese government investors and including U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, chosen as preferred bidder but the group's offer was only hastily and awkwardly put together this month. That bid has been largely orchestrated by Japan's trade ministry, which is keen to keep semiconductor technology under domestic control. Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said the firm was now aiming for an agreement with the preferred bidder consortium as early as possible and a completed transaction by the end of the financial year in March.  It is taking time to smooth out differences in opinion among members of the consortium,  he said, after apologising for a string of humiliating setbacks that include Toshiba's demotion to the second section of the Tokyo bourse. Related CoverageToshiba says chip unit pact delayed as talks with preferred bidder ongoingThere appears, however, to be little likelihood of a quick and smooth conclusion to the deal. Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, claims that its partner is breaching joint venture contracts and is seeking a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent - actions that prompted Toshiba's lawsuit on Wednesday. Toshiba executives continued to offer a string of mixed messages on their willingness to resolve the spat with the California-based firm. On one hand, Tsunakawa lambasted the Western Digital at the shareholders meeting, saying it had been interfering in the sale. But the head of Toshiba's chip unit also said the Japanese company was prepared to make concessions and hoped to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. Staff members greet shareholders as they arrive at Toshiba Corp.'s annual shareholders meeting in Chiba, Japan June 28, 2017.Issei KatoToshiba argues that Western Digital's bid for the memory unit presents anti-trust issues and is too low in price. Western Digital has said it offer meets the 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) minimum demanded by Toshiba - a figure that appears to match the amount offered by the preferred bidder. Western Digital Tries Again It is not clear if the terms of the bid that Western Digital resubmitted on Tuesday with partner U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) had significantly changed. Slideshow (5 Images)Western Digital said it will provide debt financing to facilitate a sale. Sources with knowledge of the matter have said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) which are currently part of preferred bidder consortium - would be invited to join the resubmitted offer. While it was not immediately clear what parts of Toshiba's talks with the preferred bidder consortium were taking time, sources have said some Toshiba board members are concerned about technology leaks to South Korean chip rival SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), which is part of the consortium and will provide Bain with financing. Western Digital has also said it is strongly opposed to SK Hynix's participation and has threatened further legal action. Toshiba's lawsuit, filed with the Tokyo District Court,  seeks around $1 billion in damages. The Japanese firm also said it had shut out Western Digital employees based outside their Yokkaichi chip plant from accessing information relating to the two companies' joint venture - a move that threatens to impede R&D; work on next-generation NAND memory chips. Western Digital declined to comment on the lawsuit. It said in statement it had reiterated its concerns about the sale process and SK Hynix's participation to Toshiba.

Jain is one of millions of small business owners who face wrenching change from India's biggest tax reform since independence that will unify the country's $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a common market. But he is simply not ready for a regime that from July 1 will for the first time tax the bed linen his 10 workers make, and require him to file his taxes every month online. On the desk in his tiny office in Meerut, two hours drive northeast of New Delhi, lay two calculators. Turning to open a metal cabinet, he pulled out a hand-written ledger to show how he keeps his books.  We will have to hire an accountant - and get a computer,  the thickset 52-year-old told Reuters, as a dozen ancient power looms clattered away in the ramshackle workshop next door. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that by replacing several federal and state taxes, the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) will make life simpler for business. To drive home the point, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan has appeared in a promotional video in which he weaves a cat's cradle between the fingers of his hands - symbolizing India's thicket of old taxes. With a flourish, the tangle is gone and Bachchan proclaims:  One nation, one tax, one market!  (bit.ly/2sch8ou) Not So Simple By tearing down barriers between India's 29 states, the GST should deliver efficiency gains to larger businesses. HSBC estimates the reform could add 0.4 percent to economic growth. Yet at the local chapter of the Indian Industries Association, which groups 6,500 smaller enterprises nationwide, the talk is about how to cope in the aftermath of the GST rollout.  In the initial months, there may be utter confusion,  said chairman Ashok Malhotra, who runs one firm that manufactures voltage stabilisers and a second that makes timing equipment for boxing contests. A big concern is the Indian GST's sheer complexity - with rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent, and myriad exceptions, it contrasts with simpler, flatter and broader sales taxes in other countries. The official schedule of GST rates runs to 213 pages and has undergone repeated last-minute changes.  Rubber goods are taxed at 12 percent; sporting goods at 18 percent. I make rubber sporting goods – so what tax am I supposed to pay?  asks Anurag Agarwal, the local IIA secretary. Cloth merchants and workers shout slogans as they carry an effigy depicting Goods and Services Tax (GST) in a market area during a protest rally against implementation of GST on textiles in Kolkata, India, June 28, 2017.Rupak De ChowdhuriGrace Period? The top government official responsible for coordinating the GST rollout rebuts complaints from bosses that the tax is too complex, adding that the IT back-end that will drive it - crunching up to 5 billion invoices a month - is robust.  It is a technological marvel, as well as a fiscal marvel,  Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia told Reuters in an interview. The government will, however, allow firms to file simplified returns for July and August. From September they must file a total of 37 online returns annually - three each month and one at the year's end - for each state they operate in. One particular concern is how a new feature of the GST, the input tax credit, will work. This allows a company to claim refunds on its inputs and means it should only pay tax on the value it adds. Slideshow (11 Images)The structure will encourage companies to buy from suppliers that are GST-compliant, so that tax credits can flow down a supply chain. That spells bad news for small firms hesitating to shift into the formal economy. The government estimates smaller companies account for 45 percent of manufacturing and employ more than 117 million people. Adhia played down the risk of job losses, however, saying this would be offset by new service sector jobs. Demonetisation 2.0 The prospect of disruption is drawing comparisons with Modi's decision last November to scrap high-value bank notes that made up 86 percent of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge illicit  black money  from the system. The note ban caused severe disruption to India's cash-driven economy and slammed the brakes on growth, which slowed to a two-year low in the quarter to March.  It could throw the business out of gear - it can affect your volumes by at least 30 percent,  said the head of one large cement company in the Delhi region. Back in Meerut, Pankaj Jain worries that hiring an accountant and charging 5 percent GST on his bedsheets could eat up to two-thirds of his annual profits of 400,000-500,000 rupees ($6,210-$7,760).  I know my costs will go up, but I don't know about my income,  he said.  I might even have to shut up shop completely and go into trading.

As of Tuesday morning, the blaze had scorched nearly 50,000 acres, the bulk of that in the Dixie National Forest, with crews managing to carve containment lines around just 10 percent of the fire's perimeter, officials said. The fire erupted on June 17 near the ski resort of Brian Head, Utah, about 30 miles northeast of Zion National Park, and spread quickly as high winds drove flames into dense forests, threatening homes in nearby communities. The town of Brian Head ordered an evacuation of all residents, and the number of people forced from their dwellings throughout the fire zone has climbed to 1,500, according to U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Jackson. Local fire spokeswoman Elayn Briggs said at least 13 homes and eight outbuildings have been demolished since the blaze began but no serious injuries have been reported. The fire was ignited by human activity, but officials said they were still investigating the precise cause.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. Rosneft filed claims against Sistema seeking RUB170.6 billion of damages for alleged abuse of Sistema's shareholding rights in PJSOC Bashneft (Bashneft) (BBB-/Stable), a medium-sized Russian oil company with legal registration in Russian Republic of Bashkortostan (BBB-/Stable)  and currently a majority-controlled subsidiary of Rosneft, during the period when Sistema was the majority owner of Bashneft. The government of Bashkortstan, a shareholder in Bashneft, was accepted as the co-plaintiff. The hearings on the substance of this case started on 27 June 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Assets Affected: The court injunction and the subsequent bailiff's decision significantly limit Sistema's ability to control a sizeable portion of its assets, and may reduce the flow of dividends to the holding company. The watch is likely to be resolved when Fitch receives more clarity on the financial consequences of the litigation, and their implications for both Sistema and MTS. The freeze on shares does not pre-empt the court decision on the substance of the claims. The total amount of claims consists of a number of individual claims of smaller size, and the court is likely to make a decision on the merit and the size of each of the sub-claims. Worst Case Scenario: The worst case scenario for MTS will be for Sistema to exercise its majority shareholder rights to upstream significant additional distributions from MTS that may be necessary to cover Sistema's potential losses under this litigation. The total amount of claims is significant and equal to more than 4.5x dividends received by Sistema in 2016 from its operating subsidiaries. If satisfied in full, the impact on the company's leverage and its ratings is likely to be negative. Frozen Stakes: Sistema announced that its 31.76% equity interest in MTS (out of its owned 51% stake), 100% equity stake in Medsi and 90.47% equity interest in Bashkirian Power Grid Company were frozen by a decision of the arbitration court. In addition, bailiffs imposed additional restrictive measures prohibiting Sistema to receive any income on the frozen shares, including dividends. DERIVATION SUMMARY Sistema's credit profile is primarily shaped by the company's ability to control cash flows and upstream dividends from MTS. This is overlaid by a significant debt burden at the holdco level, including exposure to substantial off-balance-sheet liabilities related to its subsidiaries. Efforts to diversify dividend inflows are likely to take time before providing a sustainable contribution. MTS's credit profile is supported by the company's position as a leading Russian and CIS mobile operator with moderate leverage and sustainable positive pre-dividend free cash flow (FCF) generation. It is the largest operator in Russia and the second-largest in Ukraine by subscriber and revenue. MTS's ratings are notched down to reflect the potential negative influence of its controlling shareholder Sistema. KEY ASSUMPTIONS The RWN is driven by the assumption that Sistema may incur losses from the litigation initiated by Rosneft. RATING SENSITIVITIES The RWN is likely to be resolved when there is more clarity on the financial consequences of the litigation with Rosneft, and their implications for both Sistema and MTS. Sistema: Sustained deleveraging at the holdco level to below 2.5x net debt, including off-balance-sheet liabilities to normalised dividends received from Sistema's operating subsidiaries, may be positive for Sistema's rating. A protracted rise in net debt including off-balance-sheet liabilities to normalised dividends to above 4.5x may lead to negative rating action. A portfolio reshuffle, increasing the share of subsidiaries with week credit profiles, could also be rating-negative. MTS: MTS's rating could benefit from an upgrade of Sistema's rating provided that MTS continues to adhere to high corporate governance standards. A downgrade could arise from weaker corporate governance but also excessive shareholder remuneration and other developments that lead to a sustained rise in funds from operations adjusted net leverage to above 3.0x. Competitive weaknesses and market-share erosion, leading to significant deterioration in pre-dividend FCF generation, may also become a negative rating factor. A downgrade of Sistema may also be negative if Sistema remains the dominant shareholder. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Sistema Joint Stock Financial Corp.

The French presidency and White House said Trump had accepted an invitation to make the visit, which will also commemorate the U.S. entry into World War One 100 years ago.   The two leaders will further build on the strong counter-terrorism cooperation and economic partnership between the two countries,  the White House said in a statement.  Macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia. But the two leaders publicly clashed after Trump said he would pull out of a global accord on action to combat climate change.  Beyond our differences on some subjects such as climate, it shows the strength and the links in our transatlantic ties and the convergence of views on counter-terrorism and our joint commitment in war zones,  said a French diplomat. After the United States, France is the biggest contributor to the coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The July 14 festivities see thousands of men and women from France's army, navy and air force march down the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris. The U.S. military will this year march with French forces.  On July 14, 1789, crowds stormed the Bastille prison, where opponents of the monarchy were held, at the start of the French Revolution. Plans by Trump to visit Britain have yet to be finalised despite an invitation by Prime Minister Theresa May when she met him in Washington in January. The prospect of a visit has met opposition in Britain, prompting fears of angry protests, also a possibility in France.  Donald Trump is violent and there's no reason for him being here,  a far-left lawmaker and former French presidential candidate said on Wednesday.  He is not welcome. That's clear,  Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the France Unbowed movement, told Europe 1 radio.

A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said the cyber extortion, which has disrupted businesses around the globe, has also led to congestion at some of the 76 ports run by its APM Terminals unit, including in the United States, India, Spain and the Netherlands.  It will have an impact on vessels or cargo that loaded yesterday, today and maybe also tomorrow,  Maersk Line Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc told Reuters on Wednesday. Due to limited access to some of its computer systems, Maersk, which handles one out of seven containers shipped worldwide, also has problems processing orders taken just before the breakdown, Clerc said. When the attack began, on Tuesday afternoon in Europe, Maersk decided to take down a number of systems as a precaution. The company is working on a technical recovery plan, Clerc said. For now, Maersk is using alternative channels to take  orders manually and to communicate with customers, he said. He said no data had been lost due to the cyber attack, and that the company would be able to resume operations  right away  once the issues were solved. Paul Tsui, managing director of one of Maersk's clients, Hong Kong-based logistics company Janel Group, said in an email sent to Reuters that Maersk's system was shut down and had not been accessible for bookings since late yesterday evening.

Maersk said operations at some APM Terminals' around the world, including Los Angeles, were affected. A spokeswoman for the Port in Barcelona said one of the two big container terminals run by Maersk was affected. At the Spanish port of Algeciras, operations at one of two terminals run by APM Terminals has been down since Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. A Maersk-operated terminal at India's largest container port JNPT, near Mumbai, has also been disrupted, the port said on Wednesday. The Port of New York & New Jersey said in a tweet on Tuesday that APM's Terminal would be closed on Wednesday. In Aarhus, the biggest container terminal in Maersk's home country Denmark, APM Terminals was using alternative methods of communication when loading and offloading vessels.  We have found a solution where we work outside the Maersk network,  said Steen Davidsen, managing director at the terminal, told Reuters.  It's not quite so fast, but at least we can operate and customers can be serviced,  he said. Two APM terminals in Rotterdam, Europe's busiest port, are still out of commission. A spokesman said knock-on effects for the port as a whole were minimal, with a slight delay in operations.

It is critical that we act to protect the long-term sustainability of this business and the majority of our workforce,  Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, said in a statement. It said its South African gold mining operations had experienced  heavy, and ultimately unsustainable, losses . The company, which employs 28,000 people, said the potential lay-offs were part of its efforts to improve production and the cost base of its South African business. In May, AngloGold reported a 16 percent drop in first-quarter profit following a decline in South African production and said it was reviewing its operations to restore margins and ensure their recovery. AngloGold shares fell 4.29 percent to 132.23 rand. The biggest union in the gold sector by membership, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it would  fight tooth and nail to make sure that its members are not retrenched cheaply.   The NUM is extremely angry and shocked that Anglogold Asanti is likely to retrench such a huge number of workers at the time when there is a high rate of unemployment in the country,  spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said in a statement. Trade union Solidarity said it would work with the company to try to retain as many jobs as possible. However, the union expressed concern about the potential for further job cuts across the sector due to new rules announced by the government to raise the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent.

Rome's EU ambassador, Maurizio Massari, met EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and told him that  the situation we are facing is serious and Europe cannot turn its back , an Italian government source said.  The idea of blocking humanitarian ships flying foreign flags from returning to Italian ports has been discussed,  another Italian government source told Reuters. That may force EU partners to take them instead because many of the charities that operate rescue ships are based in other EU countries, including Malta and Germany, the source said.  Italy has reached saturation point,  he said, adding that Rome had planned for 200,000 beds for asylum-seekers and those were almost all taken. Italy has brought in over half a million boat migrants since 2014, and a record 181,000 came last year. This year arrivals are up about 14 percent on the same period last year to 75,000. Italy is the main point of arrival for mostly African migrants to European shores this year, and more boats are sent out almost daily. All of those rescued off the coast of Libya are brought to Italy, often by private charities. Meanwhile, Italy's neighbors have closed their borders to try to keep migrants from moving north as they did in the past, and some EU partners such as Poland and Hungary have refused to host some asylum-seekers to ease the burden on Italy and Greece, another frontline country. Migrant Issue Sways Elections At the weekend, voters punished Italy's ruling Democratic Party in local elections, opting instead for center-right rivals led by the anti-immigrant Northern League and four-time former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who want Italy to take a tougher stance on migration. While EU members have been at loggerheads for two years now about moving asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece, the bloc's 28 leaders agreed last week the two southern states should get more help to manage arrivals. The bloc's executive European Commission will give more emergency funding to Italy and wants EU states to put up more money to assist African countries, an EU official said, hoping that better conditions at home will keep people from leaving. At a meeting in Tallin next week, EU migration ministers will discuss Rome's request to have EU peers let some of the boats arriving with migrants disembark in their ports, the official said. Since Saturday, some 11,000 migrants have been pulled from unsafe and overcrowded boats, but overall numbers for the month of June are in line with last year and the year before, according to Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration in Rome.   The number of June arrivals is normal. They are high, but they should not be worrying,  Di Giacomo said. An Italian navy boat brought about 700 migrants to the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Wednesday, including an infant boy who was born on a migrant boat but who died from respiratory problems after he and his mother were rescued, port doctor Angelo Gugliotta said. Because of the summer heat, some migrants dove off the ship into the water when it arrived in port. Several were carried off on stretchers, including one severely malnourished man, and injuries included gunshot wounds, the doctor said.  This has been going on for years and it is increasingly dramatic,  Gugliotta said.

It suggested the bloc could tap into new taxes and make savings. Britain contributes around 16 percent to the overall EU budget, or 10 billion to 11 billion euros annually, so its exit in March 2019 will create a financing gap that will be difficult to fill.  We will have to save money because it will not be possible to make up completely for the gap,  Budget Commissioner Gunther Oettinger told a news conference. He presented a paper  to be debated by EU governments this year, laying out options.  The EU budget ... will change after 2020. This is certain -- the status quo is not an option,  the Commission paper said. The Commission outlined five scenarios, from a much lower to a significantly higher budget from 2020 under the headings of  carrying on ,  doing less together ,  those who want more, do more ,  radical redesign  and  doing much more together . Only the  doing less together , which assumes a much lower budget, keeps the current financing sources and levels unchanged. All others assume new revenue sources, or bigger national co-financing and a review of spending or both. To fill the gap caused by Brexit, the document said, the EU could tap sources like corporate taxes, a tax on financial transactions, or levies on electricity, motor fuel, carbon emissions or proceeds from central bank currency issuance. The taxes, collected nationally, could be passed on in part, or in full to the EU, especially if they were generated directly by EU policies -- like revenues from auctions under the Emissions Trading System or emission premia for cars. The EU now gets its money from national contributions based on gross national income, from customs duties collected at all EU borders and from a tiny cut of national value added taxes. To make savings for the EU budget, governments could take on some of the direct payments to farmers made by the EU under the bloc's Common Agricultural Policy, the paper said. Governments could also put in more of their own money to finance projects funded by the EU under its cohesion policy -- aid to less developed regions to equalise living standards. The EU could also try to make better use of existing funds, leveraging them to finance projects, similarly to its investment fund EFSI which is to generate some 500 billion euros of investment by 2020 by leveraging only 33.5 billion of own funds. All this would could help finance new areas of EU activity.  In the future, migration management, internal and external security, external border control, the fight against terrorism and defence will need to be budgeted ... alongside continuing investment to support stability and sustainable development in our partner countries,  the Commission paper said. Money and the Rule of Law Under pressure from the EU's biggest countries, who are also the biggest net contributors to the budget, the Commission put in the paper an idea that disbursements from the next budget could be linked to governments abiding by the rule of law. This is a clear reference to Poland which is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the EU budget and the only country the Commission is monitoring if it observes the rule of law. EU officials say Poland has been ignoring the Commission's recommendations under the rule of law procedure, which call on the nationalist-minded government to respect the independence of the judiciary, media and civil rights. The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said he was against linking the rule of law procedure with budget payments. But there is growing pressure from Germany, France and Italy as well as Sweden to consider it.  (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron saying the European Union is not a supermarket is the most strongly-worded expression of that,  Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans told Reuters.  I... fully understand the point made by the French president, you can't pick and chose, you can't say 'Give us the money and we don't want to hear anything else about European rules',  Timmermans said.

Shaw said its wireless business - the former Wind Mobile business it acquired in early 2016 and rebranded as Freedom Mobile in November - added 20,085 net postpaid customers in the third quarter ended May 31, with revenue jumping 16.7 percent from a year ago.  They've been executing well on that business though there's still a long way to go,  said Edward Jones analyst Dave Heger.  They're making a slow transition to being a more formidable competitor in wireless.  Calgary-based Shaw is locked in a fierce battle for internet, television and telephone customers in the west of the country with Vancouver-based rival Telus Corp.  In the last month or two, it hasn't gotten any easier, but we've got a strategy, and we're focused on our strategy and we're going to continue to execute,  Jay Mehr, Shaw's president, said on a call with analysts. The company launched a renewed television product based on Comcast's X1 video platform in January after losing market share at the hands of Telus' Optik TV. Shaw said its consumer unit added almost 13,000 cable subscribers and 6,000 satellite TV customers in the period, the first net TV growth since fiscal 2010. It also added some 20,000 internet additions. The cable subscriber numbers were  surprisingly strong,  likely helped by the BlueSky product helping them both keep existing customers and attract new ones, analyst Heger said. The company said a slip in operating income in the quarter was primarily due to marketing costs for the BlueSky launch. Shaw said it will need to spend C$350 million to deploy recently purchased spectrum for its wireless network. Net income from continuing operations rose to C$164 million, or 33 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter, from C$74 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 2.8 percent to C$1.31 billion. Earlier this month Shaw sold its ViaWest data center subsidiary for $1.675 billion, using some of the proceeds to buy airwaves to boost its new wireless unit. Overall, the results were largely in line with expectations, and its shares were unchanged at C$30.24.

In its 7-2 decision, Canada's Supreme Court found that a court in the country can grant an injunction preventing conduct anywhere in the world when it is necessary to ensure the injunction's effectiveness.  The internet has no borders - its natural habitat is global,  the Supreme Court wrote in its judgment.  The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates - globally.  Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  The case stems from claims by Equustek Solutions Inc, a small technology company in British Columbia that manufactures network devices, that distributor Datalink Technologies Gateways relabeled one of its products and sold it as its own online and acquired trade secrets to design and manufacture a competing product. In 2012, Equustek asked Google to remove Datalink search results until the case against the company was resolved. While Google removed over 300 specific web pages associated with Datalink, it did so only on the Canadian version of its search engine.  The Supreme Court of British Columbia subsequently ordered Google to stop displaying search results in any country for any part of Datalink's websites. FILE PHOTO: A view shows the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa February 6, 2015.Chris Wattie/File PhotoIn its appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, Google had argued that the global reach of the order was unnecessary and that it raised concerns over freedom of expression. The Supreme Court rejected Google's argument that the right to freedom of expression should have prevented the order from being issued.  This is not an order to remove speech that, on its face, engages freedom of expression values,  the court wrote in its ruling.  We have not, to date, accepted that freedom of expression requires the facilitation of the unlawful sale of goods.   The global reach was necessary, according to the court, because if the removed search results were restricted to Canada alone, purchasers both in and out of Canada could easily continue to find and buy from Datalink. OpenMedia, a Canadian group campaigning for open communications, opposed the ruling.  There is great risk that governments and commercial entities will see this ruling as justifying censorship requests that could result in perfectly legal and legitimate content disappearing off the web because of a court order in the opposite corner of the globe,  said OpenMedia spokesman David Christopher. Google cannot appeal the Supreme Court ruling. If the company has evidence that complying with the order would force it to violate other countries' laws, including interfering with freedom of expression, it can apply to the British Columbia court to alter the order, the Supreme Court said, noting Google has not made such an application.

The comments from Draghi on Tuesday, viewed as hawkish following his cautious tone at this month's European Central Bank meeting, had sent government bond yields and the euro sharply higher. He said deflationary forces had been replaced by inflationary ones, but any policy change should be gradual as considerable monetary support was still needed. The sell-off in bonds, sensitive to any signs that the ECB may be getting closer to unwinding the massive stimulus that has pinned down borrowing costs, continued into Wednesday but abated after ECB sources said Draghi's comments had been over interpreted.  At the moment markets are singing to the tune of central bankers,  said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at Credit Agricole.  The balance the ECB is trying to strike is removing policy accommodation slowly but surely and at the same time not allowing the market to get ahead of itself in pricing in rate hikes.  German two-year government bond yields dipped 1.5 basis points to minus 0.58 percent, retreating from a one-year peak of minus 0.53 percent hit earlier in the day. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was up 2.5 basis points on the day at 0.38 percent, but off one-month highs hit earlier in the session at around 0.41 percent. French 10-year bond yields also pulled back from a one-month high at around 0.78 percent, while Spanish and Portuguese bond yields were 3-4 basis points lower on the day . The euro fell after the ECB sources-based report but recovered, hitting a one-year high of $1.1390 after weaker-than expected U.S. pending home sales data. The pan-European STOXX 600 briefly turned positive on the report, and was trading flat after languishing in the red since the open.  The market is looking for any read on the timing of tapering and maybe overinterpreted Draghi's speech,  said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.  When I read his speech yesterday I thought the reaction was quite a violent one given what was actually said.  Adding to a second day of volatile trading, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said a UK interest rate rise was probably necessary and the bank would debate this  in the coming months.  British gilt yields jumped on the comments, putting some upward pressure on their euro zone peers.

Eritrea was the worst performer in the annual index released by the New York-based Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), while Norway ranked top, closely followed by Chile, Britain and Canada. The index ranked 81 countries according to the transparency and accountability of their oil, gas and mining sectors. Sixty-six countries were found to be  weak, poor or failing  in their governance of extractive industries, with less than 20 per cent achieving  good  or  satisfactory  overall ratings. Launched in 2013, the index aims to help commodity-rich nations avoid the pitfalls of the  resource curse , in which their economies grow slowly due to poor institutional management and oversight of their natural resources.  Good governance of extractive industries is a fundamental step out of poverty for the 1.8 billion poor citizens living in the 81 countries we assessed...,  said Daniel Kaufmann, president and chief executive of the NRGI, an independent non-profit organization.  It is encouraging that dozens of countries are adopting extractives laws and regulations, but often these are not matched by meaningful action in practice.  The index showed some middle-income countries including Colombia, Indonesia, Ghana, Mongolia, Peru, Mexico and Botswana achieved good or satisfactory overall ratings.  Burkina Faso was placed highest among the low-income countries studied and its mining sector ranked 20th overall. The NRGI said the situation is worse in countries where corruption is systemic, including in policy areas such as environmental and social impacts, and the sharing of resource revenues by national governments with local authorities. The index also looked at how well citizens and local communities could voice concerns and hold governments to account. It also examined the transparency of management of sovereign wealth funds in 33 countries. Eleven sovereign wealth funds, managing $1.5 trillion in wealth, were rated as failing. The best governed of those studied was Colombia's Savings and Stabilization Fund followed by Ghana's Stabilization Fund. Chile’s Codelco state mining company was rated the best-governed of 74 extractive sector state-owned enterprises that were assessed for their disclosures and corporate governance. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India came second.  In total, 48 countries’ state-owned companies were given  unsatisfactory  ratings. The NRGI called on governments to support transparency  measures, including laws to ensure the identities of the true beneficiaries of oil and mining companies are clear.

The more than one-and-a-half year antitrust scrutiny has raised uncertainity and weighed on Fred's shares, which has lost about 40 percent since the company's deal with Rite Aid. The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. antitrust watchdog, is expected to reach a decision on the deal by July 7. Fred's shares were nearly unchanged at $12.08 in morning trading on Wednesday. Walgreens shares were up 0.7 percent at $77.82, while Rite Aid was up 4.5 percent at $3.91.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/freds-rightsplan-idUSL1N1JP12V"},

If the Pleiades star cluster appears large and bright, then rains will be abundant. If it looks small and dim, then the rains will be poor – in which case, the farmers delay the planting of their crops.  What could at first glance seem like a far-fetched ancestral tradition actually showcases indigenous peoples' ability to make useful and constructive observations on climate forecasting,  said Douglas Nakashima, head of the small islands and indigenous knowledge section at the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  While scientists know that El Niño reduces rainfall in the Andes, they were previously not aware of the link between El Niño and cloud cover,  he said. Traditional skills and knowledge should be seen as a complement, not a barrier, to scientific knowledge and climate adaptation efforts, experts said at a conference on how communities adapt to climate change, held this week in the Ugandan capital Kampala. Pool Traditional Knowledge National policies to adapt to climate change not only often disregard traditional knowledge, they sometimes even undermine the resilience of indigenous populations, Nakashima said.  Initiatives around the world to build large dams or boost green fuels to reduce emissions have displaced many communities,  he said. Krystyna Swiderska, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that governments also largely ignore indigenous innovation in farming.  In Peru, for example, farmers already grow hundreds of potato varieties – as opposed to relying on just a few varieties as many countries do – so they have a better chance of surviving the negative impacts of climate change,  she said.   But there is still a strong belief among the international community that science is the best solution for climate adaptation,  she said. Herders - who have been adapting to erratic weather for decades - have much to teach about coping with climate change, said Elizabeth Carabine, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, a London-based think tank. Cities and Slums Conference participants stressed that cities, and slums in particular, could also be a significant source of inspiration for climate adaptation. One participant highlighted that slum dwellers were highly innovative and entrepreneurial, for example by converting parts of their home into a school or a soup kitchen. Using cities' knowledge is all the more important as people living in cities are just as affected as others – and perhaps more so – by climate change, said Julie Arrighi from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.  Cities are big consumers of energy and particularly exposed to threats like flooding as a result of rising sea levels,  she said.  That challenge is only going to get bigger as cities grow.   Julie Greenwalt, an urban environment specialist at the Cities Alliance, guarded against governments ignoring the needs of cities to adapt to a changing climate, and instead focusing their resources on rural areas.    Our definitions of urban and rural are largely driven by developed countries, but even in some cities – like in India – people keep cattle,  she said. This, said Rebecca Carter from the World Resources Institute, means that  climate adaptation should become part of how a city works, not just an add-on .

Eritrea was the worst performer in the annual index released by the New York-based Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), while Norway ranked top, closely followed by Chile, Britain and Canada. The index ranked 81 countries according to the transparency and accountability of their oil, gas and mining sectors. Sixty-six countries were found to be  weak, poor or failing  in their governance of extractive industries, with less than 20 per cent achieving  good  or  satisfactory  overall ratings. Launched in 2013, the index aims to help commodity-rich nations avoid the pitfalls of the  resource curse , in which their economies grow slowly due to poor institutional management and oversight of their natural resources.  Good governance of extractive industries is a fundamental step out of poverty for the 1.8 billion poor citizens living in the 81 countries we assessed...,  said Daniel Kaufmann, president and chief executive of the NRGI, an independent non-profit organization.  It is encouraging that dozens of countries are adopting extractives laws and regulations, but often these are not matched by meaningful action in practice.  The index showed some middle-income countries including Colombia, Indonesia, Ghana, Mongolia, Peru, Mexico and Botswana achieved good or satisfactory overall ratings.  Burkina Faso was placed highest among the low-income countries studied and its mining sector ranked 20th overall. The NRGI said the situation is worse in countries where corruption is systemic, including in policy areas such as environmental and social impacts, and the sharing of resource revenues by national governments with local authorities. The index also looked at how well citizens and local communities could voice concerns and hold governments to account. It also examined the transparency of management of sovereign wealth funds in 33 countries. Eleven sovereign wealth funds, managing $1.5 trillion in wealth, were rated as failing. The best governed of those studied was Colombia's Savings and Stabilization Fund followed by Ghana's Stabilization Fund. Chile’s Codelco state mining company was rated the best-governed of 74 extractive sector state-owned enterprises that were assessed for their disclosures and corporate governance. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India came second.  In total, 48 countries’ state-owned companies were given  unsatisfactory  ratings. The NRGI called on governments to support transparency  measures, including laws to ensure the identities of the true beneficiaries of oil and mining companies are clear.

In its 7-2 decision, Canada's Supreme Court found that a court in the country can grant an injunction preventing conduct anywhere in the world when it is necessary to ensure the injunction's effectiveness.  The internet has no borders - its natural habitat is global,  the Supreme Court wrote in its judgment.  The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates - globally.  Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The case stems from claims by Equustek Solutions Inc, a small technology company in British Columbia that manufactures network devices, that distributor Datalink Technologies Gateways relabeled one of its products and sold it as its own online and acquired trade secrets to design and manufacture a competing product. In 2012, Equustek asked Google to remove Datalink search results until the case against the company was resolved. While Google removed over 300 specific web pages associated with Datalink, it did so only on the Canadian version of its search engine. The Supreme Court of British Columbia subsequently ordered Google to stop displaying search results in any country for any part of Datalink's websites. In its appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, Google had argued that the global reach of the order was unnecessary and that it raised concerns over freedom of expression. The Supreme Court rejected Google's argument that the right to freedom of expression should have prevented the order from being issued.  This is not an order to remove speech that, on its face, engages freedom of expression values,  the court wrote in its ruling.  We have not, to date, accepted that freedom of expression requires the facilitation of the unlawful sale of goods.  The global reach was necessary, according to the court, because if the removed search results were restricted to Canada alone, purchasers both in and out of Canada could easily continue to find and buy from Datalink. OpenMedia, a Canadian group campaigning for open communications, opposed the ruling.  There is great risk that governments and commercial entities will see this ruling as justifying censorship requests that could result in perfectly legal and legitimate content disappearing off the web because of a court order in the opposite corner of the globe,  said OpenMedia spokesman David Christopher. Google cannot appeal the Supreme Court ruling. If the company has evidence that complying with the order would force it to violate other countries' laws, including interfering with freedom of expression, it can apply to the British Columbia court to alter the order, the Supreme Court said, noting Google has not made such an application.

The FTSE 100 index fell 0.6 percent. A brief recovery was brought to an end in afternoon trading when Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the bank would debate an interest rate increase in the coming months. His remarks boosted sterling and sent the blue chip index back to the day's lows with big international companies such as drugmaker Shire and drinks firm Diageo - which benefit from a weaker pound - among the heaviest fallers. The mid-cap index, which is more domestically focused, did slightly better, ending down 0.3 percent. Fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown fell 2.3 percent following an industry report by Britain's markets watchdog. In a drive to improve funds transparency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed a number of changes to the asset management industry, adding it supported the disclosure of a single, all-in fee. It also said it would launch a market study into investment platforms.  Rather than having the management fee and then also trading commission as well and then other sorts of fees on top of that, I think the regulator would rather that wealth managers charged just one fixed percentage that encompassed everything, so consumers would know exactly what they were paying,  Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at Killik & Co, said. Winter added that, because performance reporting has been a big part of Europe's upcoming Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II regulation, wealth managers had already been looking at their fee structures and considering one fee. A weaker oil price was also a drag on UK blue chips, with shares in majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP dropping 0.6 and 1 percent respectively. Shares in Bunzl, a provider of distribution and outsourcing services, bounced 1.5 percent. Bunzl issued an upbeat trading statement in which it said it saw a 7 percent rise in first-half revenue at constant currency, as well as a boost from recent acquisitions. Outside of the large caps, results dragged down shares in Stagecoach, which slumped 6.2 percent after its full-year earnings missed expectations. Stagecoach's full-year pretax profit dropped 15.3 percent as economic conditions hit its domestic bus business.

The market has defied expectations with issuance this year of US$49bn through June 23, 90% higher than the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral. If these revised forecasts are realized, 2017 would be among the top five years of volume ever. Issuance in 2014 of US$123.6bn is the record. This year’s forecasts initially ranged from US$50bn to US$70bn with banks citing a lack of collateral and rules that require managers to be on the hook for a portion of their fund’s risk as reasons for the expected dip from US$72.4bn in 2016. “Issuance so far this year has been a bit stronger than expected,” said Rishad Ahluwalia, head of CLO research at JP Morgan. The bank, which started the year with one of the most pessimistic 2017 forecasts, restated its prediction to US$85bn to US$95 of volume this year from its original projection of US$50bn to US$60bn, according to a June 16 report. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast to US$80bn in issuance, up from its original prediction of US$70bn, according to a June 16 report, while Wells Fargo raised its forecast to US$85bn from US$70bn in a June 22 report. Deutsche Bank increased its projection to US$95bn from US$65bn, according to a June 28 report. These forecasts do not include CLO refinancings or resets. A Wells Fargo spokesperson, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson and a Deutsche Bank spokesperson all declined to comment. Record Repricing Low loan volume and debt repricings are potential limiting factors to continued robust CLO issuance this year. New institutional loan volume of US$53.72bn in the first quarter was down more than 10% from the prior quarter, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. The lack of new deals and increased investor interest for floating-rate debt allowed borrowers to refinance a record US$195.8bn of loans in the first three months of the year. The lower interest payments can eat into the most junior CLO investors’ returns because they are paid last with whatever interest is left over after a deal’s debtholders are paid. As borrowers cut costs, equity holder distributions decrease. “The main risk continues to be spread compression on the underlying loans, making arbitrage to the equity more challenging,” said Ahluwalia. “Another factor is the lack of collateral given the strong loan repricing and refinancing activity. So we’ll see how the next six months play out.” Risk retention, part of Dodd-Frank that requires managers to hold 5% of their fund, was often cited in initial forecasts as an impediment to issuance, but managers have developed options to comply. Managers may buy the retention directly or with financing from a third party. Many have set up a capitalized manager vehicle (CMV) – a standalone management company that oversees the CLO to buy the retention stake – or a majority-owned affiliate (MOA) or capitalized majority-owned affiliate (C-MOA) to purchase the required amount. “The fundraising for CMVs and MOAs has gone quite well,” said Dave Stehnacs, a portfolio manager at ZAIS Group. “It is an opportunity to invest in CLOs as well as participate in the revenues of the asset management companies.” (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing by Leela Parker Deo and Chris Mangham)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/clo-revisedforecast-idUSL1N1JP0XH"},

Shares climbed 1 percent and hit a two-year high of $118.47 a share. St. Louis-based Monsanto reaffirmed its earnings per share target and raised its gross profit outlook for its seeds and genomics unit, which sells seeds, licenses biotech traits and sells farm data services. Record soybean seedings in the United States and Brazil, the top two producers, were a boon for the world's largest seed company.  There was a lot of acreage that rotated out of corn and into soy and Monsanto was set up really well for that since they had some product launches in soy this year,  said Matt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones. Sales of soybean seed and traits, the second-biggest business by revenue, jumped 29.3 percent to $896 million in the third quarter ended May 31. Seedings of Monsanto's Xtend soybeans, the newest U.S. varieties, totaled 20 million acres this spring, above earlier forecasts for 18 million. Intacta, its South American variety, was planted on more than 50 million acres, near the high end of expectations. FILE PHOTO: Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on May 9, 2016.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoHowever, sales of corn seed and traits, the company's biggest revenue generator, fell 6.3 percent to $1.49 billion. Monsanto agreed in September to a $66 billion buyout offer from Bayer, that, if approved by regulators, would create a company commanding more than a quarter of the world market for seeds and pesticides. Monsanto said on Wednesday it was working toward completion of the merger by the end of 2017 and expects to submit merger-related filings to the European Union by the end of this month. Bayer has said it would sell its LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses to help satisfy competition authorities looking at the Monsanto deal. Net income attributable to Monsanto rose to $843 million, or $1.90 per share, in the quarter, from $717 million, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, Monsanto earned $1.93 per share, beating the analysts' average estimate of $1.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The euro extended the prior session's rally against the dollar, which had sent it to its strongest one-day percentage gain against the greenback in more than a year, while sterling also jumped after BoE Governor Mark Carney said the central bank is likely to need to raise interest rates as the British economy comes closer to operating at full capacity. Speaking at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, Carney said the BoE will debate this  in the coming months.  Carney's remarks convinced traders that European monetary policy was shifting in a more hawkish direction, analysts said, just a day after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the bank's stimulus policy, fuelling market expectations that the ECB will announce a reduction of stimulus as soon as September. Analysts said Draghi's comments continued to support the euro even as sources familiar with the ECB chief's thinking said Wednesday that he intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening. “There is a bit of a concern in the markets about the fact that the balance of monetary policy expectations is moving a little bit in a more hawkish direction in Europe,  said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. The euro rose as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar to a one-year high of $1.1390 after jumping 1.4 percent Tuesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell as much as 0.4 percent to hit a more than seven-month low of 95.967. The dollar was last down 0.2 percent against the yen at 112.12 yen after hitting a more than one-month high of 112.46 on Tuesday. The announcement on Tuesday that U.S. Senate Republican leaders postponed a vote on a healthcare overhaul continued to fuel skepticism that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration would realize pro-growth infrastructure spending and tax reform policies, hurting the dollar. “Prospects for infrastructure spending and tax reform are fading by the minute,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.

BPI had claimed ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co, and Avila defamed the company by calling its ground-beef product “pink slime” and making errors and omissions in a 2012 report. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. BPI's signature product, commonly mixed into ground beef, is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill E. coli and other contaminants.  While this has not been an easy road to travel, it was necessary to begin rectifying the harm we suffered as a result of what we believed to be biased and baseless reporting in 2012,  South Dakota-based BPI said in a statement.  Through this process, we have again established what we all know to be true about Lean Finely Textured Beef: it is beef, and is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.  ABC stood by its reporting, which it has said deserved protection under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment which guarantees freedom of religion, speech and the press.  Throughout this case, we have maintained that our reports accurately presented the facts and views of knowledgeable people about this product,  ABC said in a statement confirming the settlement.  Although we have concluded that continued litigation of this case is not in the company's interests, we remain committed to the vigorous pursuit of truth and the consumer's right to know about the products they purchase.  The trial began earlier this month in the tiny town of Elk Point, South Dakota, and had been expected to last eight weeks. BPI had claimed up to $1.9 billion in damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. During its reports, ABC used the term  pink slime  more than 350 times across six different media platforms including TV and online, Dan Webb, an attorney for BPI, said during opening statements on June 5. In the aftermath of ABC's broadcasts, BPI closed three of its four processing plants and said its revenue dropped 80 percent to $130 million. Attorneys for ABC countered that the term was commonly used before ABC's reports and said that BPI's business was already suffering.

The investigation centres on the company's 1 billion shekel ($285 million) acquisition of the remaining stake in its satellite TV unit, YES, from Eurocom Group in 2015. Elovitch, who controls Bezeq through holding company Eurocom Group, was held for questioning before being released on a 5 million shekel bail by a Tel Aviv court last Wednesday.

In a noticeable shift in emphasis since his last speech on June 20, Carney did not repeat his phrase from then that now was not the time to raise rates. Markets immediately priced in a greater chance of an early rate rise. The pound rose to its highest level since Britain's June 8 election after the BoE released Carney's remarks. Gilt yields jumped as one measure of rate hike expectations rose to its highest since last year's vote to leave the European Union. Addressing the European Central Bank conference in Sintra, Portugal, Carney said policymakers would need to look at the extent to which stronger business investment offset a slowdown in consumption, as well as growth in wages and labour costs.  These are some of the issues that the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) will debate in the coming months,  Carney said.  Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional.  The MPC split 5-3 earlier this month on whether it was time to start to raise British interest rates from a record-low 0.25 percent.  As spare capacity erodes, the ... (MPC's) tolerance for above-target inflation falls,  Carney said. Britain was the fastest-growing major advanced economy last year, but quarterly economic growth slowed to just 0.2 percent in the first three months of 2017. However, last month the BoE still forecast that growth this year would be only slightly below Britain's long-run trend at around 1.9 percent. British inflation hit its highest in nearly four years at 2.9 percent last month, well above its 2 percent target, prompted by the pound's post-Brexit vote tumble. Offsets Policymakers are unsure about how much of the slowdown in consumer spending will be offset by stronger exports and investment. Moreover, wage growth -- which some policymakers see as a key gauge of medium-term domestic inflation pressures -- is slowing, and the impact of political uncertainty since the June 8 election and the start of Brexit talks is hard to predict.  Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual,  Carney said. BoE chief economist Andy Haldane -- who less than a year ago defended a  sledgehammer  package of measures to tackle the risk of a post-referendum slowdown -- surprised many observers last week by saying he expected to vote for higher rates this year. In part this reflects the BoE's expectation that strong global growth -- combined with sterling's big fall -- will lift exports and spur business investment. Carney also noted on Wednesday that strong world growth would push up global equilibrium interest rates and potentially make British monetary policy more accommodative in comparison. ING economists said Carney's speech was a  a significant shift in policy bias , but not all economists were convinced his comments implied he would back a rate rise soon.  The Governor's view continues to be very much 'wait and see',  said Martin Beck of consultancy Oxford Economics. BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe also seemed cautious in a radio interview earlier on Wednesday, saying he wanted to see how a squeeze on household income played out.

First half volume in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa was just US$52.9bn - its lowest first-half total since 2009 and down significantly from US$125.4bn raised in the same period last year. The drop was mainly down to a huge drop in borrowing opportunities in the Middle East - volume plummeted to US$6.5bn in the second quarter from US$43bn during the same three months of 2016. “At the moment everything is slow,” a Middle East-focussed loans banker said. Refinancing continues to be the main driver of activity in EMEA with volume of US$273bn in the first half. This was 28% higher than a year earlier as many companies took advantage of high levels of market liquidity and ultra low interest rates to amend and extend existing loans. The largest refinancings of the second quarter included global diversified natural resource company Glencore's US$7.335bn refinancing, Irish building supplies group CRH’s €3.5bn amend and extend, and French drinks maker Pernod Ricard’s €2.5bn refinancing. A handful of large acquisition loans earlier in the year helped M&A; loan volume rise to US$132bn in the first half, up 41% year-on-year, but acquisition financing became patchy in the second quarter. Italian motorway group Atlantia placed the largest M&A; financing of the second quarter with a €14.7bn loan backing its proposed takeover of Spain’s Abertis. The loan closed with a group of 24 international banks in May. Despite the increase in M&A; and refinancing, lending to Europe’s high grade borrowers was 12% down at the half year point at US$235bn, as wider macroeconomic and political issues weighed. “There’s been a lot of uncertainty to deal with. An ongoing round of European elections, the continuing dramas around Brexit, Donald Trump and North Korea -- it’s no wonder that volumes have been hit,” a senior loans banker said. TEN-YEAR HIGH First-half leveraged loan volume of US$133bn was two-thirds higher than the same period last year as refinancings, repricings and recapitalisations flooded the market. With borrowers taking advantage of the deep liquidity on offer to improve portfolio companies, volume reached its highest level since 2007. The ten-year high means first-half volume has reached nearly three-quarters of last year’s annual US$182.73bn total for European leveraged loans. Non-event driven financings of US$118.4bn accounted for a massive 88.8% of all leveraged loan activity in the first half as borrowers sought to take dividends, reprice debt on better terms, extend maturities and improve documents amid a lack of buyout deals. Buyout loans totalled US$14.88bn, the lowest level since 2014 as sponsors struggled to compete for assets against high valuations and cash-rich strategic bidders. A €1.33bn term loan that formed part of a wider US$3.2bn-equivalent refinancing for Liberty Global's Belgian cable and mobile company Telenet was the leveraged largest loan of the second quarter, followed by a US$1.225bn-equivalent euro-denominated term loan backing the take-private of Hong Kong-based international schools operator Nord Anglia. The pipeline of new deals is building, which should bolster event-driven volumes in the third quarter. They include loans for Danish packaging group Faerch Plast; French nursing home company DomusVi; UK-headquartered health food and supplements chain Holland & Barrett; cleaning and chemicals systems business Diversey Care; and US life sciences company Avantor’s take-private of lab supplies company VWR Corp. “There is an adequate pipeline of deals to launch and a good potential pipeline of deals to come, however it is not enough to satisfy demand,” a head of leveraged finance said. A €1.95bn seven-year term loan backing the buyout of German drugmaker Stada would have been the largest leveraged loan of the year to launch so far but is set to fall away if Bain and Cinven are unable to put in a successful new offer for the business, after an initial takeover attempt failed. Bank of America Merrill Lynch topped the first half EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table with a US$23.74bn market share and 55 deals. HSBC claimed second place with US$22.89bn and 83 deals, while Deutsche Bank was third with a US$22.64bn market share and 58 deals.

Rescuers carry a bag containing the dead body of a migrant at the coast of Tajoura, east of Tripoli, Libya, June 27, 2017.Ismail Zitouny We reached the capacity limit of our ship, while our crew is seeing more boats on the horizon. Currently, all vessels are overloaded,  Jugend Rettet added.  The total number of migrants reaching Europe by sea so far this year is less than half that counted in the same period of 2016, thanks to a deal between the EU and Turkey which blocked a once-busy route to Greece. But the number coming to Italy has risen.   Rescuers carry a bag containing the dead body of a migrant at the coast of Tajoura, east of Tripoli, Libya, June 27, 2017.Ismail ZitounyAbout 72,000 migrants arrived in Italy on the perilous route from Libya between Jan. 1 and June 21, roughly 20 percent more than in 2016, and more than 2,000 died on the way, according to the International Organization for Migration.  Criminal gangs have taken advantage of widespread lawlessness in Libya to establish profitable businesses, cramming mainly sub-Saharan African and Bangladeshi migrants into flimsy rubber boats. The Spanish naval ship Victoria, deployed in the European Union's Mediterranean mission, went to the aid of six boats and took on migrants from rescue vessels that were already full to capacity, Spain's defense ministry said. The Victoria then headed to the southern Italian island of Lampedusa with 907 migrants on board, one of whom was in critical condition, a ministry statement said.    Italy and the EU are trying to work with Libyan authorities to fight smugglers, but the same chaos which allowed the gangs to flourish is hampering official efforts.

The charges related to the deaths and also to an alleged subsequent cover-up by police of their own catastrophic mistakes. The victims, all Liverpool supporters, died in an overcrowded, fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, northern England, during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Police at first blamed the tragedy on drunken fans, an explanation that was always rejected by survivors, relatives of the victims and the wider Liverpool community. Families spent decades campaigning for justice for the 96.  It's about all of these families, 28 years we've had of torture really. It's been hell on earth,  said Margaret Aspinall, a leader of the families' campaign group, whose 18-year-old son James was among the dead.   This is definitely the start of the end,  she told reporters after the charging decision was announced.  We all need peace from Hillsborough, but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability.  Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was sufficient evidence to charge six men with criminal offences. The most high-profile among them is former police chief superintendent David Duckenfield, who was in charge of police operations at Hillsborough on the fateful day. He was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 men, women and children.  We will allege that David Duckenfield’s failures to discharge his personal responsibility were extraordinarily bad and contributed substantially to the deaths of each of those 96 people who so tragically and unnecessarily lost their lives,  said Hemming. Duckenfield was not charged over the death of the 96th casualty, Tony Bland, who died aged 22 from brain damage sustained at Hillsborough four years after the disaster, because of legal time limits that were in force at the time. Tributes for the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster are seen at Anfield in Liverpool, Britain April 15, 2016.Phil NobleChanges to Witness Statements Relatives of the victims, who were told of the decision in private shortly before it was made public, embraced outside the building where they were briefed in Warrington, northern England. Barry Devonside, who survived the stadium crush but lost his 18-year-old son Christopher, pumped his fist as he emerged from the building. He was visibly emotional as he told reporters how he had felt going into the briefing. Slideshow (6 Images) I was frightened, absolutely frightened that we were going to be let down again. It's so very hard to fight for justice over the period of time that the families have had to fight,  he said.   And we've been smacked in the face on a number of occasions,  he said, referring to a series of flawed investigations in the past. Among the other defendants was Norman Bettison, a former police chief constable, who was charged with four offences of misconduct in public office. Those related to his alleged lies about his involvement in the aftermath of the disaster and the culpability of fans. Two other ex-police chiefs, Donald Denton and Alan Foster, were charged with perverting the course of justice over alleged changes they made to witness statements used during the original investigation and inquest into the Hillsborough deaths. A lawyer who acted for police, Peter Metcalf, was also charged with perverting the course of justice over similar allegations. Graham Mackrell, who was Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's company secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, was charged with contravening safety rules and failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of others. The defendants other than Duckenfield will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on August 9 for a first hearing in their prosecution. Duckenfield is in a different situation because he was privately prosecuted in 1999, following which a senior judge imposed a stay. Prosecutors will need to apply to a High Court judge to lift the stay and order that the public prosecution go forward.

The firm declined to say how much Dyal paid for the stake but a person familiar with the matter said the stake values the firm at more than $400 million.  This capital allows us to continue developing our business for the future and invest more in our funds, fostering greater alignment with our investors,  Ivan Zinn, who founded the New York-based firm in 2006 said in a statement. Dyal, led by Michael Rees, has backed more than two dozen firms totaling some $9 billion in assets, its website says.

U.S. packaged food makers, including General Mills, Conagra Brands Inc (CAG.N) and Kellogg Co (K.N), have been struggling with sluggish demand as more consumers shift to fresh foods and products seen as healthier. The sector is expected to come under renewed pressure with the entry of online giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) into the brick-and-mortar grocery stores business through its deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). However, on a post-earnings call General Mills Chief Executive Jeff Harmening played down the impact.   There are a variety of customers who participate in e-commerce, and so it's not going to be just one winner,  he said. General Mills - the first packaged foods maker to report since the Amazon-Whole Foods deal - has  great relationships  with both companies, Harmening said. The company sells its Annie's line of organic foods at Whole Foods, while it sells a broad range of products on Amazon. Harmening, who took over in June, said the company would be more competitive on pricing this year, and concentrate on improving sales, which have fallen for the past two years.  We missed the mark last year on promotional spending, on soup and refrigerated dough. So in fiscal 2018, our goal is to be in the zone on pricing during the key season,  he said. In a bid to shore up margins, General Mills had been aggressively cutting back on promotions on high-margin products such as Progresso soups and Pillsbury dough, at a time when rivals were slashing prices. This weighed on sales, and the company said in March it would slow down the pace of the pull back on promotions. The company on Wednesday forecast adjusted earnings to increase 1-2 percent for the year ending May 2018, with a 1 cent impact from currency translation.  This implies an adjusted profit of $3.10-$3.13 per share, coming in below analysts' average estimate of $3.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  General Mills' profit has topped analysts' estimates in the past three quarters, helped by its cost-cutting strategy.  Selling and other expenses fell 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with advertising and media expenses dropping 17 percent.

Unless the New York State Legislature acts, control of the education system that serves 1.1 million students reverts on Friday to the state's Board of Education.  Governor Andrew Cuomo called vacationing lawmakers back to the statehouse in Albany a week after they adjourned their regular 2017 session. Mayoral control of city schools was started by de Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, who convinced the legislature to grant him leadership for seven years in 2002, and a six-year extension in 2009. De Blasio has been granted only annual renewals by lawmakers who have used that leverage for political horsetrading.  Since (Bloomberg) achieved mayoral control of education, our graduation rate has gone up almost 50 percent in 15 years – 50 percent!  de Blasio said on WCBS Radio on Wednesday.   That should be enough for everyone to agree this is the way to run our schools,  de Blasio said.  Previously, schools were run by 32 local school boards  with no accountability,  the mayor said.  Unfortunately it was a time characterized by chaos and corruption.

The assignment of the final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documentations conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB+(EXP)' expected rating is based on the 'BBB' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Andbank NL's parent, Andorra Banc Agricol Reig S.A. (Andbank), which acts as reference IDR, and a recovery uplift of one notch. Fitch will rely on the 90% expected contractual maximum asset percentage (AP), which will also be the breakeven AP for the rating. The 90% breakeven AP corresponds to a breakeven over-collateralisation (OC) of 11.1%. The Stable Outlook on the covered bond rating mirrors that on the parent's IDR. Fitch rates the covered bonds based on a limited rating uplift approach given the insufficient Andorran market performance information available to develop credit assumptions and perform a full asset analysis. For this reason Fitch is not assigning a payment continuity uplift (PCU) and limits the instrument's recovery uplift to one notch. Despite limitations, the data was sufficient to allow Fitch to conduct a broad asset analysis and estimate recovery prospects. The cover assets, originated by Andbank, will be transferred by means of a true-sale to a bankruptcy-remote Irish special-purpose vehicle (SPV). Fitch views that the cover assets will be sufficiently ring-fenced from the rest of Andbank's balance sheet as this transfer is valid under the laws of Andorra and the Netherlands. The covered bondholders benefit from dual recourse. The obligations of the issuer are guaranteed by the parent bank, Andbank, on first recourse. The second recourse comes from a guarantee by an Irish SPV, secured by rights to Andorran mortgages. Andbank NL's obligations will be secured by the issuer's interests under an intercompany loan granted to Andbank to lend on the proceeds of the issuance, while Andbank's guarantee will be secured by its interests under an intercompany loan and subordinated credit facility, granted to the SPV for the purpose of funding the initial and subsequent purchase of assets respectively. An IDR uplift of zero notches has been assigned. Secured debt is exempt from bail-in as per Andorran bank resolution law and it is Fitch's view that the security arrangements enable this to extend to the covered bonds. However, Fitch sees the risk that the cover pool could be enforced in a bank resolution scenario. We do not have sufficient clarity on the ability of the bank to maintain payments on the bonds in this scenario as there is no lender of last resort in Andorra and the bank only has limited access to European Central Bank liquidity through small European subsidiaries. Under Andbank NL's euro medium term note and covered bond programme it can issue hard- and soft-bullet covered bonds and senior debt up to EUR500 million. The covered bonds are expected to be secured by a dynamic cover pool, which as of April 2017 amounted to EUR177.3 million, consisting of 1,755 prime first ranking residential mortgage loans, granted to Andorran residents. Additional assets will be purchased from Andbank by the SPV with the aim to maintain the maximum contractual level of AP. All assets and covered bonds are expected to be denominated in euro. CRITERIA VARIATION Fitch has applied a variation to the Criteria for Country Risk in Global Structured Finance and Covered Bonds which describes the agency's approach to assigning and maintaining covered bonds ratings that are higher than the relevant sovereign's Local Currency IDR (LC IDR) or the Country Ceiling. Given that no limit above the LC IDR exists for Andorra and that the covered bonds under this programme are expected to be rated above Andorra's LC IDR, Fitch has considered a relative assessment with the limits set in other countries and concluded that the limit above the sovereign LC IDR would be four notches. This is based on the analysis of macroeconomic risks, the strength of the legal system and the intrinsic strength of Andorran banks. Had this variation not been applied, the bond rating would be capped at 'BBB'. RATING SENSITIVITIES Andorra Capital Agricol Reig, B.V.'s (Andbank NL) covered bonds are directly vulnerable to changes to  the Long-Term issuer Default Rating (IDR) of parent Andorra Banc Agricol Reig, S.A. (Andbank, BBB/Stable) which acts as the reference IDR. Given Fitch's application of the limited rating uplift approach, the rating of the covered bonds is directly linked to Andbank's Long-Term IDR The programme is also sensitive to obligor concentration risk, exposure to mortgage loans for which property title by the borrower is not absolute and/or to the level of employee loans which Fitch believes are relevant to the covered bond rating. If the combined exposure to these risks is material, recovery expectations could be undermined. In this event the covered bond rating would be equalised to that of senior debt.

Wearing a tag round his neck that read  Please look after this bear , Paddington was named after the London railway station of the same name where he was found after a boat journey from  darkest Peru , according to Bond's 1958 story  A Bear called Paddington . Bond said the inspiration for the character came when he spotted a teddy bear in his flat, and wondered what would happen if a real bear arrived at Paddington Station like a World War Two refugee with a label around his neck.  Glancing round in search of inspiration my gaze came to rest on Paddington, who gave me a hard stare from the mantelpiece, and the muse struck,  Bond wrote in the Radio Times magazine in 2014.  I knew exactly how my own parents would react if they saw it, particularly if it had a label round its neck, like a refugee in the last war. There are few things sadder in life than a refugee,  Bond said.  Paddington was taken in by the Brown family and his adventures and mishaps were detailed in more than 20 books, the last of which,  Paddington's Finest Hour , was published in April. The stories invariably saw Paddington, fueled by marmalade sandwiches, caught up in accidental but well-intentioned scrapes, while examples of rudeness were met with one of his  hard stares .  Please Look After This Bear  FILE PHOTO: Michael Bond, who created Paddington Bear, holds his Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) after it was presented to him by Prince William at an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in central London, October 27, 2015.John Stillwell/PoolAnn-Janine Murtagh, executive publisher of children's books at HarperCollins, which sold more than 35 million Paddington books, said Bond was a true gentleman and the most enchanting of writers.  Actor Hugh Bonneville, who played Mr Brown in the 2014 film  Paddington , said it seemed particularly poignant to learn about Bond's death on the last day of filming of a sequel. The new film is due out later this year. Slideshow (12 Images) He leaves a special legacy: long live the bear from darkest Peru,  he said.  Bond, who was born in Newbury, a town west of London, in 1926, wrote another series of children's books about a guinea pig called Olga da Polga and adult detective stores featuring Monsieur Pamplemousse.    He started writing while serving in the British army in Egypt and once said that he could have papered his walls with rejection slips. Paddington, though, was written for his own pleasure.  I didn't intend to write a book at all which was a plus as it happened I think as I didn’t write for any particular age group – I wrote it to please myself,  Bond told the BBC.  In 10 days I had what turned out to be a book on my hands.   Paddington is very real to me.

In November, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson directed the State Department to reconsider its  binary-only gender passport policy,  in the case of Navy veteran Dan Zzyym, an “intersex” Colorado resident who sued the federal government for refusing to issue a passport because it requires an applicant to denote either male or female gender. After conducting its court-ordered review, the State Department last month again denied Zzyym’s application, according to a motion filed on the plaintiff's behalf by the Lambda Legal Defense Fund asking Jackson to reopen the case. In his original order to the State Department, Jackson declined to consider constitutional questions raised in Zzyym's lawsuit unless the issue could not be resolved administratively. Zzyym, born in 1958, sued in 2015 after being denied a passport to travel to Mexico for an international conference of intersex people - those born with anatomies that do not fit the typical definition of male or female. The lawsuit claims the State Department's policy violates due process and equal protections for Zzyym and other intersex people. Zzyym was raised as a boy and underwent several irreversible, painful and medically unnecessary surgeries before joining the U.S. Navy as a male, according to the lawsuit. It was only after returning to civilian life after six years in the military that Zzyym realized there were others who did not fit into traditional gender categories, the lawsuit says. The government did not oppose Tuesday's motion by Zzyym and on Tuesday Jackson agreed to revive the case. A spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Zzyym, associate director for the Intersex Campaign for Equality, said in a statement that the government “is in effect forcing me to lie about who I am and I’m not going to do that.

BPI had claimed ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co, and Avila defamed the company by calling its ground-beef product “pink slime” and making errors and omissions in a 2012 report. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. BPI's signature product, commonly mixed into ground beef, is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill E. coli and other contaminants.  While this has not been an easy road to travel, it was necessary to begin rectifying the harm we suffered as a result of what we believed to be biased and baseless reporting in 2012,  South Dakota-based BPI said in a statement.  Through this process, we have again established what we all know to be true about Lean Finely Textured Beef: it is beef, and is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.  ABC stood by its reporting, which it has said deserved protection under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment which guarantees freedom of religion, speech and the press.  Throughout this case, we have maintained that our reports accurately presented the facts and views of knowledgeable people about this product,  ABC said in a statement confirming the settlement.  Although we have concluded that continued litigation of this case is not in the company's interests, we remain committed to the vigorous pursuit of truth and the consumer's right to know about the products they purchase.  The trial began earlier this month in the tiny town of Elk Point, South Dakota, and had been expected to last eight weeks. BPI had claimed up to $1.9 billion in damages, which could have been tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. During its reports, ABC used the term  pink slime  more than 350 times across six different media platforms including TV and online, Dan Webb, an attorney for BPI, said during opening statements on June 5. In the aftermath of ABC's broadcasts, BPI closed three of its four processing plants and said its revenue dropped 80 percent to $130 million. Attorneys for ABC countered that the term was commonly used before ABC's reports and said that BPI's business was already suffering.

Voya's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is unaffected by this action. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is equivalent to the ratings assigned to Voya's existing senior unsecured debt, and reflects standard notching based on Fitch's rating criteria. Fitch expects proceeds from the new issuance to be used to fund Voya's proposed partial tender offer for up to $400 million of outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2018. Financial leverage was approximately 23% at March 31, 2017, unchanged from year-end 2016. Fitch affirmed Voya's ratings and its insurance operating subsidiaries on Sept. 19, 2016. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Voya's ratings reflect its balance sheet strength and ample debt servicing capacity, the large-scale and solid business profile in retirement, employee benefits and universal life markets, improved operating performance within its core businesses, and its conservative investment portfolio. Offsetting these positives are the challenges related to the run-off of Voya's closed-block variable annuity (VA) book and ongoing headwinds associated with the low interest rate environment, which negatively impacts earnings and reserve adequacy. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Continued growth in operating profitability that leads to an improvement in operating ROE to over 11%; --Sustained maintenance of GAAP adjusted operating earnings-based interest coverage of more than 10x; --Private sale of closed-block book at good value with boost to capitalization and reduction in volatility and risk; --Reported RBC above 450% and financial leverage below 20%. Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --A decline in reported RBC below 375%; --Financial leverage exceeding 30%; --Significant adverse operating results that lead to GAAP adjusted operating earnings-based interest coverage below 6x; --Material reserve charges required in the company's insurance/variable annuity books. Fitch has assigned the following rating: Voya Financial, Inc. --$400 million 3.125% senior notes due July 15, 2024 at 'BBB'.

The conservative South Asian nation, where homosexuality is a crime, last week issued a passport to prominent transgender activist Farzana Jan with an X to symbolize the third sex printed under the gender category of travel document. Jan, who is president of the charity Trans Action Pakistan, said the introduction of the X classification - along with M for Male and F for Female - was a significant step in the community's fight for legal recognition in Pakistan.  Men and women both have been given their identity, but we were deprived of this right. We are happy there is a growing realization that we should be given our identity,  Jan said by phone from the northwest city of Peshawar.  We also want to see how the outside world is. But we have been facing many problems with regard to complications in our travel documents. But, thank God, this issue has now been resolved,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. There is no official data on the population of transgender people in Pakistan, but Trans Action Pakistan estimates they number at least half a million in a country of 190 million. Trans people technically enjoy better rights in Pakistan than in many other nations across the world, but in practice they are marginalized and face discrimination when it comes to health, education and jobs. They often face violence and stigma. The country's Supreme Court has in recent years taken steps towards recognizing their basic rights. In 2009, the court ruled that  hijras  - which include transvestites, transsexuals and eunuchs - could get national identity cards as a  third sex.  Since then it has also declared equal rights for transgender people, including the right to inherit property and assets, the right to vote and to be counted as a separate category in the country's national census. Yet many hijras in Pakistan, as well as other South Asian nations such as India and Bangladesh, are attacked, murdered, raped or forced to work as sex workers to support themselves. Others eke out a living by begging for alms on the streets. Last year there was a spate of attacks on transgender people in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Peshawar is the capital city. After one attack, an activist died in hospital after being shot multiple times by a friend. Her friends accused the hospital of delays in her treatment, with staff unsure whether to admit her to a male or female ward.  The main challenge for us is to change society's behavior,  Jan said.  We have largely been confined to the four walls of our houses because we are harassed, terrorized and ridiculed by the people.

Mihai Tudose was named premier after lawmakers from his Social Democrat Party last week ousted Sorin Grindeanu for failing to stick to legislative plans that helped them win an election in December. But critics said that, with some leading political figures facing allegations of graft, Grindeanu was more likely fired for not doing enough to water down anti-corruption legislation.  I don't feel like I won a prize,  Tudose told reporters as he prepared to seek parliamentary approval for his cabinet.  I was designated ... to go work for the country. The top priority will be implementing the governing program.   The leu was up 0.3 percent to the euro at 1505 GMT (11.05 a.m. ET), boosted by hopes of an end to the political crisis that pushed the currency to a five-year low earlier this month. Romania is the European Union's fastest-growing but least-developed economy, and its authorities have been under close scrutiny from Brussels as a crackdown on high-level corruption has exposed internal divisions. The European Commission keeps its justice system under special monitoring. An attempt in February by the outgoing cabinet to decree abuse of office offences exempt from prosecution below a certain amount of financial gain triggered the largest street protests in Romania since the fall of communism in 1989.  The decree was subsequently rescinded. Most outgoing ministers featured again in the line-up Tudose and Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea presented on Wednesday. Tudose is a close ally of Dragnea, who keeps a tight rein on the party and is himself currently on trial in an abuse of office case.  Tudorel Toader, who retained his portfolio as Justice Minister, has said he would seek a wide debate this time before, in line with a constitutional court ruling, setting a financial gain exemption cap.  In theory, the higher the cap, the greater an offending politician's chances of being shielded from prosecution.  In the most high-profile cabinet change, Ionut Misa replaced Viorel Stefan as finance minister. Critics  Both the finance and justice posts will play a key role as the Social Democrat-led government also seeks to answer critics over the state of the economy. Its program envisions hefty public sector wage and pension hikes, as well as a fiscal overhaul that includes income tax cuts and shifts the burden of social security contributions solely onto workers, not employers.  Those plans have raised concerns among analysts, the European Commission and the IMF, that Romania will overshoot the EU's deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product. Another priority is setting up a sovereign wealth fund worth billions of euros and incorporating state-owned companies. Fund managers and brokers have said if done well, the fund would boost the performance of these companies.  However, it raises concerns over transparency, they added.  The chances for the stability of this government are evenly split,  said Sergiu Miscoiu, political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University.   One the one hand, we have a prime minister who is more loyal to the party leader. But within the government itself there are potentially clashing personalities.

Craig Austin Lang, William Wright-Martinovich and Alex Zwiefelhofer were detained on June 21 trying to cross to South Sudan from Kenya, said Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino from America's 82nd Airborne Unit. They were deported to Kenya, he added.  Private First Class Zwiefelhofer was absent from the 82nd without leave, he said.

It was not clear when the three were transferred to Kenyan custody. Kenyan authorities did not return calls seeking comment.  South Sudanese foreign affairs ministry spokesman Mawien Makol said the three had been deported because they did not have visas but said they may have claimed to be journalists.   I heard about three American journalists who were detained on the border between Kenya and South Sudan because these journalists had not received visas,  he told Reuters.  South Sudan's four-year-old civil war has displaced more than three million people and briefly sparked a famine earlier this year.

The government reviews bank rules every two years to judge whether they meet international standards and to ensure that taxpayers will not have to bail out big banks that run into trouble. It said on Wednesday that it sees no need for fundamental changes to the regulatory approach but suggested extending  gone  concern  rules beyond big banks UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) to include primarily domestic lenders PostFinance [PFAG.UL], Raiffeisen [RFSHW.UL] and Zuercher Kantonalbank [ZKB.UL].  Like for the big banks, they should reflect the going concern capital requirements, but only 40 percent of them,  the government said.  With this proposal, the (government) is taking into consideration the fact that the banks in question are less interconnected internationally and are thus less systemically important.  The government has instructed the finance ministry to work with the FINMA watchdog and Swiss National Bank (SNB) on the rules changes. Raiffeisen said it could live with the government's proposal and build up its so-called total loss-absorbtion capacity capital buffers during a transition period. Postfinance simply took note of the proposal, while a ZKB representative was not immediately available for comment. Banks deemed important to the financial system must maintain enough  going concern  capital to operate in a stress scenario without state support.  They also have to hold  gone concern  capital used to restructure a troubled bank or keep alive its important functions without state help. The SNB this month told UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) they still need to draft credible plans for potential insolvency as part of Swiss efforts to prepare for a potential banking crisis.    Even so, the government said on Wednesday that it had concluded that Switzerland's existing regulatory approach for reducing risk posed by systemically important banks was suitable.  Overall, the approach is to be seen in a positive light by international standards,  the Federal Council said.  It is not necessary to fundamentally adapt the regulatory model.

The new protocols, which started on April 10, involve full inspection of all Brazilian meat imports on five consecutive shipments from each approved plant and for each product category, CFIA spokeswoman Maria Kubacki said. Canada is a small buyer of Brazilian beef, importing C$21 million ($16.1 million) worth of its beef and veal last year, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Full inspections by Canada include analysis for pathogens in ready-to-eat meat products, chemical residue testing and further analysis of containers used for canned meats. Previously, CFIA conducted one full inspection randomly out of 10 consecutive shipments from each specific Brazilian establishment. The other nine shipments were visually inspected. Brazilian police raided the premises of global meatpacking companies JBS SA and BRF SA in March, as well as dozens of smaller rivals, over suspected bribery of health officials.. The United States last week banned imports of fresh Brazilian beef after a high percentage of shipments failed safety checks. Canada has rejected six shipments of Brazilian beef out of 191 meat shipments since April 10, according to CFIA. It blocked imports in May from one JBS plant in Brazil that did not meet food safety requirements, and delisted two others in March. The rejected shipments had metal can defects which could lead to spoilage. The U.S. ban on fresh Brazilian beef imports will not likely create much opportunity for Canadian beef shippers selling to their neighboring country, said Dennis Laycraft, executive vice-president of Canadian Cattlemen's Association. Brazilian fresh beef is more similar to that produced by Australia and New Zealand, where cattle are raised mostly on grass, than Canadian beef, he said.

Shares climbed 1 percent and hit a two-year high of $118.47 a share. St. Louis-based Monsanto reaffirmed its earnings per share target and raised its gross profit outlook for its seeds and genomics unit, which sells seeds, licenses biotech traits and sells farm data services. Record soybean seedings in the United States and Brazil, the top two producers, were a boon for the world's largest seed company.  There was a lot of acreage that rotated out of corn and into soy and Monsanto was set up really well for that since they had some product launches in soy this year,  said Matt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones. Sales of soybean seed and traits, the second-biggest business by revenue, jumped 29.3 percent to $896 million in the third quarter ended May 31. Seedings of Monsanto's Xtend soybeans, the newest U.S. varieties, totaled 20 million acres this spring, above earlier forecasts for 18 million. Intacta, its South American variety, was planted on more than 50 million acres, near the high end of expectations.

Monsanto agreed in September to a $66 billion buyout offer from Bayer, that, if approved by regulators, would create a company commanding more than a quarter of the world market for seeds and pesticides. Monsanto said on Wednesday it was working toward completion of the merger by the end of 2017 and expects to submit merger-related filings to the European Union by the end of this month. Bayer has said it would sell its LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses to help satisfy competition authorities looking at the Monsanto deal. Net income attributable to Monsanto rose to $843 million, or $1.90 per share, in the quarter, from $717 million, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, Monsanto earned $1.93 per share, beating the analysts' average estimate of $1.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings per share guidance remained at the high end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90 on an ongoing basis.

Success in passing the so-called  marriage for all  amendment will be a tonic for the centre-left party, which has barely made a dent in Merkel's comfortable poll lead after months of campaigning. At a parliamentary group meeting on Wednesday, Merkel accused the SPD of  ambushing  her by bringing forward a vote on an issue that divides her conservative bloc down the middle.  It's sad and completely unnecessary ... that such a decision has turned into a political confrontation at the very moment when there was a realistic outlook for a process that could have crossed party lines,  Merkel told Wirtschaftswoche magazine in an interview.  Every member of parliament should be able to follow their conscience.  When Merkel announced on Monday that she would make any vote on equal marriage a matter of conscience for her lawmakers, freeing them from the party whip on the matter, she was hoping to shut down a line of attack that was a threat to her party. With same-sex marriage now legal in most of Germany's neighbours and backed by all parliamentary parties other than her conservative bloc, continued opposition to change risked looking anachronistic. But immediately after her decision, SPD leaders moved to bring a vote to the floor of the full parliament, arguing that by making it a matter of conscience Merkel had released her coalition partner from its commitment not to hold a vote. Merkel's volte face drew the ire of some of her own lawmakers, who usually defer to a leader who has led them to three election victories and still enjoys a 14-point poll lead over the SPD.  Are we going to change our view whenever it is politically convenient?,  asked lawmaker Wolfgang Bosbach in the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper. Together, the pro-equal marriage SPD, Greens and Left parties command a slim majority in parliament, meaning the amendment is likely to pass even without the expected support of many conservative lawmakers. The proposal, moved in 2015 in the upper house of parliament by the state of Rhineland Palatinate, would, if passed by the lower house, be signed into law by the president some time after July 7. Victory would give a boost to the SPD's flagging morale. But with three months of campaigning to go until the September 24 parliamentary election, Merkel's early retreat may prove to have been the better strategic choice.

Crude inventories rose 118,000 barrels in the week ending June 23, compared with forecasts for a 2.6 million-barrel decrease, as imports rose  129,000 barrels per day and refinery runs fell 262,000 bpd. Gasoline stocks fell 894,000 barrels, compared with expectations for a 583,000-barrel drop. But current gasoline inventories of 241 million barrels remains about 7.5 percent higher than the seasonal average for stocks over the past five years. Those high inventories have squeezed refining profits. The current gasoline crack spread RBc1-CLc1 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, an indicator of refining margins, of $16.53 a barrel is $3 lower than the five-year average of $20.56, as heavy supply is hurting refiners even in the midst of the summer driving season.  U.S. gasoline stocks remaining above its five-year average underscores demand concerns in the market,  said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. Demand for the motor fuel over the past four months was down 2.4 percent from the same period a year ago, the EIA said. Gasoline demand was slack at the outset of 2017, but has picked up in recent weeks, and the American Automobile Association expects a record number of U.S. motorists will drive more than 50 miles (80 km) from home over the coming Fourth of July holiday weekend. Oil prices rose following the report. U.S. crude futures was 55 cents higher at $44.79 a barrel as of 10:57 a.m. EDT (1457 GMT), while Brent futures rose 62 cents to $47.27 a barrel. Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 297,000 barrels, the EIA said. U.S. crude production fell 100,000 bpd to 9.25 million bpd last week, the EIA said. That is  a significant decline given the increases in previous weeks and that is supporting crude futures today,” Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said, noting some of that production decline was likely due to Tropical Storm Cindy, which briefly shut some operations in the Gulf of Mexico last week. Refinery utilization rates fell 1.5 percentage points to 92.5 percent of operable capacity, EIA data showed. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 223,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 453,000-barrel increase, the EIA said.

Mihai Tudose was named premier after lawmakers from his Social Democrat Party last week ousted Sorin Grindeanu for failing to stick to legislative plans that helped them win an election in December. But critics said that, with some leading political figures facing allegations of graft, Grindeanu was more likely fired for not doing enough to water down anti-corruption legislation.  I don't feel like I won a prize,  Tudose told reporters as he prepared to seek parliamentary approval for his cabinet.  I was designated ... to go work for the country. The top priority will be implementing the governing program.   The leu was up 0.3 percent to the euro at 1505 GMT (11.05 a.m. ET), boosted by hopes of an end to the political crisis that pushed the currency to a five-year low earlier this month. Romania is the European Union's fastest-growing but least-developed economy, and its authorities have been under close scrutiny from Brussels as a crackdown on high-level corruption has exposed internal divisions. The European Commission keeps its justice system under special monitoring. An attempt in February by the outgoing cabinet to decree abuse of office offences exempt from prosecution below a certain amount of financial gain triggered the largest street protests in Romania since the fall of communism in 1989.  The decree was subsequently rescinded. Most outgoing ministers featured again in the line-up Tudose and Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea presented on Wednesday. Tudose is a close ally of Dragnea, who keeps a tight rein on the party and is himself currently on trial in an abuse of office case.  Tudorel Toader, who retained his portfolio as Justice Minister, has said he would seek a wide debate this time before, in line with a constitutional court ruling, setting a financial gain exemption cap.  In theory, the higher the cap, the greater an offending politician's chances of being shielded from prosecution.  In the most high-profile cabinet change, Ionut Misa replaced Viorel Stefan as finance minister. Critics  Both the finance and justice posts will play a key role as the Social Democrat-led government also seeks to answer critics over the state of the economy. Its program envisions hefty public sector wage and pension hikes, as well as a fiscal overhaul that includes income tax cuts and shifts the burden of social security contributions solely onto workers, not employers.  Those plans have raised concerns among analysts, the European Commission and the IMF, that Romania will overshoot the EU's deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product. Another priority is setting up a sovereign wealth fund worth billions of euros and incorporating state-owned companies. Fund managers and brokers have said if done well, the fund would boost the performance of these companies.  However, it raises concerns over transparency, they added.  The chances for the stability of this government are evenly split,  said Sergiu Miscoiu, political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University.   One the one hand, we have a prime minister who is more loyal to the party leader. But within the government itself there are potentially clashing personalities.  New Defense Minister Adrian Tutuianu will oversee an ongoing military acquisitions program as Romania, on NATO's European easternmost flank, boosts its military spending. editing by John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/romania-government-idUSL8N1JP24J"},

(Reuters) - A man charged with stabbing an airport police officer in an attack federal investigators are probing as an act of terrorism will remain in detention until a hearing next week, his lawyers said on Wednesday.  Amor Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada, was charged in federal court with violence at an international airport for stabbing officer Jeff Neville at the Bishop International Airport in Flint on June 21. Neville underwent surgery and has left the hospital, local media reported.  Ftouhi, originally from Tunisia and who holds dual Tunisian-Canadian citizenship, appeared briefly before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis at the federal courthouse in Flint on Wednesday morning.  Ftouhi's attorney, Joan Morgan, said her client was not seeking bond because of an immigration hold that would bar Ftouhi from leaving jail. He will remain in detention until his preliminary hearing scheduled for July 5, but a grand jury indictment could come before that.  Ftouhi, who did not speak other than to acknowledge he understood and agreed with his attorney, wore an orange jumpsuit and was shackled. His face was partially covered by a mask he was wearing for  unspecified medical reasons,  federal court spokesman David Ashenfelter said.  Court officials would not say where he is being held.   Ftouhi legally entered the United States at Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said last week. Officials said Ftouhi targeted a city with an international airport, but declined to say why Flint was chosen.  Ftouhi, who was not on the radar of U.S. or Canadian authorities before the attack, was in Michigan as early as June 18, the FBI said. U.S. and Canadian investigators are probing his travel before the attack.  According to the criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic  Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Neville. He also said something to the effect of  You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are all going to die,  the complaint said.  Ftouhi attempted to buy a gun before the attack, but was unable to do so, the FBI said. FBI officials declined to provide details on where Ftouhi attempted to buy the gun or what type of gun he tried to purchase. The 12-inch (30.5 cm), serrated knife Ftouhi used in the attack was bought in the United States.

Barclays and Deutsche Bank, along with Goldman Sachs, led the charge in 2014 in predicting rises in U.S. interest rates and the weakness of Europe would see the greenback reach parity with the euro for the first time in more than a decade. Yet instead, Draghi's cementing of expectations for a gradual tightening of euro zone monetary policy - and the lack of faith in the Fed's promises on rate rises - spurred a 2 percent jump in the euro this week that to some felt final. Both Barclays and Deutsche - respectively the fifth and seventh biggest players in the $5 trillion a day global currencies trade - have now backed off long-held support for the greenback in the space of a few days.   The prospective economic and monetary divergence that has driven the dollar updraft has peaked,  Barclays' macro research team said in a note last Thursday.  It seems premature ... to call for a dollar downdraft. But with the USD already significantly overvalued on most of our metrics (by about 15 percent), medium-term risks are mainly to the downside,  they added. Many economists already believed the greenback was nearing the end of the road last year when excitement over the boost to spending and growth promised by President Donald Trump funded one last hurrah.  The evaporation of faith in that idea along with Trump's troubles in Congress over healthcare have pulled the greenback 10 cents back from the long-term highs of $1.03 per euro hit in January.  Strength against a batch of other emerging currencies has kept the index used to measure its broader strength rising.  But if this week's moves mark the end of the line, the 24 percent gain this time will have fallen well short of previous rallies between 1995 and 2002 and 1978 and 1985, when the dollar gained respectively 53 and 34 percent.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that the best way they have to address this challenge may not help much, and is economically dangerous and politically unpopular. Doing nothing, though, is even more hazardous. The key problem for the monetary authorities is neither unwanted inflation nor debilitating deflation. No one really knows why, but after almost four decades of global disinflation, prices and wages seem to be broadly stable. Things might change, but in recent years both the mandates and the mindsets of today’s monetary authorities have not been fit for purpose. In particular, the focus on the non-problem of price instability encouraged monetary authorities to sleepwalk into the 2008 global financial crisis. Their belief that only inflation mattered allowed them to doze through the blowing of a gigantic global credit bubble, the boom phase of what the Bank for International Settlements aptly calls the financial cycle. Central bankers have stirred from their dogmatic slumber. The fear of future credit excess has led them to endorse much tighter control of lending quantity and practices: so-called macro-prudential regulation. And although they are often coy about admitting it, the fear of a damaging credit bust helps explain why they have spent the last nine years looking for reasons not to tighten monetary policy. Among the big economies, only the United States has increased the policy rate, and even then to a still-puny range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. Credit has indeed been restrained in some countries. The BIS calculates that since 2007 the ratio of private debt to GDP has declined in the United States and United Kingdom by 16 percentage points and 13 percentage points respectively. In Spain, which had the biggest property crash, the fall has been 39 percentage points. However, the rest of the world continues to borrow away, so much so that the global ratio has increased by 23 percentage points, to 138 percent. China, where the ratio has almost doubled, is the biggest culprit, but the ratio has risen by 30 percentage points or more in Canada, France, Korea, Poland, Switzerland and Turkey. The BIS notes other signs of global financial excess. The reliance on short-term dollar financing for global trade and portfolio flows is still high. And disinflation adds to the potential danger, since, as Italy’s dire experience has shown, bad loans tend to get worse when nominal GDP growth slows to a crawl. In retrospect, the decade of ultra-low policy rates looks like a mistake. While the slow recovery in the real economy suggests that loose monetary policy was at best a blunt instrument for stimulus, it almost certainly encouraged the resumption or continuation of risky credit expansion in many countries. It also entrenched expectations of ever-bullish markets for financial assets. The more secure those hopes become, the more certain they are to be proved false. But this is a hard mistake to correct. A sharp increase in policy interest rates could bring an immediate financial crisis – a spiral of defaulting borrowers, crumbling bank balance sheets and sudden shortages of credit and confidence. Not only could the price of a new monetary regime be high, but the effects might be less than desired. While central banks control the short-term cost of money, their actions may not push up longer-term yields or immediately curb financial excess. Still, central banks are in the wrong place on interest rates, and need to move to a better position. Low rates have already done what they can for the real economy, but they continue to breed the credit excesses which make an eventually more serious breakdown more likely. Macro-prudential curbs can help, but cannot withstand the rising tide forever. There could even be gains in the short term. Anything which makes leveraged financial speculation less alluring is good for the world, and the lack of cheap money and the availability of higher interest income should have that effect. A more normal interest rate environment could possibly lead to a healthier financial attitude, with less interest in playing the markets and more investment in real assets.  As for the downside, another great recession can be avoided. The biggest problem in 2008 was not actually the sharp turn in the credit cycle, but the severe drop in business and consumer confidence after Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. That error does not have to be repeated. A steady and coordinated global increase in policy interest rates might well push some institutions over the edge. But the authorities need not repeat their mistake. They can help wind down excesses and recognise losses while using fiscal policy to ensure there is enough money around to protect trade, jobs, investments and depositors.  Interest rate stimulus has lost whatever kick it once had. It is time to make money substantially more expensive.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The conservative South Asian nation, where homosexuality is a crime, last week issued a passport to prominent transgender activist Farzana Jan with an X to symbolize the third sex printed under the gender category of travel document.   Jan, who is president of the charity Trans Action Pakistan, said the introduction of the X classification - along with M for Male and F for Female - was a significant step in the community's fight for legal recognition in Pakistan.    Men and women both have been given their identity, but we were deprived of this right. We are happy there is a growing realization that we should be given our identity,  Jan said by phone from the northwest city of Peshawar.  We also want to see how the outside world is. But we have been facing many problems with regard to complications in our travel documents. But, thank God, this issue has now been resolved,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. There is no official data on the population of transgender people in Pakistan, but Trans Action Pakistan estimates they number at least half a million in a country of 190 million. Trans people technically enjoy better rights in Pakistan than in many other nations across the world, but in practice they are marginalized and face discrimination when it comes to health, education and jobs. They often face violence and stigma. The country's Supreme Court has in recent years taken steps towards recognizing their basic rights. In 2009, the court ruled that  hijras  - which include transvestites, transsexuals and eunuchs - could get national identity cards as a  third sex.  Since then it has also declared equal rights for transgender people, including the right to inherit property and assets, the right to vote and to be counted as a separate category in the country's national census. Yet many hijras in Pakistan, as well as other South Asian nations such as India and Bangladesh, are attacked, murdered, raped or forced to work as sex workers to support themselves. Others eke out a living by begging for alms on the streets. Last year there was a spate of attacks on transgender people in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Peshawar is the capital city. After one attack, an activist died in hospital after being shot multiple times by a friend. Her friends accused the hospital of delays in her treatment, with staff unsure whether to admit her to a male or female ward.  The main challenge for us is to change society's behavior,  Jan said.  We have largely been confined to the four walls of our houses because we are harassed, terrorized and ridiculed by the people.

A series of stories on the Iran prisoner-hostage swap, by Yeganeh Torbati, Joel Schectman, Matt Spetalnick, Lesley Wroughton and Patricia Zengerle, won the Edwin M. Hood Diplomatic Award. The judges said the Reuters reporters offered a close look at the prisoners that President Barack Obama agreed to release in exchange for the four Americans held by Tehran and that their reporting made clear it represented a reversal of five years of U.S. policy. Here are the links to their coverage:   As relations thaw, some Iranian prisoners in U.S. hope for early release Exclusive: White House dropped $10 million claim in Iran prisoner deal Exclusive: Obama pardons Iranians charged with sanctions violations On US end of Iran prisoner deal, doubts and delays in final hours Exclusive: In negotiating to free Americans in Iran, U.S. blinked on new sanctions  The series “Unsafe at Any Level,” by Michael Pell and Joshua Schneyer, won in the Joan M. Friedenberg Online Journalism category. The judges said the series was “really important reporting on a crucial topic - the lead-water crisis in Flint, Mich. Interactive graphics allow readers to search different cities to see how they're affected.”  The series “The Uncounted,” by Ryan McNeill, Deborah J. Nelson, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Andrew Chung, David Rohde and Benjamin Lesser, was given an Honorable Mention in the Consumer Journalism-Newspapers category. Judges said the “hard-hitting series explores the deadly ramifications from ‘superbugs,’ antibiotic-resistance bacteria that can develop in health care settings and raise hell on both individual lives and the entire system.”   These awards add to a growing number of prestigious recognitions so far this year, including a Pulitzer Prize finalist, a One World Media Award, four Loeb Award finalists, twelve SOPA Award recognitions, two SABEW Awards and four Deadline Club Award honorees.

Bank stock reflected a rise in treasury yields, following a Reuters report that the market had overinterpreted chief Mario Draghi's comments that the ECB was ready to start withdrawing the emergency stimulus for the economy. The sources clarified that Draghi intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening. The financial index's 1.16 percent rise led the gainers, with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup all up more than 1 percent. The consumer discretionary index rose 0.9 percent, helped by a gain in Walt Disney, Comcast and Amazon. At 10:57 a.m. ET (1457 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 126.57 points, or 0.59 percent, at 21,437.23, the S&P; 500 was up 18.26 points, or 0.75 percent, at 2,437.64. The Nasdaq Composite was up 54.76 points, or 0.89 percent, at 6,201.38. With investors awaiting second-quarter corporate earnings, equity valuations have come under focus at a time when inflation remains low, recent economic data has been tepid and President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies face delays. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15 times.  Valuations are certainly a little bit elevated and they are a bit of a concern,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  We saw valuations run up in the first quarter but then when earnings came out they were pretty solid so ultimately if earnings continue at the rate we've seen recently, then those valuations will be fine.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that by standard metrics, some asset valuations look high while Vice Chair Stanley Fischer warned that central bank must remain vigilant in monitoring financial stability risks. San Francisco Fed head John Williams said investors may be getting overly complacent about risks and that  the stock market seems to be running pretty much on fumes.  Meanwhile, Trump administration's ability to deliver on election promises came under focus on Tuesday after a planned vote on Republican healthcare bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act was put off to after the Senate's July 4 recess. The healthcare legislation is the first plank of President Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Oil prices rose about 1 percent but concerns remained that a three-year supply glut is far from over. KB Home was up 3.2 percent at $23.54 after the homebuilder increased its full-year forecast. General Mills rose 2.3 percent to $56.81 after the Cheerios maker's quarterly profit beat estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,263 to 516. On the Nasdaq, 2,016 issues.

The conservative South Asian nation, where homosexuality is a crime, last week issued a passport to prominent transgender activist Farzana Jan with an X to symbolize the third sex printed under the gender category of travel document.   Jan, who is president of the charity Trans Action Pakistan, said the introduction of the X classification - along with M for Male and F for Female - was a significant step in the community's fight for legal recognition in Pakistan.    Men and women both have been given their identity, but we were deprived of this right. We are happy there is a growing realization that we should be given our identity,  Jan said by phone from the northwest city of Peshawar.  We also want to see how the outside world is. But we have been facing many problems with regard to complications in our travel documents. But, thank God, this issue has now been resolved,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. There is no official data on the population of transgender people in Pakistan, but Trans Action Pakistan estimates they number at least half a million in a country of 190 million. Trans people technically enjoy better rights in Pakistan than in many other nations across the world, but in practice they are marginalized and face discrimination when it comes to health, education and jobs. They often face violence and stigma. The country's Supreme Court has in recent years taken steps towards recognizing their basic rights. In 2009, the court ruled that  hijras  - which include transvestites, transsexuals and eunuchs - could get national identity cards as a  third sex.  Since then it has also declared equal rights for transgender people, including the right to inherit property and assets, the right to vote and to be counted as a separate category in the country's national census. Yet many hijras in Pakistan, as well as other South Asian nations such as India and Bangladesh, are attacked, murdered, raped or forced to work as sex workers to support themselves. Others eke out a living by begging for alms on the streets. Last year there was a spate of attacks on transgender people in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Peshawar is the capital city. After one attack, an activist died in hospital after being shot multiple times by a friend. Her friends accused the hospital of delays in her treatment, with staff unsure whether to admit her to a male or female ward.  The main challenge for us is to change society's behavior,  Jan said.  We have largely been confined to the four walls of our houses because we are harassed, terrorized and ridiculed by the people.

The affected terminal is operated by Danish shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk, which said on Tuesday that the cyber attack had caused outages in its computer systems globally. Clients were notified on Wednesday morning that vessel operations at the terminal would be hit and that the company could not say when normal services would resume, according to one shipping industry source. In a note to global clients, Maersk said:  Access to most ports is not impacted, however some APM Terminals are affected and gates are closed.  The port has been trying to clear containers manually, but operational capacity has dropped to a third at the terminal, Anil Diggikar, chairman of Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT), told Reuters on Wednesday morning.  This is fallout of global cyber attack. We are hopeful that operations will normalize in a day,  he said. Containers are piling up outside the port due to the delay in loading and unloading at Gateway Terminals India, he said. Trucks carrying containers enter the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) on the outskirts of Mumbai, India June 28, 2017.Shailesh AndradeThe Indian government said on Wednesday it had sent Gulshan Rai, India's national cyber security coordinator, to JNPT to deal with the situation. It warned that the disruptions could lead to  bunching of in-bound and out-bound container cargo,  and truck congestion around the port.  Slideshow (3 Images)The operations of an adjourning terminal were also slightly affected by congestion at the Maersk Terminal, said two shipping industry sources.     In a securities filing, Gujarat Pipavav Port, located about 175 miles northwest of JNPT, said it is also working to  limit the impact  at its site. Pipavav, which is also operated by APM Terminals, did not provide detail on the extent of the impact at its site, but a spokeswoman for APM said the port was  partially impacted.    The cyber attack, similar to the ransomware that infected more than 300,000 computers last month, also affected computers at Russia's biggest oil company, Ukranian banks and numerous other multinational firms. Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, told Reuters on Wednesday it was unable to process new orders after being hit by the cyber attack.

The pound jumped by well over a cent after Carney's comments to hit $1.2971, its strongest since June 9, the day of the results of Britain's parliamentary election. That left it up 1.2 percent on the day.  Speaking at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, Carney said policymakers would need to look at the extent to which stronger business investment offset a slowdown in consumption, as well as growth in wages and labour costs. The remarks showed a shift in emphasis since a speech last week when Carney said now was not the time to raise rates. He did not repeat that phrase on Wednesday, and markets immediately priced in a greater chance of an earlier-than-expected rise. Short sterling interest rate futures <0#FSS:> plunged, particularly across the mid-2018 to 2019 contracts, indicating a steeper path of interest rate hikes.   Our main message would be not to over-interpret the comments – there’s definitely a disconnect when you look at what’s happening in the rates market and the way the FX market is moving,  ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said.   There is a risk that the moves are a bit too aggressive relative to what the central banks are trying to tell us. In the case of the UK, this withdrawal of stimulus could just be one rate hike and not the start of a full-blown hiking cycle. So you’ve got to be careful about overshoots in these currencies.  Having touched a seven-month low against a resurgent euro, sterling jumped 0.9 percent to 87.71 pence.  The euro jumped on Tuesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that the days of the bank's stimulus programme were numbered.  Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 stock index, which tends to move inversely to the pound, extended losses to trade 0.4 percent lower, while mid caps were down 0.2 percent.    Upside (in sterling) may be capped in the near term as Mr Carney has not signalled that the Bank is ready to tighten, only that there is an active debate taking place within the MPC (BoE Monetary Policy Committee),  ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said.   Nevertheless, this was the most explicit signal that we are close to reaching the point at which a hike would be warranted.        Long gilt futures were last down 109 ticks on the day at 126.39, the biggest drop since Jan. 3 when inflation worries hammered British debt prices. The two-year gilt yield touched its highest level since late October at 0.329 percent, up about 6 basis points on the day.

The 430-page report was completed in 2014 but had been secret until Tuesday, when FIFA hurriedly released it after the document was leaked to the German newspaper Bild. The report said Garcia was unable to contact Teixeira but questioned his conduct while a member of FIFA's Executive Committee for 18 years. Teixeira, who resigned as CBF president in 2012, lives a quiet life in Rio de Janeiro and rarely talks to the press. He has not been accused of any crimes in Brazil and rubbished any chance of taking a plea bargain and cooperating with U.S. authorities, as some other former FIFA officials have done.

Hong Kong marks the July 1, 1997, handover on Saturday, amid calls for democracy and fears of creeping influence of Communist Party leaders in Beijing undermining the  one country, two systems  formula under which it operates. The city is under lockdown, with a massive security presence expected for Xi's arrival on Thursday. About 30 protesters, including student protest leader Joshua Wong, gathered at the six-meter  Forever Blooming Golden Bauhinia  statue on the Wanchai waterside, a gift to Hong Kong from China, in front of the Chinese national flag and hundreds of perplexed Chinese tourists. The sweet-smelling bauhinia is the official Hong Kong emblem. They unfurled a black banner demanding full democracy for the city and the unconditional release of Nobel Peace Prize winning activist Liu Xiaobo, who was recently diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.  Democracy now. Free Liu Xiaobo,  the protesters shouted.  We do not want Xi Jinping. We want Liu Xiaobo.

Police said the demonstrators, including Wong who helped lead the 2014  Occupy  street protests that blocked key streets for 79 days, were arrested for causing a public nuisance.  We want to tell Xi Jinping that Hong Kong's prosperity is just a facade,  Wong shouted into a microphone as he sat at the foot of the statue.  When democracy is not in sight, we need to take action to confront this system. Before the visit of Xi Jinping, it is time to urge the Chinese president, a hardliner, to release Liu Xiaobo.  Slideshow (13 Images)Four policemen carried Wong by all four limbs into a police van as he shouted:  Hong Kong people, don't give up. Protest on July 1!

Many asked each other,  Who is Liu Xiaobo?  It will be the 20th anniversary of the handover. Foreigners will be watching. This is not good for the image of Hong Kong,  said a 58-year-old tourist from the southern Hainan province who gave her surname as Fu. Tens of thousands are expected to join an annual pro-democracy demonstration on Saturday. (This story has been refiled to amend first reference of Xi's arrival to Thursday in third paragraph.)

(Reuters) - A man charged with stabbing an airport police officer in an attack federal investigators are probing as an act of terrorism will remain in detention until a hearing next week, his lawyers said on Wednesday.  Amor Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada, was charged in federal court with violence at an international airport for stabbing officer Jeff Neville at the Bishop International Airport in Flint on June 21. Neville underwent surgery and has left the hospital, local media reported.  Ftouhi, originally from Tunisia and who holds dual Tunisian-Canadian citizenship, appeared briefly before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis at the federal courthouse in Flint on Wednesday morning.  Ftouhi's attorney, Joan Morgan, said her client was not seeking bond because of an immigration hold that would bar Ftouhi from leaving jail. He will remain in detention until his preliminary hearing scheduled for July 5, but a grand jury indictment could come before that.  Ftouhi, who did not speak other than to acknowledge he understood and agreed with his attorney, wore an orange jumpsuit and was shackled. His face was partially covered by a mask he was wearing for  unspecified medical reasons,  federal court spokesman David Ashenfelter said.  Court officials would not say where he is being held.   Ftouhi legally entered the United States at Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said last week. Officials said Ftouhi targeted a city with an international airport, but declined to say why Flint was chosen.  Ftouhi, who was not on the radar of U.S. or Canadian authorities before the attack, was in Michigan as early as June 18, the FBI said. U.S. and Canadian investigators are probing his travel before the attack.  According to the criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic  Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Neville. He also said something to the effect of  You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are all going to die,  the complaint said.  Ftouhi attempted to buy a gun before the attack, but was unable to do so, the FBI said. FBI officials declined to provide details on where Ftouhi attempted to buy the gun or what type of gun he tried to purchase. The 12-inch (30.5 cm), serrated knife Ftouhi used in the attack was bought in the United States.

The government reviews bank rules every two years to judge whether they meet international standards and to ensure that taxpayers will not have to bail out big banks that run into trouble. It said on Wednesday that it sees no need for fundamental changes to the regulatory approach but suggested extending  gone  concern  rules beyond big banks UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) to include primarily domestic lenders PostFinance [PFAG.UL], Raiffeisen [RFSHW.UL] and Zuercher Kantonalbank [ZKB.UL].  Like for the big banks, they should reflect the going concern capital requirements, but only 40 percent of them,  the government said.  With this proposal, the (government) is taking into consideration the fact that the banks in question are less interconnected internationally and are thus less systemically important.  The government has instructed the finance ministry to work with the FINMA watchdog and Swiss National Bank (SNB) on the rules changes. Raiffeisen said it could live with the government's proposal and build up its so-called total loss-absorbtion capacity capital buffers during a transition period. Postfinance simply took note of the proposal, while a ZKB representative was not immediately available for comment. Banks deemed important to the financial system must maintain enough  going concern  capital to operate in a stress scenario without state support.  They also have to hold  gone concern  capital used to restructure a troubled bank or keep alive its important functions without state help. The SNB this month told UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) they still need to draft credible plans for potential insolvency as part of Swiss efforts to prepare for a potential banking crisis.    Even so, the government said on Wednesday that it had concluded that Switzerland's existing regulatory approach for reducing risk posed by systemically important banks was suitable.  Overall, the approach is to be seen in a positive light by international standards,  the Federal Council said.  It is not necessary to fundamentally adapt the regulatory model.

Fred's said on Wednesday the short-term rights plan, also known as a  poison pill , will be triggered if a party takes 10 percent ownership and will expire on Sept. 25. The company said the rights plan was to reduce the likelihood of any entity gaining control through open market purchases, and not in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc agreed to buy Rite Aid Corp in October 2015, but the deal, which will merge the No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. drug store chains, has faced tough regulatory scrutiny. The closing date has been already been extended twice. In December, Fred's agreed to buy 865 Rite Aid stores, but the deal is contingent on Rite Aid winning regulatory approval. The more than one-and-a-half year antitrust scrutiny has raised uncertainity and weighed on Fred's shares, which has lost about 40 percent since the company's deal with Rite Aid. The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. antitrust watchdog, is expected to reach a decision on the deal by July 7. Fred's shares were nearly unchanged at $12.08 in morning trading on Wednesday. Walgreens shares were up 0.7 percent at $77.82, while Rite Aid was up 4.5 percent at $3.91.

They described how the leaders had fled Raqqa as pressure mounted from the U.S.-backed campaign and separate offensives by Turkey-backed rebels and Russian-backed government forces. One said ordinary fighters had been left behind to die like  sheep . Their accounts also indicate growing dissent within the ultra-hardline group in northern Syria in recent months. Khadouja al-Humri, one of three women who fled Raqqa around six months ago, said Islamic State leaders were worried about an uprising or coup, and the Tunisians were seen as a threat because they had criticized the way the group was run.  My husband was scared. Towards the end there were around 70 Tunisians on the list of the (Islamic State) security services, wanted. They wanted to shoot them,  she told Reuters at a camp for displaced people in Ain Issa, a village north of Raqqa.  You couldn't speak freely or criticize IS, you didn't know who was listening.  The women, two Tunisians and one from Lebanon, said they had traveled to join Islamic State in the hope of leading the kind of religious lifestyle they had long dreamt of. It did not turn out as they expected. Some Tunisian jihadists declared the IS leadership non-believers, or kuffar, over the extreme way they were running Raqqa, Humri said, adding that inequality between leaders and the rank-and-file fighters had become ever more obvious. It was not possible to confirm their accounts, although Islamic State has posted videos showing the execution of people identified as spies or agents of foreign enemy states. Related CoverageU.N. rights boss urges all sides to spare civilians in RaqqaStole Cars Humri said she and her husband escaped Raqqa by going south to the town of al-Mayadeen, another IS-held area where they hid for a time. Her husband stole cars from Islamic State officials and sold them to amass money to pay a smuggler who later took them across the River Euphrates to areas controlled by the Kurdish YPG. When he got there, the YPG, which is spearheading the U.S.-led assault to drive Islamic State out of Raqqa, detained him.  Humri was questioned but not detained.  We explained that they we were fleeing Daesh. They treat us well,  she said, sitting with the other two in a sparsely furnished building where foreigners are being accommodated at Ain Issa.  I just want to get out of this camp.  The women followed similar paths, journeying to Syria via Turkey to follow husbands who had gone to wage jihad in the multi-sided war. Two of them - Humri and Nour al-Huda, a 20-year-old mother of two from Tripoli in Lebanon - said their first husbands had been killed in battle. Tunisian Iman Othman, wife of a former Islamic State fighter, cleans the floor at a camp for displaced people in Ain Issa, north of Raqqa, Syria June 21, 2017. Picture taken June 21, 2017.Rodi SaidThey met for the first time at an Islamic State-run  guest house  in Raqqa for widows where they were kept under lock and key. The guest house was overcrowded, each room accommodating 12 women and their children, and Huda said Islamic State fighters would choose wives from there based on descriptions provided by a female Islamic State official. Wives for Pistols IS leaders would pay the  emir  who ran the guest house to secure their choice of bride, either in cash or a weapon such as a pistol, she said. German-made Glocks were particularly sought-after. The title  emir  is assigned to senior IS officials. Slideshow (3 Images)Huda said the Tunisian who married her had wanted to care for orphans. Wounded in both hands, he had not fought for some time.  He was very good with my children, treated me very well. But they didn't treat him fairly, didn't give him money,  she said. It was the  emirs  who had the pick of the women, who lived in the best houses and who wore the fanciest clothes, she said, adding that the Islamic State governor of Raqqa was known for giving his relatives well-paid positions in the administration.  We thought it was the state of Islam, but frankly, we have a lot of regret.  The U.S.-led coalition battling to drive Islamic State from Raqqa has estimated 3,000 to 4,000 of its fighters are holed up there, even after its leaders abandoned the town for more secure areas. U.S. intelligence officials say the IS leadership has rebased at al-Mayadeen in southeastern Syria. Jalal al-Ayyaf, the official in charge of the camp sheltering some 7,000 people at Ain Issa, said some 15 to 20 foreign families had arrived so far, including Russians, Tunisians, Lebanese and Indonesians. More were expected at the camp, which is run by a civilian council backed by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the military force waging the Raqqa campaign on the ground.  He said the authorities were taking care of their needs and would help them leave to wherever they wanted. The women said they were not detained but awaiting arrangements to return home.  We want someone to help us get out,  Huda said.

Loans in arrears for at least 90 days rose to the equivalent of 5.9 percent of non-earmarked, outstanding loans in May from 5.7 percent in April, the central bank said in a report. The number hit the highest since October and bucked two months of stable delinquency readings. Corporate defaults reflect the impact of protracted debt restructurings that have extended for over two years. However, defaults between 15 days and 90 days fell for consumers and companies alike, a sign banks are racing to fix problematic loans earlier than usual. The numbers suggest that banks may not lower loan-loss provisions as much as expected this year, as a wave of plea deals involving large borrowers looms. Shares of Brazil's largest lenders fell on Wednesday. Loan book quality has suffered in the face of Brazil's recession and  Operation Car Wash,  a probe into corruption at state firms. Firms ensnared in Car Wash have negotiated with creditors to get debt relief as their revenue falter. Warning In a recent client note, JPMorgan Securities analyst Natalia Corfield had warned that a weak recovery could delay banks' efforts to bolster loan book quality. Lenders have wrestled with all-time high provisions since Brazil slumped into a deep recession almost three years ago. Lenders could feel the pinch of hefty fines imposed on some clients seeking Car Wash-related plea bargains and leniency deals, Corfield said. The latest of them is J&F; Investimentos SA, the holding company overseeing the investments of Brazil's billionaire Batista family - including a 42 percent stake in JBS SA , the world's largest meatpacker. The Batistas are in talks with banks over refinancing 30 billion reais of debt at J&F; and JBS, people told Reuters this month. Outstanding loans totaled 3.065 trillion reais ($926 billion) in May, down 0.2 percent from the prior month and 2.6 percent over the past 12 months, the report showed. A year ago, the default ratio was 5.8 percent. A succession of central bank interest-rate reductions, fueled by slowing inflation, led commercial lenders to cut the cost of borrowing to an annual average 46.8 percent, the report showed. $1 = 3.3114 reais Reporting by Marcela Ayres and Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Bernard Orr","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-economy-lending-idUSL1N1JP0LZ"},

U.S. President Donald Trump has made more expenditure his priority for NATO, using his first alliance meeting in May to scold European leaders about spending, which is at historical lows and does not meet NATO's target of 2 percent of GDP.  This year's 4.3 percent increase represents the fastest  growth since more than a decade of cuts ended in 2014. Spending growth was 1.8 pct in 2015 and 3.3 percent last year, although it was unclear how near that takes members to the target. Stoltenberg said the higher spending by Europe and Canada, some $280 billion this year, was NATO's way of showing Washington that the United States had reliable allies, after Trump repeatedly questioned the alliance's worth and only this month publicly committed to its mutual defense pledge.  For me, America First is not America alone,  Stoltenberg told reporters, referring to the new administration's foreign policy focused on U.S. interests and U.S. national security.  No other great power has that, China, Russia do not have anything like the U.S. has in NATO, 28 allies that stand together with the United States, which provide support.  Vital Capabilities Figures for individual allies will be released on Thursday, after approval by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's envoys, but overall 2017 spending will add to a cumulative $46 billion jump since cuts left Europe without vital capabilities, such as refueling airborne fighter bombers. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg addresses a news conference ahead of a NATO defence ministers meeting at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 28, 2017.Francois LenoirNATO officials stressed that while Trump's tough stance had put the spotlight on defense spending, Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 had a bigger impact. After that annexation, allies agreed to spend 2 percent of economic output on defense every year by 2024 and reverse a trend that saw military research spending in the European Union fall by more than 20 billion euros ($23 billion) since 2006. But only four of NATO's 27 European members - Greece, Britain, Poland and Estonia - met the spending target in 2016. Romania will also do so this year, followed by Latvia and Lithuania in 2018, Stoltenberg said. Slideshow (4 Images)Twenty five of NATO's 29 allies plan to lift spending this year, he said, a day before NATO defense ministers meet in Brussels to discuss greater security spending on rising threats including deterring a resurgent Russia, dealing with failed states on its borders and protecting against cyber attacks. For the first time, NATO governments will produce national plans this year showing how they will reach the 2024 spending pledge, focusing not just on spending increases but also monitoring troop contributions to missions and acquiring technology such as precision-guided munitions.  The new figures are part of a broader rise in military spending in Europe, as the United States commits billions more dollars to return troops and heavy weaponry to the continent to deter Russia, and as the European Union seeks to set up a multi-billion-euro defense fund.      We have really shifted gears, the trend is up and we intend to keep it up,  Stoltenberg said. He said the increase in funds would be spent on more military exercises, training and equipment and to allowing NATO troops to deploy at ever faster notice, as well to pay  salaries and pensions.  It's more about high-end forces, heavier forces and more ready forces, meaning we need forces that are fully equipped, fully manned and fully trained,  Stoltenberg said.

NuGen, in Moorside, northwest England, is expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain's electricity when built, but has been thrown into doubt after developer Toshiba's nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt this year. Toshiba's NuGen joint venture partner Engie subsequently pulled out of the project, leaving the Japanese firm searching for new investments.  We are in negotiations with Toshiba to take some share (in the project),  Jong-hyuck Park, chief nuclear officer at state-owned KEPCO, said on the sidelines of an industry event in London. If successful, the South Korean firm would want to use its own nuclear reactor design for the British project, Park said, which would likely delay its start date. Toshiba's Westinghouse was initially expected to provide the reactors and won regulatory approval for its technology earlier this year. Park said KEPCO could submit its reactor design for approval by Britain's nuclear regulator early next year, and that if a deal was struck with Toshiba and regulatory approval given, the plant, using KEPCO technology, could be in operation by 2027 or 2028. Toshiba had targeted a 2025 start date, as well as a gross capacity of up to 3.8 gigawatts. New nuclear reactor technology in Britain must go through a generic design assessment (GDA), which takes around four years. Tom Samson, chief executive of NuGen, the venture set up by Toshiba and Engie to build the plant, said other companies were also interested in investing in the project.  No decisions have been taken on ownership or technology,  he said, on the sidelines of the same event. Britain needs to invest in new infrastructure to replace aging coal and nuclear plants set to close in the 2020s, but has struggled to get large projects built, especially nuclear, due to the costs involved. EDF's 18 billion pound ($22.5 billion) Hinkley Point C nuclear project in southwest England got the final go-ahead in 2016 after several years of delay, but only after securing backing from the French government. KEPCO is already developing a nuclear project in the United Arab Emirates, and hopes to export more of its technology . Park said the company's international strategy remained, despite recent changes in domestic policy in South Korea. The government on Tuesday suspended construction of two partially completed nuclear reactors in the country while it gathers public opinion on the facilities and decides whether they should be scrapped.

A deterioration in market liquidity, or how easily bonds are bought and sold, has concerned investors and regulators in the aftermath of several episodes, in particular the  flash rally  in Oct. 15, 2014 when Treasury yields swung wildly within a 12-minute span without a fundamental reason. Some market participants have blamed these episodes on smaller dealer balance sheets due to tighter regulations, which are aimed to safeguard the financial system with higher capital requirements for dealers.  We find that dealer balance sheets have continued to stagnate and that various measures point to less abundant funding liquidity,  Tobias Adrian, an analyst at the International Monetary Fund, and New York Fed economists Michael Fleming and Or Shachar, wrote in their article,  Market Liquidity after the Financial Crisis.  Dealers' assets fell to $3.0 trillion at the end of 2016, down from a peak of about $5 trillion prior in early 2008 prior to the height of the financial crisis. Because it has become more expensive for them to borrow in a more stringent regulatory climate, dealers have rolled back risk-taking and have become more reluctant to stake big bond positions, the analysts said. Possibly due partly to less support from dealers, there has been a decline in the  depth  in the $14 trillion U.S. Treasury market, they said. The average quantity of these government bonds that can be traded at the best bid and offer prices remained below levels seen before the crisis and 2013  taper tantrum  but above the levels during the crisis, they said. In the $8.5 trillion U.S. corporate bond sector, the average bid-ask spreads on institutional-sized trades remained above pre-crisis levels, they noted. While these measures signal some decline in bond market liquidity, the deterioration is not widespread, they said.  Although liquidity under normal market conditions may not have significantly worsened, it might be that it has become more fragile, or prone to disappearing under stress,  Adrian, Fleming and Shachar wrote.

When Stehr's second and third children came along, he opened accounts for them too.  But now Stehr, a financial adviser based in the San Francisco Bay area, is now rethinking the math. His oldest two kids are in pricey private colleges and might end up in graduate school, while the youngest is eyeing the Naval Academy, which is free.   As parents consider the best way to save for college, financial advisers say the kind of accounts matter, as well as the plan to spend the money when the time comes.  One Bucket or Many?  It is a natural parental instinct to do what Stehr did: open new accounts as the kids come along. Parents like to keep things equal, and there is also something psychologically satisfying about watching each child's account grow.  Financial adviser Peter Palion of Master Plan Advisory in East Meadow, New York, says it does not matter how you slice the pie in terms of growth. The difference in compounding between three accounts with $3,000 and one account with $9,000 will be negligible if they all have the same allocations. Children who are far apart in age might have different risk tolerances along the way, though.  You might have an annual maintenance fee if you are saving in a tax-advantaged 529 college savings plan. Even at just $30 a year, it could amount to 3 percent of a $1,000 yearly contribution.  If you saved all in one account until it was time to spend the money, you could just shift the beneficiaries as needed, or open new accounts and distribute the funds, without penalty.  Most states offer a tax deduction for 529 contributions per tax return, not per account. But more accounts would be better in Virginia, where there is a deduction for contributions of up to $4,000 per account per year, says Carl Holubowich, a certified financial planner in the Washington, D.C. area.  Spending The psychology involved is especially tricky when it is time to spend down money saved for college. Saving college money for each child was so engrained in Ricardo Noceda's thinking that the idea of shifting funds from one account to the next was akin to stealing.   It's robbing Peter to pay Paul,  says Noceda, a physician from Orange County, California.  Though the money technically belonged to him, in his head all those years it was one bucket for Olivia, now 24, and one for Dylan, 22. Even when his older daughter ran short to pay for her last year of school, Noceda did not transfer money from the other account to cover the shortfall.  Kelly Bressette, a mom of three from Massachusetts, took a more pragmatic approach, after saving in separate 529 accounts for 15 years for her daughters, who are now 24, 22 and 19.   It was not easy because I needed to divide up the funds,  says Bressette. When it came to spending for the first two, she was cautious, because she was afraid of running out. Then it turned out that the youngest's tuition was far more expensive.   I decided that I would use $10,000 per year for the first child and second child, and then use $20,000 per year for the last child,  Bressette says.    Shifting funds around can often be more an issue of family dynamics than accounting, says Darin Shebesta, a financial adviser from Cave Creek, Arizona. A lot of it has to do with managing expectations, because even the kids get involved in the bucket theory - and can get attached to the notion that what is in their college fund belongs to them.  Jim Stehr will be sorting this out soon, as he decides what to do if his youngest gets a full ride. He had always told the kids that if there was money left over, they could have it.  The older two used all of their money up, but the youngest would be in for a windfall of more than six figures.   It would be a healthy chunk of change,  Stehr says.

Fitch immediately upgraded the IDR to 'CCC' to reflect Vivarte's new business plan and capital structure. In addition, under the new plan and capital structure Vivarte SAS's senior secured debt ( new money ) instrument rating is upgraded to 'CCC' from 'CCC-'/RWP. Following the debt restructuring, Novarte SAS's reinstated debt is affirmed at 'C' and withdrawn upon its conversion into equity. The conclusion of the financial restructuring represents a restricted default under Fitch's methodology. The IDR of 'CCC' reflects high execution risk in sustainably turning around Vivarte's remaining activities due to a very unfavourable market environment, while maintaining high leverage. This is despite positive initiatives accompanying the debt restructuring, such as comprehensive asset-disposal and cost-cutting plans. High operational risk compounds a high level of refinancing risk inherent in the fiducie agreement between the company and its lenders, which was signed in parallel with the debt restructuring agreement. Under the fiducie terms the group has to prepay at least EUR300 million of remaining debt by October 2019. KEY RATING DRIVERS Financial Restructuring Plan Complete: The debt restructuring concluded on 21 June 2017. As a result, financial debt has been reduced by more than half to approximately EUR590 million, including EUR548 million of new money senior secured debt. Fitch expects FFO adjusted gross leverage to fall to 8.8x at the end of the financial year ending August 2017 versus 13.5x one year earlier. Adverse Market Changes: Fitch estimates market risks are increasing for Vivarte, thus further compromising the chances of a successful repositioning. The French apparel retail sales dropped by around 12% between 2012 and 2015 and by a further 1.2% in 2016. Customers are not only shifting to lower prices but also reducing the number of purchases, fuelling competition. Having been harmed by fast-fashion players such as Zara and H&M;, Vivarte now also has to face new entrants (pure online retailers, Primark), which are more aggressive in terms of prices and also challenge traditional fast-fashion retailers. Asset Pruning; Cost-Cutting:  Management's brand disposal plan and the closing of non-performing stores are credit-positive. If executed effectively, they should help management focus on turning around the remaining brands while supporting liquidity to fund investments. Execution Risk in Operational Turnaround: Management's ability to generate like-for-like sales growth in a declining market remains uncertain. Beyond cost-cutting measures, as fruitful as they may be, like-for-like growth is a key element to sustainable profitability. In the current market environment, characterised by intense competition and customers' lack of loyalty, the success of a brand goes depends not just on prices, but also on a wide variety of other factors including omni-channel capacity, and customer experience. In its rating case Fitch incorporates this risk through like-for-like sales stabilising in FY19, with EBITDA margin slowly growing to around 6% by that time, driven by cost reductions. High refinancing Risk: Fitch evaluates Vivarte's refinancing risk at FYE19 rather than at FYE21, despite the maturity of the remaining new money being lengthened by two years to October 2021. Our assessment derives from the terms of the fiducie agreement: failure to prepay at least EUR300 million of debt by October 2019 would lead to the sale of the group. Fitch expects FFO adjusted gross leverage at 7.9x at FYE19, a level of refinancing risk consistent with a 'CCC' IDR. Any upgrade would be conditional on a successful asset sale leading to at least a EUR300 million debt repayment, then to improved business and financial profiles of the remaining assets. Expected New Money Recoveries: The upgrade of the new money instrument rating to 'CCC' from 'CCC-' reflects Recovery Ratings in the 'RR4' range (31%-50%) and Vivarte's post-restructuring IDR of 'CCC'. Fitch estimates post-restructuring sustainable EBITDA of EUR90 million and a multiple of 4.0x. The EBITDA level reflects the group's smaller scale after asset disposals and store closures, together with low profitability prospects following recurring turnaround failures. The distressed multiple is at the low end of the sector due to the likely loss of attractiveness among potential buyers following numerous failed restructurings in an adverse market environment. Fitch assumes fully drawn letter of credit commitments ranking ahead of the super senior debt in the payment waterfall. DERIVATION SUMMARY Vivarte is a diversified retailer in terms of price points (low cost and mid-market), locations (both downtown and out-of-town) and products (apparel and footwear). However, it has a lower EBITDAR margin than most non-food retailers due to its uncompetitive position in the fast-changing market, also leading to higher leverage. Its large capex needs and restructuring costs also weaken its cash conversion capability compared with relatively asset-light competitors. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - progressive stabilisation of like-for-like sales by FY19, growth below 1% thereafter; - negative net proceeds from asset disposals in FY17, including the upcoming disposal of Kookai by financial year end, net proceeds limited to EUR50 million from the sale of Chevignon and Merkal in FY18, no other brand disposals; - progressive EBITDA margin recovery towards 6.2% in FY19, driven by the disposal or closure of non-performing assets and to a lesser extent by like-for-like sales growth and business model optimisation; - broadly neutral annual changes in working-capital needs; - close to EUR150 million non-recurring cash flow in FY17-FY18 related to discontinued activities and restructuring costs, falling to EUR15 million per annum thereafter; - EUR55 million financing cash outflow in FY17 resulting from financial restructuring and increase in cash collateral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Evidence of return to positive like-for-like sales growth, with significant improvement in profitability -Reduced refinancing risk, implying successful repayment of at least EUR300 million debt through asset sales by October 2019 -Improved financial flexibility including neutral FCF, FFO fixed charge cover sustainable above 1.5x and perennial access to committed facilities to fund working capital Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Fitch's increased perception that the group will fail to repay at least EUR300 million of remaining new money by October 2019, which would probably be due to a lack of sales and EBITDA improvement in FY18 -Major deterioration in liquidity LIQUIDITY Limited Liquidity:  Fitch expects limited net proceeds from asset sales over FY17-FY18. Should Vivarte's operating performance come under further pressure, banks could deny the renewal of the existing letters of credit and therefore compromise its liquidity position. This is despite the additional cash headroom provided by lower debt and the toggle option.

The amount is likely to decrease in FY17 due to working-capital optimisation measures, the planned disposal of several brands, and the full-year impact of past store closures. Operating Leases:  Fitch adjusts the debt by adding a multiple of 8x of yearly operating lease expense related to long-term assets (EUR297.8 million in FY16). Funds from Operations (FFO): Fitch excludes from FFO what it estimates to be one-off cash costs related to the ongoing operational restructuring (EUR28.4 million in FY16). Free Cash Flow (FCF): Fitch excludes from its FCF calculation all cash flows related to discontinued activities (- EUR85.3 million in FY16) in order to better assess FCF from continuing operations. Fitch also excludes the change in cash collateral and reclassifies it as an outflow related to financing activities. CICE financing (French Competitiveness and Employment Tax Credit): On 12 July 2016, the group entered into a loan agreement with Banque Publique d'Investissement for the pre-funding of 80% of the CICE receivable for the 2014 calendar year, representing an amount of EUR14.5 million. This funding takes the form of a confirmed credit line over 12 months and renewable upon maturity, until the repayment of the receivable by the French tax department. Fitch excludes outstanding factoring related to the monetisation of the tax credit granted by the French government from its debt calculation.

That is the ideal getaway the grandfather of Chicago financial planner Tim Obendorf's wife built around 50 years ago. Then the property passed to the next generation, with ownership shared by four people. Now they are thinking about the next generation: 11 potential owners. Without the right planning, that paradise could turn into hell.  As brothers, sisters, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents gather this summer at family homes to go hiking, canoeing or swimming, there will also be arguments over schedules, property taxes or mortgage costs, and upkeep duties, along with the thousand other matters that come with shared homeownership.  Whenever a number of families are under the same roof, conflicts are going to arise,  said Jill Shipley, managing director of family dynamics for Abbot Downing, a division of Wells Fargo that handles high-net-worth families and foundations.  That is why Obendorf's family has already logged a couple of family meetings.  It's never going to be perfect, but you have to decide you value the place, more than the hassles of working through family issues,  said Obendorf. It is not surprising that vacation homes have become a point of contention. Many vacation homeowners are baby boomers: They possess the bulk of the nation's assets and are projected to hold over 50 percent by 2020, according to a study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services. They are now beginning to retire as they hit their 60s and 70s. The potential problems are plentiful: Is the place big enough for everybody? Who gets it on July 4th weekend? Do they split costs equally? Who cleans up, handles repairs, or stocks the fridge? And the big one: When the owners eventually pass on - who gets the place? How can families get the most out of shared vacation properties this summer, without either going broke or killing each other? Some tips from the experts: * Draw up a calendar.  Just like season tickets for a sports team, some dates will be in high demand. So if the property is not big enough to handle multiple families at once - or, let's face it, you just do not get along - pick your spots.  Establish a rotating lottery each year, and allow each family member to pick their respective dates,  suggests Kevin Reardon, a financial planner in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. * Write down a policy.  Everyone has different opinions of what a getaway should be, so hash it out and put it all down on paper. One key item: Whether ongoing costs like property taxes, homeowner's association dues and repairs are split equally, or allocated based on usage. * Create an opt-out.  A sure way to guarantee family resentment: One member being forced into an arrangement they do not want. If a family cottage is being passed to the next generation, allow an escape hatch that permits one member's share to be bought out by their siblings. After all, not everyone might be able to use the property to the same extent, especially if they have moved far away. * Bring in a pro.  Siblings, of course, do not always get along. In fact, 15 percent of adult siblings report arguing over money, according to a new survey from Ameriprise Financial (bit.ly/2sNIa90). To make sure everyone is heard, bringing in a trained facilitator is probably your best bet, advises Shipley. * Have the discussion now.   I have been in many family meetings where the kids ask, 'I wonder what mom and dad would have wanted?'  says Shipley. So if you are fortunate enough that the family matriarch and patriarch are still around, arrange a family meeting and find out what they envision for the property in the decades to come. Maybe they want it to stay in the family, as a legacy for the grandkids. Or maybe, because of family circumstances like far-flung siblings, it would be wiser to just sell the property and split the proceeds.  *Set up a trust.  One way to take future financial squabbles out of the equation altogether: If families have the resources, they should create a trust to  fund the maintenance and ongoing use of the property in perpetuity,  says Shipley.  That is one solution to reduce conflict, and keep the property in the family for generations.  (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)

Germany, the World Cup holders, and CONCACAF champions Mexico were unbeaten in their respective groups, each finishing with two wins and a draw in three matches. Germany have rested their more seasoned players for the two-week tournament in Russia that serves as a dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup, with coach Joachim Loew bringing several newcomers into a squad with an average age of just over 24.   I think we're going to play against a team that can be a great example to follow for those who believe in processes, in development,  Osorio told a news conference on Wednesday.  I think being young and having experience are two different things.  He stressed that many of the Germany squad had extensive experience with the national team as well as from playing in the top European leagues and the Champions League.   It doesn't matter if they're young or not. What really matters is how much experience they have although they are young,  Osorio said. Loew told reporters on Wednesday he did not regret selecting such a young squad for the tournament because it served as a good opportunity to test their strengths.   It has worked really well as we've seen,  Loew said of his team's performances so far. Mexico — who finished second in Group A on seven points behind Portugal on goal difference — knocked out hosts Russia with a 2-1 win in their final group match last week. Portugal face Chile in the first semi-final on Wednesday in Kazan for a place in Sunday's final in Saint Petersburg.

Barclays and Deutsche Bank, along with Goldman Sachs, led the charge in 2014 in predicting rises in U.S. interest rates and the weakness of Europe would see the greenback reach parity with the euro for the first time in more than a decade. Yet instead, Draghi's cementing of expectations for a gradual tightening of euro zone monetary policy - and the lack of faith in the Fed's promises on rate rises - spurred a 2 percent jump in the euro this week that to some felt final. Both Barclays and Deutsche - respectively the fifth and seventh biggest players in the $5 trillion a day global currencies trade - have now backed off long-held support for the greenback in the space of a few days.   The prospective economic and monetary divergence that has driven the dollar updraft has peaked,  Barclays' macro research team said in a note last Thursday.  It seems premature ... to call for a dollar downdraft. But with the USD already significantly overvalued on most of our metrics (by about 15 percent), medium-term risks are mainly to the downside,  they added. Many economists already believed the greenback was nearing the end of the road last year when excitement over the boost to spending and growth promised by President Donald Trump funded one last hurrah.  The evaporation of faith in that idea along with Trump's troubles in Congress over healthcare have pulled the greenback 10 cents back from the long-term highs of $1.03 per euro hit in January.  Strength against a batch of other emerging currencies has kept the index used to measure its broader strength rising.  But if this week's moves mark the end of the line, the 24 percent gain this time will have fallen well short of previous rallies between 1995 and 2002 and 1978 and 1985, when the dollar gained respectively 53 and 34 percent.

Long-term pricing looks sensible and offers decent protection though investors will need to search to find attractive income streams and sources of growth that can deliver target returns, said the investment management arm of Prudential Financial Inc. Following the financial crisis of a decade ago, investors benefited from historically low interest rates, low valuations and rising rents, resulting in returns not seen since the 1980s. There is no evidence of mispricing in major markets, leverage has been reduced and prime real estate is priced at about fair value, said Peter Hayes, PGIM Real Estate's global head of investment research.   There is no obvious trigger out there that would point to a collapse in real estate values,  he said.  There's definite investor nervousness (but) that's always been the case. But there's no evidence of systemic risk,  he said. PGIM, which manages $65.9 billion in real estate assets, said opportunities can be found in non-gateway U.S. markets such as Dallas and Phoenix and non-central business districts in Asia and Europe, where office rental demand looks strong. Ongoing demand for warehousing in the United States and elsewhere because of e-commerce and the world's growing middle class, which is driving tourism, especially in Asia, also offer opportunities, PGIM said in a presentation. Caution, which has reigned since the global financial crisis, still prevails as investors take their foot off the pedal a little bit after the superior returns from 2010-2015, Hayes said.  In core U.S. real estate assets those returns were in the mid-teens and now will likely be in the high single digits, said Eric Adler, chief executive of PGIM Real Estate. The number of global transactions fell in 2016 but were still high from a historical perspective, suggesting continued competition for deals, PGIM said. However, the amount of capital targeting real estate has dropped slightly and pricing pressure in global markets has cooled, it said. Eight global gateway cities - London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington - account for about one-third of investment capital, Hayes said.

At least 73 people are missing and 10 people are confirmed to have been killed after the landslide engulfed Xinmo village in the mountainous southwestern province early on Saturday, according to the latest official figures on Wednesday.  The publicity department of the Communist Party's central committee declined to comment on specific questions from Reuters about how it handled media coverage of the disaster, but offered a statement:   Chinese media published a large number of reports about the landslide. It has become commonplace for Chinese media to promptly and actively publish information when breaking news occurs.  However, half a dozen Chinese journalists covering the disaster told Reuters they were recalled on Sunday night by editors who said they had received orders from the publicity department to stop reporting on the event.  Gone are the days of being able to freely report on natural disasters,  said a journalist from an official party newspaper. All of the Chinese journalists Reuters spoke to for this story asked not to be named for fear of losing their jobs.   When I covered the 2008 Sichuan earthquake I was able to go anywhere in the earthquake site, interview anyone and report on any story I wanted. This time around, I wasn't even allowed into the rescue area, we were just given press releases (from the government) to write up.   Nearly 70,000 people died in the 2008 earthquake, the epicenter of which was in Wenchuan county, not far from Xinmo. Protecting the Party President Xi has overseen a drive to place the Communist Party back at the center of China's media, academia and charities, while reining in news organizations and research bodies and detaining rights lawyers.  All news media run by the Party must work to speak for the Party's will and its propositions and protect the Party's authority and unity,  Xi was quoted as saying while visiting the three big state news agencies in February 2016. The government's position on the media is that it guarantees freedom of expression but that the media has to operate in accordance with the law.  News about the landslide was pushed down the agenda of many  major Chinese news organizations monitored by Reuters at the weekend. State broadcaster CCTV ran its story almost twenty minutes into the Saturday night news, after stories about poverty alleviation and Xi's visit to a military base. Much of the coverage in the days since the landslide has focused on the heroic role of the rescue dogs and the types of food served to people involved in rescue efforts. Members of the media take pictures of rescue workers at the site of a landslide in the village of Xinmo, Mao County, Sichuan Province, China June 26, 2017.Aly SongThe Chinese language version of an article in leading business magazine Caixin which questioned the official view that the landslide was an unavoidable disaster was deleted late on Monday, according to China Digital Times, an online watchdog based in Berkeley, California. A less-detailed English language version of the story was still available on the magazine's global site. Villagers were quoted in the article as saying the government was partially to blame for the landslide because it did nothing after locals reported a large fissure had formed in the mountainside above them after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  Caixin was not immediately available for comment. Limited Access Slideshow (3 Images)Unlike the 2008 earthquake, which was widely dispersed and fell under the control of several different local governments, there is only one road in and out of Xinmo which is under the control of a single local government.  About 100 relatives and villagers who were away when the landslide occurred met government officials at a primary school on Monday to complain about the lack of information and access to Xinmo. They were eventually allowed back. A journalist at a state-backed Chinese media organization said he had planned to accompany the group back to Xinmo but was deterred from going by his own editors.   Our big boss called me specifically to tell me we had to leave today and stop reporting,  he told Reuters. After another earthquake in Sichuan in 2013, People's Liberation Army soldiers invited Reuters reporters to eat lunch with them near the disaster zone and armed police offered journalists rides to get closer to the epicenter.  But on Sunday, many Chinese and foreign news organizations,  including Reuters, were blocked by police from accessing the site. Efforts to get government help were thwarted.

I'm glad that I came here to Eastbourne,  Djokovic, who is playing his first grasscourt warm-up tournament ahead of the Championships since 2010, said after the match.  I have had a great couple of days of training with good players, different styles of game. I felt good on the court, considering it's the first match. I have played against an opponent that has a really good game for grass. It was a really, really solid win. I'm happy with it.  Djokovic, who suffered a quarter-final exit at the French Open, is hoping to adapt to the conditions in as many matches he can play this week at Devonshire Park ahead of the third grand slam of the year starting July 3.

The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicentre of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbour annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft and a steelmaker.  No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,  said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent. The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,  Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. Eternal Blue While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organisation but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect. Bushiness that installed Microsoft's latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said  a small number  of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's Talos and Symantec said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software programme called MEDoc. The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.  Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,  it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain and Mondelez International Inc, which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. The company said on Wednesday it was unable to process new orders and its 76 terminals around the world were becoming increasingly congested. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate , a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.  The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered  serious consequences  but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

This is likely to benefit domestic and business customers by keeping down prices, but it is testing the financial commitment and muscle of both companies, which are being forced to expand their original rollout ambitions, driving up costs. Since being launched last year, Open Fiber (OF), the broadband unit owned by Enel and state lender CDP, has more than doubled its planned investments to 6.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion), added more cities to its rollout and also included rural areas under a state-subsidised scheme. Phone group TIM said in March it would reach 95 percent of Italy's population with ultrafast broadband by mid 2018 - almost two years ahead of its original schedule. The concern, according to industry experts, is that the race to get there first, in Perugia and beyond, could lead to a mutually damaging war where both firms lose money and infrastructure is duplicated across the country.  It's house by house combat and we're all rushing to plant the flag first,  said a person involved in one of the rollouts, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.  It makes absolutely no sense: we are digging and opening up buildings twice and all we needed was some sort of collaboration.  The battle mirrors one of the most infamous overspends in telecoms history. During the 1990s internet boom in Australia, dominant carrier Telstra and new rival Optus rolled out separate networks, often wiring up the same homes. By duplicating the Optus network, Telstra's defensive move effectively killed the economics of its rival's plan but it was a Pyrrhic victory: Telstra and Optus both took heavy losses, writing a total of more than $2 billion off their investments. The duplication of infrastructure in Perugia might serve commercial and competitive purposes, though not a practical one given fiber-optic cable, unlike copper wire, has practically unlimited capacity.  We're happy because we now have a choice but I realise having two parallel networks doesn't make much sense,  said city manager Francesco Calabrese, part of a team that traipsed around Italy for a year to campaign for companies to digitalise Perugia. It was that effort that made Perugia OF's first port of call. Ruled Roost The Rome government has long been pushing for an all-fiber optic network to be rolled out to boost productivity across a country with the lowest take-up of fixed broadband in Europe. For years it had accused TIM of acting too slowly to upgrade its ageing copper network to fiber and publicly backed state-controlled Enel to do the job instead. TIM's reluctance was premised on the belief that the demand was not there to justify over-ambitious investments. It has focused more on cabling fiber to street cabinets - junction boxes - rather than homes, which is less costly and faster, and using alternative technologies over the last mile of copper. The struggle goes beyond corporate Italy as TIM's biggest shareholder is French media conglomerate Vivendi, which has made no secret of its desire to use the Italian firm to help it create a southern European media empire. TIM has much at stake: it owns almost all of Italy's wholesale market - selling access to retail telecom operators, who sell it on to consumers - and has ruled the roost for years. This business brings in about 2 billion euros a year - a significant chunk of its overall Italian revenues of 15 billion, and one which the heavily-indebted group can ill afford to lose. Morgan Stanley estimates TIM could lose a third of the 2 billion euros by 2022 as a result of the competition from OF. Retail operators such as Vodafone, Wind Tre and Tiscali are already warming up to the new infrastructure entrant.  Like all other telecom operators, we want to wean ourselves off TIM, gain full control of our customers and boost our profitability,  said Riccardo Ruggiero, CEO of Tiscali. Stakes Rising In Perugia, the population is already benefiting from jumping from the web slow lane to the expressway. IT specialist Luca Braconi is now able to stream Netflix movies without any hiccups after Enel cabled up his home with a new super-fast link. TIM will soon be laying its own 1 gigabyte cable under the cobbled streets of Perugia's centre, but Braconi says his loyalties are with Enel for now.  Enel got there first and I like what I've got. I'm not going to change for the sake of saving a few euros,  he said. With the stakes rising and no obvious winner, the gloves are off. TIM is running more fiber past street cabinets into homes. OF is wooing banks to address concerns about its ability to stay the course. Both are competing to secure critical permits first. The row ratcheted higher last week when the government said TIM had gone back on its word not to invest in rural areas, undermining Rome's efforts to tender them out using state subsidies and threatening the economics of OF's project there. Industry and political sources said the two companies might ultimately have to join forces if losses become too painful, suggesting TIM could potentially spin off its network and merge it with OF or else buy out its smaller rival. Rome is already using its sway to get the two companies to reach a compromise, one industry ministry source said.  They need to agree to build just one network or otherwise it'll turn into a battlefield and the only thing battlefields throw up are dead,  a person involved in the roll-out said.

World markets were jarred this week by a chorus of central bankers warning about overpriced assets, excessive consumer borrowing and the need to begin the process of normalizing world interest rates from the extraordinarily low levels introduced to offset the fallout of the 2009 credit crash. This week, U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen has warned of expensive asset price valuations, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has tightened controls on bank credit and European Central Bank head Mario Draghi has opened the door to cutting back stimulus, possibly as soon as September.  Years of cheap central bank cash has delivered a sugar rush to world equity markets, pushing them to successive record highs. But another side effect has been explosive credit growth as households, companies and governments rushed to take advantage of rock-bottom borrowing costs. Global debt, as a result, now amounts to 327 percent of the world's annual economic output, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said in a report late on Tuesday. One of the most authoritative trackers of global capital flows, the IIF report highlighted  rollover  risks, especially in emerging markets that have borrowed in hard currencies such as euros and dollars. Such debts will become costlier to service if Western interest rates rise and currencies strengthen. While U.S. interest rates have already been raised four times, the euro has surged to one-year highs after Draghi's comments on Tuesday, while German 10-year government bond yields - the benchmark for euro area borrowing - have doubled over the past two days DE10YT=RR. The Fed too seems intent on continuing to tighten policy - Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said this week balance sheet normalization should be put on  autopilot . And despite Britain's tepid economy, several Bank of England rate-setters too voted this month to raise interest rates.  The IIF said the surge in indebtedness was largely down to a  $3 trillion rise in debt levels across the developing world, which now have debt totaling $56 trillion. That is 218 percent of their combined GDP, a five percentage point rise over year-ago levels, it said. China accounted for $2 trillion of this rise, with its debt  now at almost $33 trillion, data showed.  Rising debt may create headwinds for long-term growth and eventually pose risks for financial stability,  the IIF said.  In some cases, this sharp debt build-up has already started to become a drag on sovereign credit profiles, including in countries such as China and Canada.  The report acknowledged that advanced economies had continued to deleverage, cutting total public and private debt by more than $2 trillion in the past year, but this was mainly due to the euro zone. Total U.S. debt rose $2 trillion to more than $63 trillion by the first quarter of this year. But even in the euro zone, household borrowing is at a post-crisis high, data showed this week. The BOE plans to soon publish tighter rules on consumer lending and is bringing forward checks on banks' ability to cope with consumer loan losses.  But it is in the developing world that stresses are most likely to emerge, the IIF noted. First, emerging hard currency-denominated debt rose by $200 billion in the past year - growing at its fastest pace since 2014 - and 70 percent of this was in dollars, its report found.  Second, emerging markets have a hefty debt repayment schedule with more than $1.9 trillion of emerging bonds and loans falling due by end-2018, and 15 percent of this denominated in dollars. The biggest redemptions were in China, Russia, Korea and Turkey, the IIF added.  Rollover risk is high,  the IIF added. Any significant central bank policy shift risks derailing emerging debt markets, which have delivered robust returns in recent years and are up 7-10 percent in dollar terms in 2017.

After slowing to 2.2 percent last year from 2.9 percent in 2015, the economy of the former Soviet republic is now recovering from a fall in exports and a depreciation of currencies of its main trading partners.  I think that economic growth will exceed the projected 4 percent by the end of this year,  Giorgi Gakharia said in an interview with Reuters. The economy in Georgia, through which pipelines carry Caspian oil and gas to Europe, has already picked up to 4.2 percent in the first four months this year after expanding by 2.8 percent in the same period a year earlier thanks to higher exports and more remittances from abroad.  Private sector is developing well and the government's capital spending will increase,  Gakharia said. Gakharia also told Reuters he expected foreign direct investment (FDI) to be slightly up this year from $1.645 billion in 2016. Talking about FDI, Gakharia said it was one of the government's main tasks to attract investment from abroad amid waning investments from the country's major investor - BP , which had almost completed a pipeline construction project in Georgia. Azerbaijan, which acted as Georgia's main investor, helped to push FDI 3.7 percent higher year-on-year to $403.3 million in the first quarter, with the transport sector benefiting the most from the foreign influx. Gakharia also said that the government has for now considered suspending plans to sell stakes in major state-owned firms due to  unfavourable market conditions . Such conditions altered the government's earlier plan to carry out initial public offerings abroad, offering 25 percent stakes in state-owned firms Oil and Gas Corporation (GOGC) and the country's railways monopoly Georgia's Railway, Gakharia said. Georgia's Railway, which is working on developing new routes such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars project for a corridor from the Caspian Sea through Azerbaijan and Georgia to Turkey, had already postponed a London IPO listing due to volatile markets in 2012.

An independent commission report said in December that more than 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and paralympic sport were involved in or benefited from an institutional conspiracy to conceal positive doping tests. The IBSF released the names of 35 skeleton athletes for its Registered Testing Pool (RTP), who must be a part of regular anti-doping checks during the Winter Olympic season. Yarnold is one of the three Britons in the 11 athletes selected from skeleton.  I don't understand why there are three GB athletes and no Russians,  the 28-year-old told the BBC.  The system is crucial in our fight against doping and I think the IBSF should expand the testing pool.  The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA's) Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) requires all 35 athletes in the RTP to guarantee their whereabouts for one hour per day of the program's duration. In response to Yarnold's comments, the IBSF told Reuters it will publish the criteria for its RTP on Thursday.  We are working closely with the national anti-doping organizations of our member federations to assure testing is coordinated and most efficient.

The army's 16th infantry division captured Hadarat al-Saada and al-Ahmadiyya, the military said in a statement. The areas are northwest of the historic Grand al-Nuri Mosque which the militants destroyed last week. Islamic State still controls the mosque's grounds and about half of the territory in the Old City, its last redoubt in Mosul.  Fifty percent of this area has been liberated, al-Mashada and al-Ahmadiyya and al-Saada,  Major General Jabbar al-Darraji told Iraqi state television.  Our troops are now moving towards Farouq Street,  he said, referring to the Old City's main north-south thoroughfare. Federal police and elite units of the Counter-Terrorism Service have also been fighting inside the district's maze of narrow alleyways since the battle began 10 days ago. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support in the eight-month-old offensive. Authorities expect the battle to end in the coming days, though the advance remains arduous. A member of the Iraqi Federal Police runs for cover on the frontline in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq June 28, 2017.Ahmed JadallahMedieval City Federal policemen walked through piles of rubble amid wrecked houses on Wednesday to reach the frontline, southwest of al-Nuri mosque. A Reuters correspondent said they exchanged mortars and sniper fire with militants. The Old City's stone buildings date mostly from the medieval period. They include market stalls, a few mosques and churches, and small houses built and rebuilt on top of each other over the ages. Slideshow (9 Images)The minaret of the Ziwani mosque, which is cleared of militants, has been partially destroyed, and the cross had been removed from the bell tower of Shamoon al-Safa church, a Reuters correspondent said. The military estimates up to 350 militants are dug in among civilians in wrecked houses and crumbling infrastructure. They are trying to slow the advance of Iraqi forces by laying booby traps and using suicide bombers and snipers. Five IS fighters tried to flee across the Tigris River to the eastern side of Mosul but were killed by security forces, the military said on Wednesday. Those residents who have escaped the Old City say many of the civilians trapped behind Islamic State lines - put at 50,000 by the Iraqi military - are in a desperate situation with little food, water or medicines. Darraji, the army general, said one of his soldiers had been killed when he seized a militant wearing a suicide vest amid a crowd of fleeing civilians.  The heroic fighter was martyred, protecting the lives of many citizens,  he said.

Then it becomes clear it's about Gaza and the future of the impoverished and fenced-in Palestinian enclave. Israel's intelligence and transport minister has long pushed the idea of an artificial island off the coast of the Gaza Strip, with plans for a port, cargo terminal and even an airport to boost the territory's economy and connect it to the world. But now the minister, Israel Katz, has released a slick, high-production video setting out his proposal in more detail, complete with a dramatic, English-speaking narration, colorful graphics and stirring music. [ Video here: here ]  The artificial island initiative is aimed at providing an answer to a reality that is bad for the Palestinians and not good for Israel,  says the narrator, acknowledging that the aim is in part to change the view that Israel is to blame for the deteriorating circumstances of Gaza's two million people. The Islamist militant group Hamas has controlled Gaza for the past decade, during which time Israel and neighboring Egypt have maintained a tight blockade, restricting the flow of goods and people in and out, in part to pressure Hamas.  While Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers in 2005, it still limits Gaza's access to the sea and controls its airspace.  Today, Israel continues to be perceived as being responsible for the Gaza Strip and is to a large extent the only lifeline to it, even though it withdrew from the strip over a decade ago,  says the narrator. To challenge that perception, and tackle the broader humanitarian and economic problems that beset Gaza - it is currently receiving less than three hours of electricity a day and has unemployment exceeding 40 percent - Katz's plan calls for a $5 billion investment over five years. It envisages an international consortium building the 1,300-acre island (525 hectares) some three miles offshore, connecting it to the mainland via a causeway, which would have a bridge in the middle that could be raised, cutting off access.  A still image taken from handout video supplied by the Israeli ministry of intelligence and transportation shows animation of an artificial island off the coast of Gaza. via REUTERSHamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since it seized control of Gaza from the rival Palestinian movement Fatah, has long called for a sea port and wants the airport in Gaza, destroyed by Israel in 2001, rebuilt.  It has not commented directly on Katz's island plan, but Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for the group, said:  Building a sea port for Gaza is a right of its people to alleviate their suffering and end the blockade.  Gas, Water Works Slideshow (3 Images)The projected island would hold vast infrastructure, including cargo and passenger ports, a marina, gas and electricity terminals, a desalination plant and space for an airport in the future.  While Israel would retain control of security in the sea around the island, and would carry out inspections at the port, an international policing force would be responsible for security on the island and at checkpoints on the bridge.  In addition to its humanitarian and economic importance, and distinct security advantages, the artificial island initiative will strengthen the cooperation and relations between Israel and the countries in the region,  says the video. While at one level the idea sounds pie-in-the-sky, Katz has presented it internationally and raised it consistently for discussion. He showed his video to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet this month, where it met with widespread approval, according to Katz's spokesman.  But Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who has responsibility for Gaza policy, remains unconvinced and has not endorsed the proposal. He has said Gaza does not deserve any development project as long as Hamas runs the territory. Katz's hope is that if the Israeli government does get fully behind it, it can then be presented to international partners as a potential, if ambitious, project to finance.

Below is a list of the main steps the Financial Conduct Authority will take, and consultations for implementing them: Price Competition Finding: - There is weak competition in a number of areas. Firms do not typically compete on price, particularly in the retail market. - There is  considerable price clustering  and charges for active funds have remained broadly stable over the last 10 years. - Added to the industry's high profit levels and reluctance to lower prices to attract new business, price competition is not working effectively. Remedy: - Supports disclosure of a single all-in fee to investors. To consult on any proposals later in the year. - Seeks a standardised template of costs and charges to institutional investors. To ask an independent person to work with stakeholders to develop idea further. Will consult on next steps. Performance Finding: - There is substantial variation in performance across asset classes and within them. - On average, actively managed and passive funds failed to outperform their benchmarks after fees and it is difficult for investors to identify outperforming funds. - Poorly performing funds are often merged into better performing funds, but it can take a long time to happen. Remedy: - Proposes to strengthen the duty on fund managers to act in the best interests of investors. - To clarify expectations around value for money, increasing personal accountability and introducing a minimum level of independence in governance structures. - To consult on steps to force fund managers to be clear about how they manage inflows and redemptions from funds where the company is itself an investor. Any so-called  box profits  should be returned to the fund. - To make it easier for fund managers to switch investors to cheaper share classes. - To seek views on introducing a phased-in sunset clause for trail commissions, where the fund management company pays a financial advisor for introducing them to a client. Clarity of Objectives and Charges Finding: - Many active funds offer a similar exposure to that found in passive funds but charge more for it, so-called  closet index  funds. - It estimates 109 billion pounds of assets are in such funds. - Investors' awareness and focus on charges are mixed and often poor, particularly in the retail market. Remedy: - Will chair a working group to consider how to make objectives clearer and more useful for investors, before considering any subsequent rule changes. - To consult on requiring managers to be clear about why or why not a benchmark has been used and requiring that their use or otherwise of benchmarks is consistent across marketing materials. - To consult to clarify that where managers present past performance they must do so against the most ambitious target held out to investors. - Recommends the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) continue to review and, where possible, remove barriers to pension scheme consolidation, to achieve economies of scale. Investment Consultants and Intermediaries Finding: - There are significant differences in both the behaviour and outcomes of different institutional investors. - Large institutions can negotiate good value for money, but many smaller ones do not. Many do not switch consultants to get a better outcome. - There are also conflicts of interest as some consultants also act as investment managers to some clients. - Retail investors do not appear to benefit from economies of scale when pooling their investments. Remedy: - Proposes to reject proposals from Big-3 consultants to head off a formal competition review. To seek views from other interested parties and make a final decision on whether to refer the industry for a competition review in September 2017. - Recommends the Treasury considers bringing investment consultants into the regulatory perimeter, subject to the outcome of the provisional market investigation reference to the Competition and Markets Authority. - Will launch a market study into investment platforms to look at how competition is working in that market.

India, the world's third biggest oil importer, ships in about 80 percent of its needs and Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target in 2015 to cut dependence on oil imports to 67 percent by 2020. The country's oil and gas output has been stagnant for years while the nation's fuel demand is rising with its economic expansion, hitting federal finances with an import bill worth billions of dollars. The fields, given to Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India Ltd prior to the opening up of the sector to private players, account for about 70 percent of the country's oil and gas output.  We have now started monitoring those fields and have given new benchmarks to the National Oil Companies to increase production,  Pradhan said at an industry event. The global benchmark of recovery of oil from reservoirs is 35-40 percent and for gas is 55-70 percent, he said.  In India, the current recovery factors of ONGC and Oil India for crude oil are as low as 27 percent and 23 percent. In the case of natural gas, it is 54 percent and 43 percent for ONGC and Oil India,  Pradhan said. Modi's government has been taking steps to unlock the country's vast reserves and boost foreign investment in the sector. The relaxed rules, among others, allow pricing and marketing freedom to contractors. Encouraged by the reforms, BP and Reliance Industries earlier this month announced a plan to invest $6 billion to revive a deepwater gas field off the country's east coast.  A robust captive market is India's strength, and for energy security we have brought these reforms,  Pradhan said. India on Friday announced the launch of a national data repository (NDR) and open acreage licensing programme, giving freedom to firms to carve out areas they want to drill. However, the delineated area will be put up for auction. India aims to open up 2.8 million sq kms of the country's sedimentary basins through the open acreage policy to accelerate exploration and production.

The border between the Irish Republic, an EU member, and the British province of Northern Ireland will be the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the EU once Britain leaves the bloc in early 2019. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants the border to be as seamless as possible and EU negotiating guidelines call for the avoidance of a  hard border . But with the nature of Britain's future ties with the bloc unclear, solutions to the border issue have yet to be proposed.  From my meetings in Brussels and elsewhere, there is a real understanding of the issues that are unique to Ireland, a sympathy for us and a lot of goodwill,  Varadkar told a conference.  But turning those into practical solutions that will be written in law is going to be extremely difficult ... The Irish issues, including avoiding an economic border, will not be easy to solve.  Varadkar told parliament that if Britain achieves its aim of negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU that is similar to current arrangements, very little would have to be done but if it did not  we're in a very different space . Varadkar, who took over from Enda Kenny as prime minister this month, maintained his predecessor's view that Dublin would ask the EU for specific assistance in dealing with the economic fallout from Brexit. Ireland's top civil servant overseeing Brexit planning said last month one of the areas being examined was a potential exemption from EU state aid rules, enabling Ireland to provide financial support to companies adversely affected by Brexit. Ireland's export-focused economy has close trade links with its nearest neighbour, particularly among smaller firms that do little trading further afield, and businesses fear Brexit will lead to a costly rise in tariffs, paperwork and transit times.  The level of uncertainty as to the outcome of the negotiations remains very high, and it's clear that Brexit is a fundamental economic risk for Ireland if it results in a permanent change to the rules of trade between our two countries,  Varadkar said.  We will make a strong case at the EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises Brexit as a serious disturbance to our economy, once we've a better understanding of what that disturbance is going to be.

Investors have been told that anyone offering below 25.50 euros a share risks being left empty handed, the sources said. The price range was set at 22.00 to 25.50 euros a share and trading is expected to start on Friday. A successful listing for Delivery Hero is important for German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE), which holds a 35 percent stake in the firm and has failed to bring a company to market since 2014. Meanwhile, New York-based Blue Apron Holdings (APRN.N), the online meal-kit company that is targeting similar investors to Delivery Hero, cut its valuation expectations for its IPO by a third amid concerns about the impact of Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) deal to buy Whole Foods (WFM.O). A person close to the Delivery Hero IPO stressed the differences, arguing that Blue Apron's subscription-based business model was less attractive than that of Delivery Hero, which generates income by taking a commission on meal orders. Rocket Internet's meal kit company HelloFresh has a similar business model to Blue Apron. HelloFresh is also preparing for a flotation as early as this autumn if the Delivery Hero listing is successful, sources have told Reuters. Delivery Hero has said it would use the proceeds to pay off debt and for organic growth and acquisitions as it seeks to stave off rising competition. The listing is expected to value the company at up to 4.4 billion euros.  The online takeaway business has been booming in recent years, prompting listings of firms such as Britain's Just Eat (JE.L) and the Netherlands' Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), as well as the more recent entry of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Uber [UBER.UL]. However, online food delivery is seen as a  winner takes all  game as most users usually only download and use one app, meaning there is only enough space in most markets for one or two major players, underlining the need to build scale quickly.  When people have decided for a certain website they will stick to that,  Jitse Groen, chief executive of Takeaway.com which is fighting for market leadership with Delivery Hero in Germany, said last week. Delivery Hero says it is market leader in 35 of the more than 40 countries it operates in in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and the total market it has access to is worth 72 billion euros.

This will continue to support the performance of VW asset-backed security deals, in which residual values are a risk if they fall below the value of outstanding debt on car loans, in the key markets of Germany, the UK, France and Spain, it said. But the ratings agency said it expected negative pressure on the value of diesel vehicles would increase, as regulation against diesel may come into force in cities like Madrid, Milan, Paris and Stuttgart as well as in Britain.  We expect 2017 will see a larger decline in the proportion of new diesel vehicles sold and this shift in consumer demand will be echoed in the used car market. This will reflect stricter regulations related to diesel vehicles in most markets,  it said. Bavaria said earlier it had struck a deal with BMW , Audi and MAN to cut diesel-engine pollution, with carmakers promising to reduce emissions from older models and the state government planning incentives to spur sales of newer, more efficient cars. That coincided with a warning by Germany's ADAC car club, Europe's largest and most influential, to push back planned purchases of diesel cars until more fuel-efficient Euro-6D technology becomes available in new models this autumn. Due to the more efficient fuel burn and lower carbon dioxide emissions compared with gasoline-powered cars, Germany's three major carmakers have invested heavily in diesel technology. While only a niche market in the United States, where Volkswagen's emissions test-rigging scandal broke, about half the new cars sold in Germany were diesel-powered before the crisis. That market share has since declined to just over 40 percent.

Poloz said Canada had unexpectedly strong growth in the first quarter and that while the central bank expects growth to slow moderately, it will not slow down dramatically.  It does look as though those cuts have done their job. But we're just approaching a new interest rate decision so I don't want to prejudge,  he said in the interview.  But certainly we need to be at least considering that whole situation now that the capacity excess capacity is being used up steadily.  The Bank of Canada cut rates twice in 2015 to counter the effects of an oil price shock that sideswiped the Canadian economy. In recent weeks policymakers have shifted to a more hawkish stance, and many economists expect a rate hike before the end of the year. Chances of a Bank of Canada rate increase in July rose to 43 percent on Wednesday from 30 percent the day before, while the loonie surged to a four-month high after the hawkish comments by Poloz. Poloz said every major region is gathering momentum and the synchronized growth phase is a positive, though everyone is in a different phase of the business cycle.  The U.S. obviously way out in front. Canada some distance, perhaps as much as two years behind, given the oil shock. And then a little bit behind of course Europe. So but we are all there for grappling with the same issues in sequence. Well you know that's good for collaboration,  he said. Poloz also said that uncertainty about NAFTA has been weighing on business investment, adding that the trade agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico is a critical tool in Canada.  By my understanding the actual negotiations will start later this summer and that they're all hoping for it to be relatively speedy. It suggests that they've got a tight agenda. And so let's keep our fingers crossed on that, that it's not a long, drawn-out process because of this, that it is a headwind,  Poloz told CNBC. He also said the Federal Reserve's rate hiking cycle is fundamentally good news because it means the U.S. economy is strengthening further, which is good news for Canada.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 0.8 percent to 108.5. Pending home sales fell in the Northeast, South and West, and were flat in the Midwest. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales increasing 0.8 percent in May. Pending home sales were down 1.7 percent from a year ago.  A much higher share of homeowners compared to a year ago think now is a good time to sell, but until they do, sales will likely stay flat and low inventory will keep price growth moving swiftly,  NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. Housing demand is being driven by a strong economy and tight labor market. The unemployment rate fell in May to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. A lack of inventory has pushed up prices, particularly for more expensive homes. Home prices increased 26 percent for properties priced between $750,000 and $1 million compared to the same month last year. Pending home sales contracts become sales after a month or two. Last month's fall suggests that home resales, which rebounded last month to the third highest monthly level in a decade, may also falter in the coming months.

Released in 1983, the movie blended new concerns about home computers and hacking with older concerns about the accidental start of nuclear conflict and mutually assured destruction. In the film, the U.S. Air Force's new war-planning computer, which displays an early form of artificial intelligence called Joshua, runs simulations for global thermonuclear war, trying to find a way to win. But the game becomes deadly serious when the computer seizes control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and attempts to launch a real missile attack against the Soviet Union. The film's hero, a young hacker, eventually teaches the computer a lesson in futility, forcing it to play tic-tac-toe, a game that has no winning strategy and always ends in a draw. The computer then applies the same lesson to its nuclear war simulations, realizing there is no winner, only losers. The computer concludes global thermonuclear war is “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play” and stands down the missiles. In many ways, the renewed battle between OPEC and U.S. shale producers is similar to the self-defeating conflict portrayed in “WarGames”. If all oil producers try to maximize their output, the result is a glut of crude that depresses prices and proves ruinous for everyone. If one producer acts as swing producer and restricts output unilaterally, others increase their production to fill the gap, and the only result is a loss of market share. The only rational strategy is to avoid trying to manage production and allow prices to adjust to rebalance the market. Swing Producer? “I personally believe (the oil price) where we are right now is not sustainable,” Tim Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Resources, told a conference in New York on Tuesday. “It comes in the form of two words: Saudi Arabia. They cannot have a scenario, which is $43 or $44 (per barrel) oil, and sustain their national budgets.” As a result, Saudi Arabia would likely move to boost oil prices to protect its own finances, according to Dove (“U.S. shale CEO sees Saudi Arabia moving to lift oil prices”, Reuters, June 27). Despite the glut, Pioneer has no plans to curb its own drilling. “We’re not going to not drill because this very well may be the time where the well costs are as low as they’re ever going to be,” Dove said.  We can pare away and still be profitable even in a $45 (per barrel) environment,  he said.  We may just dial back at the margin in that scenario and not be a significant over-spender.  The gist of his argument was that someone would have to cut production to lift prices, but it would not be Pioneer, one of the most prominent shale drillers in the Permian Basin. Similar logic holds for all producers, but if they all carry on drilling, the result will be continued oversupply and a decline in prices. Dove seemed to think Saudi Arabia would act as a swing producer again, and in the process deliver a windfall for shale firms in the form of higher prices. But acting as a swing producer simply to protect rival shale firms from a renewed price drop would not be a rational strategy for Riyadh. The only rational strategy is to eschew the swing producer role and allow prices to decline to the point where the shale drilling boom is curbed. In this game, acting as a swing producer is futile, and the only winning move is not to play - as Saudi Arabia discovered the hard way during the 1980s and is rediscovering now. Since the start of the year, Saudi Arabia has given up market share, only to watch other producers increase their own output, and end up with prices no higher than before. Further production cuts by Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC would likely result in the same self-defeating outcome. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies have committed themselves to restraining output to the end of March 2018. The production cuts have arguably backfired but the kingdom has good reason to stick with the plan to maintain its credibility. For the future, however, the rational course is to make clear that the cuts will not be renewed when they expire next year. Saudi Arabia and the others should commit to gradually normalizing their production levels in the course of 2018 and abandoning output restraint.

Interest rate cuts made in 2015 have done their job and the Bank of Canada needs to consider its options at its upcoming interest rate decision as excess capacity is used up, Poloz said in a CNBC interview in Europe.                  That's a pretty solid signal that a July rate hike is very much on the table, Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a research note.     Chances of a rate hike next month rose to 45 percent from 30 percent on Tuesday, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                At 9:44 a.m. ET (1344 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3097 to the greenback, or 76.35 U.S. cents, up 0.8 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3198, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 24 at C$1.3076.     Strengthening of the loonie could pressure speculators to further reduce bearish bets on the currency, which had reached a record high in May.     Speculators cut bearish bets on the loonie for a fourth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 82,881 contracts as of June 20 from 88,595 a week earlier.         Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged lower after an industry report said U.S. inventories increased. U.S. crude        prices were down 0.16 percent at $44.17 a barrel.                     Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 7.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.023 percent and the 10-year             falling 38 Canadian cents to yield 1.614 percent.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 4.6 basis points to a spread of -34.2 basis points, its narrowest since Nov. 14, as Canadian government bonds underperformed.     Canada's gross domestic product data for April and the Bank of Canada's business outlook report are due on Friday.

With their focus on carbon fiber and aerodynamics, the teams that fought for the America's Cup attracted partners including planemaker Airbus and automotive groups BMW and Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] who were keen to learn from them. One area where this is likely to have an impact is in harnessing  foiling  technology, where the America's Cup boats  fly  above the water on foils, cutting water resistance.   Foiling in small electric boats will most likely appear on rivers in major cities. We are just at the beginning of the foiling adventure,  Pierre Marie Belleau, head of Airbus Business Development, who managed its partnership with Larry Ellison's Oracle Team USA, told Reuters. The space age catamarans used in the 35th America's Cup, which ended in victory for Emirates Team New Zealand this week, can sail at maximum speeds of 50 knots (92.6 kilometers per hour) and have more in common with flying than sailing. For Jaguar Land Rover, which sponsored British sailor Ben Ainslie's attempt to win the cup, the relationship is a strategic one with a focus on technology and innovation.  We don't just get our logo onto a sail,  Mark Cameron, the company's Experiential Marketing Director, said by telephone, adding that the carmaker would be providing more designers to help Land Rover BAR with technology for their next campaign. Land Rover produced a special steering wheel for Ainslie to use in the America's Cup, with in-built gear shift paddles that allowed him to adjust the catamaran's  flight  levels. The relationship is similar between BMW and Oracle Team USA, with the German automaker focused on areas including the electronics in the wheel used by skipper Jimmy Spithill, the development of carbon fiber used to make the boat and its components, and the aerodynamic testing.  We like to think of ourselves more as a partner than a sponsor. We have a very strong carbon fiber relationship,  Ian Robertson, who is the BMW management board member responsible for sales and brand, told Reuters between races. FILE PHOTO: Sailing - America's Cup finals - Hamilton, Bermuda - June 25, 2017 -  Helmsman Peter Burling drives Emirates Team New Zealand to win over Oracle Team USA in race seven in America's Cup finals .Mike Segar/File Photo This is a dynamic sport that is developing fast... It's moving quickly just like the car industry is moving quickly. It's all changing,  Robertson said.  Plane Sailing? The America's Cup catamarans use similar aerodynamics and load calculations to power their wings as commercial aircraft, which has led some skippers such as Spithill to become pilots. Airbus is now considering applying the design and method of Oracle's foils to the tips of aircraft, Belleau said, adding that this would need a two- to four-year certification process and require it to change its production method. Airbus has also created a new generation of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) microchips that were originally developed for the wings of its test aircraft and then adapted on board the Oracle boat to measure the wind speed and direction at all points on its almost 25-metre-high wing sail.  The sensors make it easier to tell if the wing sails are set efficiently, as wind speed and direction can vary from the top to bottom of the 25-metre wing of the America's Cup boats - technology that could become standard in the marine leisure industry to replace less reliable wind instruments.   I would be very surprised if this MEMS technology does not become standard in order to replace the classic anemometer,  Belleau said. The Airbus A350-1000, one of Airbus' twin-aisle, wide-body jetliners, is also flying every day using new instrumentation developed through the partnership. Oracle used Airbus' 3D printing and manufacturing process to produce stronger and lighter parts that Airbus has started to use on aircraft to replace titanium and aluminum.    In 10 years from now... this technology will spread and will be on all the sailing boats in the market,  Belleau said.  In addition to the sporting competition, there is still this technological competition...The story is not finished.

Released in 1983, the movie blended new concerns about home computers and hacking with older concerns about the accidental start of nuclear conflict and mutually assured destruction. In the film, the U.S. Air Force's new war-planning computer, which displays an early form of artificial intelligence called Joshua, runs simulations for global thermonuclear war, trying to find a way to win. But the game becomes deadly serious when the computer seizes control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and attempts to launch a real missile attack against the Soviet Union. The film's hero, a young hacker, eventually teaches the computer a lesson in futility, forcing it to play tic-tac-toe, a game that has no winning strategy and always ends in a draw. The computer then applies the same lesson to its nuclear war simulations, realizing there is no winner, only losers. The computer concludes global thermonuclear war is “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play” and stands down the missiles. In many ways, the renewed battle between OPEC and U.S. shale producers is similar to the self-defeating conflict portrayed in “WarGames”. If all oil producers try to maximize their output, the result is a glut of crude that depresses prices and proves ruinous for everyone. If one producer acts as swing producer and restricts output unilaterally, others increase their production to fill the gap, and the only result is a loss of market share. The only rational strategy is to avoid trying to manage production and allow prices to adjust to rebalance the market. Swing Producer? “I personally believe (the oil price) where we are right now is not sustainable,” Tim Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Resources, told a conference in New York on Tuesday. “It comes in the form of two words: Saudi Arabia. They cannot have a scenario, which is $43 or $44 (per barrel) oil, and sustain their national budgets.” As a result, Saudi Arabia would likely move to boost oil prices to protect its own finances, according to Dove (“U.S. shale CEO sees Saudi Arabia moving to lift oil prices”, Reuters, June 27). Despite the glut, Pioneer has no plans to curb its own drilling. “We’re not going to not drill because this very well may be the time where the well costs are as low as they’re ever going to be,” Dove said.  We can pare away and still be profitable even in a $45 (per barrel) environment,  he said.  We may just dial back at the margin in that scenario and not be a significant over-spender.  The gist of his argument was that someone would have to cut production to lift prices, but it would not be Pioneer, one of the most prominent shale drillers in the Permian Basin. Similar logic holds for all producers, but if they all carry on drilling, the result will be continued oversupply and a decline in prices. Dove seemed to think Saudi Arabia would act as a swing producer again, and in the process deliver a windfall for shale firms in the form of higher prices. But acting as a swing producer simply to protect rival shale firms from a renewed price drop would not be a rational strategy for Riyadh. The only rational strategy is to eschew the swing producer role and allow prices to decline to the point where the shale drilling boom is curbed. In this game, acting as a swing producer is futile, and the only winning move is not to play - as Saudi Arabia discovered the hard way during the 1980s and is rediscovering now. Since the start of the year, Saudi Arabia has given up market share, only to watch other producers increase their own output, and end up with prices no higher than before. Further production cuts by Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC would likely result in the same self-defeating outcome. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies have committed themselves to restraining output to the end of March 2018. The production cuts have arguably backfired but the kingdom has good reason to stick with the plan to maintain its credibility. For the future, however, the rational course is to make clear that the cuts will not be renewed when they expire next year. Saudi Arabia and the others should commit to gradually normalizing their production levels in the course of 2018 and abandoning output restraint. The result would likely be somewhat lower oil prices in the near term, but that would curb the shale boom and protect Saudi Arabia’s market share and revenues in the medium term.

Shares in the group, which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse in the United Kingdom and Ireland, rose as much as 3.4 percent on Wednesday after it also beat forecasts with a 10 percent rise in annual profit and said it was  well positioned to flourish  despite a tough economic outlook. On Tuesday, surveys showed UK consumer confidence plunged during the political crisis sparked by an inconclusive national election, while department store Debenhams (DEB.L) cautioned that trading was volatile. Earlier this month sofa retailer DFS Furniture warned on profit. British consumers have been hit by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since Britain's vote to leave the European Union, and by a slowdown in wages growth. The housing market is also cooling. However, Dixons finance director Humphrey Singer said the firm's electricals business had continued to deliver  very solid results  since its April 29 year end, though he did not give figures. Fiscal first-quarter numbers are due on Sept. 7.  We remain very alive to how the consumer is behaving and would react very quickly to any changes we saw there, but we don’t see it at the moment,  he told reporters.  Our electricals business, which is a very good bellwether on how consumers are behaving, continues to trade robustly.  Though Dixons Carphone has had a strong run of trading over the last year, prior to Wednesday's update its shares had fallen 17 percent so far in 2017, making it one of the worst performers in Britain's FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks since the country's Brexit vote last June. The decline reflects its exposure to high-cost goods and perceived vulnerability to a fall in shoppers' real earnings.  The (stock) market’s just very nervous and uncertainty in the environment, whether that’s economic or political, makes people nervous and our business is discretionary,  said Singer.

Dixons Carphone, which also trades as Elkjop and Elgiganten in Nordic countries and Kotsovolos in Greece, made a record underlying pretax profit of 501 million pounds ($642 million) in its 2016-17 financial year. Revenue increased 9 percent to 10.6 billion pounds, with growth in every region, and the dividend was raised 15 percent to 11.25 pence a share.  Dixon Carphone's valuation in our view wrongly prices in a decline in profits in the year ahead, ignoring its strong market position and self-help opportunities,  said Investec analyst Alistair Davies, who has a  buy  rating on the stock.

Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional.

A total of 839,170 Drillisch shares were tendered for a 50-euro-per-share offer, as Drillisch shares traded around 53.63 euros each. United Internet and Drillisch are in the process of combining their businesses, valued at 8 billion euros ($9.07 billion) when completed, to create Germany's fourth-largest telecoms operator and giving Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica Deutschland serious competition. The next hurdle is Drillisch's extraordinary shareholder meeting on July 25, where investors will vote on the final stage of the transaction, in which United Internet's stake in Drillisch is planned to rise to 72.7 percent. The cash offer that just ended was triggered by Drillisch's buying 7.75 percent of United Internet's 1&1 broadband brand for which it paid in own shares, bringing United Internet's stake in Drillisch to more than 30 percent.

The officials said Trump was looking at options including tariffs on steel imports, which Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross already has said he is considering as part of a national security study of the U.S. steel industry.  Whether Trump would take any steps against China remains unclear. In April, he backed off from a threat to withdraw from NAFTA after he said Canadian and Mexican leaders telephoned him asking him to halt a planned executive order in favor of opening discussions. The officials said there was no consensus on the way forward with China and they did not say what other options were being studied. No decision was expected this week, a senior official said. Chinese steel already is subject to dozens of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy orders. As a result it has only a small share of the U.S. market.  What's guiding this is he ran to protect American industry and American workers,  one of the U.S. officials said, referring to Trump's 2016 election promise to take a hard line on trade with China. On North Korea, Trump  feels like he gave China a chance to make a difference  but has not seen enough results, the official said. The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can.  They did a little, not a lot,  the official said.  And if he's not going to get what he needs on that, he needs to move ahead on his broader agenda on trade and on North Korea.  U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, spoke reporters outside his residence on Wednesday and said the United States hoped to collaborate with China.

We want to work together to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,  he said.  The death of American university student Otto Warmbier last week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, has further complicated Trump's approach to North Korea, his top national security challenge. Trump signaled his disappointment with China's efforts in a  tweet last week:  While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!  Trump had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping when he played host to Xi in April at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.

Since then, however, North Korea's tests of long-range missiles have continued unabated and there have been reports it is preparing for another underground nuclear test. Trump dropped by last Thursday as White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner were meeting Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi, an official said. China's inability to make headway on North Korea was one of the topics that was discussed, according to two people familiar with the meeting. In a statement last week, China's foreign ministry said Yang had met McMaster and Kushner, but it gave no details. Ministry spokesman Lu Kang did not directly answer a question about that meeting, but said China and the United States had discussed North Korea, among other issues, during a security dialogue Yang attended. Yang also had a separate meeting with Trump. The ministry said last week that Yang told Trump that China was willing to work with all sides, including the United States, to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula and promote an  appropriate  resolution.  Trump met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday at the White House and made a point of noting that the United States, India and Japan would be joining together in naval exercises soon in the Indian Ocean, a point that seemed aimed at India rival Beijing. Trump also thanked India for joining the United States in imposing new sanctions against North Korea.

At least 79 people died or are missing and presumed dead following the Grenfell Tower fire, which rapidly spread through the 24-storey block as families and children slept. Police have said that the death count could rise further. May said that the cladding - panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency -  was not compliant with regulations. The manufacturer has since halted sales of the panels.     May said the test failures showed that there was a wider fire safety issue that was the result of failures over many decades.  As we have seen from the number of buildings where the cladding has failed the combustibility test ... this is a much wider issue,  May said. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street in London, Britain June 28, 2017.Stefan Wermuth It's an issue that has been continuing for many years, for decades, in terms of cladding being put up in buildings. There are real questions, as to how this has happened, why it's happened and how we can ensure that it doesn't happen in the future.      May clashed with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who criticized cuts to local government and fire service budgets.   This disaster must be a wake-up call,  he said. May has pledged to rehouse all residents who have lost their homes within three weeks - a target which Corbyn said she was at risk of missing.  At the moment, it doesn't look anything like that target is going to be achieved,  Corbyn said.

The discovery of the five victims among 17 bodies retrieved would be the first evidence that civilians trapped in besieged Marawi City have been decapitated during the five-week stand by militants loyal to the Islamic State group, as some who escaped the city have previously reported.  Some 71 security forces and 299 militants have been killed and 246,000 people displaced in the conflict, which erupted after a failed attempt on May 23 to arrest a Filipino militant commander backed by Islamic State's leadership. President Rodrigo Duterte promised to destroy the militants in Marawi and said the Philippines was now dealing with  a very dangerous situation  due to young Muslims inspired by the  mass insanity  of Islamic State.  All they do is just to kill and destroy, and killing in a most brutal way,  he said at an event where he received hundreds of sniper and assault rifles donated by China to help the military campaign in Marawi.  They enjoy decapitating people in front of cameras. They have to be dealt with, with the same ferocity but not the brutality,  he said. The information about the beheadings came via a text message to reporters from Lieutenant Colonel Emmanuel Garcia of the Western Mindanao Command. Garcia did not respond to repeated requests for details. A civilian rescue worker, Abdul Azis Lomondot, told Reuters body parts were found, but with  no proof of beheading . Military spokesman Jo-Ar Herrera said bodies were found separately in two groups, of 12 and five, but he was unable to confirm if the five were beheaded. The battle entered its 36th day on Wednesday, with intense gunfights and bombing in the heart of the town and black-clad fighters seen from afar running between buildings as explosions rang out.  The rebels' hold on Marawi, while incurring the full force of a military for years trained by its U.S. counterparts, has much of the region on edge, concerned that Islamic State's influence may run deeper than thought. Philippines army soldiers return from an operation to retrieve bodies of casualties from the fighting zone in Marawi City, Philippines June 28, 2017.Jorge SilvaThose fears are also being felt in Malaysia and Indonesia, whose nationals are among the Maute group of rebels fighting in Marawi, suggesting the group may have built a cross-border network that has gone largely undetected. Rising Toll Military spokesman Restituto Padilla earlier said it was likely that many civilians had been killed and the death toll - at 27 before the latest 17 were announced - was only what the authorities could confirm independently and escapees had reported many in the area of fighting.  (It) may increase significantly,  Padilla told reporters.  There have been a significant number that have been seen.  Slideshow (11 Images)Padilla said the cause of all of those deaths would be  atrocities committed by the terrorists . Among those atrocities, the army says, have been residents being forced to loot homes, take up arms or become sex slaves. Videos have appeared this month on the website of Islamic State's Amaq news agency and its social media channels of hostages in Marawi pleading for their lives, saying they would be beheaded if air strikes were not stopped. Clips have also appeared of kneeling captives, shot in the head from behind. Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the footage. The military has so far been reluctant to discuss the possibility that the real impact of the fighting on civilians could be far more severe than has been reported. It has played down the impact of daily air strikes and mortar assaults aimed at rebel sniper positions, which have reduced areas of the lakeside town to rubble and alarmed people stuck there, some of whom have said the shelling was a bigger threat than the militants. Military spokesman Padilla said troops needed more time to finish what was a tricky mission, complicated by trapped civilians, hostages and booby traps.

The 2017 harvest is expected to be almost double the previous season, which was only 7.78 million tonnes following an El Nino drought that impacted yields and pushed up food prices. Low maize prices helped to ease inflation and food prices but have placed pressure on farmers' profits and stalled exports.

PKN's Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania relies on rail to ship its products to the Klaipeda oil terminal on the Baltic Sea, a route of about 250 kilometres (155 miles), but the Polish company has been at odds with state-run Lithuanian Railways over transport fees since 2014. Lithuanian Railways and PKN Orlen have now agreed on new tariffs for the cargos and to withdraw all litigation concerning roughly 40 million euros ($45.49 million) in fees unpaid by Orlen since it rejected a fee increase in 2014, a Lithuanian Railways spokesman told Reuters. Under the agreement, PKN Orlen will have to pay only about half of the debt, head of Lithuanian Railways Mantas Bartuska said.  Orlen's troubles were the largest negative factor in our relationship with Poland,  Lithuania's transport minister Rokas Masiulis said.  As we solved this, we can now expect a breakthrough in all areas, including in energy security,  the minister, who was in charge of Lithuania's energy security projects in a previous government, told Reuters. Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said the conflict was  casting a shadow on good relationship between our countries.   We have a lot of common projects: the energy projects, like the synchronization of our energy grid (with continental Europe), the possible gas link, and then there's also the strategic defence partnership,  Skvernelis said, asked to list common areas he hopes would be boosted by the agreement. Poland is the only European Union and NATO member country which shares a border with the Baltic States, making links between Poland and Lithuania vital for regional security as well as energy security. There are several projects where Lithuania needs to work with Poland, including an expansion of the electric power link between the two countries and a synchronisation of the Baltic countries' energy grid with the rest of continental Europe. The two countries are also trying to develop a gas pipeline link. A source familiar with the matter said the new rail fees would be more favourable for state-run PKN's Lithuanian subsidiary Orlen Lietuva and could bring it significant savings related to fuel transport from its refinery in Mazeikiai, Lithuania.  The former agreement did not serve well PKN Orlen and the railways,  head of PKN Orlen Wojciech Jasinski told reporters. Orlen Lietuva had been a financial burden on its parent. In 2014, PKN wrote down the value of Orlen Lietuva by 4.2 billion zlotys ($1.13 billion) after the refinery swung into the red. It returned to black in 2015, making net profit of $237 million in 2015 and $238 million in 2016. Jasinski said PKN was looking into reversing the writedown, but could not give a time frame.  We hope this would go further, some things have to take place. We are having a discussion with the financial market regulator on that,  he said. In total, PKN has spent $4 billion on the Mazeikiai refinery, including the purchase price, since buying a controlling stake from Russia's Yukos in 2006.

With their focus on carbon fiber and aerodynamics, the teams that fought for the America's Cup attracted partners including planemaker Airbus and automotive groups BMW and Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] who were keen to learn from them. One area where this is likely to have an impact is in harnessing  foiling  technology, where the America's Cup boats  fly  above the water on foils, cutting water resistance.   Foiling in small electric boats will most likely appear on rivers in major cities. We are just at the beginning of the foiling adventure,  Pierre Marie Belleau, head of Airbus Business Development, who managed its partnership with Larry Ellison's Oracle Team USA, told Reuters. The space age catamarans used in the 35th America's Cup, which ended in victory for Emirates Team New Zealand this week, can sail at maximum speeds of 50 knots (92.6 kilometers per hour) and have more in common with flying than sailing. For Jaguar Land Rover, which sponsored British sailor Ben Ainslie's attempt to win the cup, the relationship is a strategic one with a focus on technology and innovation.  We don't just get our logo onto a sail,  Mark Cameron, the company's Experiential Marketing Director, said by telephone, adding that the carmaker would be providing more designers to help Land Rover BAR with technology for their next campaign. Land Rover produced a special steering wheel for Ainslie to use in the America's Cup, with in-built gear shift paddles that allowed him to adjust the catamaran's  flight  levels. The relationship is similar between BMW and Oracle Team USA, with the German automaker focused on areas including the electronics in the wheel used by skipper Jimmy Spithill, the development of carbon fiber used to make the boat and its components, and the aerodynamic testing.  We like to think of ourselves more as a partner than a sponsor. We have a very strong carbon fiber relationship,  Ian Robertson, who is the BMW management board member responsible for sales and brand, told Reuters between races. FILE PHOTO: Sailing - America's Cup finals - Hamilton, Bermuda - June 25, 2017 -  Helmsman Peter Burling drives Emirates Team New Zealand to win over Oracle Team USA in race seven in America's Cup finals .Mike Segar/File Photo This is a dynamic sport that is developing fast... It's moving quickly just like the car industry is moving quickly. It's all changing,  Robertson said.  Plane Sailing? The America's Cup catamarans use similar aerodynamics and load calculations to power their wings as commercial aircraft, which has led some skippers such as Spithill to become pilots. Airbus is now considering applying the design and method of Oracle's foils to the tips of aircraft, Belleau said, adding that this would need a two- to four-year certification process and require it to change its production method. Airbus has also created a new generation of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) microchips that were originally developed for the wings of its test aircraft and then adapted on board the Oracle boat to measure the wind speed and direction at all points on its almost 25-metre-high wing sail.  The sensors make it easier to tell if the wing sails are set efficiently, as wind speed and direction can vary from the top to bottom of the 25-metre wing of the America's Cup boats - technology that could become standard in the marine leisure industry to replace less reliable wind instruments.   I would be very surprised if this MEMS technology does not become standard in order to replace the classic anemometer,  Belleau said. The Airbus A350-1000, one of Airbus' twin-aisle, wide-body jetliners, is also flying every day using new instrumentation developed through the partnership. Oracle used Airbus' 3D printing and manufacturing process to produce stronger and lighter parts that Airbus has started to use on aircraft to replace titanium and aluminum.    In 10 years from now... this technology will spread and will be on all the sailing boats in the market,  Belleau said.  In addition to the sporting competition, there is still this technological competition...The story is not finished.

With Germany's national elections only three months away, politicians are raising pressure on the powerful car industry to contribute toward improving air quality and win back trust that was pared down by Volkswagen's emissions scandal two years ago. The steps agreed on Wednesday include a pledge from luxury rivals BMW and Audi to ensure that at least half of their Euro-5 standard diesel car fleets will reach a level of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions that will cut pollution in cities, the Munich-based state government said. Bavaria wants to table proposals in July for limited purchasing incentives, especially through amended car tax, to get drivers to switch from older Euro-3 and Euro-4 models to more fuel-efficient Euro-6 technology, it said.  Wednesday's moves coincided with a warning by Germany's ADAC car club, Europe's largest and most influential, to push back planned purchases of diesel cars until Euro-6D technology becomes available in new models this autumn. Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the VW scandal, but have dropped even faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for a rise in respiratory disease.  We believe there are more intelligent options than driving bans,  BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said in an emailed statement.  That's why we support the initiative of the Bavarian government for a comprehensive and lasting improvement of air quality in our cities.  The manufacturers have agreed to shoulder the costs for certification and development of the necessary engine management software, the Bavarian government said.

At least 79 people died or are missing and presumed dead following the Grenfell Tower fire, which rapidly spread through the 24-storey block as families and children slept. Police have said that the death count could rise further. May said that the cladding - panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency -  was not compliant with regulations. The manufacturer has since halted sales of the panels.     May said the test failures showed that there was a wider fire safety issue that was the result of failures over many decades.  As we have seen from the number of buildings where the cladding has failed the combustibility test ... this is a much wider issue,  May said.

May clashed with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who criticized cuts to local government and fire service budgets.   This disaster must be a wake-up call,  he said. May has pledged to rehouse all residents who have lost their homes within three weeks - a target which Corbyn said she was at risk of missing.

The delay put the future of a longtime top Republican priority in doubt amid concerns about the Senate bill from both moderate and conservative Republicans. With Democrats united in their opposition, Republicans can afford to lose only two votes among their own ranks in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been pushing for a vote ahead of the July 4 recess that starts at the end of the week. The legislation would repeal major elements of Obamacare and shrink the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor.  We're going to press on,  McConnell said after announcing the delay, adding that leaders would keep working to make senators  comfortable  with the bill.  We're optimistic we're going to get to a result that is better than the status quo.  At the White House meeting with most of the 52 Republican senators, Trump said it was vital to reach agreement on the Senate healthcare measure because Obamacare was  melting down.    So we're going to talk and we're going to see what we can do. We're getting very close,  Trump told the senators. But he added,  If we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like, and that's okay.  McConnell, whose party has a razor-thin majority in the 100-member Senate, told reporters that Republican leaders would work through the week to win over the 50 senators needed to pass the bill, with a vote planned after the recess. Vice President Mike Pence could provide the crucial vote needed to break a tie.  I think we can get 50 votes to yes by the end of the week,  Republican Senator Roger Wicker said after the White House meeting. Related CoverageTop Senate Republican expresses optimism on healthcare bill after Trump meetingRepublican Opposition Grows The House of Representatives last month passed its own version of a healthcare bill, but the Senate bill has been criticized from both the left and the right. Moderate Republicans worried millions of people would lose their insurance. Conservatives said the bill does not do enough to erase Obamacare. The bill's prospects were not helped by a Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday saying it would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade, although it would reduce the federal deficit by $321 billion over that period. The report prompted Senator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, to say she could not support the bill as it stands. At least four conservative Republican senators said they were still opposed after the CBO analysis. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Senate Republicans about healthcare in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017. Trump is flanked by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).Kevin LamarqueThree more Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said after the delay was announced that they oppose the current draft. Portman and Capito cited the bill's Medicaid cutbacks and how that would hurt efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that has taken a heavy toll in their states. The Medicaid program was expanded under former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.  I think giving time to digest is a good thing,  Republican Senator Bob Corker said after the delay was announced.  Uncertainty  on Wall Street Slideshow (12 Images)U.S. stock prices fell, as the decision to postpone the vote added to investor worries about Trump's ability to deliver on his promises of tax reform and deregulation, as well as changes to the health sector. Those expected changes have driven a rally in U.S. stocks this year. The benchmark S&P; 500 index closed down 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.46 percent. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty. What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration?  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions Inc. Passing the measure would be a win for Trump as he seeks to shift attention after weeks of questions over Russia's role in last year's U.S. presidential election. McConnell has promised since 2010 that Republicans, who view Obamacare as a costly government intrusion, would destroy the law  root and branch  if they controlled Congress and the White House. Republicans worry a failure to deliver will cost them votes in next year's congressional elections. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, it will either have to be approved by the House or the two chambers would reconcile the differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and send it back to the Senate. Lawmakers are expected to leave town by Friday for their July 4 holiday break, which runs all next week. The Senate returns to work on July 10, the House on July 11. Lawmakers then have three weeks in session before their month-long August recess.

Bonds weakened and the euro gained on Tuesday after Draghi indicated that the ECB might tweak its stimulus so that it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers.                  Reports on Wednesday, however, said that Draghi intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening, according to sources familiar with his thinking.                              “The big trigger of action this morning has been the walk back of Draghi’s more hawkish comments yesterday,” said Guy Le Bas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were last down 4/32 in price to yield 2.212 percent, up from 2.20 percent late on Wednesday. The yields rose as high as 2.256 before the ECB reports.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                steepened after falling to 91.9 basis points overnight, the lowest since late 2007.     The yield curve has flattened in the past month as Federal Reserve officials indicated that further monetary policy tightening was likely even as inflation falls below targets.     That has caused short- and intermediate-dated debt, which is more sensitive to interest rate changes, to underperform while concerns about tepid growth and falling inflation have supported long bonds.     Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday reiterated her view that the U.S. central bank would continue to raise rates only gradually.                  The Treasury Department on Wednesday will sell $28 billion in seven-year notes, the final sale in $88 billion of new coupon-bearing supply this week.     A $34 billion sale of five-year notes saw the weakest demand in four months on Tuesday. The ratio of bids to the amount of five-year notes offered              came in at 2.33, the lowest since February.                  That came after the government sold $26 billion in two-year notes to strong demand on Monday.

With Germany's national elections only three months away, politicians are raising pressure on the powerful car industry to contribute toward improving air quality and win back trust that was pared down by Volkswagen's emissions scandal two years ago. The steps agreed on Wednesday include a pledge from luxury rivals BMW and Audi to ensure that at least half of their Euro-5 standard diesel car fleets will reach a level of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions that will cut pollution in cities, the Munich-based state government said. Bavaria wants to table proposals in July for limited purchasing incentives, especially through amended car tax, to get drivers to switch from older Euro-3 and Euro-4 models to more fuel-efficient Euro-6 technology, it said.  Wednesday's moves coincided with a warning by Germany's ADAC car club, Europe's largest and most influential, to push back planned purchases of diesel cars until Euro-6D technology becomes available in new models this autumn. Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the VW scandal, but have dropped even faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for a rise in respiratory disease.  We believe there are more intelligent options than driving bans,  BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said in an emailed statement.  That's why we support the initiative of the Bavarian government for a comprehensive and lasting improvement of air quality in our cities.  The manufacturers have agreed to shoulder the costs for certification and development of the necessary engine management software, the Bavarian government said.

Draghi's intention was to set up September as the earliest the bank would discuss rolling back stimulus, they said, but stressed it was by no means certain that it would come to a decision then.  The market failed to take note of the caveats in Draghi's speech,  one of the sources said. Draghi's comments on Tuesday, taken as a hawkish swing, sent the euro and bond yields sharply higher. The sources said Draghi wanted to acknowledge the recent, strong economic data and prepare the market for a possible autumn decision on the future of the ECB's 2.3 trillion euros bond-buying programme but without making any commitment. He also wanted to note that the ECB will not automatically ease policy due to the current slowdown in inflation, which is seen at 1.2 percent in June and is expected to hover around that level next year. Instead, the central bank is prepared to let prices take longer to reach its target of just under 2 percent, even after more than four years of inflation misses. But the speech was full of caveats, which also imply that the ECB is still ready to ease policy if financing conditions tighten as a result, for example, of a stronger euro or higher yields in the United States or Europe, the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity said. Traders took the comments as a signal the ECB was gearing up to wind down the programme as early as January, an outcome that officials said had yet to be discussed and will ultimately depend on inflation and other economic data in the coming months. Tantrum? Some commentators even wondered whether Draghi had sparked a  taper-tantrum  on financial markets like his U.S. counterpart of the time, Ben Bernanke, did in 2013 by hinting at a reduction in the Federal Reserve's own quantitative easing programme. At the time, the Fed was forced to do a U-turn and the scheme was not reduced until the following year. This time may be different, however. The officials were adamant that the current slowdown in euro zone inflation was due to excess supply pushing down the price of crude, a boost for the oil-importing bloc. They stressed the difference from 2014-15, when the lower inflation was accompanied by signs of a general economic malaise, but cautioned they were watching out for any sign that the drop in oil was affecting other prices and wages. An oil price fall would boost growth so weaker inflation would be beneficial as long as they do not impact long term inflation expectations and hold back wage growth, they added. This meant the ECB does not plan to ramp up its stimulus programme in response to the current inflation slowdown but it is in no hurry to end it either. The Governing Council will have August flash inflation data and its own updated projections at the September meeting.  My takeaway from the Draghi speech is that a decision in September is possible but not certain,  one of the sources said.

The government reviews bank rules every two years to judge if they comply with international standards and ensure taxpayers do not have to bail out big banks that run into trouble. It said on Wednesday it saw no need for fundamental changes to the regulatory approach, but suggested extending  gone concern  rules beyond big banks UBS and Credit Suisse to include primarily domestic lenders PostFinance AG, Raiffeisen and Zuercher Kantonalbank.  Like for the big banks, they should reflect the going concern capital requirements, but only 40 percent of them. With this proposal, the (government) is taking into consideration the fact that the banks in question are less interconnected internationally and are thus less systemically important,  it said. It instructed the finance ministry to work with the FINMA watchdog and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) on a draft. Banks deemed important for the financial system must maintain enough  going concern  capital to operate in a stress scenario without state support. They also have to hold  gone concern  capital used to restructure a troubled bank or keep alive its important functions without state help. Earlier this month, the SNB told UBS and Credit Suisse they still need to draft credible plans for potential insolvency as part of Swiss efforts to prepare for a potential banking crisis. Even so, the government said on Wednesday it had concluded Switzerland's existing regulatory approach for reducing risk posed by systemically important banks was suitable.  Overall, the approach is to be seen in a positive light by international standards,  the Federal Council said.  It is not necessary to fundamentally adapt the regulatory model.

The economy is booming again and hedge funds and other foreign investors want exposure to a surging tourism sector, banks, property, infrastructure and the soaring krona currency.  Most capital controls from the 2008 banking crisis were lifted in March allowing money to flow in and out of the country more freely.  But with over 20 financial crises since 1875 and warnings from economists about the risk of overheating again, the government is being cautious.  It has left in place restrictions making it prohibitively expensive to buy government bonds which offer returns of 4.5 percentREIISK3MD=, the highest of any developed economy. On Monday, the central bank took another step to try and break the cycle of boom and bust on the isolated North Atlantic island, clamping down on derivatives and other avenues it was worried were being used to bet on the krona. bit.ly/2uhgVld  There are a bunch of people I know who would love to put money into Iceland but they simply can’t because of restrictions on the inflows,  said Mark Dowding, who runs a hedge fund at BlueBay Asset Management and bought into the Icelandic government bond market in 2015, before the central bank rules were introduced.  The government is preparing other steps to make Iceland less attractive - a contrast to other economies recovering from crisis which have welcomed inflows of money. The government is preparing to raise taxes for the tourism industry which has been growing at 20-25 percent a year as foreigners flock to its volcanoes, glaciers and geysers. It is also considering a currency peg for the krona. Opportunities    Iceland offers other exciting investment opportunities. Growth of more than 6 percent is forecast this year and the krona is up 20 percent versus both the dollar ISKUSD=R and euro ISKEUR=R over the last 12 months. The central bank has cut interest rates four times in the last year and analysts say it would need to cut further if it wants to slow the rise of the currency. That could further stimulate the economy.   Once every decade or two, I come across a market overseas which is most attractive and is worth considering,  said Gervais Williams, a portfolio manager at London-based Miton Group.      That last happened in 1995 in Ireland and Iceland is the market I now like.  Cumulative net capital inflows have gone from almost nothing to 150 billion crown ($1.45 billion) in two years.  New cars sales are at the highest in 10 years, Marriott will open Iceland's first five-star hotel next year. Data center firms are also moving in as the climate and cheap geothermal energy cut the costs of cooling huge server stacks. A potential float of Arion Bank, the domestic arm that emerged from the collapsed Kaupthing bank, meanwhile is expected to lead to a surge of new foreign money into the stock market <0#.OMXIPI> which currently lists just 17 firms. Several hedge funds -- Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, Taconic Capital Advisors and Attestor Capital -- bought stakes in Arion privately, after the bulk of capital controls were lifted earlier in the year.     On the back of the shifts, London and Iceland-based fund firm GAMMA Capital Management launched its first two funds --including one hedge fund -- for foreign investors in November last year after requests from abroad.  We have been getting a lot of interest ...but investing in Iceland brings a lot of hurdles, so we created a simple conduit,  said Hafsteinn Hauksson, economist at GAMMA. Both funds have more than doubled in size this year, he said.   FILE PHOTO: An illustration picture shows Icelandic banknotes of one thousand Krona March 23, 2012.Ingolfur Juliusson/Illustration/File PhotoRed Hot Nevertheless, there are concerns that Iceland could overheat again.  The International Monetary Fund said in a report last week that there was a need for  vigilance with regards to credit growth and the real estate sector, labor market tightening and wage increases . It called for capital inflows to be managed carefully. Iceland has a history of spectacular booms and bust.  The head of Iceland's central bank regularly describes its 2007-2008 banking bust -- when the top-three banks, Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki collapsed under heavy debts --  as  the third biggest bankruptcy in the history of mankind .  Slideshow (3 Images)A 2015 report by Bank of Iceland economists noted that this was not Iceland's first financial crisis.  In fact, over a period spanning almost one and a half century (1875-2013), we identify over twenty instances of financial crises of different types,  it said.   Recognizing that crises tend to come in clusters, we identify six serious multiple financial crisis episodes occurring every fifteen years on average.  The report said the crises typically involved a sudden collapse in the currency and capital inflows. <<reut.rs/2tsOzF9>> <<reut.rs/2rYOas3>>  Glacier Bonds Wary of its history and nervous that the end of capital controls would bring a wave of foreign money, the central bank brought in a rule in May 2016 forcing buyers of its bonds to park additional money in a low interest account.  That costly 'special reserve ratio' arrangement has meant foreign investment in Icelandic debt has dropped close to zero. Along with repeated interest rate cuts, it has taken some of the steam out of the crown over the last month.   In the current domestic and global circumstances, the risk of excessive and volatile carry-trade type capital inflows was becoming significant  a central bank spokesman said of why the measure was brought in. Monday's decision to scale back some exemptions to its post capital controls 'Foreign Exchange Act' aimed to make it harder for foreign investors to bet on the krona. Those exemptions had made it possible to conduct carry trades by issuing krona-denominated bonds -- nicknamed Glacier bonds -- and entering derivatives contracts with domestic banks.  Experience has shown that capital inflows in connection with foreign issuance of krona-denominated bonds (Glacier bonds) could weaken monetary policy,  the central bank said. Iceland also still has controls in place that prevent proceeds from the sale of pre-crisis bonds leaving the country unless the investor signs up to the terms of the central bank's buy back arrangement which offer a punitive exchange rate.

It was a lively European session. The bond market sell-off and jump in the euro came as a dive in technology stocks after the latest global cyber attack sent European shares to a two-month low. The euro was eyeing up $1.14 and was at a 7-month high versus the pound though it hit the brakes after ECB sources said President Mario Draghi's comments on tweaking the bank's aggressive stimulus policy had been overinterpreted. The common currency is now up almost 10 percent this year. The head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, and one of her lieutenants, Patrick Harker, said on Tuesday that they expected to continue raising U.S. interest rates, but it couldn't rally the dollar. That provoked the banking world's single biggest cheerleader for a stronger dollar, Deutsche Bank, to declare the end of the greenback's bull run which dates back to 2014.  I do think the euro now has got quite significant momentum behind it and I think that will build towards the confirmation of some tapering announcement this year. So I would be long the euro on a tactical basis for the rest of the year,  JPMorgan Asset Management's Global Market Strategist, David Stubb, said. At the same time, core European bonds are the significant area of vulnerability to better euro zone growth and to changes in ECB policy, he added.  If you are looking at a 10-year maturity and further out, it is a global bond market and the extremely low yields in core Europe stick out alongside Japan and Switzerland as the places that seem stretched in terms of valuation.  Amid all the choppiness, safe-haven gold rose for a sixth day in the last seven. Wall Street, meanwhile, looked set to struggle again after the S&P; 500 and Dow Jones took their biggest tumbles in over a month. Nerves over the latest cyberattack, this time called Goldeneye, weighed on big tech names including Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft in premarket trading. In Asia overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4 percent as it pulled back from a two-year high hit on Monday. Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.5 percent, as the yen, at 111.900, also took advantage of the dollar's weakness. The banking and insurance sectors however outperformed on expectations of higher rates. Bonds Shaken, Metals Stir The yield on U.S. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last stood at 2.22 percent, well up from Monday's 2.14 percent levels. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen had said in London that it was appropriate to  gradually  raise U.S. rates, although there was an acknowledgement that inflation had seen some slippage.  Yellen's comment is supporting Japanese financial stocks today, and for the long-term, Japanese stocks are on the rising trend supported by U.S.-led global economic recovery,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. Wall Street's drop on Tuesday saw it close at its lowest since May 31. It was spooked after the U.S. Senate delayed voting on a healthcare reform bill, rekindling worries about the timeline of Donald Trump's business-friendly policies. The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major counterparts, edged down 0.2 percent to 96.227, well below its previous session high of 97.447. Euro bulls pushed it up 0.5 percent to a one-year high of $1.1373 with FX traders waiting for another flurry of ECB policymaker speeches at a conference hosted by the central bank in Portugal. The greenback also slumped against the Canadian dollar after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told CNBC that it looked like the central bank's rate cuts have done their job. Sterling, which has come under pressure again from Britain's recently volatile politics, bounced too, clawing above $1.28 to its highest since Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority on June 8. Conversely, it hit its weakest since November at 88.79 pence per euro. Emerging markets were caught in the global stocks sell off and commodities were also on the move. Crude oil futures gave back some of Tuesday's near 2-percent gain made on the back of the weaker dollar and expectations that U.S. crude inventories might decline for a third consecutive week. Brent crude futures were down 0.2 percent at $46.55 per barrel. U.S. crude futures were down 0.5 percent at $44.04. The weaker dollar helped bolster spot gold, which was up 0.4 percent at 1,251.59 per ounce, while industrial metals copper, lead and zinc prices dipped back from three-month highs.  The market got ahead of itself in the first quarter with (hopes for) Trump's infrastructure plans, that's not happening now but against that China growth is ok,  said SP Angel analyst John Meyer.

The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Ukraine, the epicentre of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbour annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft and a steelmaker. ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent. The aim of the latest attack appears to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,  Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. Eternal Blue While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as last month's WannaCry attack. They said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organisation but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect. The introduction of security patches in the wake of the May attack that crippled hundreds of thousands of computers also helped curb the latest malware, though its rapid spread underlined concerns that some businesses have still failed to secure their networks from increasingly aggressive hackers. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said  a small number  of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain and Mondelez International Inc, which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. The company said on Wednesday it was unable to process new orders and its 76 terminals around the world were becoming increasingly congested. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate , a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.  The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered  serious consequences  but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

Social media accounts and a magazine interview in the names of two of the men suggested they had recently been fighting pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.  Craig Austin Lang, William Wright-Martinovich and Alex Zwiefelhofer were detained on June 21 trying to cross to South Sudan from Kenya, said Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino from America's 82nd Airborne Unit. They were deported to Kenya, he added.  Private First Class Zwiefelhofer was absent from the 82nd without leave, he said.  We are working with U.S. authorities in the area to return Private First Class Alex Zwiefelhofer to U.S. military control. They are in Kenya,  he said in an email.  It was not clear when the three were transferred to Kenyan custody. Kenyan authorities did not return calls seeking comment.  South Sudanese foreign affairs ministry spokesman Mawien Makol said the three had been deported because they did not have visas but said they may have claimed to be journalists.   I heard about three American journalists who were detained on the border between Kenya and South Sudan because these journalists had not received visas,  he told Reuters.  South Sudan's four-year-old civil war has displaced more than three million people and briefly sparked a famine earlier this year.  A Facebook page and Instagram account in Zwiefelhofer's name show him in military uniform and photographs of flags, weapons and buildings that appear to have been taken in Ukraine, where foreign volunteers are helping to fight pro-Russian separatists.  Foreign citizens have showed up in South Sudan's conflicts before, when it was fighting neighboring Sudan before independence in 2011.  The life of former drug addict turned pastor Sam Childers featured in the 2011 movie  Machine Gun Preacher , although officials later cast doubt on some of his story. In 1991, British aid worker Emma McCune married rebel fighter Riek Machar, who is leading the rebellion in the current civil war. She died in a car accident in 1993.

With the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), May now has a working majority of 13 in the 650-seat House of Commons. Below is how May's working majority in the lower house of parliament is calculated, based on guidance from the House of Commons. Sinn Fein's seven lawmakers do not sit in parliament because they oppose the British government's jurisdiction in Northern Ireland and do not want to make an oath to the British queen. In their manifesto, they pledge not to waste time at Westminster. By convention, the speaker of the House of Commons and his three deputies (who have the titles of Chairman of Ways and Means, First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means) do not vote.  So there are 639 lawmakers who are considered to be active. That means any government needs 320 votes for a simple majority. The Conservatives won a total of 318 seats, though one is a speaker and one a deputy speaker, leaving May with 316 active lawmakers. Add on the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 lawmakers and May can command the votes of at least 326 lawmakers - as long as none of her lawmakers rebel. On opposing benches, Labour can command 262 of its own lawmakers and rely on 53 lawmakers from other parties opposed to May. That totals 315 opposing lawmakers, but two will be deputy speakers, so there will 313 active lawmakers opposed to May. May therefore has a working majority of 13.

The economy is booming again and hedge funds and other foreign investors want exposure to a surging tourism sector, banks, property, infrastructure and the soaring krona currency.  Most capital controls from the 2008 banking crisis were lifted in March allowing money to flow in and out of the country more freely.  But with over 20 financial crises since 1875 and warnings from economists about the risk of overheating again, the government is being cautious.  It has left in place restrictions making it prohibitively expensive to buy government bonds which offer returns of 4.5 percentREIISK3MD=, the highest of any developed economy. On Monday, the central bank took another step to try and break the cycle of boom and bust on the isolated North Atlantic island, clamping down on derivatives and other avenues it was worried were being used to bet on the krona. bit.ly/2uhgVld  There are a bunch of people I know who would love to put money into Iceland but they simply can’t because of restrictions on the inflows,  said Mark Dowding, who runs a hedge fund at BlueBay Asset Management and bought into the Icelandic government bond market in 2015, before the central bank rules were introduced.  The government is preparing other steps to make Iceland less attractive - a contrast to other economies recovering from crisis which have welcomed inflows of money. The government is preparing to raise taxes for the tourism industry which has been growing at 20-25 percent a year as foreigners flock to its volcanoes, glaciers and geysers. It is also considering a currency peg for the krona. Opportunities    Iceland offers other exciting investment opportunities. Growth of more than 6 percent is forecast this year and the krona is up 20 percent versus both the dollar ISKUSD=R and euro ISKEUR=R over the last 12 months. The central bank has cut interest rates four times in the last year and analysts say it would need to cut further if it wants to slow the rise of the currency. That could further stimulate the economy.   Once every decade or two, I come across a market overseas which is most attractive and is worth considering,  said Gervais Williams, a portfolio manager at London-based Miton Group.      That last happened in 1995 in Ireland and Iceland is the market I now like.  Cumulative net capital inflows have gone from almost nothing to 150 billion crown ($1.45 billion) in two years.  New cars sales are at the highest in 10 years, Marriott will open Iceland's first five-star hotel next year. Data center firms are also moving in as the climate and cheap geothermal energy cut the costs of cooling huge server stacks. A potential float of Arion Bank, the domestic arm that emerged from the collapsed Kaupthing bank, meanwhile is expected to lead to a surge of new foreign money into the stock market <0#.OMXIPI> which currently lists just 17 firms. Several hedge funds -- Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, Taconic Capital Advisors and Attestor Capital -- bought stakes in Arion privately, after the bulk of capital controls were lifted earlier in the year.     On the back of the shifts, London and Iceland-based fund firm GAMMA Capital Management launched its first two funds --including one hedge fund -- for foreign investors in November last year after requests from abroad.  We have been getting a lot of interest ...but investing in Iceland brings a lot of hurdles, so we created a simple conduit,  said Hafsteinn Hauksson, economist at GAMMA. Both funds have more than doubled in size this year, he said.   FILE PHOTO: An illustration picture shows Icelandic banknotes of one thousand Krona March 23, 2012.Ingolfur Juliusson/Illustration/File PhotoRed Hot Nevertheless, there are concerns that Iceland could overheat again.  The International Monetary Fund said in a report last week that there was a need for  vigilance with regards to credit growth and the real estate sector, labor market tightening and wage increases . It called for capital inflows to be managed carefully. Iceland has a history of spectacular booms and bust.  The head of Iceland's central bank regularly describes its 2007-2008 banking bust -- when the top-three banks, Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki collapsed under heavy debts --  as  the third biggest bankruptcy in the history of mankind .  Slideshow (3 Images)A 2015 report by Bank of Iceland economists noted that this was not Iceland's first financial crisis.  In fact, over a period spanning almost one and a half century (1875-2013), we identify over twenty instances of financial crises of different types,  it said.   Recognizing that crises tend to come in clusters, we identify six serious multiple financial crisis episodes occurring every fifteen years on average.  The report said the crises typically involved a sudden collapse in the currency and capital inflows. <<reut.rs/2tsOzF9>> <<reut.rs/2rYOas3>>  Glacier Bonds Wary of its history and nervous that the end of capital controls would bring a wave of foreign money, the central bank brought in a rule in May 2016 forcing buyers of its bonds to park additional money in a low interest account.  That costly 'special reserve ratio' arrangement has meant foreign investment in Icelandic debt has dropped close to zero. Along with repeated interest rate cuts, it has taken some of the steam out of the crown over the last month.   In the current domestic and global circumstances, the risk of excessive and volatile carry-trade type capital inflows was becoming significant  a central bank spokesman said of why the measure was brought in. Monday's decision to scale back some exemptions to its post capital controls 'Foreign Exchange Act' aimed to make it harder for foreign investors to bet on the krona. Those exemptions had made it possible to conduct carry trades by issuing krona-denominated bonds -- nicknamed Glacier bonds -- and entering derivatives contracts with domestic banks.  Experience has shown that capital inflows in connection with foreign issuance of krona-denominated bonds (Glacier bonds) could weaken monetary policy,  the central bank said. Iceland also still has controls in place that prevent proceeds from the sale of pre-crisis bonds leaving the country unless the investor signs up to the terms of the central bank's buy back arrangement which offer a punitive exchange rate.

Euro zone central bank sources told Reuters the market had overinterpreted Draghi's comments on Tuesday that the ECB is ready to start withdrawing the emergency stimulus for the economy. The sources, however, clarified that he intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening. The technology index has risen about 17 percent since the start of the year, making it the best performing sector among major S&P; sectors. However, investors, concerned with the sector's lofty valuations, have been shifting to defensive sectors. Equity valuations have come under focus at a time when inflation remains low, recent economic data has been tepid and President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies face delays. The S&P; 500 is trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15 times. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday the central bank would continue raising rates gradually and that by standard metrics, some asset valuations look high. Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer warned the central bank must remain vigilant in monitoring financial stability risks. San Francisco Fed head John Williams said investors may be getting overly complacent about risks and that  the stock market seems to be running pretty much on fumes.  A planned vote on Republican healthcare bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act was put off to after the Senate's July 4 recess. The healthcare legislation, which has encountered resistance from several Republicans, is the first plank of President Donald Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Trump's promises of a pro-growth agenda is partly behind the S&P;'s 13 percent rise since the Nov. 8 election.

The group is developing electric, autonomous and connected cars in addition to vehicles with combustion engines to meet more stringent emissions tests. At the same time, China's aggressive push to introduce electric car quotas has forced European carmakers to accelerate the development and roll-out of electric and hybrid vehicles, pushing up their costs. In 2016, BMW spent 5.16 billion euros or 5.5 percent of revenue on R&D.;  The next three years will be between 5.5 percent and 6 percent,  Peter told journalists. Because electric and hybrid cars are less profitable than cars with petrol and diesel engines, BMW is looking for savings by reducing the complexity of its engine and equipment portfolio.  We have over 100 steering wheels on offer. Do we need that many variants?  Peter said. BMW will drop manual gearshift variants of the BMW 2 series Coupe in the United States to cut down the cost of certifying components in each market, and it has dropped manual shift options from entry-level versions of the new 5 series diesel, he said. It will also cut down the number of engine variants.  In the 5 series we have four diesel engines on offer. I would not bet on there being four diesel engines on offer in the next generation vehicle,  Peter said. BMW stuck with its guidance for a slight increase in both vehicle sales and pre-tax profit tax this year as well as a margin on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of between 8 and 10 percent. Sales have received a boost from the launch of a new BMW 5 series limousine, which has exceeded expectations, Peter said, without providing details. The carmaker has seen double-digit sales growth in China and remains on track to keep this momentum with the launch of a long-wheelbase 5 series and a BMW X1, Peter said. BMW has also seen slight growth in Europe, although there are signs that demand in England is softening, he added.  There are some signals that the market is getting more difficult,  Peter said, adding that order intake was slower and residual values were falling. The U.S. market may remain stable or even shrink slightly, Peter said, adding that BMW was working on cutting back vehicle inventory.  He also said the group had not yet decided where to build the next electric version of the Mini, though a decision would come this year, with Oxford remaining a contender for the manufacturing site.

That is the ideal getaway the grandfather of Chicago financial planner Tim Obendorf's wife built around 50 years ago. Then the property passed to the next generation, with ownership shared by four people. Now they are thinking about the next generation: 11 potential owners. Without the right planning, that paradise could turn into hell.  As brothers, sisters, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents gather this summer at family homes to go hiking, canoeing or swimming, there will also be arguments over schedules, property taxes or mortgage costs, and upkeep duties, along with the thousand other matters that come with shared homeownership.  Whenever a number of families are under the same roof, conflicts are going to arise,  said Jill Shipley, managing director of family dynamics for Abbot Downing, a division of Wells Fargo that handles high-net-worth families and foundations.  That is why Obendorf's family has already logged a couple of family meetings.  It's never going to be perfect, but you have to decide you value the place, more than the hassles of working through family issues,  said Obendorf. It is not surprising that vacation homes have become a point of contention. Many vacation homeowners are baby boomers: They possess the bulk of the nation's assets and are projected to hold over 50 percent by 2020, according to a study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services. They are now beginning to retire as they hit their 60s and 70s. The potential problems are plentiful: Is the place big enough for everybody? Who gets it on July 4th weekend? Do they split costs equally? Who cleans up, handles repairs, or stocks the fridge? And the big one: When the owners eventually pass on - who gets the place? How can families get the most out of shared vacation properties this summer, without either going broke or killing each other? Some tips from the experts: * Draw up a calendar.  Just like season tickets for a sports team, some dates will be in high demand. So if the property is not big enough to handle multiple families at once - or, let's face it, you just do not get along - pick your spots.  Establish a rotating lottery each year, and allow each family member to pick their respective dates,  suggests Kevin Reardon, a financial planner in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. * Write down a policy.  Everyone has different opinions of what a getaway should be, so hash it out and put it all down on paper. One key item: Whether ongoing costs like property taxes, homeowner's association dues and repairs are split equally, or allocated based on usage. * Create an opt-out.  A sure way to guarantee family resentment: One member being forced into an arrangement they do not want. If a family cottage is being passed to the next generation, allow an escape hatch that permits one member's share to be bought out by their siblings. After all, not everyone might be able to use the property to the same extent, especially if they have moved far away. * Bring in a pro.  Siblings, of course, do not always get along. In fact, 15 percent of adult siblings report arguing over money, according to a new survey from Ameriprise Financial (bit.ly/2sNIa90). To make sure everyone is heard, bringing in a trained facilitator is probably your best bet, advises Shipley. * Have the discussion now.   I have been in many family meetings where the kids ask, 'I wonder what mom and dad would have wanted?'  says Shipley. So if you are fortunate enough that the family matriarch and patriarch are still around, arrange a family meeting and find out what they envision for the property in the decades to come. Maybe they want it to stay in the family, as a legacy for the grandkids. Or maybe, because of family circumstances like far-flung siblings, it would be wiser to just sell the property and split the proceeds.  *Set up a trust.  One way to take future financial squabbles out of the equation altogether: If families have the resources, they should create a trust to  fund the maintenance and ongoing use of the property in perpetuity,  says Shipley.  That is one solution to reduce conflict, and keep the property in the family for generations.  (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)

PKN's Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania relies on rail to ship its products to the Klaipeda oil terminal on the Baltic Sea, a route of about 250 kilometres (155 miles), but the Polish company has been at odds with state-run Lithuanian Railways over transport fees since 2014. Lithuanian Railways and PKN Orlen have now agreed on new tariffs for the cargos and to withdraw all litigation concerning roughly 40 million euros ($45.49 million) in fees unpaid by Orlen since it rejected a fee increase in 2014, a Lithuanian Railways spokesman told Reuters. Under the agreement, PKN Orlen will have to pay only about half of the debt, head of Lithuanian Railways Mantas Bartuska said.  Orlen's troubles were the largest negative factor in our relationship with Poland,  Lithuania's transport minister Rokas Masiulis said.  As we solved this, we can now expect a breakthrough in all areas, including in energy security,  the minister, who was in charge of Lithuania's energy security projects in a previous government, told Reuters. Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said the conflict was  casting a shadow on good relationship between our countries.  Poland is the only European Union and NATO member country which shares a border with the Baltic States, making links between Poland and Lithuania vital for regional security as well as energy security. There are several projects where Lithuania needs to work with Poland, including an expansion of the electric power link between the two countries and a synchronisation of the Baltic countries' energy grid with the rest of continental Europe. The two countries are also trying to develop a gas pipeline link. A source familiar with the matter said the new rail fees would be more favourable for state-run PKN's Lithuanian subsidiary Orlen Lietuva and could bring it significant savings related to fuel transport from its refinery in Mazeikiai, Lithuania.  The former agreement did not serve well PKN Orlen and the railways , head of PKN Orlen Wojciech Jasinski told reporters. Orlen Lietuva had been a financial burden on its parent. In 2014, PKN wrote down the value of Orlen Lietuva by 4.2 billion zlotys ($1.13 billion) after the refinery swung into the red. It returned to black in 2015, making net profit of $237 million in 2015 and $238 million in 2016. Jasinski said PKN was looking into reversing the writedown, but could not give a time frame.  We hope this would go further, some things have to take place. We are having a discussion with the financial market regulator on that,  he said. In total, PKN has spent $4 billion on the Mazeikiai refinery, including the purchase price, since buying a controlling stake from Russia's Yukos in 2006.

Pipeline firms such as Plains All American (PAA.N) and TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) move about 10 million barrels of crude around the United States every day. For pipeline operators to secure financing to build pipelines and storage facilities, they need oil producers, refiners and traders to sign long-term contracts to use space on the pipelines. Pipeline firms can then use the guaranteed revenue from those contracts as collateral. Firms shipping on the pipeline have historically benefited from the long-term deals because they offered a discount compared to the price of buying space occasionally. But now, in the wake of a two-year oil price crash, pipeline firms are still struggling to keep their lines full. So their marketing arms are offering steep discounts to ad-hoc buyers of pipeline capacity - which irritates customers whose long-term contracts are now more expensive than spot purchases.  If I were a producer with a long-term contract, I would be very unhappy at the present time,” said Rick Smead, managing director of advisory services at RBN Energy in Houston. “But, the reality is that when they (signed contracts), they were trapped.” Eight pipeline operators contacted by Reuters for this story declined to comment on their discounted spot pricing or the secondary market for pipeline capacity. Some of those pipeline firms are offering prices as low as 25 percent of federally regulated rates, creating a secondary market that undercuts shippers with long-term contracts, according to four sources at companies that regularly ship on the pipelines. For a graphic detailing how the discount deals work, see: tmsnrt.rs/2sJwW5E The discounts emerged after a global glut and crashing oil prices caused many shippers to let their pipeline contracts lapse or declare bankruptcy. More than a dozen producers, traders and refiners told Reuters they were angry and frustrated that these discount deals have become a mainstay. They declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The contract and regulatory framework of the industry makes it difficult for them to bargain down their own long-term contracts, leaving them paying more for the pipeline space than occasional shippers competing to send oil through the same lines. This gives the occasional shippers the edge in delivering cheaper crude to potential buyers at the end of the line. Deep Discounts TransCanada's 700,000 barrel-per-day Cushing-Marketlink pipeline - which carries oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Texas refineries - has long-term rates of between $1.63 and $2.93 a barrel to transport heavy crude, while occasional shippers typically paid $3. The industry downturn since 2014 has reduced demand from occasional shippers to use the line at that price. Earlier this year, TransCanada's marketing arm offered customers the right to send crude through the line at a tariff of between 80 to 90 cents, traders using the line said. At the end of 2016, the rate offered was as low 30 to 40 cents. Even with the discounts, the line rarely reached 70 percent capacity. FILE PHOTO - A TransCanada Keystone Pipeline pump station operates outside Steele City, Nebraska, U.S. on March 10, 2014.Lane Hickenbottom/File PhotoTransCanada declined to comment. Pipeline operators agree to charge specific tariffs for sending oil through the lines when they sign long-term contracts with oil shippers. Those rates are known as committed tariffs, and are subject to approval by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC also reviews the rates paid by occasional shippers, known as uncommitted tariffs. The FERC declined to comment on the secondary market and on the tariffs that the marketing arms of pipeline operators are charging in that market. Aggressive Marketing Most of the 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators - such as Enbridge (ENB.TO) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD.N) - have established their own marketing or trading arms that are reselling space. Last year, TransCanada - which operates the massive Keystone pipeline system - became the most recent player to open a unit to trade oil and resell pipeline space. A few, such as Plains, have had marketing arms for more than a decade, but in the past they had mostly just sold or traded space that went unused by major producers who had committed to long-term contracts. On lines such as TransCanada’s, big producers such as ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and Suncor Energy (SU.N) account for up to 90 percent of the flow in a pipeline. The remaining 10 percent is sold to occasional shippers. Suncor and ExxonMobil declined to comment. With the three-year rout in oil, the volume accounted for in long-term contracts has fallen, and the marketing arms have gone from simply selling occasional space to needing to make big deals to fill the lines. The practice has become so widespread that even pipeline operators who had previously said they disliked the emergence of the secondary market have now joined the fray. Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP.N), for instance, in November applied to the FERC to establish a marketing arm, citing the more favorable terms other firms can offer customers. The move came after Magellan had declined for years to run its own operation out of fear that it would compete with its own customers. The secondary market is formed by marketing firms signing up to long-term contracts with their parent companies, the pipeline owners. The marketing firms become like committed customers to the line, and pay the same rates for the space as the firms with long-term contracts. Those marketing firms book a paper loss for shipping the volumes at a discount. But the sales keep the pipelines more full - which makes the parent firm look better to investors, who use pipeline volume as a key metric to judge those firms. Some companies have felt the pinch of the paper losses. Genesis Energy LP (GEL.N) - a Houston-based midstream firm with a market cap of $3.6 billion - said its supply and logistics unit saw fourth-quarter revenues fall by 15 percent from a year earlier. The company’s Chief Executive Grant Sims, during a recent earnings call, cited  volume cannibalization  for the decline, saying that it was forced to compete in a market in which participants were willing to lose money. Genesis declined to comment further to Reuters. Ed Longanecker president of the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association, said tensions between producers and midstream firms become more strained in a low-price environment, with producers  at the mercy of an extremely competitive market.

Mediaset is controlled by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi with a 39.53 percent stake, but media giant Vivendi became its second largest shareholder in December, after swiftly building a 28.8 percent position. The stake-building deepened the rift between the two groups, already involved in a legal battle after Vivendi pulled out of an 800 million euro ($857 million) contract last July that would have given it full control of Mediaset's pay-TV unit. Though Vivendi claimed the stake-building was not intended as hostile but rather a sign of long-term interest, the move infuriated the Berlusconi family and the company said it risked paralysing operations.  It's more than just a company dispute, we are facing an attempted hostile takeover that would damage a national champion crucial in the television sector,  said Mediaset chairman Fedele Confalonieri speaking at the start of the annual meeting. With the approval of the buyback programme Mediaset, which currently holds 3.79 percent of its own shares, will be able to buy up to 10 percent of the company's shares, tightening the grip of Berlusconi's family on the group. But its structure means it will not force Mediaset's large shareholders -- including Berlusconi's holding Fininvest -- to launch a mandatory bid for the group should their stake surpass the allowed legal threshold as result of the buyback. Mediaset Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi said to date Fininvest had no reason to increase its stake. Vivendi Stays Away Vivendi, headed by French businessman Vincent Bollore, chose not to attend the annual meeting, forfeiting its right to vote. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when asked about the reasons but a person close to the matter said the French media group had preferred not to go to avoid  disruption at a delicate moment . The approval of the buyback programme is also seen as a move by Mediaset to partially offset any future sale of shares by Vivendi. The French group might decide to sell part of its stake in the broadcaster after the Italian communications authority said Vivendi was in breach of antitrust rules in the telecoms and media sector. While waiting for the outcome of an appeal it filed against the regulator's decision, Vivendi is expected to freeze its voting rights in the Italian broadcaster at just below 10 percent, a source said earlier this month. Confalonieri told shareholders the group had filed a new claim against Vivendi on June 8, alleging contract violation, unfair competition and breaking TV pluralism laws.  The first filing was linked to the failed pay-TV deal, this second one is a consequence of everything that came afterwards...,  said Pier Silvio Berlusconi referring to Vivendi's later stakebuilding and the regulator's decision. The new accusations are expected to flow into the existing case, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  If you want peace, prepare for war,  Confalonieri told reporters, citing a Latin proverb.

It was a lively European session. The bond market sell-off and jump in the euro came as a dive in technology stocks after the latest global cyber attack sent European shares to a two-month low. The euro was eyeing up $1.14 and was at a 7-month high versus the pound after an upbeat ECB President Mario Draghi on Tuesday opened the door to changing the bank's aggressive stimulus policy. The common currency is now up almost 10 percent this year. The head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, and one of her lieutenants, Patrick Harker, said on Tuesday that they expected to continue raising U.S. interest rates, but it couldn't rally the dollar. That provoked the banking world's single biggest cheerleader for a stronger dollar, Deutsche Bank, to declare the end of the greenback's bull run which dates back to 2014.  I do think the euro now has got quite significant momentum behind it and I think that will build towards the confirmation of some tapering announcement this year. So I would be long the euro on a tactical basis for the rest of the year,  JPMorgan Asset Management's Global Market Strategist, David Stubb, said. At the same time, core European bonds are the significant area of vulnerability to better euro zone growth and to changes in ECB policy, he added.  If you are looking at a 10-year maturity and further out, it is a global bond market and the extremely low yields in core Europe stick out alongside Japan and Switzerland as the places that seem stretched in terms of valuation.  Amid all the choppiness, safe-haven gold rose for a sixth day in the last seven. Wall Street, meanwhile, looked set to struggle again after the S&P; 500 and Dow Jones took their biggest tumbles in over a month. Nerves over the latest cyberattack, this time called Goldeneye, weighed on big tech names including Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft in premarket trading. In Asia overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4 percent as it pulled back from a two-year high hit on Monday. Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.5 percent, as the yen, at 111.900, also took advantage of the dollar's weakness. The banking and insurance sectors however outperformed on expectations of higher rates. Bonds Shaken, Metals Stir The yield on U.S. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last stood at 2.22 percent, well up from Monday's 2.14 percent levels. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen had said in London that it was appropriate to  gradually  raise U.S. rates, although there was an acknowledgement that inflation had seen some slippage.  Yellen's comment is supporting Japanese financial stocks today, and for the long-term, Japanese stocks are on the rising trend supported by U.S.-led global economic recovery,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. Wall Street's drop on Tuesday saw it close at its lowest since May 31. It was spooked after the U.S. Senate delayed voting on a healthcare reform bill, rekindling worries about the timeline of Donald Trump's business-friendly policies. The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major counterparts, edged down 0.2 percent to 96.227, well below its previous session high of 97.447. Euro bulls pushed it up 0.5 percent to a one-year high of $1.1373 with FX traders waiting for another flurry of ECB policymaker speeches at a conference hosted by the central bank in Portugal. The greenback also slumped against the Canadian dollar after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told CNBC that it looked like the central bank's rate cuts have done their job. Sterling, which has come under pressure again from Britain's recently volatile politics, bounced too, clawing above $1.28 to its highest since Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority on June 8. Conversely, it hit its weakest since November at 88.79 pence per euro. Emerging markets were caught in the global stocks sell off and commodities were also on the move. Crude oil futures gave back some of Tuesday's near 2-percent gain made on the back of the weaker dollar and expectations that U.S. crude inventories might decline for a third consecutive week. Brent crude futures were down 0.2 percent at $46.55 per barrel. U.S. crude futures were down 0.5 percent at $44.04. The weaker dollar helped bolster spot gold, which was up 0.4 percent at 1,251.59 per ounce, while industrial metals copper, lead and zinc prices dipped back from three-month highs a.

It is equipped with new air defense, anti-missile, anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons,  Xinhua said, without giving further details. The state-run Global Times newspaper said the ship was believed to be the first Type 055 destroyer, which is considered to be a successor class to the smaller Type 052D guided missile destroyers. China is still producing the latter and commissioned one, the Xining, in January. Chinese media showed photos of the new ship covered in streamers and flags and flanked by rows of sailors. The vessel will have to undergo planned testing before it is commissioned into use. China is producing warships at a rapid clip as it modernizes its navy, which has been taking an increasingly prominent role among the country's armed forces. State media has said that the navy commissioned 18 ships, including destroyers, corvettes and guided-missile frigates in 2016.  In April, China launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier, a conventionally powered ship that likely won't enter service until 2020.  China's naval build-up, and it's increasingly assertive stance over disputed territory in the South China, has unnerved its neighbors.

Rising demand from India, which typically churns out its own sugar to use in everything from fizzy drinks to sticky snacks, could support benchmark global prices that have been trading near 16-month lows. However, it would pressure Indian prices, potentially making it difficult for mills that process sugar cane to pay farmers rates stipulated by the government.  At the current (international) price level, refiners can import sugar for domestic consumption and make a profit,  said Rohit Pawar, chief executive of Baramati Agro, which operates sugar mills in the western state of Maharashtra. Dealers estimate the cost of sweetener produced from raw sugar shipped in from abroad, including the 40 percent import duty, is around 32,000 rupees ($496) per tonne, about 8 percent cheaper than local sugar at 34,600 rupees. A stronger rupee also makes the dollar-denominated price tag on overseas cargoes more affordable for Indian mills. The rupee has risen more than 5 percent against the dollar this year. That comes after the government in April allowed the duty-free import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar by the end of June to keep a lid on prices after local production fell by a fifth from a year ago. Nearly 60,000 tonnes of that 500,000 tonnes is yet to land in the country and the government is likely to extend the duty-free imports' period by up to two months, a government official, who declined to be named, said.  Right now refiners are processing duty-free imports. From the next month they could start importing (duty-paid) sugar for local consumption,  said a sugar miller based at Kolhapur in Maharashtra. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. Traders said predicting the scale of potential imports was tricky.  It is difficult to estimate how much Indian refiners will import ... (while) paying tax,  said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.  The market has not anticipated additional imports. Once imports start, local prices could crash and could make larger imports unviable.  Local sugar prices have already fallen to their lowest level in three months in the wake of the duty-free imports and due to a cooler summer than usual, which curbed appetite for cold treats such as ice cream.  There is a need to raise import duty on sugar to 70 percent. Otherwise imports will pull down prices further and make it impossible for mills to pay the government's fixed cane price,  said Baramati Agro's Pawar. India has increased by nearly 11 percent the price sugar mills must pay cane growers in the next sugar season beginning in October. There is no immediate plan to raise import duty on sugar and wheat, the government official said.  Mills cannot pay higher prices for cane unless they manage to sell sugar at higher prices,  said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.  There is a need to stop imports as next season we will be self-sufficient in sugar production.  India's 2017/18 sugar output is expected to jump a quarter from the previous year to 25 million tonnes.

LeEco, one of China's most ambitious companies that grew from a Netflix-like video website to a business empire spanning consumer electronics to cars within 13 years, is struggling to support its goals that include beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors in premium electric vehicle making. Its billionaire founder and CEO Yueting has previously said the firm was battling a cash crunch after expanding at an unprecedented rate.  Earlier this year, Jia thought the company had found an answer to its cash problems when Chinese property developer Sunac agreed to invest 15 billion yuan ($2.21 billion), including 9 billion yuan into LeEco's non-listed entities.  We had thought some 9 billion yuan for the non-listed units would have been able to solve all the problems, the result obviously did not meet our expectations,  Jia said at the annual shareholder meeting of the group's main listed unit, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp.  Since October, we took some measures and made some mistakes, but LeEco's non-listed units' finances got tighter. This is what we discovered over two-to-three months,  he said, a company transcript of the meeting held in Beijing shows. LeEco will need to further consolidate its non-listed units in the next two-three months,  dispose of some fixed assets and even equity assets  in order to combat what Jia described as  a second cash crunch  from April.  He added that although LeEco had paid back some 15 billion yuan in debt, including loans under his name, the company still did not have enough funding support. Choosing to repay debts instead of refinancing operations had hurt the company's ability to get back on track, Jia said. On business plans, LeEco's car unit - which Jia described as the number one source of LeEco's financial troubles - is seeking to complete round-A financing and start production as soon as possible, Jia said. The company also plans to strengthen its smart TV business under a strategy centered around larger-screen products, though Leshi chief executive Liang Jun said the TV industry in China in the first half of 2017 saw the worst sales declines in nearly a decade due to rising panel costs, with sales down around 20 percent during the May holiday season.   Leshi had income receivables of 9.5 billion yuan as of the first quarter, representing 28.4 percent of its total assets of 33.6 billion yuan, according to its financial report. Chief Financial Officer Zhang Wei said the company aims to lower that ratio to below 20 percent and reduce the receivable account by around 3 billion yuan.

Ana Brnabic, the prime minister-designate who in a one-hour speech presented her programme and cabinet to parliament, is expected to get the approval of more than 150 deputies of the ruling coalition in the 250-seat parliament. Brnabic, the country's first openly gay head of government, was picked by powerful president Aleksandar Vucic, who stepped down as prime minister to take the more ceremonial role after he won the April election in a landslide.  EU membership remains our main direction,  Brnabic said, adding that her government would work on strengthening relations with Moscow, continuing a delicate balancing act between the West and Russia. Brnabic, who had been minister in charge of state administration in Vucic's cabinet, named Nenad Popovic, a well known businessman with strong links to Russia, as one of her deputies. Dusan Vujovic will remain finance minister. She said education reform and digitalisation, which would streamline the state's administrative services and reduce waiting times, will be priorities.  We need to look into the future,  said Brnabic. She added that her government would focus on achieving average economic growth of 3.5 percent a year and would tackle environmental issues, including power production from renewables and waste control -- both key elements in the Balkan state's plans to join the EU.  I count on the support of the president Vucic,  Brnabic, who is not affiliated with any party, said. Unprecedented Power Analysts see Brnabic's election as a move to please the West which for years has insisted on the improvement of gay rights in conservative societies across the Balkans, but say real power will remain in the hands of Vucic.  By nominating a competent, but politically weak PM, Vucic expectedly seeks to solidify his influence over Serbian politics,  Teneo Intelligence said in an analyst note on Wednesday.  As president, head of the ruling SNS (Serbian Progressive Party), and de facto leader of the government, Vucic would extend his influence across the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, resulting in an unprecedented concentration of power since Slobodan Milosevic’s rule in the 1990s.  Vucic, who as information minister in the late 1990s presided over legislation designed to muzzle dissent against Milosevic, has been accused of stifling media freedoms since becoming prime minister almost two years ago. Goran Miletic, programme director for the western Balkans at Civil Rights Defenders, an independent human rights organisation founded in Stockholm, said that by electing Brnabic Serbia wanted to present itself  in a better light  to the EU.  But it all needs to be put in the context that human rights are not being respected here (in Serbia), and by that I mean the rule of law and freedom of media,  he said.  I am not optimistic that Brnabic's election will change that.  Strengthening the legal system to ensure the judiciary is free from political influence is a key step for Serbia to progress towards EU membership.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would strengthen the duty of fund managers to act in the best interests of investors and, as in the United States, require them to appoint independent directors to their boards. Fund managers will also come under the FCA's individual accountability regime, making it easier to punish them when rules are not followed. The reforms in a 112-page report follow an initial study last November that found a lack of competition and high profits for the industry. The FCA will now consult on how best to implement its plans.  This is really a major piece of work. It's a major step forward,  FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told reporters.  We have put together a comprehensive package of reforms that will make competition work better and help both retail and institutional investors to make their money work well for them.  The FCA said it would also launch a study into investment platforms which offer a range of funds online. That sent shares in platform provider Hargreaves Lansdown down more than 2 percent to the bottom of the UK's benchmark FTSE 100 index. The watchdog recommended too that the government's work and pensions department remove barriers to the pooling of pension schemes, which could cut investment costs for the schemes. Fees The combination of measures taken by the FCA will drive down fees for investors, Bailey said. The changes will be introduced in stages, which the industry will welcome as it faces other reforms, such as new European Union rules, and the unknown impact of Britain leaving the bloc on a sector with ties that criss-cross Europe. On fees, the FCA said it would broaden new EU fee disclosure requirements that come into force in January. The EU rules require intermediaries to publish a single, all-in fee, and the watchdog said this practice would be a requirement across all the sector.  The result is from the start of next year investors will get a simple disclosure of the fees they are being charged or will be charge, expressed in pounds and pence,  the FCA said. It will consult later in the year on making the new EU rules work better. Bailey said the FCA was not  gold plating  EU rules, but making them consistent across the funds sector.  Many of the key recommendations work with the grain of European legislation already in the pipeline to introduce more clarity and transparency for consumers,  the Investment Association industry body said. Owen Lysak, a partner at Clifford Chance law firm, said introducing independent board members marked a partial move towards a more U.S.-style approach to fund governance, that could mean a cultural shift in the market. However, some industry watchers said funds would be relieved the FCA didn't go further  The FCA has delivered a report which spares them the harshest potential remedies flagged in their interim report last November,  said Daniel Godfrey, founder of investment company The People's Trust and ex-head of trade body Investment Association.  There's a big difference between supporting the 'disclosure of an all-in fee' and making managers actually charge an all-in fee.  Consultations The regulator stopped short of an immediate referral to Britain's competition authority of the market for institutional advice, but is expected to do so later in the year after a public consultation launched on Wednesday.  Postponing this decision until September, pending further consultation, is almost certainly a delaying of the inevitable,  KPMG's Head of Investment Advisory, Nick Evans, said. It did, however, recommend the government consider bringing investment consultants under the remit of the FCA. The FCA's November consultation paper raised hackles in the industry after it criticised asset managers for making hefty profits, and the watchdog said its final report confirmed those findings.  This found that price competition is weak in a number of areas of the industry,  the FCA said.  Despite a large number of firms operating in the market, the FCA's analysis found evidence of sustained, high profits over a number of years.  The FCA said it also found investors are not always clear what the objectives of funds are, and fund performance is not always reported against an appropriate benchmark. David Morrey, a partner at Grant Thornton consultancy, said the FCA had backed away from the  frontal assault  it began in November on whether actively managed funds could ever be better than passive funds. The implementation of the  remedies  will take place in a number of stages. The FCA has published a consultation paper, focussing on the remedies related to governance and technical changes to promote fairness for investors. $1 = 0.7804 pounds Editing by Jane Merriman and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-funds-regulations-idUSL8N1JP0SP"},

LeEco, one of China's most ambitious companies that grew from a Netflix-like video website to a business empire spanning consumer electronics to cars within 13 years, is struggling to support its goals that include beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors in premium electric vehicle making. Its billionaire founder and CEO Yueting has previously said the firm was battling a cash crunch after expanding at an unprecedented rate.  Earlier this year, Jia thought the company had found an answer to its cash problems when Chinese property developer Sunac agreed to invest 15 billion yuan ($2.21 billion), including 9 billion yuan into LeEco's non-listed entities.  We had thought some 9 billion yuan for the non-listed units would have been able to solve all the problems, the result obviously did not meet our expectations,  Jia said at the annual shareholder meeting of the group's main listed unit, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp.  Since October, we took some measures and made some mistakes, but LeEco's non-listed units' finances got tighter. This is what we discovered over two-to-three months,  he said, a company transcript of the meeting held in Beijing shows. LeEco will need to further consolidate its non-listed units in the next two-three months,  dispose of some fixed assets and even equity assets  in order to combat what Jia described as  a second cash crunch  from April.  He added that although LeEco had paid back some 15 billion yuan in debt, including loans under his name, the company still did not have enough funding support. Choosing to repay debts instead of refinancing operations had hurt the company's ability to get back on track, Jia said. On business plans, LeEco's car unit - which Jia described as the number one source of LeEco's financial troubles - is seeking to complete round-A financing and start production as soon as possible, Jia said. The company also plans to strengthen its smart TV business under a strategy centered around larger-screen products, though Leshi chief executive Liang Jun said the TV industry in China in the first half of 2017 saw the worst sales declines in nearly a decade due to rising panel costs, with sales down around 20 percent during the May holiday season.   Leshi had income receivables of 9.5 billion yuan as of the first quarter, representing 28.4 percent of its total assets of 33.6 billion yuan, according to its financial report. Chief Financial Officer Zhang Wei said the company aims to lower that ratio to below 20 percent and reduce the receivable account by around 3 billion yuan.

Alibaba's announcement comes as its rivals such as Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc are expanding operations in Southeast Asia and amid media reports that Amazon is eyeing an entry into the region of 600 million people where only a fraction of total retail sales are currently conducted online. (tcrn.ch/2mSzlop) The region may be the first market where Amazon and Alibaba will go head-to-head, if the U.S. firm confirms the plans.   It is a clear signal from (Alibaba) that, now having learned the market better, that they really believe in the opportunity of ecommerce in southeast Asia,  Lazada Chief Executive Maximilian Bittner told Reuters in an interview.  The move doubles Alibaba's investment in Lazada after last year's deal to buy a controlling stake in it for about $1 billion and is a part of its efforts to boost its global sales. Alibaba had the option to buy the remaining stakes from some Lazada investors, 12-18 months after the deal closed. Besides financial support, Alibaba's investment has provided Lazada with several benefits, including access to a wider range of merchants and improving its logistics capabilities.  Lazada has been expanding its offerings over the last year, buying Singapore-based online grocer RedMart and tying up with companies such as Netflix and Uber [UBER.UL] for a membership program.  Bittner said having Alibaba as a backer was  very helpful  in distinguishing itself from Amazon and other competitors.

On Wednesday, Alibaba said it will purchase the shares from certain Lazada shareholders at an implied valuation of $3.15 billion. Germany's Rocket Internet and Sweden's Kinnevik confirmed in separate statements that they were among the selling shareholders.  Last year's deal had included partial stake sales by investors, including British supermarket operator Tesco Plc, Rocket and Kinnevik. Bittner said Lazada management and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] were the only other remaining shareholders, besides Alibaba. Lazada, founded in 2012, is headquartered in Singapore and also operates in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, Lazada had about 23 million annual active buyers, according to Alibaba's annual report.   The e-commerce markets in the region are still relatively untapped, and we see a very positive upward trajectory ahead of us,  Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba, said in a statement.

One of the world's most forested countries, Gabon is the second African nation, after the Democratic Republic of Congo, to sign an agreement with the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), launched in 2015 and backed by European donor nations. The initiative, which also covers Central African Republic, Cameroon, Congo Republic and Equatorial Guinea, aims to restart protection efforts in the Congo Basin - a target for expansion of palm oil plantations as available land in Indonesia dwindles. Protecting forests is widely seen as one of the cheapest and most effective ways to reduce the emissions driving global warming. Loss and degradation of forests account for about 15 percent of emissions each year, conservation groups say.  This agreement is a big step forward,  Vidar Helgesen, Norway's climate and environment minister and chairman of the CAFI, said in a statement published late on Tuesday.   Gabon is committing to measures that, if implemented, would preserve about 98 percent of its rainforests,  Helgesen added. Forests in the Congo Basin cover about two million sq km - nearly the size of Mexico - but are shrinking by 5,600 sq km a year. The small, central African nation aims to cut its emissions by half by 2025 - compared with 2005 levels - by establishing a national land-use plan, implementing a system to monitor forests and natural resources, and improving governance of its forests.  The CAFI requires countries to create national investment plans to address the pressures driving deforestation, and aims to slow illegal logging and burning of forests that are vital to millions of people and endangered animals, such as gorillas. It is backed by funding from the European Union, Norway, Britain, France and Germany, and technical advice from Brazil.  Gabon could set a standard for sustainable development that could inspire other countries in Central and Western Africa,  said U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Magdy Martinez-Soliman.  By accelerating reforms, the country will engage on a genuine green economy path that offers solutions for both climate and agriculture, and is attractive for green private sector investments more generally,  he added in a statement.

COMMENTARY: The biggest victims of the Senate health bill (and other Trump plans) President Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and is now considering possible trade actions against Beijing, three senior administration officials told Reuters. The officials said Trump was looking at options including tariffs on steel imports, which Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross already has said he is considering as part of a national security study of the U.S. steel industry.  World A Venezuelan police helicopter fired 15 shots at a government ministry, where scores of people were at a social event, and dropped four grenades on the Supreme Court, where judges were meeting, escalating the OPEC nation's political crisis in what President Nicolas Maduro called an attack by  terrorists  seeking a coup.

They may also be incorrect, with China's current account surpluses understated as a result. Anna Wong, a senior economist with the U.S. Federal Reserve, reckons the money spent overseas by Chinese tourists -- some $215 billion last year, according to one industry estimate -- is not all it is cracked up to be. In a draft paper for the Fed's governors, Wong says a large amount of the money designated as having come from Chinese tourists globally should actually count as investment in assets.  Financial outflows concealed as travel imports are large and significant, growing to around 1 percent of China’s GDP in 2015 and 2016, and account for a quarter of recorded net private financial outflows,  she wrote. This would mean that China's current account surpluses over the past few years are actually larger than reported, and possibly as big as before the financial crisis. China's capital controls make it difficult for wealthier Chinese to invest abroad. But the implication of Wong's findings  is that there are a plethora of ways for the country's  tourists  to buy property and other assets overseas. Factors suggesting this is happening come down to the amount of money being reported as tourist-related versus the actual macroeconomic conditions surrounding it. One example is that China's travel expenditure as a share of GDP was reported to be higher than Britain's in 2014, even though the latter's per capita GDP is seven times China's. Similarly, in the same year, spending by Chinese tourists abroad was reported to have increased four times faster than the actual number of tourists. The way that money designated as tourist inflows ends up as asset buying is mainly anecdotal. Wong cites  purchases of insurance saving and annuity products, real estate properties, and cashback through a cover-up jewelery transaction , as examples. Not Whole Story None of this is to say that Chinese tourism is not a huge boon to some countries, or that the phenomenon of a new wave of tourists is not real. But it does have some impact on both tourist economies and China's finances. For the former, it means tourist expenditure may not be adding to jobs, revenues and manufacturing in the way that has been assumed. Instead, a lot of the money designated as Chinese tourist inflow may simply be pumping up asset prices -- in real estate, for example -- that do not necessarily benefit the economies, or the locals, of the destination countries. For China, it suggests that official current account surplus data may have been distorted, that far more money is escaping capital controls than believed, and that China's services deficit has been inflated. Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at British fund firm Standard Life Investments, says the main implication of Wong's report is that the current account surplus is larger than implied by official statistics -- a hot potato politically.  Transactions that appear as travel imports actually should have been on the capital or financial account,  he said.  If then the services deficit is smaller than implied, the overall net surplus would then be larger.  China’s current account surplus is likely as large (as a percentage of GDP) as it was before the global financial crisis.   Wolf noted that the U.S. Treasury has recently cited progress in China reducing its external balance. If Wong's analysis is correct, the Treasury's assessment may not be.

Those are the broad findings of a nineteen-month probe by Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, published on Wednesday. Those conclusions, mostly previewed in an earlier report last November, hit harder than the watchdog’s prescriptions. The big question is whether, once managers have been whipped into shape, clients will become more discerning. Central to the FCA’s vision is discipline and transparency. The watchdog argues that customers should see an “all-in fee” that tells them how much they pay to have their money managed – including trading charges. Funds should be clearer when comparing their past performance relative to benchmarks, and use more ambitious yardsticks. Meanwhile, fund managers will be required to act in the best interests of investors – which implies they don’t always do so already. The FCA has also ensured it has a healthy workload for the foreseeable future, through an investigation into investment platforms, and a vague hint that hedge funds and private equity firms may be in line for future scrutiny. The conclusions may be bold, but there’s a sense that some punches have been pulled. All-in fees and benchmarking practices, for example, will be consulted on before they are implemented. Some gradualism makes sense, given the uncertainty around Britain’s departure from the European Union, and the imminent implementation of the so-called MIFID II rules that already promise to bring more transparency to the industry. Shares in Jupiter Fund Management and Aberdeen Asset Management, which Morgan Stanley analysts estimate have the highest percentage of UK clients among listed managers, rose slightly by late morning on Wednesday. What’s still missing is a good explanation for why investors accept such a raw deal. A study of the market showed that prices for active asset management haven’t much changed in a decade – and that the average firm has a hefty operating profit margin of 36 percent. Yet the industry isn’t obviously highly concentrated. The recent spate of mergers also supports asset managers’ complaint that life is getting tougher. The problem might lie with consultants and financial advisers who act as intermediaries, who will now face further investigation. But the other conclusion to draw is that customers don’t care enough to shop around for a better deal. Fixing that problem deserves deeper scrutiny.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The (dollar) demand was there but volumes were thin,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Dealers said they expect seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. Investors shrugged off a policy rate decision by the central bank, which held key rates steady as expected, dealers said. The central bank kept its benchmark interest rate steady on Friday, saying the current monetary policy was appropriate as it expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank said it would allow gradual depreciation of the currency and set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year, mainly to meet a target set by the International Monetary Fund for a three-year $1.5 billion loan. Analysts have said that if the U.S. Federal Reserves tightens monetary policy more aggressively than the market expects over the coming months, there is a risk of further falls in the rupee against the U.S. dollar.

Completion of the third unit at Flamanville, where two reactors have been operating since 1986-87, had been thrown into doubt after the discovery in 2015 of weak spots in the steel prompted an extensive safety review by the ASN. The ASN report on the reactor, which has yet to be released but a copy of which has been seen by Reuters, concludes that the reactor is fit for service, though it will need to be monitored throughout its lifetime and the lid of the containment vessel will probably need to be replaced in a few years. The  Groupe Permanent  experts, appointed to provide an independent second opinion, discussed the report on Monday and Tuesday and drafted its recommendation late on Tuesday evening, the source said. The group's non-binding recommendation, which will be used by the ASN to formulate a final ruling on Flamanville this autumn, is expected to be published by the ASN at a news conference at 1400 GMT on Wednesday, along with its report. The source also said that representatives of EDF had told the group of experts that the utility had started a procedure to order a new reactor cover from manufacturer Areva. The new cover would be forged by Japan Steel Works, not by Areva's Creusot Forge foundry, which manufactured the piece with carbon concentrations that were found to have made the steel more brittle. The new cover will still be tooled by Areva, the source added. EDF plans to build two of the same Areva-designed European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) models in Hinkley Point, Britain. EDF declined to comment. High Stakes The stakes are high for EDF and Areva because it would cost billions of euros and take years to repair the vessel if ASN rules that the steel is too brittle. The ASN's green light for Flamanville, slated for start-up in late 2018, is also a European Commission precondition for approving EDF's planned takeover of Areva's reactor business. The source said that the ASN may publish a provisional ruling on Flamanville on its website around July 11 for public consultation. Following input from the public and industry, it will then publish its final ruling in the autumn. Industry watchers say it its unlikely the final ruling will differ much from the original report and the experts' recommendation. Greenpeace called on energy and environment minister Nicolas Hulot to halt the Flamanville construction.  The ASN is no longer able to decide on safety in all independence and cannot resist industry pressure, simply because the survival of the entire French nuclear industry is at stake with the approval of this reactor vessel,  Greenpeace said. Greenpeace and other anti-nuclear activists argue that the group of experts is too close to the ASN and the nuclear industry to be able to contest the ASN's conclusion that Flamanville will be safe to operate. The ASN does not detail the experts' professional backgrounds, but a spreadsheet obtained by Reuters shows that eight of them work or have worked with the ASN or IRSN, the technical arm of the regulator. Another eight work or have worked for EDF or Areva. Critics say that only three of the experts are independent of the nuclear industry.  The ASN is using an expert committee that is at its feet, with a text it has drafted itself, to legitimise a highly controversial decision on the safety of a device whose failure could have implications for millions of people,  said Mycle Schneider, author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report.

The rescue package will see the bank's existing investors swapping their bondholdings for cash and shares, boosting its capital levels back to a level acceptable to Britain's financial regulators. The deal follows months of negotiations between the bank and its hedge fund creditors after Co-op put itself up for sale in February this year, seeking its second rescue in the last five years. The bank, which prides itself on being an ethical lender, nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from problem real estate loans and received a further capital injection in 2014 as it battled IT and governance problems.  The proposal today should lay the foundations to help secure the future of the Co-operative Bank,  its chairman Dennis Holt said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. Co-op Bank provides banking services to almost 4 million retail and small and medium-sized enterprises in Britain. The deal will allow the bank to survive as a standalone entity, Co-op Bank said, and the agreement allows the lender to keep its name and ethical policy under which it does not lend or provide services to businesses deemed harmful to society. If the bank had failed to find a buyer or agree a rescue package, it would have posed a first test of powers granted to the Bank of England after the 2008 financial crisis -- allowing it to intervene in a struggling bank and unwind it in an orderly way. Investors who own the bank's debt will pump 443 million pounds ($568.37 million) into recapitalising its bonds and will also help it raise 250 million pounds in fresh equity, the bank said in a statement. The bank and parent Co-operative Group have agreed terms to separate their respective pension plans, overcoming a stumbling block after months of negotiations with investors as to who would be liable for the members' pensions. The bank will contribute 100 million pounds over 10 years to its section of the shared pension scheme. Co-Op Group's holding in the bank will fall to around 1 percent from 20 percent, leaving the bank's U.S.-based hedge fund owners in control. They include BlueMountain Capital, Cyrus Capital Partners, GoldenTree Asset Management, and Silver Point Capital. Britain's Prudential Regulation Authority said in a separate statement it had accepted the plan, but that implementation of it would be subject to further approvals. $1 = 0.7794 pounds Reporting by Lawrence White, additional reporting by Esha Vaish; editing by Simon Jessop and Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/co-operativ-bank-capital-idUSL8N1JP2HD"},

Schaeuble, speaking at a news conference after the cabinet approved the spending plans, rejected criticism that income tax cuts of 15 billion euros ($17.06 billion) a year over that period was too low to significantly boost growth through consumption.  A modest and reliable fiscal policy doesn't allow much more wiggle room (to cut taxes),  Schaeuble said.  Our mid-term fiscal plans take into account the possibility of moderate interest rate rises and we set aside provisions,  he added. The budget must still be confirmed by the lower house of parliament after a Sept. 24 national election. Asked about Italy's decision to start winding down two failed regional banks in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros, Schaeuble said that the European Union needed to look again at whether loopholes were created by differences between bank closure rules and national insolvency regimes.

Life insurance companies generated 308.4 billion yuan ($45.36 billion) from products related to so-called universal life in the Jan-May period, according to statistics released on Wednesday on the website of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). The decline comes as CIRC intensifies its widespread regulatory crackdown on the excessive use of universal life products. A handful of insurance firms, which have issued higher-yielding products to raise funds to acquire stakes in market-listed companies, have been punished. Anbang Life, a key part of Anbang Insurance Group Co , one of China's most acquisitive firms overseas, was barred in May from applying to issue new products for three months. Its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was subsequently detained. Last December, CIRC suspended Foresea Life, a unit of financial conglomerate Baoneng Group, from selling universal life insurance products until it addressed problems in how it managed customer accounts and information.

Murillo, who manages disaster response for international agency World Animal Protection, said flash floods, flying debris and mudslides killed large numbers of animals, including pigs, goats and chickens.  In storm-hit areas of the country, teams of veterinarians helped treat thousands of animals for injuries and infections. “If animals are saved, families can stay self-sufficient and be better prepared for future disasters,” Murillo, himself a vet, said by telephone from Costa Rica. “Without animals, families lose one of their main sources of income and are often left with no way to rebuild their lives - that is why losing animals can hinder the recovery of entire communities,” he said, soon after treating flood-affected animals in Brazil’s northeast Alagoas state. Often forgotten amid the chaos, experts say animals are just as vulnerable as humans to death and injury in disasters.  Treating them is not only humane but essential to help the more than 1 billion people around the world who depend on livestock for both income and food. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization says livestock is one of the fastest-growing farming activities, helping support 70 percent of the world’s 880 million rural poor.  But the agriculture sector sustains more than a fifth of disaster-related losses in developing nations. The first few weeks after a disaster can be the hardest for animals if pasture is flooded, damaged roads cripple supply chains or farmers lack the money to buy feed, said Murillo.

Pigs Safe Underground In Latin America, where many countries are threatened by hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, wildfires and volcanic eruptions, farmers should identify evacuation routes for their animals, as well as emergency feed sources such as rented grazing land, said Murillo of World Animal Protection. Simple techniques like putting animals on rooftops during floods can help save them too, he added.  “To access food for their animals... farmers locate their farms or homes pretty close to high-risk areas like river banks or mountains that can slide down,” said Murillo. “Often they can barely survive day-to-day and do little to prepare.” Strategies used in the Philippines to dig out underground storm shelters for pigs could also work in hurricane-prone areas such as the Caribbean, said Gerardo Huertas of World Animal Protection, which works with governments, local vets, volunteers and communities in disaster zones. The organization is partnering with rescue services to include animals in evacuation plans and developing an online risk management toolkit for vets with advice and case studies, said Huertas. Experts say disaster strategies should also include evacuation plans for pets, as many owners put themselves or rescue workers in danger by refusing to leave their homes without their animals or by going back to rescue them.

In Latin America, Mexico is one of the few to have included animals in its disaster plans, along with Costa Rica, which was the first to set up an emergency fund for animals in natural disasters and is now sharing its experiences across the region.  “We’re new at this as well,” said Valerio. “Costa Rica has been a laboratory for many things that many countries have wanted to do.”  Reporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.

Lower U.S. courts had completely blocked Trump's executive order issued on March 6, which includes a blanket 90-day ban on people from countries including Iran and Libya and a 120-day ban on all refugees. But the Supreme Court on Monday ruled there could be partial restrictions placed on refugees. The decision is  an indication of the decision of the leaders of that country to discriminate against Muslims,  Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi was cited as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).  The Islamic Republic of Iran, after carefully examining the recent decision of the Supreme Court of America, will take proportional and reciprocal action,  Qassemi said. He did not elaborate. U.S. citizens must apply for tourist visas before travelling to Iran, as opposed to others including Germans who are able to obtain these on arrival. During his presidential campaign in 2016, Trump campaigned for  a total and complete shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States, arguing the measure is needed for national security. The court also gave examples of who may qualify for exemptions, including those with close family ties in the United States, obtaining a place at a U.S. university, or offers of employment. Qassemi also said the United States was targeting the wrong countries for a visa ban.  It's regrettable that the American government, because of their economic and commercial short-sightedness, have closed their eyes to the main perpetrators of terrorism in America,  he said. Iran blames Saudi Arabia, a long standing U.S. ally, for Islamic militancy.

Official data for domestic production, imports via pipelines and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) show the total amount of natural gas available in China in the first five months of the year was the equivalent of 72.01 million tonnes of LNG. This was up nine percent, or 5.94 million tonnes, on the 66.07 million tonnes that were either pumped domestically or imported in the first five months of 2016. China has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in energy consumption from 5.9 percent in 2015 to 10 percent in 2020, an average annual increase of 4.1 percent. So far this year, China's output and imports of the fuel are running at more than double the annual rate needed to reach the official target. The biggest gainer has been imports of LNG, which are up 38.4 percent in the first five months of 2017 to 12.86 million tonnes, while pipeline imports have dropped 4.4 percent to 12.65 million tonnes. Domestic natural gas production has been a strong gainer, rising almost 7 percent in the January to May period to 62.88 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 46.5 million tonnes of LNG. The rise in natural gas output stands in sharp contrast to the decline in crude oil production, which fell to the lowest on record in May as output declines from older fields. Natural gas has also outperformed coal, with domestic output of the polluting fuel up 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes in the first five months of the year. The jump in imports of LNG shows how the super-chilled fuel is becoming more competitive with pipeline imports from central Asia. Customs data from May shows that the average landed cost of LNG was $7.28 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This is higher than the $5.25 per mmBtu of pipeline imports, however, the customs price excludes the cost of internal pipeline and distribution, meaning imports from central Asia still have to pay to get from the border to demand centers. In contrast, much of the LNG is consumed near to where it is offloaded and re-gasified, meaning it doesn't suffer from the additional costs associated with the pipeline imports. Lng from Australia Surges Among China's LNG suppliers Australia has fared best, with imports rising 42.7 percent in the first five months to 5.39 million tonnes, almost double that of second-placed Qatar at 2.84 million tonnes. Malaysia is the third-biggest supplier to China, with 1.82 million tonnes in the first five months, up 90 percent from the same period in 2016. The price being paid by China for LNG tells part of the story, with cargoes from Australia landing at $6.80 per mmBtu in May, well below the $8.95 for Qatar and slightly ahead of the $6.49 for Malaysia. Australia's price advantage is still largely tied to the 25-year supply deal from the North West Shelf venture, signed in 2002 at a fixed price of $3.80 per mmBtu. At the time it was Australia's biggest export deal and hailed as a breakthrough in accessing China's markets, with former prime minister John Howard calling deal a  gold medal performance.  Since then, as spot LNG prices first rose dramatically to peak at over $20 per mmBtu in 2014, the deal was seen as too generous to the Chinese, given it lacked any mechanism for re-negotiation or linking the price to crude oil, as is common in most long-term LNG contracts. The spot price of Asian LNG was $5.40 per mmBtu in the week to June 23, down from the northern winter peak this year of $9.40 in early January. This means China is still paying more for its LNG than the spot price, but not so much as to make LNG imports uncompetitive against pipeline supplies. LNG imports in June appear set to remain robust, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts showing 2.7 million tonnes has already been discharged, or is discharging, at Chinese ports as of Tuesday. With three days still remaining in the month, the data suggests that an additional eight vessels carrying 560,000 tonnes may discharge before the end of June, taking total imports for the month to around 3.26 million tonnes. While natural gas has policy support boosting its use in China, it remains more expensive than coal when used to generate electricity. The best chance for natural gas to continue to make inroads is not only for LNG prices to remain relatively low, but also for the authorities in Beijing to push for natural gas to be used more in areas like residential heating and smaller factories, many of which still use coal.

Low carbon ferrochrome was last quoted at $1.80 a lb, its lowest since Nov. and down 20 percent since late January. High carbon ferrochrome is at an eight-month low at 93 cents a lb and more than 30 percent lower since late January.      The Chinese ports have about 10 weeks of chrome ore stocks and that coupled with reduced ferrochrome demand has sent the prices of ore and alloys crashing,  said Ravi Prakash, marketing and business development head for ferro alloys and minerals division of Tata Steel Ltd.  Stainless steel producers in China are cutting production as a supply overhang has pulled down prices, Prakash added.     China last year accounted for nearly 25 million tonnes or about 54 percent of global stainless steel production.  Two of the largest stainless producers in China – Taiyuan Stainless and Tsingshan Group – say they have enough ferrochrome for their near-term production needs and are not issuing ferrochrome tender prices,  Citi analysts said in a recent note.  Both the main Chinese stainless producers have announced plans to cut output in June following 'maintenance shutdowns' in May.  Some output cuts in South Africa, which produces nearly 60 percent of the world's chrome ore, are unlikely to cut supplies significantly, leaving ferrochrome prices under pressures, traders said.   Ferrochrome orders in the second quarter were much less than expected. With seasonal slowdown in Europe approaching, prices could take some more time to recover,  a London-based trader said.         Global supply for ferrochrome this year is expected to reach about 12.4 million tonnes, compared with an estimated 11 million tonnes last year, Tata Steel's Prakash said, adding global demand for the metal this year is seen at 12 million tonnes.  China's stainless steel demand will fall in the third quarter as the property market and manufacturing sectors slow amid growing concerns about oversupply, an executive from the Stainless Steel Association said earlier this month.

They may also be incorrect, with China's current account surpluses understated as a result. Anna Wong, a senior economist with the U.S. Federal Reserve, reckons the money spent overseas by Chinese tourists -- some $215 billion last year, according to one industry estimate -- is not all it is cracked up to be. In a draft paper for the Fed's governors, Wong says a large amount of the money designated as having come from Chinese tourists globally should actually count as investment in assets.  Financial outflows concealed as travel imports are large and significant, growing to around 1 percent of China’s GDP in 2015 and 2016, and account for a quarter of recorded net private financial outflows,  she wrote. This would mean that China's current account surpluses over the past few years are actually larger than reported, and possibly as big as before the financial crisis. China's capital controls make it difficult for wealthier Chinese to invest abroad. But the implication of Wong's findings  is that there are a plethora of ways for the country's  tourists  to buy property and other assets overseas. Factors suggesting this is happening come down to the amount of money being reported as tourist-related versus the actual macroeconomic conditions surrounding it. One example is that China's travel expenditure as a share of GDP was reported to be higher than Britain's in 2014, even though the latter's per capita GDP is seven times China's. Similarly, in the same year, spending by Chinese tourists abroad was reported to have increased four times faster than the actual number of tourists. The way that money designated as tourist inflows ends up as asset buying is mainly anecdotal. Wong cites  purchases of insurance saving and annuity products, real estate properties, and cashback through a cover-up jewelery transaction , as examples. Not Whole Story None of this is to say that Chinese tourism is not a huge boon to some countries, or that the phenomenon of a new wave of tourists is not real. But it does have some impact on both tourist economies and China's finances. For the former, it means tourist expenditure may not be adding to jobs, revenues and manufacturing in the way that has been assumed. Instead, a lot of the money designated as Chinese tourist inflow may simply be pumping up asset prices -- in real estate, for example -- that do not necessarily benefit the economies, or the locals, of the destination countries. For China, it suggests that official current account surplus data may have been distorted, that far more money is escaping capital controls than believed, and that China's services deficit has been inflated. Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at British fund firm Standard Life Investments, says the main implication of Wong's report is that the current account surplus is larger than implied by official statistics -- a hot potato politically.  Transactions that appear as travel imports actually should have been on the capital or financial account,  he said.  If then the services deficit is smaller than implied, the overall net surplus would then be larger.  China’s current account surplus is likely as large (as a percentage of GDP) as it was before the global financial crisis.

The Financial Conduct Authority proposed sweeping changes to the asset management sector in order to improve transparency and value for money for customers, including around fee disclosures and fund governance. In a toughly worded interim update in November, the FCA had raised the prospect of referring the consultants, which advise on 3 trillion pounds ($3.85 trillion) of investments for pension schemes and others, to the Competitions and Markets Authority, citing concerns around conflicts of interest and opaque fees. That prompted the three leading consultants, Aon, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson, which together make up 60 percent of the market, to band together and issue a series of private pledges to the regulator to prevent a review. In its Wednesday statement, the FCA said it was inclined to reject those so-called 'undertakings in lieu' because the proposals did not come from the whole market, and instead said it would consult further and make a decision in September. It also said it would recommend that the UK finance ministry consider allowing the watchdog to regulate the sector. Mary Starks, the FCA's director of competition, said the  thoughtful and serious  offer of undertakings made by  big three  investment consultants cover about 60 percent of the market.  Our thinking is if we were to accept that, it would only give us partial market coverage,  Starks told reporters.  We don't think the offer does away with the need for in-depth investigation of that market.  The head of the FCA, Andrew Bailey, said the move by some consultants into fiduciary management - running money like an asset manager - alongside their traditional advisory business, created potential conflicts of interest between the two.  It's that sort of area we would recommend looking at,  Bailey said. Tamasin Little, partner at law firm Reed Smith, said the attempt by the major investment consultants to head off a competition investigation by offering voluntary undertakings  appears to have failed . The consultants, which have not made their proposals public before, repeated in statements on Wednesday their belief the proposals should answer any regulatory concerns.  The combination of a mandatory tendering regime, performance and fee standards, and conflicts of interest protocols act as a powerful spur to competition,  Mercer said. Willis Towers Watson, meanwhile, said the pledges provided  a solid foundation on which to build any future work on the investment consulting industry , while Aon said it was confident the proposals reflected best practice. The three firms also said they supported the plan to bring them under the regulatory remit of the FCA. Smaller consultants, however, remained eager for a shake-up of the sector.  Competition within the investment consultancy market is worth looking at, and (we) would encourage the FCA to make a recommendation to the CMA,  Danny Vassiliades, head of investment consulting at Punter Southall, said in an emailed statement.  There is a clear requirement for remedies to increase competition.  $1 = 0.7799 pounds Editing by Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-funds-regulations-consultants-idUSL8N1JP1QF"},

The three, Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing of Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) and Lawi Weng, a senior reporter with the Irrawaddy magazine, were taken into military custody in Shan State in northeast Myanmar on Monday. They had covered the burning of some drugs by the rebel Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), which demands more autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic group and has been engaged in clashes with government troops over the past week. Deputy police inspector Kyaw Min said the three reporters, along with three other men detained at the same time, had been brought to police in Hsipaw town, where they would be imprisoned. “Today, in the afternoon, the military opened the case under Article 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act,  said Kyaw Min. The legal article, which prohibits giving assistance to banned groups, carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.  We will have to propose the case at the court and will detain them at Hsipaw prison,  he added. Despite the end of full military rule, and the election in 2015 of a government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi, concern in Myanmar is growing about press freedom, and about the challenge Suu Kyi faces in achieving peace. Clashes between government troops and loosely allied rebel groups close to Myanmar's border with China have set back peace talks prioritized by Suu Kyi when she took power last year. The DVB and the Irrawaddy, which operate in English and Burmese, were formed in exile during military rule but have both set up bureaus in the city of Yangon since pre-publication censorship was officially abolished in 2012. Domestic media advocacy groups and international watchdogs, including Amnesty International, raised concern about the reporters. 'Affront to Democracy' Lawyer Nyan Win, a senior member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, raised concerns about due process, although he said he was not sure of the full details of the case.  There's no provision for detaining anybody secretly -there's no clause in the law. And there's no arresting power for the military,  he told Reuters when asked about the journalists' detention. The Myanmar Press Council has written to the Ministry of Defense calling for their release, according to a defense official. The official declined to elaborate. The Committee to Protect Journalists said the three should be released and allowed to carry on with their work.  Using the archaic Unlawful Associations Act to incarcerate journalists is an affront to democracy in Myanmar,  the group's Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler said in a statement. Though she is de facto government leader, Suu Kyi does not have oversight over the armed forces. But she has not used her party's parliamentary majority to repeal many of the laws used by previous regimes to stifle dissent. Nyan Win said the NLD was reviewing such legislation. Journalists demonstrated in Yangon this month against what they said were increasing curbs on free speech, especially the use of a telecommunications law to prosecute reporters and social media users for defamation. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the army - known as the Tatmadaw - had clashed five times with insurgents since the army discovered a TNLA training camp on June 20.  Several Tatmadaw officers and troops were killed and a few were wounded. Four bodies of enemy troops were also found,  the newspaper said, citing military officials. The clashes took place while the three journalists were in the TNLA zone for the drug-burning. Two community groups in the area said on Tuesday they had documented extrajudicial killings, mass detention of civilians and torture by the military in recent days. They also said the military killed two villagers and wounded one in attack on Monday.  The Global New Light of Myanmar said rebels were responsible for the attack Military spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. The army almost always rejects accusations of rights abuses although it has in recent years acknowledged occasional violations by soldiers and promised action.

Kerr, a former Victoria's Secret model, was given diamond pendants, earrings and other jewelry worth about $8 million in 2014 by Malaysian financier Jho Low, according to a June 15  U.S. Department of Justice civil lawsuit. Kerr is not accused of any wrongdoing and her spokesperson said she has co-operated fully with U.S. authorities from the start of the inquiry.  The transfer of the jewelry gifts from Ms. Kerr's safe deposit box in Los Angeles to government agents was completed on last Friday afternoon,  the spokesperson said in a statement. The gifts of jewelry were detailed in the Justice Department's lawsuit, in a long-running case over an alleged conspiracy to launder money misappropriated from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB, which was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 to promote economic development. The Justice Department alleges that more than $4.5 billion was taken from 1MDB by high-level fund officials and their associates. Kerr, who was in between marriages to actor Orlando Bloom and Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel at the time, was given a heart-shaped diamond necklace worth $1.8 million, with her initials inscribed on the back, as a 2014 Valentine's Day gift from Low, according to the lawsuit. 89th Academy Awards - Oscars Vanity Fair Party - Beverly Hills, California, U.S. - 26/02/17 Model Miranda KerrDanny Moloshok/File PhotoLater in 2014, investigators said, Low gave Kerr a second, pink diamond, pendant worth $4.8 million, followed by matching earrings, a bracelet and a ring worth almost $2 million. The lawsuit said the funds for the jewelry were misappropriated from the 1MDB account. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, could not be reached for comment. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio also is tied up in the scandal after accepting artwork by Picasso and Basquiat worth more than $12 million from financiers connected with the 1MDB case, along with an Oscar once owned by actor Marlon Brando.  DiCaprio is cooperating with authorities and has initiated the return of the items, his spokesman has said. DiCaprio's involvement stems from his 2013 film  The Wolf of Wall Street,  which investigators allege was financed through Hollywood production company Red Granite with $100 million diverted from the 1MDB fund.

The hints in Draghi's speech to a major central bank conference in Portugal convinced investors that ECB policymakers are ready to start to withdraw the emergency stimulus for the economy that has dominated policy-making for almost a decade. That provoked the banking world's single biggest cheerleaders for a stronger dollar, Deutsche Bank, to abandon calls for a stronger greenback and instead call the end to a dollar rally dating back to 2014.  Our main message is that the EUR is likely to be the key vehicle via which financial conditions in the Euro-area will be tightened,  Deutsche analyst George Saravelos said in a note to clients on Wednesday.  We now see the risks as shifting towards an attempted break-out of the euro’s multi-year 1.05-1.15 range to the topside.  Saravelos, who at the height of the dollar's rally called for the euro to fall to $0.85 by the end of this year, raised his end of year forecast from $1.03 to $1.16. In Asian and early European trade, the euro rose another 0.7 percent, adding to a 1.4 percent daily gain on Tuesday. It traded half a percent higher on the day at $1.1365 by 1100 GMT. The dollar also dipped a third of a percent to 112.12 yen. The latest failure of Republicans to pass healthcare legislation in the United States was also playing in to the dollar's weakness, further undermining faith in President Donald Trump's promises of other measures to support growth. Eyes were again fixed on the central banking conference in Sintra, Portugal, with several ECB officials speaking, along with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and the Bank of England's Mark Carney. The Canadian dollar, among the most volatile of the G10 group of developed world currencies this year, gained almost 1 percent against its U.S. counterpart in morning trade in Europe. Poloz and deputy Carolyn Wilkins set the stage for hikes sooner than had been anticipated in appearances two weeks ago, although a dip in inflation since has cooled expectations of a move as early as July.  Has the BoC rate assessment gotten ahead of itself? We’ll perhaps find out today,  said Saxo Bank analyst John Hardy.  A small minority are looking for a rate hike already.  The dollar's weakness pushed sterling, again under pressure from Britain's recently volatile politics, above $1.28 to its highest since Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority on June 8. Conversely, it hit its weakest since November at 88.79 pence per euro.  No matter the subtlety of any shift in guidance (by Draghi), the reaction in a yield-sensitive market is generally binary and we may well have to add currency appreciation to the risks facing ECB policy,  said Bank of New York Mellon strategist Neil Mellor.  Euro bulls may now feel that they have the perfect opportunity to challenge the post-2015 trading range whose ceiling is a couple of big figures north of spot.

The worldwide attack has disrupted computers at Russia's biggest oil company, Ukrainian banks and multinational firms with a virus similar to the ransomware that infected more than 300,000 computers last month.  The attack hit BNP's Real Estate subsidiary, a BNP Paribas spokeswoman told Reuters, after a person familiar with the matter had said that some staff computers were blocked on Tuesday due to the incident.  The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  she said. BNP Paribas Real Estate provides advisory, property and investment management and development services mostly in Europe. It employed 3,472 staff at end of last year, with operations in 16 countries, and had 24 billion euros ($27.26 billion) in assets under management. Many of the companies affected globally by the cyber attack had links to Ukraine although there is no indication that this was the case for BNP. It owns a bank in the country, UkrSibbank.  France's financial sector regulator ACPR remained vigilant but there were no alerts concerning banks it supervises, it said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Earlier this year following a similar attack, many banks in Europe said they had stepped up efforts to shield themselves. BNP Paribas set up a dedicated department in 2015 called Information Security and Information Systems and launched a  transformation program  to upgrade its security systems. Authorities including the European Central Bank have also checked their technology systems in recent years. Among BNP's peers, France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) told Reuters on Tuesday it was not affected by the attack. Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) and BPCE both declined to comment. Banks generally have more robust cyber defenses than other sectors, because of the sensitive nature of their industry. But ageing technology and banks' attractiveness to hackers means they are often targets. Prudence France's ANSSI cyber security agency urged caution on Wednesday about speculation on the identity and number of victims of the attack in France. Reverberations from the attack continued on Wednesday with shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, telling Reuters it is unable to process new orders after being hit by the cyber attack.  Among other French companies, retailer Auchan [AUCH.UL] said Tuesday's cyber attack had hit terminal payments in its stores in Ukraine but the incident was now over. [nP6N1JF044] French construction and building materials group St Gobain (SGOB.PA) said its systems were gradually returning to normal after the company fell victim to the cyber attack on Tuesday. [nP6N1JF045] The ransomware virus includes code known as  Eternal Blue , which cyber security experts widely believe was stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. If one computer in a network is infected, the virus can spread rapidly. The virus crippled computers running Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows by encrypting hard drives and overwriting files, then demanded $300 in bitcoin payments to restore access.

The three, Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing of Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) and Lawi Weng, a senior reporter with the Irrawaddy magazine, were taken into military custody in Shan State in northeast Myanmar on Monday. They had covered the burning of some drugs by the rebel Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), which demands more autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic group and has been engaged in clashes with government troops over the past week. Deputy police inspector Kyaw Min said the three reporters, along with three other men detained at the same time, had been brought to police in Hsipaw town, where they would be imprisoned. “Today, in the afternoon, the military opened the case under Article 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act,  said Kyaw Min. The legal article, which prohibits giving assistance to banned groups, carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.  We will have to propose the case at the court and will detain them at Hsipaw prison,  he added. Despite the end of full military rule, and the election in 2015 of a government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi, concern in Myanmar is growing about press freedom, and about the challenge Suu Kyi faces in achieving peace. Clashes between government troops and loosely allied rebel groups close to Myanmar's border with China have set back peace talks prioritized by Suu Kyi when she took power last year. The DVB and the Irrawaddy, which operate in English and Burmese, were formed in exile during military rule but have both set up bureaus in the city of Yangon since pre-publication censorship was officially abolished in 2012. Domestic media advocacy groups and international watchdogs, including Amnesty International, raised concern about the reporters. 'Affront to Democracy' Lawyer Nyan Win, a senior member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, raised concerns about due process, although he said he was not sure of the full details of the case.  There's no provision for detaining anybody secretly -there's no clause in the law. And there's no arresting power for the military,  he told Reuters when asked about the journalists' detention. The Myanmar Press Council has written to the Ministry of Defense calling for their release, according to a defense official. The official declined to elaborate. The Committee to Protect Journalists said the three should be released and allowed to carry on with their work.  Using the archaic Unlawful Associations Act to incarcerate journalists is an affront to democracy in Myanmar,  the group's Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler said in a statement. Though she is de facto government leader, Suu Kyi does not have oversight over the armed forces. But she has not used her party's parliamentary majority to repeal many of the laws used by previous regimes to stifle dissent. Nyan Win said the NLD was reviewing such legislation. Journalists demonstrated in Yangon this month against what they said were increasing curbs on free speech, especially the use of a telecommunications law to prosecute reporters and social media users for defamation. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the army - known as the Tatmadaw - had clashed five times with insurgents since the army discovered a TNLA training camp on June 20.  Several Tatmadaw officers and troops were killed and a few were wounded. Four bodies of enemy troops were also found,  the newspaper said, citing military officials. The clashes took place while the three journalists were in the TNLA zone for the drug-burning. Two community groups in the area said on Tuesday they had documented extrajudicial killings, mass detention of civilians and torture by the military in recent days. They also said the military killed two villagers and wounded one in attack on Monday.  The Global New Light of Myanmar said rebels were responsible for the attack Military spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. The army almost always rejects accusations of rights abuses although it has in recent years acknowledged occasional violations by soldiers and promised action.

The sanctions were imposed in July 2014 following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula and Moscow's direct support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Moscow denies direct involvement in the conflict despite NATO's assertions its troops are supporting the rebels. EU leaders agreed to the extension at their summit in Brussels last week, after France and Germany cited no progress in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014. Under the sanctions that were imposed in tandem with the United States, European companies are banned from doing business with or investing in Russia's defense and energy industries, while financial ties are severely limited.  European companies cannot borrow or lend money to Russia's five main state-owned banks for more than 30 days, limiting Moscow's avenues for raising funds. Along with restrictions on business with Russia's top energy companies, exports of some energy-related equipment and technology to Russia must also be approved by EU governments. Any lifting of sanctions on Russia is tied to the implementation of the Minsk peace deal for Ukraine which was negotiated by the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia in 2015.

Although the Christian-majority Philippines has endured bouts of insurrection by Muslim groups for centuries, the two communities mostly live together peacefully. Now, many Muslims say, the vicious urban battle with government forces for control of Marawi may intensify the divide. Civilians who have fled the fighting say the militants spread rumors on social media and by word of mouth that Christian soldiers were committing excesses against the largely Muslim population, and urged locals to take up arms.  They are using the discrimination, neglect and social injustices against us, the minority, to sow hate and anger,  said Musa Diamla, a member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a rebel group that has signed a ceasefire with the government. Nearly 400 people have been killed in the month-long battle in Marawi, which is on the Philippines' southernmost island, Mindanao, which is roughly the size of South Korea and where more than 20 percent of the population are Muslims.  Islam has even older roots in the Philippines than Christianity. When Spanish colonialists landed in the country in the mid-16th century and pushed Muslims to the south, they called them Moros, from the Spanish word for Moors.  For hundreds of years, the Moro people resisted Manila's rule and the term 'Bangsamoro' - meaning 'nation of Moros' - was coined in the second half of the 20th century as many sought and fought for independence, or at least autonomy.  Multiple peace pacts with Moro groups have since collapsed or run into delays, consigning Mindanao to economic neglect and poverty, and fuelling a culture of insurgency and banditry.  Reforms have not taken root in the south due to conflict driven by the Moro struggle for self determination,  said Julkipli Wadi, former dean of the Institute of Islamic Studies at Manila's University of the Philippines.  As the peace process dragged on indefinitely, this created frustration for the Moro youth and this is the reason they are prone to embrace radical ideology,  he said. Harmony, but Discrimination The Philippines' constitution provides for the free exercise of religious profession and worship, and the country does not rank among those most often criticized by Western governments and rights groups for violations of religious freedom. In Quiapo, a teeming and rundown district of the capital, Manila, Christians and Muslims live peacefully alongside each other, worshipping at an ancient church and an imposing mosque that are just a few blocks apart.  We live in harmony,  said Rohaina Babar, a 40-year-old Muslim woman who sells clothes from one of Quiapo's many street stalls that offer everything from headscarves to pirated DVDs. Based on 2010 census data, 94 percent of the Philippines' Muslim population of over 5 million live on Mindanao, but more than 100,000 are in Manila, many of them Moros who left the south to escape poverty and violence. Some Muslims in Quiapo worry that the bonhomie of different faiths could be at risk as the death toll among troops fighting in Marawi, now at 70, climbs. Anxious to nip religious tensions in the bud, the military appealed to the public this month not to share video images of the militants destroying religious statues and pulling down a cross inside a church. Babar said that comments she reads on social media and in the news were becoming increasingly anti-Muslim.       It's like they equate Muslims with terrorists,  she said.  A Generation of Disgruntled Muslims  Despite the appearance of equality and tolerance in Quiapo, however, Muslim leaders say discrimination against people of their faith is ingrained in the Philippines. Paisalin Tago, a commissioner at the National Commission on Muslim Filipino, an agency under the office of the president, said Muslims are under-represented in senior government and military positions. In elections last year, only 11 Muslims were voted to the 292-member House of Representatives, low compared to the community's 5-6 percent portion of the 100 million population.  In some agencies, if they find out you are Muslim, they won't accept you although you are qualified for the position,   said Tago, a Muslim, noting his agency is flooded with job applications from Muslims who cannot find work in other government offices. Jesus Dureza, the presidential adviser on the peace process in Mindanao, said he could not comment since he had  no specific information on those complaints . He acknowledged that Muslims had some reason to be aggrieved  but said there is a peace and development roadmap for the region that will address historical injustices.  Historical Injustice  In Mindanao, the sense of injustice is felt more keenly. Former rebel Diamla said Moro people used to be the majority in Mindanao, but over the past half century Christians have migrated from the north and grabbed much of their land.  Historical social injustice is being used as a platform by extremists to recruit and fan anger,  said Zia Alonto-Adiong, a local politician in Lanao del Sur region, which includes Marawi. Abdulgani Ali, who owns shops in Marawi and nearby Iligan City, said there is less resentment of Christian neighbors than there is of the government for neglecting Muslim livelihoods.  Where are the schools, roads and development projects?  he said.  They are all in non-Muslim areas and that's why we still have a low literacy rate and higher poverty incidence.  Official statistics show that 48.2 percent of families in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, which includes Marawi, were below the poverty line in 2015 compared with a national average of 16.5 percent. The poverty line is defined at $180 per month for a family of five.  The region's secondary-school enrolment rate and its literacy rate are the lowest in the country.  President Rodrigo Duterte, who was for many years the mayor of Mindanao's biggest city, Davao, pledged last year to devolve power from  imperial Manila  to long-neglected provinces. But Zia said Duterte's plan for a federal system has only delayed progress towards peace with Moro insurgents, encouraging the emergence of  a generation of disgruntled young Muslims .

The sanctions were imposed in July 2014 following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula and Moscow's direct support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Moscow denies direct involvement in the conflict despite NATO's assertions its troops are supporting the rebels. EU leaders agreed to the extension at their summit in Brussels last week, after France and Germany cited no progress in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014. Under the sanctions that were imposed in tandem with the United States, European companies are banned from doing business with or investing in Russia's defense and energy industries, while financial ties are severely limited.  European companies cannot borrow or lend money to Russia's five main state-owned banks for more than 30 days, limiting Moscow's avenues for raising funds. Along with restrictions on business with Russia's top energy companies, exports of some energy-related equipment and technology to Russia must also be approved by EU governments. Any lifting of sanctions on Russia is tied to the implementation of the Minsk peace deal for Ukraine which was negotiated by the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia in 2015.

The bank was forced to issue billions of new shares after three rounds of recapitalisation in recent years to boost its equity capital. But with the share price trading in cents, transactions on electronic platforms were becoming cumbersome, bank executives said. Piraeus shares were down 2.4 percent at 0.2070 euros on Wednesday, underperforming the Athens bourse's banking index which was losing 0.12 percent. Shareholders approved a one-for-20 reverse split that will reduce the bank's 8.73 billion outstanding shares to 466.6 million. The new par value will therefore increase from 0.3 euros to 6.0 euros.  The move aims to facilitate the trading of the shares on electronic platforms and improve the stock's marketability and liquidity,  Chief Executive Christos Megalou told shareholders. Piraeus, which is 26.2 percent owned by Greece's bank rescue fund HFSF, plans to slim down by selling wholly-owned subsidiaries in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Albania and the Ukraine as part of its  Agenda 2020  plan to reduce its foreign exposures. Megalou said the group will aim to increase lending to 5.0 billion euros annually by 2020 from 2.0 billion euros last year and improve its asset quality, which remains  the biggest challenge facing all Greek banks .

The riyal has been increasingly volatile in the spot market since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism. Some banks are quoting huge bid-ask spreads, there are big jumps in quoted rates within the space of a few minutes, some customers find it difficult to fill orders because of poor liquidity, and there's continual uncertainty about which banks are still willing to trade riyal and in what volumes. At times, the riyal has been quoted by Qatari banks very near its peg of 3.64 to the dollar; at other times, foreign banks have quoted it much lower. This week it traded between banks as low as 3.81, more than 4 percent below its peg - the lowest level this decade. Normally, such a gap would suggest the central bank was abandoning the peg and allowing its currency to depreciate but this time the riyal's drop is due to the way the diplomatic crisis has fragmented the foreign exchange market. Many Gulf banks have suspended or reduced ties with Qatar, causing funds in the market to flow more slowly and inefficiently between onshore and offshore banks. This has opened a chasm between onshore trade, where the Qatari central bank has continued to provide ample supplies of dollars at a rate of up to 3.6415 under its peg mechanism, and offshore trade, where jittery foreign banks are demanding a premium for buying riyals, pushing the currency lower. “There’s definitely an arbitrage between offshore and onshore rates because of the uncertainty, and traders are taking advantage of the volatility,” said a senior treasury official at a bank in Abu Dhabi. But the official, who like others in the region declined to be named because of political sensitivities, said there was no reason to think Qatar would need to take the risky and destabilising step of abandoning its peg.  Qatar Central Bank will definitely defend the peg... It makes no sense for Qatar to de-peg. It won’t happen from an economic point of view. If it de-pegs at all, that would be due to political reasons.  The riyal's lowest levels were hit early this week when all Gulf Arab financial markets were closed for the Eid al-Fitr holidays, leaving offshore banks in Europe and New York to trade without reference to business in the Gulf. On Wednesday morning, when the UAE and Bahrain reopened after the holidays, an Abu Dhabi bank quoted the riyal only slightly below the peg at 3.6550. Qatar itself will remain on holiday throughout this week and reopen next Sunday. Central Bank Qatar's central bank had net foreign reserves of $34.8 billion (27.16 billion pounds) in May and Doha is estimated to have over $200 billion of liquid assets in its sovereign wealth fund - enough to defend the peg for years, even if there is a mass withdrawal of foreign bank deposits from Qatar, analysts calculate. That raises the question of why the central bank has not intervened aggressively by flooding the market with dollars to keep riyal spot rates consistently in line with the peg and deter offshore speculation. Ehsan Khoman, regional strategist at Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ, said such action was possible if the gap between onshore and offshore rates continued to widen.  It would not be unprecedented if the Qatar Central Bank intervenes in some form in the offshore market to inject USD liquidity, which would narrow the divergence somewhat precipitously.  Several commercial bankers in the region, however, said they thought the central bank simply saw no need to spend part of its reserves getting drawn into a battle with offshore banks. Forwards market prices show that expectations for long-term riyal depreciation are minor and not enough to trigger major capital flight from Qatar. The country gets most of its dollar supplies from oil and gas exports, which are controlled by the government, so it does not need to fear offshore trade will suck dollars away from onshore companies which need them. In this situation, the central bank may see no harm in an offshore weakening of the riyal, especially if it means foreign banks considering whether to sell their riyal assets would face an exchange loss in doing so, the bankers said. In his only public statement since the diplomatic crisis erupted, central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani said Doha had enough foreign currency reserves to meet all its requirements, but did not explicitly mention the peg. The central bank has privately told Qatari banks, however, that it is committed to the peg, a Qatari commercial banker told Reuters.  The message was that those hedge funds and other international investors who bet against the peg will lose their money.

The move extends CME's global reach in grain markets, after its launch last year of a European Union wheat contract, and also marks a push to cater for derivative deals not traded on exchanges. The Australian futures will launch on July 24, pending regulatory approval, as a cash-settled contract without physical delivery, priced in relation to Platts' daily assessment of Australian Premium White (APW) wheat, CME said.  Australia is very important for wheat, one of the top 5 exporting nations in world, and this contract really completes our suite of wheat contracts,  Nelson Low, CME's executive director, agricultural products, told Reuters. The product, which will be priced in U.S. dollars and traded in 50 tonne lots, will be available both on CME's Globex exchange and for over-the-counter (OTC) deals cleared through its ClearPort system.  We expect that most of the trades will be executed on an OTC basis and then submitted to ClearPort for clearing,  Low said. A cash-settled contract would probably appeal to a wider range of participants than a physically delivered one, he said, adding that CME had no plans to develop physical delivery for wheat in Australia. CME's Australian contract will offer a rolling one-year trading horizon with 12 consecutive months available, starting with July 2017, Low said. CME will compete with ASX Ltd, which runs eastern and western Australian wheat futures. The Australian contract adds to CME's U.S. soft red winter and hard red winter wheat futures, its French-based EU wheat contract and its Black Sea wheat futures. The Black Sea region, which includes the world's biggest wheat exporter Russia, has increasingly attracted interest for developing price references. Euronext, whose France-based contract acts as the benchmark for the western European market, is looking at Black Sea derivatives. Platts, part of S&P; Global Inc, has in the past year launched a price assessment for Black Sea wheat to cater for OTC trades.

Jain is one of millions of small business owners who face wrenching change from India's biggest tax reform since independence that will unify the country's $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a common market. But he is simply not ready for a regime that from July 1 will for the first time tax the bed linen his 10 workers make, and require him to file his taxes every month online. On the desk in his tiny office in Meerut, two hours drive northeast of New Delhi, lay two calculators. Turning to open a metal cabinet, he pulled out a hand-written ledger to show how he keeps his books.  We will have to hire an accountant - and get a computer,  the thickset 52-year-old told Reuters, as a dozen ancient power looms clattered away in the ramshackle workshop next door. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that by replacing several federal and state taxes, the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) will make life simpler for business. To drive home the point, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan has appeared in a promotional video in which he weaves a cat's cradle between the fingers of his hands - symbolizing India's thicket of old taxes. With a flourish, the tangle is gone and Bachchan proclaims:  One nation, one tax, one market!  (bit.ly/2sch8ou) Not So Simple By tearing down barriers between India's 29 states, the GST should deliver efficiency gains to larger businesses. HSBC estimates the reform could add 0.4 percent to economic growth. Yet at the local chapter of the Indian Industries Association, which groups 6,500 smaller enterprises nationwide, the talk is about how to cope in the aftermath of the GST rollout.  In the initial months, there may be utter confusion,  said chairman Ashok Malhotra, who runs one firm that manufactures voltage stabilisers and a second that makes timing equipment for boxing contests. A big concern is the Indian GST's sheer complexity - with rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent, and myriad exceptions, it contrasts with simpler, flatter and broader sales taxes in other countries. The official schedule of GST rates runs to 213 pages and has undergone repeated last-minute changes.  Rubber goods are taxed at 12 percent; sporting goods at 18 percent. I make rubber sporting goods – so what tax am I supposed to pay?  asks Anurag Agarwal, the local IIA secretary. Cloth merchants and workers shout slogans as they carry an effigy depicting Goods and Services Tax (GST) in a market area during a protest rally against implementation of GST on textiles in Kolkata, India, June 28, 2017.Rupak De ChowdhuriGrace Period? The top government official responsible for coordinating the GST rollout rebuts complaints from bosses that the tax is too complex, adding that the IT back-end that will drive it - crunching up to 5 billion invoices a month - is robust.  It is a technological marvel, as well as a fiscal marvel,  Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia told Reuters in an interview. The government will, however, allow firms to file simplified returns for July and August. From September they must file a total of 37 online returns annually - three each month and one at the year's end - for each state they operate in. One particular concern is how a new feature of the GST, the input tax credit, will work. This allows a company to claim refunds on its inputs and means it should only pay tax on the value it adds. Slideshow (11 Images)The structure will encourage companies to buy from suppliers that are GST-compliant, so that tax credits can flow down a supply chain. That spells bad news for small firms hesitating to shift into the formal economy. The government estimates smaller companies account for 45 percent of manufacturing and employ more than 117 million people. Adhia played down the risk of job losses, however, saying this would be offset by new service sector jobs. Demonetisation 2.0 The prospect of disruption is drawing comparisons with Modi's decision last November to scrap high-value bank notes that made up 86 percent of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge illicit  black money  from the system. The note ban caused severe disruption to India's cash-driven economy and slammed the brakes on growth, which slowed to a two-year low in the quarter to March.  It could throw the business out of gear - it can affect your volumes by at least 30 percent,  said the head of one large cement company in the Delhi region. Back in Meerut, Pankaj Jain worries that hiring an accountant and charging 5 percent GST on his bedsheets could eat up to two-thirds of his annual profits of 400,000-500,000 rupees ($6,210-$7,760).  I know my costs will go up, but I don't know about my income,  he said.  I might even have to shut up shop completely and go into trading.

The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by work there.  The latest cap, announced in May, would lower production to 21.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year from October. It was 53.9 bcm in 2013. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture, known as NAM, said it had been left in an impossible position by being told it could continue production - vital to supply homes with gas - but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.  NAM cited one paragraph of the government's May production decision in particular as troubling:  There is no model that can predict at which level of production the seismic risks align with the safety norms.   We need to know the rules of the game,  NAM director Gerald Schotman told reporters.  Models based on independent research have been shoved aside.    Schotman said last year's production plan used estimates of scenarios put together by a panel of scientists and then subjected to independent review by peers - the way the Dutch government determines acceptable levels of risk in other areas, such as the safety of its dikes and flood defenses. NAM's appeal will be heard starting July 13 at the Council of State, along with appeals by environmentalists who think the latest cap did not go far enough.

Yields have risen sharply since ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door on Tuesday to tweaks in the bank's aggressive monetary stimulus policy, with short-dated German yields hitting a one-year high. The sell-off was even more pronounced in longer-dated bonds as investors started to price in a higher path for price growth. Germany's 10-year yield has nearly doubled in two days. It jumped 10 basis points from 0.24 percent to 0.34 percent on Tuesday to strike a one-month high, and then a further 6 bps on Wednesday to 0.40 percent. Draghi stressed on Tuesday that any change in the bank's stance, which includes sub-zero rates and a massive quantitative easing (QE) bond-buying scheme, should be gradual as  considerable  support was still needed and the inflation rebound would also depend on favourable global financing conditions. But the tone of his speech, which for some analysts appeared to jar with a cautious posture at the central bank's meeting earlier this month, has led to a reassessment of how soon the ECB may start to withdraw its support.  Mario Draghi did the number one thing that he wanted to avoid, market disruption. Are we looking at Europe's taper tantrum?,  Cantor Fitzgerald strategist Ryan McGrath said, referring to the sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields after the U.S. central bank hinted at reducing QE in 2013.  The hawkish remarks were well tempered... However, investors choose not to see them... Draghi started prepping the market for the next substantial instalment of forward guidance (that we are expecting in September) where QE tapering will be announced.  Draghi's comments coincided with a government report in Germany - the harshest critic of the ECB's easy stance - which showed that low interest rates posed the biggest threat to the country's financial system. Other benchmark 10-year bond yields in the euro zone rose to multi-week highs, the euro hit a one-year high against the U.S. dollar, and a key market gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the bloc hit a three-week high. In another sign that inflation bets were building, Germany's yield curve -- the gap between short- and long-dated borrowing costs -- was its steepest in around two weeks. The sharp move in Europe spilled over to the United States, even though a delay to a U.S. healthcare reform bill was further evidence of the difficulties President Donald Trump may face pushing through his growth-boosting spending plans. U.S two-year yields hit a 3-1/2-month high on Wednesday with 10-year yields at a one-month peak.

At times, the riyal has been quoted by Qatari banks very near its peg of 3.64 to the dollar; at other times, foreign banks have quoted it much lower. This week it traded between banks as low as 3.81, more than 4 percent below its peg - the lowest level this decade. Normally, such a gap would suggest the central bank was abandoning the peg and allowing its currency to depreciate but this time the riyal's drop is due to the way the diplomatic crisis has fragmented the foreign exchange market. Many Gulf banks have suspended or reduced ties with Qatar, causing funds in the market to flow more slowly and inefficiently between onshore and offshore banks. This has opened a chasm between onshore trade, where the Qatari central bank has continued to provide ample supplies of dollars at a rate of up to 3.6415 under its peg mechanism, and offshore trade, where jittery foreign banks are demanding a premium for buying riyals, pushing the currency lower. “There’s definitely an arbitrage between offshore and onshore rates because of the uncertainty, and traders are taking advantage of the volatility,” said a senior treasury official at a bank in Abu Dhabi. But the official, who like others in the region declined to be named because of political sensitivities, said there was no reason to think Qatar would need to take the risky and destabilising step of abandoning its peg.  Qatar Central Bank will definitely defend the peg... It makes no sense for Qatar to de-peg. It won’t happen from an economic point of view. If it de-pegs at all, that would be due to political reasons.  The riyal's lowest levels were hit early this week when all Gulf Arab financial markets were closed for the Eid al-Fitr holidays, leaving offshore banks in Europe and New York to trade without reference to business in the Gulf. On Wednesday morning, when the UAE and Bahrain reopened after the holidays, an Abu Dhabi bank quoted the riyal only slightly below the peg at 3.6550. Qatar itself will remain on holiday throughout this week and reopen next Sunday. Central Bank Qatar's central bank had net foreign reserves of $34.8 billion (27.16 billion pounds) in May and Doha is estimated to have over $200 billion of liquid assets in its sovereign wealth fund - enough to defend the peg for years, even if there is a mass withdrawal of foreign bank deposits from Qatar, analysts calculate. That raises the question of why the central bank has not intervened aggressively by flooding the market with dollars to keep riyal spot rates consistently in line with the peg and deter offshore speculation. Ehsan Khoman, regional strategist at Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ, said such action was possible if the gap between onshore and offshore rates continued to widen.  It would not be unprecedented if the Qatar Central Bank intervenes in some form in the offshore market to inject USD liquidity, which would narrow the divergence somewhat precipitously.  Several commercial bankers in the region, however, said they thought the central bank simply saw no need to spend part of its reserves getting drawn into a battle with offshore banks. Forwards market prices show that expectations for long-term riyal depreciation are minor and not enough to trigger major capital flight from Qatar. The country gets most of its dollar supplies from oil and gas exports, which are controlled by the government, so it does not need to fear offshore trade will suck dollars away from onshore companies which need them. In this situation, the central bank may see no harm in an offshore weakening of the riyal, especially if it means foreign banks considering whether to sell their riyal assets would face an exchange loss in doing so, the bankers said. In his only public statement since the diplomatic crisis erupted, central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani said Doha had enough foreign currency reserves to meet all its requirements, but did not explicitly mention the peg. The central bank has privately told Qatari banks, however, that it is committed to the peg, a Qatari commercial banker told Reuters.  The message was that those hedge funds and other international investors who bet against the peg will lose their money.

The worldwide attack has disrupted computers at Russia's biggest oil company, Ukrainian banks and multinational firms with a virus similar to the ransomware that infected more than 300,000 computers last month.  The attack hit BNP's Real Estate subsidiary, a BNP Paribas spokeswoman told Reuters, after a person familiar with the matter had said that some staff computers were blocked on Tuesday due to the incident.  The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  she said. BNP Paribas Real Estate provides advisory, property and investment management and development services mostly in Europe. It employed 3,472 staff at end of last year, with operations in 16 countries, and had 24 billion euros ($27.26 billion) in assets under management. Many of the companies affected globally by the cyber attack had links to Ukraine although there is no indication that this was the case for BNP. It owns a bank in the country, UkrSibbank.  France's financial sector regulator ACPR remained vigilant but there were no alerts concerning banks it supervises, it said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Earlier this year following a similar attack, many banks in Europe said they had stepped up efforts to shield themselves. BNP Paribas set up a dedicated department in 2015 called Information Security and Information Systems and launched a  transformation program  to upgrade its security systems. Authorities including the European Central Bank have also checked their technology systems in recent years. Among BNP's peers, France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) told Reuters on Tuesday it was not affected by the attack. Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) and BPCE both declined to comment. Banks generally have more robust cyber defenses than other sectors, because of the sensitive nature of their industry. But ageing technology and banks' attractiveness to hackers means they are often targets. Prudence France's ANSSI cyber security agency urged caution on Wednesday about speculation on the identity and number of victims of the attack in France. Reverberations from the attack continued on Wednesday with shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, telling Reuters it is unable to process new orders after being hit by the cyber attack.  Among other French companies, retailer Auchan [AUCH.UL] said Tuesday's cyber attack had hit terminal payments in its stores in Ukraine but the incident was now over. [nP6N1JF044] French construction and building materials group St Gobain (SGOB.PA) said its systems were gradually returning to normal after the company fell victim to the cyber attack on Tuesday. [nP6N1JF045] The ransomware virus includes code known as  Eternal Blue , which cyber security experts widely believe was stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. If one computer in a network is infected, the virus can spread rapidly. The virus crippled computers running Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows by encrypting hard drives and overwriting files, then demanded $300 in bitcoin payments to restore access.

It said Turkish warplanes separately struck Kurdish militants in northern Iraq on Wednesday, killing seven fighters from the PKK group which Ankara says is closely linked to the YPG. The strikes came after Turkey's defense minister warned that Ankara would retaliate against any threatening moves by the YPG and after reports that Turkey was reinforcing its military presence in northern Syria. The United States supports the YPG in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, while NATO ally Turkey regards them as terrorists indistinguishable from militants from the outlawed PKK which is carrying out an insurgency in southeast Turkey. Turkey's army said YPG machine-gun fire on Tuesday evening targeted Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army elements in the Maranaz area south of the town of Azaz in northern Syria.  Fire support vehicles in the region were used to retaliate in kind against the harassing fire and the identified targets were destroyed/neutralised,  the military statement said. The boom of artillery fire could be heard overnight from the Turkish border town of Kilis, broadcaster Haberturk said. It was not clear whether there were casualties in the exchange of fire. Ankara was angered by a U.S. decision in June to arm the YPG in the battle for Islamic State's Raqqa stronghold. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that nations which promised to get back weapons from the YPG once Islamic State were defeated were trying to trick Turkey.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday left open the possibility of longer-term assistance to the YPG, saying the U.S. may need to supply them weapons and equipment even after the capture of Raqqa. Ankara considers the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The PKK has carried out an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and more than 40,000 people, most of them Kurds, have died in the fighting. Turkish warplanes on Wednesday morning destroyed PKK shelters and gun positions during air strikes in the Avasin-Basyan area of northern Iraq, killing seven militants planning an attack on Turkish border outposts, an army statement said. Faced with turmoil across its southern border, Turkey last year sent troops into Syria to support Free Syrian Army rebels fighting both Islamic State and Kurdish forces who control a large part of Syria's northern border region. Erdogan has said Turkey would not flinch from taking tougher action against the YPG in Syria if Turkey believed it needed to.

The latest cap, announced in May, would lower production to 21.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year from October. It was 53.9 bcm in 2013. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture, known as NAM, said it had been left in an impossible position by being told it could continue production - vital to supply homes with gas - but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.

We need to know the rules of the game,  NAM director Gerald Schotman told reporters.  Models based on independent research have been shoved aside.    Schotman said last year's production plan used estimates of scenarios put together by a panel of scientists and then subjected to independent review by peers - the way the Dutch government determines acceptable levels of risk in other areas, such as the safety of its dikes and flood defenses.

A prolonged cut would threaten critical supplies of fuel and force North Korea to find alternatives to its main supplier of diesel and gasoline, as scrutiny of China's close commercial ties with its increasingly isolated neighbour intensifies.     CNPC and the Ministry of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment. North Korea's embassy in Beijing declined to comment.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the sale suspension and whether the Chinese government put pressure on CNPC to make this decision, said:  I do not understand this situation you are talking about  and declined to elaborate. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said CNPC decided to put fuel sales on hold  over the last month or two  and described it as a  commercial decision .   It's no longer worth the risks,  said the source. Chinese and international banks are stepping up compliance checks on companies dealing with countries on the U.S. sanctions list, such as North Korea, he said. The North Korean agents who mostly buy the diesel and gasoline have been unable recently to pay for the supplies -- CNPC normally requires upfront payments, the source said.   Reuters was unable to determine if the agents have started facing credit problems with Chinese and international banks worried about sanctions compliance issues. Two other sources briefed about CNPC's decision confirmed the suspension of diesel sales, but did not know directly about the gasoline move. The three people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter and are not authorised to speak to the media.      Prices Surge in North        Last year, China shipped just over 96,000 tonnes of gasoline and almost 45,000 tonnes of diesel worth a combined $64 million to North Korea, where it is used across the economy from fishermen and farmers to truckers and the military.[O/CHINA4]        FILE PHOTO: PetroChina's logo is seen at its petrol station in Beijing, China, March 21, 2016. Picture taken March 21, 2016.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoMost of that was sold by CNPC, which has grown over the past two decades to dominate China's energy trade with Pyongyang.  Data for May released on Friday showed China supplied significantly lower volumes of diesel and gasoline compared with a month earlier, although monthly tonnages can vary widely. June data will be released in late July.     Fuel prices in North Korea, meanwhile, have sharply risen in recent months, suggesting a tightening in supply. A Reuters analysis of data collected by Daily NK showed the price of gasoline sold by private dealers in Pyongyang and the northern border cities of Sinuiju and Hyesan had hit $1.46 per kg on June 21, up almost 50 percent from April 21. Until then, they had remained relatively stable since late last year. Diesel prices averaged $1.20 per kg as of June 21, more than double over the same period, according to Daily NK, a website run by defectors who collect prices via phone calls with North Korean fuel traders.     u.s Scrutiny North Korea's unprecedented pace of nuclear and ballistic missile tests has prompted China, which handles 90 percent of North Korea's trade, to start squeezing Pyongyang.  In February, Beijing suspended coal purchases until the end of the year, cutting off North Korea's main export revenue source. In 2016, North Korea sold 22.5 million tonnes of coal to China, worth about $1.9 billion, according to Chinese customs. The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea, but Beijing has said its influence on North Korea is limited and it is doing all it can. President Donald Trump, frustrated over Beijing's inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues, is now considering possible trade actions against China, three senior administration officials told Reuters on Tuesday. The sources in China saw no sign yet that Beijing is cutting crude oil to Pyongyang. China has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it supplies via an aging pipeline about 520,000 tonnes of crude a year to North Korea, worth about $170 million at current market prices.  North Korea imports all its oil needs, mostly from China and a much smaller amount from Russia.  Reporting by Chen Aizhu in BEIJING; additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; in SEOUL, Lusha Zhang and Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Editing by Josephine Mason and Bill Tarrant","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-northkorea-oil-exclusive-idUSKBN19J04M"},

Water supplies across the port city of Chennai have dropped by half, with the government saying tap water may dwindle to a trickle in the days to come.  We are supplying between 450 to 470 million liters of water every day,  compared to the normal requirement of 830 million liters, said Arun Roy, of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewage Board that supplies water across the city.  Many residents have switched to their private borewells to meet their requirements, and we are also using water tankers to regulate supply.  Water from lakes and reservoirs around the city largely meet the needs of the city and its suburbs, home to more than 8 million people. Veeranam lake in neighboring Cuddalore district - one of Chennai's main water sources - is almost dry after the failure of the 2016 monsoons. Depleted groundwater sources and other dried up lakes within 60 km of Chennai - including Pulicat, Puzhal, Sholavaram, Kaliveli and Maduranthakam - have left the city parched. Domestic worker Maheshwari Karunakaran is allowed to fill only 20 pots of water every two days to meet the needs of her four-member household. Karunakaran uses this water to drink, cook, bathe, wash utensils and clothes.  There is a fight every time the water supply is released to the hand pump below my block of apartments,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that she often had to leave work early to queue up for water.  Everybody needs more water. We are forced to buy additional water for anywhere between two to five Indian rupees(less than $1) per pot.  In many areas, piped water is being supplied only once every three to four days. The water costs for most Chennai residents have gone up by 50 percent, while more people are depending on private water tankers and personal borewells for their everyday needs. Officials say the number of calls to their helpline have increased with many people asking for water tankers. The government has 7,000 tankers in operation in the city. Chennai also gets water from government-run desalination plants, which are now working around the clock, raising concerns about technical glitches.  This crisis was expected considering that the last monsoons had failed,  said Sekhar Raghavan of Rain Centre, a nonprofit that promotes rainwater harvesting in the city.  But the shocker is that there has been no planning to deal with it. De-silting of lakes and reservoirs, efforts to ensure recharge of groundwater have all been missing.  According to Roy, the government started putting measures into place as early as January.  Industries and bulk users were forewarned, and our engineers have been engaging with resident welfare associations to create awareness on the situation,  he said.  We are hoping we will get some rains in July that will help recharge some of the groundwater, failing which, the next few months will be tough.  Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Alisa Tang.

Water supplies across the port city of Chennai have dropped by half, with the government saying tap water may dwindle to a trickle in the days to come.  We are supplying between 450 to 470 million liters of water every day,  compared to the normal requirement of 830 million liters, said Arun Roy, of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewage Board that supplies water across the city.  Many residents have switched to their private borewells to meet their requirements, and we are also using water tankers to regulate supply.  Water from lakes and reservoirs around the city largely meet the needs of the city and its suburbs, home to more than 8 million people. Veeranam lake in neighboring Cuddalore district - one of Chennai's main water sources - is almost dry after the failure of the 2016 monsoons. Depleted groundwater sources and other dried up lakes within 60 km of Chennai - including Pulicat, Puzhal, Sholavaram, Kaliveli and Maduranthakam - have left the city parched. Domestic worker Maheshwari Karunakaran is allowed to fill only 20 pots of water every two days to meet the needs of her four-member household. Karunakaran uses this water to drink, cook, bathe, wash utensils and clothes.  There is a fight every time the water supply is released to the hand pump below my block of apartments,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that she often had to leave work early to queue up for water.  Everybody needs more water. We are forced to buy additional water for anywhere between two to five Indian rupees(less than $1) per pot.  In many areas, piped water is being supplied only once every three to four days. The water costs for most Chennai residents have gone up by 50 percent, while more people are depending on private water tankers and personal borewells for their everyday needs. Officials say the number of calls to their helpline have increased with many people asking for water tankers. The government has 7,000 tankers in operation in the city. Chennai also gets water from government-run desalination plants, which are now working around the clock, raising concerns about technical glitches.  This crisis was expected considering that the last monsoons had failed,  said Sekhar Raghavan of Rain Centre, a nonprofit that promotes rainwater harvesting in the city.  But the shocker is that there has been no planning to deal with it. De-silting of lakes and reservoirs, efforts to ensure recharge of groundwater have all been missing.  According to Roy, the government started putting measures into place as early as January.  Industries and bulk users were forewarned, and our engineers have been engaging with resident welfare associations to create awareness on the situation,  he said.  We are hoping we will get some rains in July that will help recharge some of the groundwater, failing which, the next few months will be tough.  Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Alisa Tang.

The Tigers eye their sixth straight victory against division foes Wednesday when they continue a three-game set against the visiting Kansas City Royals. Detroit stopped an eight-game skid with Sunday's triumph over San Diego to avoid going winless on a seven-game West Coast road trip, improving to 17-31 outside the division. The Tigers returned home and resumed their winning ways inside Central on Tuesday, getting homers from J.D.

After allowing one homer over his first three starts, the 32-year-old USC product has surrendered 13 over his last 10 outings, including at least one in 10 straight. Kennedy was tagged for five runs in three frames of a loss versus the Tigers on May 31, dropping him to 1-4 with a 4.66 ERA in seven starts against them. Norris was unable to win a third straight start after taking the loss Thursday at Seattle, permitting five runs on five hits over six innings. Control continues to be a problem for the 24-year-old Tennessee native, who has issued three free passes in three of his last four outings and thrown at least 96 pitches despite not working more than six frames each time.

The host Marlins eye their eighth victory in 12 meetings against the New York Mets when the National League East rivals continue a three-game set Wednesday. Riddle officially became Miami's everyday shortstop following Monday's trade of Adeiny Hechavarria to Tampa Bay and promptly snapped a 0-for-23 stretch in his second at-bat Tuesday en route to a 2-for-3 effort. However, Suzuki sparked the Marlins' offense with a tiebreaking RBI single in the seventh inning - his league-leading 12th pinch hit of the season - before coming around to score moments later on a two-run single from Christian Yelich to wrap a 6-3 victory. While Miami improved to 15-5 at home since May 26, the Mets - who have already sent five starting pitchers to the disabled list this year - took another hit to their rotation when Robert Gsellman left the game with a hamstring strain after he unsuccessfully tried to beat out a grounder.

TV: 7:10 p.m. ET, SNY (New York), FSN Florida (Miami) PITCHING MATCHUP: Mets LH Steven Matz (1-1, 3.60 ERA) vs. Marlins LH Jeff Locke (0-3, 5.70) Matz was effectively wild in a no-decision Thursday at the Los Angeles Dodgers, allowing three runs on three hits - two homers - while walking a career-high five and striking out a season-high eight in six frames. The 26-year-old surrendered three home runs six days earlier in a loss to Washington and has permitted five in three turns after giving up 14 in 22 outings last year. Giancarlo Stanton is 3-for-7 with a pair of homers against Matz, who is 1-0 with a 1.59 ERA in two career starts at Marlins Park. Locke remained winless since Aug. 27 of last season with his worst effort of the year Thursday, yielding a season-high five runs on seven hits and three walks across four innings. The New Hampshire native, who has allowed eight runs on 12 hits and four walks over eight frames in his last two outings combined, is 0-4 during his 10-game winless streak and hasn't recorded a quality start over that stretch. Locke has also struggled against the Mets, going 0-2 with a 6.63 ERA in four starts. Walk-Offs 1. The Mets, who have already set a club record for homers in a month with 48, hit two more in the opener and lead the majors with 70 homers on the road. 2. Suzuki is two hits shy of tying Hall-of-Famer Rod Carew (3,053) for 23rd place on the all-time list. 3. New York OF Curtis Granderson is one double away from becoming the eighth active player with at least 300 doubles and 300 homers in his career.

Listings at Companies House showed six businesses were registered to a London address on May 31 and June 6 using the Force One name. A hack of Mallya's Twitter account last December revealed the same address, a terrace of mansions overlooking Regents Park, as his London residence. The only named official for the companies -- Force One Grand Prix, Force One Racing, Force One Team, Force One Technology, Force One Hospitality and Force One Brand -- was Force India director Thiruvannamalai Ventkatesan Lakshmi Kanthan. Kanthan is also sole director of Force One Consultancy, a company set up on June 2. Mallya was quoted on June 14 as saying he was considering changing the name of the Silverstone-based team to make it more attractive to potential sponsors and give it more of an  international flavor .  There are some people who believe the current name Force India is restrictive psychologically,  he told Motorsport.com.  I'm considering along with the other shareholders what steps to take but it's a major decision and one that is not going to be taken in a hurry without due consideration.  India has accused Mallya of fraud and is seeking the 61-year-old's extradition after he fled to Britain in March last year.  Banks are seeking to recover about $1.4 billion that the Indian authorities say Kingfisher owes. Mallya has repeatedly dismissed the charges against him. Mallya attended only one Formula One race last year -- the British Grand Prix over the road from his team's factory. He said this month that there were no plans to sell the team, however. Any application for a name change would have to be approved by the governing FIA and other teams through the Formula One Commission.  Force India was born out of Vijay owning the team,  chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer told motorsport.com on Wednesday.  Since then we’ve lost the Grand Prix there (in India), the Indian sponsors no longer were interested in sponsoring us. Now we have no Indian sponsors whatsoever, apart from Vijay’s Kingfisher.  So it kind of makes sense to change it from India in order to attract sponsors more globally, and not restrict ourselves to being Force India.

At the same time Fitch has assigned a senior unsecured rating of 'BBB'(EXP) to Annington Funding Plc. Fitch has also rated Annington Funding Plc's proposed GBP4 billion EMTN Programme 'BBB'(EXP). The expected ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that issuer loans under Annington's existing CMBS transaction will be repaid almost immediately following the funding of proposed corporate bond issues and term loans. Fitch will assign a final IDR to Annington Limited and final senior unsecured debt ratings to the bonds following confirmation that the AF4 and AF5 transactions have been fully defeased and that all security under the transaction has been released. Fitch cannot assign a final IDR whilst any form of encumbrance relating to the CMBS transaction continues. KEY RATING DRIVERS Portfolio Leased to MoD: The ratings of Annington are supported by a portfolio of 38,979 residential properties (the retained estate leased to Ministry of Defence (MoD), a department of the United Kingdom (AA/Negative). This generates stable, long-term, contracted rent. The MoD is obliged to pay rent on all leased units, regardless of occupancy, and is responsible for maintenance and repair. The MoD can release units back to Annington, but must ensure the properties are in good condition or pay dilapidation costs. Annington typically sells released units on the open market, generating substantial reversionary returns. Annington was created in November 1996 when it acquired a 999 year head lease over 57,434 homes across 765 sites from the MoD for GBP1.66 billion. Annington then provided 200-year underleases over the sites to the MoD to house married service personnel and their families. Stable, Long-Term Contracted Revenue: The retained estate generates high-quality revenue that anchors the business profile of Annington. MoD rent is set at a 58% discount to open market rent until the 2021-2024 site review. Rent levels are reviewed on a five-year rolling basis, based on designated units on each site. Rent is then adjusted to reflect market movements. This exposes Annington to an element of price risk, but rent on nearly all sites has increased over the past 19 years and total rent has never decreased. Under the terms of the leases, the MoD must pay rent, regardless of occupancy, and is responsible for maintenance and repair, generating high gross to net rental margins. Large Residential Properties Portfolio: As of 31 December 2016, the retained estate was independently valued at GBP7.2 billion based on discounted cash flow under the contract, or GBP8.4 billion using vacant possession values. Units within the retained estate range from flats to large detached houses, although most are two- to three-bedroom semi-detached or terraced houses, largely in south-east and south-west England where housing demand has been strong. Annual rent under the five-year reviews has grown by a CAGR of 3.8% from 1996-2016, despite the retained estate having fewer units owing to sales, higher than the UK CPI of 1.9%. Site Review: Apart from the rent review cycle, each site will be looked at over a four-year period starting in 2021. The 42% currently payable will be reviewed site by site with a view to moving more towards open market rental levels. As a number of elements that make up the current discount will be reduced or eliminated, the discount is expected to fall to 25%-35%, substantially boosting rental income. Annington and the MoD have maintained positive working relations for 20 years, but any disputes during the site review will be resolved through an official arbitration process. Reversionary Gains: The MoD can release surplus property back to Annington with a six-month notice period, after which the company may use the property as it sees fit. To date, Annington has disposed of 18,539 units for more than GBP1.8 billion, achieving 98% of the open market value. The portfolio's current vacant possession value exceeds the discounted cash flow value, which factors in the MoD leases, by almost 15%, indicating strong reversionary potential. Annington also rents released properties, often back to the MoD. The company intends to increase its rental portfolio, which currently comprises around 1,388 owned and 78 managed homes. The MoD is likely to increase releases in the medium to long term to offset potentially higher rents and to reduce vacant properties, which are currently around 20%. UK Market Fundamentals Support Growth: There is a persistent shortage of UK housing and build rates are not closing the gap. This lack of supply continues to push house price inflation well ahead of earnings growth. Affordable rental housing, Annington's primary market, is particularly under pressure, owing to insufficient social housing. Accordingly, the company's ability to generate good returns is unlikely to diminish, despite the portfolio being largely secondary or even tertiary. Brexit: The overall effect of Brexit on Annington is likely to be muted, as Fitch expects the MoD's current housing needs to be maintained, and the number of public-sector and former military personnel is unlikely to decline. MoD housing demand is underpinned by the Joint Force 2025 commitments by the UK government. High Cash-Flow Leverage: Annington has a relatively weak financial profile for the 'BBB' category. This reflects the discounted rental stream, which affects cash flow leverage. We expect Annington's cash-flow leverage to remain high post refinancing, with a forecast LTV of around 47%, an EBITDA NIC of 1.7x and high net debt/EBITDA of 19x at the end of the financial year to March 2018 (FYE18). Further releases by the MoD may contribute to deleveraging, but the effect is likely to be marginal. This financial weakness is mitigated by the quality of the MoD lease. In addition, the site review may significantly improve Annington's position, although the outcome remains uncertain. DERIVATION SUMMARY Annington has a number of unique characteristics that distinguish it from most publicly rated real-estate peers. These include the leases to the MoD, under which there is no void risk and maintenance and repair, as well as dilapidations are passed to the MoD, which is reflected in the rental discount. In addition, military housing needs, rather than residential market needs, drive demand. Fitch views Annington's business profile as stronger than most peers'. Annington, for example, has a similar financial profile to Grainger Plc (BB/Stable), but a significantly stronger business profile. Other European residential peers operate largely in regulated markets, such as Sweden and Germany, where income is below market and there is good reversionary potential. These companies can achieve reversionary gains when tenants vacate properties or when apartments are upgraded, whereas Annington depends on the MoD to releases properties. Like Annington, residential real-estate companies tend to support relatively high net debt/EBITDA and LTVs, given the high number of properties, low voids and stable income. No parent or subsidiary linkage was used in this rating and there is no Country Ceiling in effect. We have not uplifted the issue rating given most properties are leased to the MoD in the retained estate and not easily used in a recovery. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Low single-digit rental growth - Small scale releases by the MoD - Stable housing prices - Long-term funding across bank term loans and notes issued under its medium-term note programme. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - The results of the site review substantially increasing rental income - Net debt/EBITDA falling below 15x Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Substantial weakening of the housing market - Very high levels of releases from the MoD, particularly if concentrated in a single geographic area - Significant fall in house prices leading or releveraging leading to LTV rising above 50% LIQUIDITY Healthy Liquidity: After the refinancing, Annington's liquidity will be strong, given there will be no short-term debt and the company will have cash available on the balance sheet and access to the committed, undrawnGBP300 million revolver. Annington's intention to issue long-dated bonds as part of its refinancing of the existing CMBS structure will further extend the debt profile significantly beyond existing maturities.

On Tuesday, most of the  shares he named abruptly plunged, pointing to chronic regulatory problems over small-cap shares in the Asian financial hub. Webb's report mapped out a complex web of cross-shareholdings between companies listed on both the main board and its sibling, the Growth Enterprise Market, which he said created a breeding ground for volatility. Tuesday's biggest decliners showed characteristics that have long worried regulators and which Webb highlighted in his report: high shareholding concentrations, unrealistic valuations, and complex relationships between companies and listed brokerages. The Hong Kong government and regulators are growing increasingly concerned that a series of company scandals, many of them centred on mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, have tarnished the territory's reputation as a financial centre as it marks the 20th anniversary of its handover to China this weekend. Webb, a successful investor and author who studied mathematics at Oxford, told Reuters on Wednesday he had come across the network through his own research into annual reports and company disclosures.  I picked up on this network years ago when they started building it. The meltdown shows these stocks are closely related,  he said. His report only covers cross-shareholding relationships but the companies also have many directors in common as well as related transactions, Webb said. The purpose of such networks, Webb said,  is to defraud investors - extract and misappropriate money and part of that involves manipulating stocks.  'Dump and Run' Webb, an outspoken critic of the Hong Kong market since he quit the HKEX board in 2008, said it was unclear what triggered Tuesday's sell-off. “I can only speculate. But it’s possible margin calls have been triggering the sell-off. It’s possible the brokers involved have been told to stop lending against those shares ... Maybe the people operating the network have decided to dump and run.” The Hang Seng index tracking main board companies closed down 0.61 percent on Wednesday, while the GEM board was down 0.8 percent, having lost more than 8 percent of its market value the previous day. Webb said he never shorts Hong Kong shares.  The bigger picture here is that this again reminds us that the current regulatory system is not working and these problems have been allowed to build up by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX).  He also blamed the independent market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),  for not stopping it.  An SFC spokesman declined to comment on whether the regulator was investigating any of the companies in the network. In a statement, the SFC said:  The stocks which have experienced large price declines yesterday occupy a market segment characterized by thin turnover, small public floats, high shareholding concentrations, and multiple relationships between different companies and listed brokerage firms. These characteristics can be especially conducive to extreme volatility and also to market misconduct.  The HKEX said on Wednesday it would closely monitor activities and take appropriate action when necessary. WLS Holdings, which had a market value of HK$409 million, was the biggest loser on Wednesday with its shares sliding 47 percent, while Greaterchina Professional Services Ltd dropped 34 percent after a 93 percent drop on Tuesday. Reform Ideas Webb said he opposed a recent HKEX proposal to add a third board, catering to start-ups, and argued the two existing boards should be merged and put under the jurisdiction of the SFC. The investor activist said Hong Kong also needs a class action legal provision so investors can hold boards accountable. He said all companies should be compelled to file results on a quarterly basis, with restrictions on how much companies can invest in other stocks. Webb, a member and a deputy chairman of the SFC's takeover panel, has been a thorn in the side of the establishment and Hong Kong's mega-rich business elites through his public commentary and eponymous Webb-site.com for much of the past 26 years he has been resident in the city. Last year, however, Webb told readers of his newsletter he would dial back his commentary and public activism in frustration that his efforts had yielded little change in the financial hub over the years. The HK$28.6 trillion ($3.7 trillion) market has grown nine-fold since the former British colony reverted to China rule in 1997, largely on an influx of listings from mainland firms. They now make up two-thirds of market value and represent 90 percent of the funds raised from IPOs in the five years to 2016. Investors seem to discount the market, with the Hang Seng index trading at around 14 times earnings, versus 22 times for world stocks and 23 times for U.S. equities. The SFC, along with the Hong Kong stock exchange, have issued several warnings over concentrated shareholdings in penny stocks listed on the GEM. The average first-day price rise for a GEM company debut during the first half of 2016 was 454 percent due to such concentrations, SFC data shows. This month the HKEX launched a wide-ranging consultation to try to address this problem, including a proposal to raise the minimum market capitalization by 50 percent to HK$150 million and increasing the cash flow requirement for initial listings.

Fitch has also affirmed Sino-Ocean Group's foreign-currency senior unsecured rating, and the ratings on all the outstanding US dollar bonds it guarantees, at 'BBB-'. The full list of rating actions can be found at the end of this commentary. The affirmation reflects strong support from China Life Insurance Company Limited (China Life; A+/Stable), which provides a two-notch uplift from Sino-Ocean Group's standalone 'BB' credit profile. Sino-Ocean Group's standalone credit profile is supported by its strong focus on and leading position in targeted Tier 1 and 2 Chinese cities, increasing rental income, prudent land acquisitions, and its diversified funding channels. KEY RATING DRIVERS Support from China Life: China Life has positioned Sino-Ocean Group as its sole strategic real-estate investment platform in China. It holds 29.99% of Sino-Ocean Group and is committed to owning no less than 25% in the future. China Life's linkage with the property developer is strong and provides support for Sino-Ocean Group's rating level. China Guangfa Bank Co., Ltd. (BB+/Stable), in which China Life has a controlling stake, subscribed to 20% of the first phase of medium-term notes issued by Sino-Ocean Group in March 2017. Sino-Ocean may intensify its collaboration with China Life in investment property funds and the senior living business. Focus on Top-Tier Cities: Sino-Ocean Group continues to focus on Tier 1 and 2 cities, making it well-positioned to benefit from the strong demand in these cities. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region will account for about 46% of its saleable resources in 2017 by value. At end-2016, 43% and 55% of Sino-Ocean Group's land bank by value was in Tier 1 and 2 cities, respectively, where the demand-supply dynamic is more balanced than in lower-tier cities. Sino-Ocean Group aims to raise contracted sales by about 20% to CNY60 billion in 2017, compared with CNY104 billion of saleable resources. Its contracted sales in January-May 2017 rose 59% to CNY22 billion, while the average selling price (ASP) for contracted sales rose 35% to CNY20,321. Rising Rental Income: Sino-Ocean Group's attributable rental income from investment properties and property management fees increased 12% to CNY1.7 billion in 2016, due to the addition of a new office building in Shanghai, and a higher rental rate and a higher occupancy rate achieved in its existing projects. Sino-Ocean Group is also expanding its real estate finance business and senior living business to provide an additional source of income in the long term. The contribution of new businesses is still immaterial, given their small scale. Prudent Land Acquisitions: Sino-Ocean Group's leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory (including guaranteed debt for joint ventures and associates), decreased to 34.9% in 2016 from 49.6% in 2015, due to stronger contracted sales and a prudent land acquisition strategy. The company acquired 19 projects for its land bank, with total gross floor area of 4.8 million sqm, at an attributable cost of CNY10.5 billion, which accounts for only 24% of its contracted sales proceeds in 2016. Fitch expects the company to spend about CNY20 billion-25 billion on land acquisitions in 2017, which will form about half of its contracted sales proceeds. Fitch expects its leverage ratio to increase to 35%-40% by end-2017 due to more land acquisitions. Lower Funding Costs: Sino-Ocean Group has developed diversified funding channels, including onshore bonds and offshore bank loans. The company sold domestic corporate bonds in May 2016 at 3.5% and redeemed the perpetual bonds issued in 2011. It also obtained approval for a CNY10 billion MTN programme and issued CNY4 billion as the first tranche at 4.77%-5.05%. The proceeds will be used to refinance its existing borrowings. The company reduced its average funding cost to 5.38% in 2016 from 6.25% in 2015. Fitch expects its funding cost to decline further to about 5% in 2017. DERIVATION SUMMARY Sino-Ocean Group's standalone rating is more reflective of 'BB' category peers such as Guangzhou R&F; Properties Co. Ltd. (BB/Stable), Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) Co., Ltd. (BCDH, BBB-/Stable, standalone BB/Stable), and Yuexiu Property Company Limited (Yuexiu, BBB-/Stable, standalone BB/Stable). Sino-Ocean Group's contracted sales scale is smaller than Guangzhou R&F;'s and BCDH's, but higher than Yuexiu's. Its leverage of 35% is similar to Yuexiu's, but lower than Guangzhou R&F;'s and BCDH's. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Attributable contracted sales of CNY50 billion-70 billion per year in 2017-2019 (2016: CNY50.4 billion) - EBITDA margin (excluding capitalised interest) at 23%-26% in 2017-2019 (2016: 23.9%) - Annual land replenishment cost at about 50% of total contracted sales for 2017-2019 (2016: 21%) - Attributable rental income from investment properties at about CNY1.8 billion-2.0 billion for 2017-2019 (2016: CNY1.7 billion) RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Evidence of strengthening linkage with China Life -EBITDA margin (excluding capitalised interest) sustained above 25% (2016: 23.9%) -Net debt/adjusted inventory (including guaranteed debt for JVs and associates) sustained below 35% (2016: 34.9%) -Contracted sales/gross debt (including guaranteed debt for JVs and associates) sustained above 1.25x (2016: 1.0x) Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -EBITDA margin sustained below 20% -Substantial decrease in contracted sales -Net debt/adjusted inventory (including guaranteed debt for JVs and associates) rising close to 50% -      Contracted sales/total debt (including guaranteed debt for JVs and associates) sustained below 0.8x -Evidence of weakening linkage with China Life LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity: At end-2016, Sino-Ocean Group had unrestricted cash of CNY19.1 billion, enough to cover the short-term debt of CNY6.2 billion. The company issued CNY4 billion in domestic bonds in March 2017. It also has approved but unutilised facilities of CNY118.7 billion at end-2016. This will be sufficient to fund development costs, land premium payments and debt obligations during 2017.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

President Xi Jinping has overseen a raft of legislation to bolster national security against perceived threats from both within and outside China. The government gained new powers with a national security law passed in 2014, followed by measures on counter-terrorism, the management of foreign non-government bodies and cyber security, among other subjects. On Tuesday, the standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) passed the law, the largely rubber stamp body said in a short statement on its website. The law will go into effect on Wednesday, it added,   without giving details of what was in the law or how its contents had changed since a draft was circulated in May. A draft was only released for one round of public consultation that lasted three weeks. Laws are often subject to at least two rounds of consultation, or more if controversial. The legislation was also passed after only two rounds of discussion by parliament's standing committee. Laws often go through three or more rounds. State news agency Xinhua said last week that the law was  needed to ensure the nation's security interests are met .  Intelligence work needs to be performed both within and outside China, and foreign groups and individuals who damage national security must be investigated, according to the draft. The law will give authorities new legal grounds to monitor and investigate foreign and domestic individuals and bodies, in order to protect national security. Chinese activists have said they fear intensified state surveillance. The draft showed authorities will also be able to propose customs and border inspections or  quarantines , as well as  administrative detention  of up to 15 days for those who obstruct their work, or leak related state secrets. China already has broad laws on state secrets and security but the new law will allow intelligence officials to enter  restricted access areas  and use  technological reconnaissance measures  when required, according to the draft. Vehicles, communication devices and even real estate, such as buildings, can be used or seized by authorities during intelligence gathering efforts, the draft says. Western governments have spoken out against China's security measures as defining its national interests too broadly and warning they could be used to target dissent. China says the laws are appropriate for its national security concerns.

The gap in EU finances arising from the United Kingdom’s withdrawal and from the financing needs of new priorities need to be clearly acknowledged,  the Commission said in a reflection paper that will be discussed by governments this year.  In the future, migration management, internal and external security, external border control, the fight against terrorism and defence will need to be budgeted ... alongside continuing investment to support stability and sustainable development in our partner countries,  it said. In a clear reference to Poland, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the EU budget and also the only country against which the Commission has opened a procedure over the rule of law, the paper said:  There have been new suggestions in the public debate to link the disbursement of EU budget funds to the state of the rule of law in Member States,  it said. Poland has been ignoring the Commission's recommendations under the rule of law procedure, which call on the nationalist-minded government to respect the independence of the judiciary, media and civil rights, raising concern of other EU governments.  Respect for the rule of law is important for European citizens, but also for business initiative, innovation and investment, which will flourish most where the legal and institutional framework adheres fully to the common values of the Union,  the Commission said.  There is hence a clear relationship between the rule of law and an efficient implementation of the private and public investments supported by the EU budget,  the paper said.

House prices rose 1.1 percent in June after falling 0.2 percent in May, the biggest jump since April 2015, Nationwide said. Compared with a year earlier, prices were up 3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent in May. Nationwide warned that monthly growth rates can be volatile and said it was unclear if the latest increase reflected improved demand. It expects prices to rise by about 2 percent in 2017 overall. Other analysts also have a subdued outlook.  The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to deteriorate further over the coming months with consumers' purchasing power squeezed even more by a damaging combination of higher inflation and muted earnings growth,  said Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club consultancy. House prices in London during the second quarter fell by 2.0 percent compared with the first three months of the year, the sharpest drop since the end of 2010. In annual terms, London house prices increased 1.2 percent over the period, the weakest growth on this measure since 2012.  For London's house prices to be growing at the second slowest rate in the country would have been unthinkable for much of the past decade,  Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. Demand in London has stuttered since taxes were increased on properties worth more than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) and on second homes and buy-to-let rental properties, compounded by the Brexit vote putting off some foreign investors. Other gauges of the housing market have pointed to a slowdown across Britain. Mortgage approvals slid to an eight-month low in May, industry figures showed on Monday. More comprehensive lending figures from the Bank of England are due on Thursday at 0830 GMT. A Reuters poll of economists last month showed house prices look set to rise 2.1 percent this year but stagnate in London.

The investor suitability rules, which apply to securities and futures products, were published at a time when China's hedge fund industry has boomed, while the government is promoting wealth management investment in commodities. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which published the rules on its website, said putting more burden on financial institutions to sell the right products to the right investors was in line with international practices after the 2008 global financial crisis, citing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rules  will have positive and far-reaching impact on the healthy development of China's capital markets, and the interests of small investors , the CSRC said. According to the rules, investors will be classified into two types - ordinary and professional. Financial institutions are barred from promoting  high risk  products to ordinary investors. Over the weekend, Hong Lei, head of the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC) urged China's money managers to bear more responsibility in maintaining financial market stability.  Asset managers should put investors' interest above their own ... and should not sell products to those with inadequate ability to take risks,  Hong told a hedge fund conference in the Chinese city of Hangzhou.

Higher short-term funding costs, driven by a regulatory crackdown on banks' riskier financing, have started to spill over into the real economy, a risk to economic stability ahead of this year's Communist Party Congress, when President Xi Jinping is expected to consolidate his control. The challenge is to counter the risks from excessive debt and shadow banking without endangering a growth target of around 6.5 percent – and previous experience suggests growth will be the priority.  The leadership favours stability this year. We don't want to boost growth aggressively but we cannot allow growth to slow too sharply,  said a policy adviser.  Many companies face difficulties and higher interest rates will push up borrowing costs, which will be unfavourable for economic growth.  The sources are involved in internal policy discussions and offer advice to policymakers but are not part of the final decision-making process. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The weighted average lending rate of China's non-financial firms rose by 26 basis points in the first quarter to 5.53 percent, the PBOC has said. Officials were tightening prudential requirements for banks during that period to try to tame risks from soaring property prices and debt. The PBOC also guided market rates higher during the first quarter, including immediately after the Federal Reserve raised rates in March, in what analysts saw partly as an effort to counter pressure on the yuan from capital outflows. Many analysts expect borrowing costs to have risen further in the second quarter, although the central bank has injected substantial liquidity to avoid an end-June cash crunch and did not follow this month's increases in U.S. interest rates. The official China Securities Journal reported earlier in June that commercial banks have started to raise mortgage rates and even preferential rates for state-owned companies. Authorities are expected to maintain a tighter regulatory environment given the focus on whittling down the large build-up of debt, but some of the insiders said that smaller banks could get some relief on the policy front to support activity. One option to ease funding difficulties for those banks would be to cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), which sets the amount of cash that must be held against loans.  Cutting RRR across the board is unlikely, but a targeted RRR cut cannot be ruled out in the second half,  said one of the advisers. The sources said top leaders are likely to meet in the summer, ahead of the Congress expected in the fourth quarter, to assess the economy and set the agenda for the rest of the year.  They could step up policy support if economic growth slows in the second quarter and third quarter,  said another policy adviser. China's ruling Communist Party holds a Congress every five years to select a leadership team and set a broad direction for economic and social policy. Although the world's second-largest economy is on track to hit its growth target for 2017, the tighter monetary policy, cooling housing market and slowing investment has reinforced views it will lose momentum. Broad M2 money supply growth fell to 9.6 percent in May, its slowest in more two decades, due to the impact from cooling interbank and asset management businesses, as well as the clampdown on shadow financing activities, the central bank said. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers' acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, fell sharply to 28.9 billion yuan ($4.23 billion) in May from 177 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data. Still, banks reported a higher-than-expected 1.11 trillion yuan in new loans in May, as they shifted more credit back onto their books amid the shadow financing clampdown. And the yuan has strengthened over the past month due to tighter curbs on outflows, market intervention and a weakening in the dollar, reducing the need to push rates higher, analysts said. If the yuan were to come under renewed and sustained pressure, that could lead to a reassessment. Policymakers could get worried if borrowing costs rise further and credit becomes even harder to access, especially for small- and medium-sized firms that account for 80 percent of employment, because although containing financial risks is important, it cannot be at too great a cost to growth.  Stable economic growth is hard-won and we must safeguard this,  said a policy adviser.

The strike, in al-Dablan, about 20 km (13 miles) southeast of al-Mayadeen on the west bank of the Euphrates, is the second in 48 hours that the Observatory says has killed dozens of people.  The identity of the jets that carried out the air strike was not known, the Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, said.  Both a U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, and the Syrian military backed by Russia, have targeted the jihadist group in cities and towns along the Euphrates valley.  On Monday a coalition airstrike in al-Mayadeen hit a building used by Islamic State as a prison, killing 57 people, the Observatory said on Tuesday. The coalition did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether its jets carried out Wednesday's strike in al-Dablan. On Tuesday it said it had hit targets in al-Mayadeen the previous day in a mission  meticulously planned  to avoid harming civilians.  It says it takes great pains to avoid harming or killing civilians and investigates all reports that it has done so. The Syrian government and Russia also deny targeting civilians.  The coalition is supporting an offensive by Kurdish and Arab militias against Islamic State's besieged Syrian capital of Raqqa, 200 km (150 miles) northwest of al-Dablan up the Euphrates.  Syria's army and its allies are pushing through the desert to relieve their own besieged Euphrates enclave in Deir al-Zor, 65 km (40 miles) northeast of al-Dablan.

In new guidelines jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Commerce, the government removed 30 restricted items compared with the 2015 version, leaving 63 on the list. Restrictions lifted in the manufacturing sector include those for rail transportation equipment, motorcycles, edible fats and oils, and fuel ethanol, according to the statement. China will also lift restrictions on foreign investment in unconventional oil and gas development, including shale oil, oil sands and shale gas. The new guidelines will take effect from July 28. Since the end of last year, the government has promised to take steps to further open the world's second-largest economy to foreign investment, offering increased access to its services manufacturing and mining sectors.  The measures come as President Xi Jinping seeks to project China as a world leader in fighting protectionism and defending globalization.  The government has also said that as China opens its doors wider, it expects to get fairer treatment for Chinese firms investing overseas.  Premier Li Keqiang said this week Beijing will facilitate foreign investment by relaxing restrictions on the stakes  overseas firms can hold in China ventures and making it easier for them to register new companies locally.

Its second largest shareholder is France's Vivendi with a 28.8 percent shareholding. The buyback will allow Mediaset, which already has 3.79 percent of the company, to increase its grip on the company. But, because of a special whitewash mechanism, it will not force Mediaset's large shareholders- including Berlusconi's family holding Fininvest - to launch a mandatory bid on Mediaset should their stakes go past the allowed legal threshold as a result of the buyback. The buyback programme was voted by over 94 percent of the 12,5 percent of minority shareholders. The vote required a simple majority of these shareholders. Vivendi was not present at the AGM.

A generic of Dolutegravir (DTG), first approved in the United States in 2013, is being given to 20,000 patients in Kenya before being rolled out in Nigeria and Uganda later this year, with the backing of the health agency UNITAID. DTG is the drug of choice for people with HIV in high-income countries who have never taken antiretroviral therapy before and for those who have developed resistance to other treatment.  I had constant nightmares and no appetite,  said Nairobi resident Doughtiest Ogutu, who started taking the drug this year because of her resistance to other treatments.  My appetite has come back... My body is working well with it.  Ogutu, who has been living with HIV for 15 years, said her viral load - the amount of HIV in her blood - has fallen tenfold from 450,000 to 40,000 since she started on DTG.  Sub-Saharan Africa has been at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic for decades and home to nearly three quarters of all people with HIV/AIDS. Daughtie Ogutu who lives with HIV and takes part in the Dolutegravir pill trial used in the treatment of HIV talks to Reuters during an interview in Nairobi, Kenya, June 27, 2017.Baz RatnerUNAIDS aims for 90 percent of people diagnosed with HIV to receive antiretroviral treatment by 2020. The brand name version of DTG is Tivicay, produced by ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline.  About 15 percent of HIV patients are resistant, which means the medicines do not work on them, said Sylvia Ojoo, Kenya country director for the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who is monitoring the introduction of DTG. Doctor Martin Sirengo, deputy director of medical services in the Kenyan ministry of health talks to Reuters during an interview in Nairobi, Kenya, June 27, 2017.Baz RatnerUNITAID works to bring medicines to market quickly and to reduce manufacturing costs by allowing generic companies to access patents for a small royalty and produce them cheaply for the developing world. Kenya, with one of the world's largest HIV positive populations, has made great strides in addressing HIV in its public medical facilities.   The health systems we have in place allow for rapid deployment,  said Ojoo.  It makes it relatively easy to introduce new interventions.  About 1.5 million Kenyans are HIV positive, with more than two-thirds on treatment, said Martin Sirengo, head of Kenya's National AIDS and STI Control Program. The number of new infections in Kenya has almost halved over the last decade to 80,000 a year, he said, thanks to increased testing, treatment and awareness.

Trading in Hongqiao Group's Hong Kong shares were halted in March after research firm Emerson Analytics published a report alleging the company underreported its costs. In a report dated Feb. 28, Emerson Analytics said Hongqiao had hidden 21.6 billion yuan ($3.14 billion) in costs through under-reporting over the years and estimated that its profitability is less than half of what it claims. The company's shares fell as much as 8 percent the following day and were subsequently halted upon Hongqiao's request. It was the third such report to take aim at Hongqiao after an anonymous websites also published negative claims about the company in November and December. Hongqiao has rejected all the allegations as groundless and misleading and said in April it would seek legal remedy against Emerson for alleged defamation. Ernst & Young, the company's auditor, subsequently resigned over a disagreement with the management regarding whether the company should conduct an internal investigation into the various allegations. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) this month asked the company to address issues raised by E&Y;, publish all its outstanding financial results, and to clarify the allegations raised by the Emerson report. The company said it was taking  appropriate steps  to fulfill the conditions.

Bunzl's shares rose 3.6 percent at 2,394 pence at 1005 GMT, making it the biggest gainer on London's bluechip index. Analysts said the mid-point of the estimated revenue growth for the six months to June 30 implied an acceleration of underlying growth to about 5 percent over the second quarter, from the 2 percent reported in the first quarter. As a supplier of low-value products such as carrier bags and toilet rolls to supermarkets, hospitals and hotels, Bunzl is more exposed to consumer spending than most of its support services peers that contract orders from large private firms and public budgets. However, while a slide in UK consumer confidence has squeezed retail sales there, most of Bunzl's revenue comes from North America, where it expects to see an uplift from President Donald Trump's plan for more local manufacturing. Bunzl posted a 19 percent rise in reported revenue, thanks to strong North America growth, favourable currency moves and benefits from recent deals. At least three analysts said revenue growth beat their expectations. Citi analysts bumped up their full-year growth forecast to 4.25 percent from 3 percent, citing the  impressive growth  of at least 7 percent in North America due to additional business won from one of Bunzl's existing large grocery customers.  It might not be as exciting as picking an oil explorer or junior miner... but investing is about keeping your money safe as much as it is making a return on it and Bunzl (update) shows that the best long-term picks can be the dull ones,  said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Bunzl has spent billions buying small firms since 2004 to expand its operations or enter new markets and uses its scale to then drive growth, and said on Wednesday it had acquired eight businesses so far this year, adding annualised revenue of 370 million pounds. The company has spent about 290 million pounds on these acquisitions, far greater than the 184 million pounds it spend on deals in the whole of 2016. However, acquisitions continued to be an important part its growth strategy, it said.  With a promising pipeline of additional opportunities, I would expect us to complete further acquisitions as the year progresses,  CEO Frank van Zanten said.

Chief Executive Martin Griffiths said revenue growth on the East Coast rail line had not met expectations when it bid for the franchise in 2013-2014, and it was making provisions to reflect losses over the next two years.  But based on our contractual position, I am confident that Virgin Trains East Coast will become profitable again from 2019 onwards,  he said. The East Coast line is the main rail link between London and Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, and it serves more than 20 million customers a year. Stagecoach, which owns 90 percent of Virgin Trains East Coast, is talking to the government about new terms for the contract, he said, in part to reflect Network Rail's investment plans. Talks were not progressing as quickly as hoped due to political uncertainty, he said, but he expected a deal to be agreed in the next 12 months. Griffiths said the short-term outlook for the rail and bus sector in general was  challenging .  The economy is tougher, political uncertainty and terrorism is impacting what we are seeing in our businesses and particularly in UK rail,  he said. Shares in Stagecoach, which runs buses in Britain and North America, as well as rail services, were trading down 11 percent at 180 pence at 0949 GMT, the lowest level since December 2009. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo, who has a  sell  rating on the stock, said Stagecoach's results were below his forecasts, although an unusually low tax rate saw earnings per share match expectations. He said the exceptional charges, mostly related to the East Coast franchise, were  substantial . Stagecoach reported a pretax profit of 158.7 million pounds for the year ended April 29. Full-year revenue rose to 3.94 billion pounds from 3.87 billion pounds a year earlier.  We remain cautious on the short-term outlook for revenue trends and operating profit in our bus and rail markets in the UK,  the company said.

Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Summit ESP makes pumps used to maintain well pressure to increase oil and gas production in aging wells. The devices, components in a business called artificial lift, increasingly are being used to prolong the life of shale wells. Halliburton's 2014 attempt to buy Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N was opposed by U.S. regulators and its 2016 bid for a Russian company has been stalled by Russian regulators. Halliburton declined to comment on Tuesday. Summit did not return calls seeking comment. Argonaut Private Equity, Kaiser's investment vehicle, declined to comment. Summit ESP was founded in 2011 and is led by executives who had earlier held senior posts at Baker Hughes, including Chief Executive John Kenner. It has expanded quickly in the United States and Canada, and in May announced it had installed its 8,000th electric submersible pump (ESP), an increase of 1,000 since November. ESPs are a worldwide business of about $5 billion a year, according to market researcher Frost & Sullivan. The main providers are Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), Baker Hughes and Weatherford International PLC WTF.N. Halliburton, which has a small ESP business,  is trying to catch up to Schlumberger and Weatherford,  Anand Gnanamoorthy, industry manager at Frost & Sullivan, said in an interview this month. ESPs generally cost between $50,000 and $200,000 for a complete system, he said. Summit, said one of the sources, wants to reach a deal soon to pre-empt the announcement of Baker Hughes' closing on its merger with General Electric Co (GE.N) oil and gas unit, which is expected at mid-year.  Kaiser, who controls Kaiser-Francis Oil Co and is the majority owner of BOK Financial Corp (BOKF.O), which owns banks from Arizona to Missouri, financed Summit ESP through his Argonaut Private Equity investment firm. It has more than $3 billion of capital deployed in more than 100 investments.     Sales talks between Halliburton and Summit have been on and off several times in the last year over valuation differences. Summit ESP's revenue last year was about $180 million, a decline of 10 percent from 2015, according to market researcher Spears & Associates.      After initial talks with Summit last year, Halliburton shifted its focus to reaching an agreement with Novomet Oil Services Holdings, a Russian supplier of electric submersible pumps that has operations in about 17 countries. In December, Halliburton disclosed it had sought Russian government approval for a deal to acquire up to 100 percent of Novomet.  Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller twice this year has told analysts the company was looking to fill a gap in its artificial lift business through mergers and acquisition.    Halliburton renewed talks with Summit this year after Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service failed to rule on the application. A Halliburton spokesman declined to comment on the status of that application.      A representative of the FAS told Reuters earlier this month it had not decided whether a government strategic review would be needed. A source familiar with the matter said the Russian review has been stalled over concerns about the strategic implications of a U.S. company owning a domestic supplier whose gear keeps aging Russian fields producing.

Neville underwent surgery and has left the hospital, local media reported. Ftouhi, originally from Tunisia and who holds dual Tunisian-Canadian citizenship, is expected to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis at the federal courthouse in Flint on Wednesday morning. Ftouhi legally entered the United States from Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Officials said Ftouhi targeted a city with an international airport, but declined to say why Flint was chosen. Ftouhi, who was not on the radar of U.S. or Canadian authorities before the attack, was in Michigan as early as June 18, the FBI said. U.S. and Canadian investigators are probing his travel before the attack. According to the criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic  Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Neville. He also said something to the effect of  You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are all going to die,  the complaint said. Ftouhi attempted to buy a gun before the attack, but was unable to do so, the FBI said. FBI officials declined to provide details on where Ftouhi attempted to buy the gun or what type of gun he tried to purchase. The 12-inch, serrated knife Ftouhi used in the attack was bought in the United States.

Tanoesoedibjo has been given a 20-day overseas travel ban starting on June 22 based on a request by Indonesian police's criminal investigation unit Agung Sampurno, a spokesman at the immigration directorate said on Wednesday. The Indonesian billionaire  is under investigation related to a violation of the information and electronic transactions law,  Sampurno said. Tanoesoedibjo, whose MNC Group controls businesses ranging from media to property, has been named a suspect for allegedly sending a threatening message to a prosecutor investigating a  case involving Mobile 8, a telecommunications company previously owned by MNC Group.  Tanoesoedibjo's lawyer could not be reached on Wednesday but in an earlier statement dismissed the allegations.  The content of Hary Tanoesoedibjo's SMS is general and idealistic and does not threaten anyone,  his lawyer Hotman Paris Hutapea said. Part of Tanoesoedibjo's text message read:  If I am the leader of this country, then that's where Indonesia will be changed and cleared of things that are not as they should be,  according to the statement from the lawyer.

By 0809 GMT, the Czech crown and the Polish zloty were both down 0.2 percent and the Hungarian forint recovered from early lows above 310 against the euro to trade flat.       If worries over a tightening monetary policy in the euro zone continue to occupy markets, the crown will stay under pressure in the coming days,  CSOB analysts said.      The weakening comes before Czech rate-setters hold a policy meeting on Thursday at which they are expected to hold rates near zero, where they have been since 2012.      An analyst poll this week forecast the central bank's first rate hike is getting closer and could come this year rather than next year as previously expected.     The leu held steady after gains posted in the wake of the nomination of a new prime minister, raising hopes of an end to Romania's political crisis.      The calmer political backdrop is helping the Romanian currency,  ING analysts said in a note. The prospect of political noise returning to  normal levels  could support the leu in the near and medium term, they said.

Shares leading the declines on Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) had been included in a report by activist shareholder David Webb six weeks ago titled  The Enigma Network: 50 stocks not to own . Hao Wen Holdings was the biggest loser on Wednesday, with its shares down 56 percent. The second-biggest loser was WLS Holdings, off 41 percent, while Greaterchina Professional Services Ltd plunged a further 34 percent after its 93 percent plummet on Tuesday. Nearly all of the 50 stocks in Webb's report fell on Wednesday. GEM's benchmark index dropped 0.8 percent, after losing nearly 10 percent on Tuesday in a sell-off that wiped HK$24 billion ($3.08 billion) off market value, leaving it at HK$268 billion. On Wednesday, a Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) spokesman declined to comment on whether the regulator was investigating any of the companies in what Webb called a network.  The stocks which have experienced large price declines yesterday occupy a market segment characterized by thin turnover, small public floats, high shareholding concentrations, and multiple relationships between different companies and listed brokerage firms,  the SFC said in a statement.  These characteristics can be especially conducive to extreme volatility and also to market misconduct.  On Wednesday, Webb told Reuters it was unclear what caused the sell-off in  Enigma Network  stocks.  I can only speculate, but it's possible margin calls have been triggering the sell-off – it's possible the brokers involved have been told to stop lending against those shares,  he said.  Maybe the people operating the network have decided to dump and run.  Active Umbrella-Maker Another stock on Webb's list was umbrella maker China Jicheng Holdings Ltd, whose shares plunged more than 90 percent on Tuesday and gained 6 percent on Wednesday. Financial services firm Lerado Financial Group Co Ltd , which had trading of its shares suspended this month and is also on Webb's list, said on Wednesday it sold HK$24.96 million ($3.20 million) of shares in China Jicheng. The securities regulator on June 6 halted trading in Lerado, alleging the company had issued misleading statements. Lerado has said it is seeking legal advice. China National Culture Group Ltd (CNCG) said on Wednesday it offloaded 1.63 billion shares in China Jicheng on Tuesday to raise HK$34.85 million, while QPL International Holdings, another stock on Webb's list, said it sold HK$1.99 million worth of the umbrella-maker's shares. All three firms said they sold China Jicheng at a loss because its stock-price was  extremely volatile . Amco United, another stock on Webb's list, plunged nearly 50 percent on Wednesday. Widespread Concerns Hong Kong's second board has seen high levels of volatility due to very concentrated shareholdings, and concerns have grown over the quality of companies listed there. Authorities have issued several warnings over concentrated shareholdings and this month launched a consultation to address this problem which would include raising the minimum market capitalization by 50 percent to HK$150 million and increasing the cashflow requirement for initial listings. The market jitters come nearly two weeks after the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) proposed adding a third board for pre-profit companies, and firms with dual class share structures. Corporate governance activists, including Webb and the Asian Corporate Governance Association, have criticized the plan, saying it will further lower standards. Some market watchers have called for a change to Hong Kong’s margin lending rules, which have been blamed for dramatic sell-offs in stocks. Other have warned that the second board's slide could impact the broader market.  We have to watch out for any spillover effect in the next few days,  said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities. The HKEX said on Wednesday it would closely monitor activities and take appropriate action when necessary. $1 = 7.8028 Hong Kong dollars Additional reporting by Elzio Barreto,; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Richard Borsuk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-stocks-smallcaps-idUSL3N1JP1OY"},

Spectranetics uses techniques including lasers and tiny drug-covered balloons to clean the insides of veins and arteries that have become clogged due to heart disease. Philips will pay Spectranetics shareholders $38.50 per share, a 27 percent premium to their closing price on June 27. Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten has transformed the former conglomerate into a focused maker of healthcare equipment over the past five years, spinning off its lighting division (LIGHT.AS) and selling most of its remaining consumer products business. Philips said Spectranetics, which expects sales of around $300 million this year, will continue to grow revenues at double-digit rates and will begin adding to Philips' earnings in 2018. The deal strengthens Philips' position in heart disease therapy following its acquisition of vascular imaging company Volcano in early 2015, van Houten told reporters. A Philips logo is seen at Philips headquarters in Amsterdam, January 28, 2014.Toussaint Kluiters/United Photos/File PhotoAfter the acquisition  we will have quite a nice lineup of devices for both heart, coronary, peripheral, vascular therapies,  he said.  In combination with our image-guided systems which enable doctors to see inside the body and use these tools, we have a very compelling market position.   Philips shares dipped 1.35 percent to 32.1 euros in morning trading in Amsterdam. Analysts from Berenburg, which rates the shares 'Hold', said the acquisition was a good strategic fit but would not increase Philips' return on invested capital for five years.  In our view, this is a nice technology-rich company and adds scale and breadth to Philips’ existing portfolio of mechanical atherectomy and intravascular ultrasound – but clearly this is a punchy price to pay,  they said in a note.      Separately on Wednesday, Philips announced a new 1.5 billion euro share buyback program that will begin in the third quarter and run for two years. CEO van Houten denied that the company had acted under pressure from activist U.S. hedge fund Third Point LLC, which has recently acquired a stake in Philips below the three percent threshold that would require disclosure under Dutch securities law. Van Houten said he has not had any communication with Third Point.

In new guidelines jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Commerce, the government removed 30 restricted items compared with the 2015 version, leaving 63 on the list. Restrictions lifted in the manufacturing sector include those for rail transportation equipment, motorcycles, edible fats and oils, and fuel ethanol, according to the statement. China will also lift restrictions on foreign investment in unconventional oil and gas development, including shale oil, oil sands and shale gas. The new guidelines will take effect from July 28. Since the end of last year, the government has promised to take steps to further open the world's second-largest economy to foreign investment, offering increased access to its services manufacturing and mining sectors.  The measures come as President Xi Jinping seeks to project China as a world leader in fighting protectionism and defending globalization.  The government has also said that as China opens its doors wider, it expects to get fairer treatment for Chinese firms investing overseas.  Premier Li Keqiang said this week Beijing will facilitate foreign investment by relaxing restrictions on the stakes  overseas firms can hold in China ventures and making it easier for them to register new companies locally.

Shares in the group, which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse in the United Kingdom and Ireland, rose as much as 3.4 percent on Wednesday after it also beat forecasts with a 10 percent rise in annual profit and said it was  well positioned to flourish  despite a tough economic outlook. On Tuesday, surveys showed UK consumer confidence plunged during the political crisis sparked by an inconclusive national election, while department store Debenhams (DEB.L) cautioned that trading was volatile. Earlier this month sofa retailer DFS Furniture warned on profit. British consumers have been hit by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since Britain's vote to leave the European Union, and by a slowdown in wages growth. The housing market is also cooling. However, Dixons finance director Humphrey Singer said the firm's electricals business had continued to deliver  very solid results  since its April 29 year end, though he did not give figures. Fiscal first-quarter numbers are due on Sept. 7.  We remain very alive to how the consumer is behaving and would react very quickly to any changes we saw there, but we don’t see it at the moment,  he told reporters.  Our electricals business, which is a very good bellwether on how consumers are behaving, continues to trade robustly.  Though Dixons Carphone has had a strong run of trading over the last year, prior to Wednesday's update its shares had fallen 17 percent so far in 2017, making it one of the worst performers in Britain's FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks since the country's Brexit vote last June. The decline reflects its exposure to high-cost goods and perceived vulnerability to a fall in shoppers' real earnings.  The (stock) market’s just very nervous and uncertainty in the environment, whether that’s economic or political, makes people nervous and our business is discretionary,  said Singer. But he stressed the resilience of the group and the work it has done to rationalise its store estate, reduce costs and offer a wider range of products less susceptible to the vagaries of consumer confidence. Dixons Carphone, which also trades as Elkjop and Elgiganten in Nordic countries and Kotsovolos in Greece, made a record underlying pretax profit of 501 million pounds ($642 million) in its 2016-17 financial year. Revenue increased 9 percent to 10.6 billion pounds, with growth in every region, and the dividend was raised 15 percent to 11.25 pence a share.  Dixon Carphone's valuation in our view wrongly prices in a decline in profits in the year ahead, ignoring its strong market position and self-help opportunities,  said Investec analyst Alistair Davies, who has a  buy  rating on the stock.

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has signalled that a stimulus reduction could get underway as soon as September, while the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept a hawkish stance on interest rates despite a recent run of soft inflation data. The 10-year German yield has almost doubled in the past two days, boosting the euro against the dollar, while U.S. yields are at two-week highs. The U.S. S&P; 500 posted its biggest one-day fall in almost six months, the losses filtering through to Asia where markets slipped about 0.5 percent  . MSCI's benchmark emerging equity index fell 0.8 percent .  It's a combination of Draghi and the Yellen comments – Draghi pushing up U.S. Treasury yields and Mrs Yellen highlighting stretched risky asset prices,  said Simon Quijano-Evans, a strategist at L&G; Investment Management. He was referring to comments by Fed chair Janet Yellen who said on Tuesday that rates would rise gradually and that  some asset valuations look high . The German bond sell-off will likely take a toll on eastern European debt markets, with Polish yields rising to one-month highs. Quijano-Evans said the main impact could be on the Czech crown, by bringing forward the timing of the first rate rise. The central bank is expected to hold rates near zero on Thursday but a Reuters poll found the first rise could come this year instead of previous expectations of 2018. The crown rose slightly against the euro. While euro gains pushed the dollar index 0.2 percent lower, most emerging currencies were flat, although the rouble pulled back 0.3 percent, hit by renewed oil weakness. Russian equities slipped 0.2 percent with shares in embattled conglomerate Sistema down another 0.3 percent, following falls of 7 percent and 6 percent respectively on Monday and Tuesday . A court on Tuesday froze more than $3 billion of Sistema assets as it started hearing a lawsuit brought by state oil firm Rosneft . In the Gulf, the Qatari riyal rose in forward markets versus the dollar to trade as firm as 3.686, the strongest level since mid-June. One-month forwards jumped back to levels seen at the start of the month, when a diplomatic spat with its neighbours first erupted.

Mayoral elections on Sunday showed four-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party remains a force to be reckoned with despite the billionaire media tycoon's sex scandals and legal troubles.  Berlusconi sees this as the last challenge of his career,  said Renato Brunetta, a close ally for over 20 years and Forza Italia's lower house leader.  He feels he has suffered many injustices and deserves one last shot. Who can deny him that?  Matteo Renzi, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), and Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement have dominated the national scene in recent years, relegating Forza Italia to a distant third or fourth in the polls.     Yet in the mayoral ballots, Forza Italia and its anti-immigrant Northern League allies trounced the PD and 5-Star in cities all over the country, suggesting they have momentum behind them just as the national vote comes into view. And crucially, after several failed attempts at electoral reform, Italy looks set to vote next year using proportional representation. Polls suggest this will lead to a fragmented parliament where no party has the votes to govern alone. This means Berlusconi, who spent months recovering from open-heart surgery last year, is likely to be a key player both leading up to the election, which must be held by May 2018, and in negotiations to form a government after it.  Forza Italia has 14 percent of voter support, roughly the same as its Northern League allies and well behind PD and 5-Star which have about 28 percent each, according to opinion polls. Tax Fraud A series of scandals have undermined Berlusconi's political career. Under pressure from his parliamentary and international allies, he was forced to quit as prime minister in 2011 as Italy's borrowing costs soared to unsustainable levels.  He left office amid revelations about erotic parties at his private villa and accusations he paid for sex with an under-aged prostitute. He was cleared of the sex charges but he is still on trial for allegedly bribing witnesses to testify in his favor. In 2013, he was convicted of an elaborate fraud scheme to cut the tax bill of his TV company Mediaset. He served his sentence helping Alzhheimer's patients in an old-people's home. He was kicked out of parliament and barred from public office, but he is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It is due in November to hear his appeal against the Italian law that excludes him from office.  FILE PHOTO - Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gestures during the television talk show  Porta a Porta  (Door to Door) in Rome, Italy June 21, 2017.Remo Casilli/File PhotoBut millions of voters still back him.  Giovanni Orsina, political history professor at Rome's Luiss University, said moderate center-right voters had nowhere else to go, as the only alternatives were the Northern League and 5-Star, both widely seen as populist and extremist -- and then there's Renzi. The 42-year-old Renzi, who quit as prime minister in December after losing a referendum on his planned constitutional reform,  is now discredited and seems politically older than Berlusconi because his defeats are more recent,  Orsina said. These Italians  couldn't care less  about Berlusconi's sex life, Orsina said, and they see him as unfairly targeted by judges. His political failures have dimmed in voters' memories because his successors have failed equally badly to revive the country's chronically sluggish economy.  Tree of Freedom  FILE PHOTO - Forza Italia party (PDL) leader Silvio Berlusconi speaks during Northern League rally in Bologna, central Italy, November 8, 2015.Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoAlessandra Ghisleri, head of the Euromedia polling agency which Berlusconi relies on for his own polls, says he still communicates better than his rivals and voters remain attracted by his personal charm and charisma.  It's as if he plays by no rules, he is himself and that's it, with no faking, his electors like him because he is direct,  she said.  He is also good at listening, he always faces who he's talking to.  Berlusconi spends most of his time at his villa outside Milan but comes to Rome for two nights a week to meet lawmakers and discuss political strategy, says Brunetta, and he is already drawing up his program for the next election. His flagship policy will be a drastic simplification of the tax code, with all the income tax rates substituted with a  flat tax  of 20 percent for both individuals and companies. He has also hit on a new symbol, the  Tree of Freedom , to get his message across.  The roots are our values, the trunk is our history, the branches are our broad themes and the leaves and the fruit are our solutions to the problems,  said Brunetta. It is unlikely that the court in Strasbourg will come to Berlusconi's rescue in time for the next election, and even if it does, it is far from sure whether he would be accepted as the center-right's leader by his Northern League allies. Yet Berlusconi continues to be a central player on Italy's political scene and a formidable campaigner, while Renzi stumbles from one defeat to another and 5-Star struggles to broaden its appeal. Deborah Bergamini, a Forza Italia deputy and its head spokeswoman, said Italians had tired of Renzi's constant media presence while Berlusconi, after a long spell out of the limelight, had timed his return perfectly. In the two weeks leading up to Sunday's vote, he made some 40 appearances on national and local television talk shows to stump for Forza Italia and its candidates.   It's important to know how to wait for the right moment to offer oneself to the electorate,  Bergamini said.

Figures released last month showed organizers had trimmed budget estimates to 1.685 trillion yen ($15.7 billion) including contingencies, from 1.8 trillion yen in their initial budget unveiled in December. Coates, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of the IOC Coordination Commission on its fourth visit to Tokyo, said the IOC was pleased with the reduction as well as organizers' emphasis on reducing costs further.  It is important to us that with these costs of the Games and the final analysis that become public, they are going to be a reason to attract candidate cities,  he said.  To attract them to bid, rather than to scare them off.  A construction worker walks past at a construction site of a building displaying Tokyo 2020 Olympics emblem in Tokyo, Japan May 23, 2017.Issei KatoIn September last year, a Tokyo city government panel had warned that expenses could balloon to 3 trillion yen. That would have been some four times the estimate Tokyo had made when it won the bidding in 2013, and prompted a worried IOC and local organizers to form a working group on cutting costs. The IOC is worried soaring costs could scare off future bidders, after four cities dropped out of the 2024 race over such concerns.  That is not only important to you, your taxpayers and the public, but it is very important to the IOC,  Coates said of reducing costs.  It's for our own future that we're doing it, just as much as you want to do it for your taxpayers.  The latest budget figures also show a reduction in the amount of public money to be used. Meanwhile, the organizing committee has increased its portion - paid through sponsorship, IOC contributions and other private funds - to about 43 percent of the budget excluding contingencies.

British government data, diplomatic sources and testimonials from six Hong Kong residents paint a picture of rising anxiety over the future and growing mistrust of Communist Party leaders in Beijing, especially among the younger generation. Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a  one country, two systems  formula which guarantees wide-ranging autonomy and judicial independence. China has promised Hong Kong's capitalist system will remain unchanged for  at least  50 years, but it has not clarified what happens after that. Hong Kong foreign passport holders and diplomats interviewed by Reuters say the rush for overseas protection has been fueled by the territory's divisive battle for democracy, especially the  Occupy  street protests of 2014, and increasing calls for independence, a red line for Beijing. The abduction of several Hong Kong booksellers, who sold publications critical of China's leaders, by mainland agents has also shaken confidence in Beijing's promise of non-interference, they say.   We will be coming under Chinese rule and we don't know what will happen in 2047 if there is political instability,  said 25-year old Hong Kong resident Dennis Ngan.  I am preparing for the worst.  China's main representative office in Hong Kong, the Liaison Office, didn't respond to a faxed request for comment. Like many of his peers, Ngan plans to renew his BN(O), or British National (Overseas), passport, a special status passport granted to Hong Kong permanent residents prior to 1997. More than 37,500 BN(O) passports were issued last year, a 44 percent jump on 2015 and the highest number for more than a decade, government data shows.  A Kind of Security  BN(O)s do not automatically confer right of abode in the United Kingdom, but holders can visit visa-free for six months and are entitled to British consular protection.   The BN(O) passport is a kind of security, like insurance. The renewal is not about having a travel document, it's about being eligible for rights or protections,  said Ngan.  The British Home Office rejected Reuters' requests for data on BN(O) passports issued in 2017 and on the number of BN(O) holders who have sought full British citizenship.  However, diplomatic sources in Hong Kong said they were seeing a broader rush for foreign citizenship which they attributed to concerns over the territory's future. FILE PHOTO: A vendor sells cushions depicting the Apple Inc logo and a British passport inside a Lunar New Year market at Hong Kong's Victoria Park February 17, 2015.Bobby Yip/File Photo People are worried. We understand that embassies all over Hong Kong are getting lots of queries from people seeking citizenship,  said one senior diplomat at a major consulate. Canada saw a growing number of new citizens from Hong Kong in the 10 years to 2015. Taiwan saw a boost in 2016, as a total of 1,086 Hong Kong Chinese became Taiwan permanent residents, the highest figure for the last decade. South Korea saw the number of Hong Kong citizens applying for permanent residency increase sevenfold in 2015 from 2007, while in the United States, the number of immigrant visas issued for Hong Kong increased 22 percent from 2015 to 2016. The data, the latest available, was requested from each  government by Reuters. One of the abducted booksellers, Lee Bo, drew international attention because he was a dual Hong Kong and British citizen, prompting London to rebuke China for a  breach  of Hong Kong's law.   Option to Escape   If things get really bad here and people need to seek asylum, I hope the British take that into consideration and listen,  said Kevin Hla, 40, a Myanmar-born IT professional. He has lived in Hong Kong most of his life but refuses to get a Hong Kong passport, preferring instead his BN(O) which he renewed last year.  It gives me an option to escape. I don't trust the Chinese government.  According to a University of Hong Kong survey released last week that polled 120 youths, only 3.1 percent of those aged between 18 to 29 identified themselves as  broadly Chinese . The figure stood at 31 percent when the half-yearly survey started 20 years ago.  I feel as though I'm half a British citizen,  said 30-year old Daisy Wong, who hopes to use her BN(O) status to secure British residency so her children can be born there.   The British government is good, they've given people this choice.  Still, some say such faith may be misplaced and point out that the British did nothing to promote democracy until the dying days of more than 150 years of colonial rule. Britain, looking for new trade partners as Brexit approaches, is also keen not to upset China, the world's second-largest economy. Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, told the Guardian newspaper British  kowtowing  to China would become increasingly craven after Brexit.  Are we more likely ... to take a firm line with China – on trade issues, on economic issues, on political issues – on our own than we would within the EU? I don’t think that the outlook outside the European Union is one in which we are more likely to behave honorably toward Hong Kong than we have inside.

Genel has seen a substantial leadership reshuffle in recent months amid a steep share price drop over the past three years following two oil reserve downgrades of its main Taq Taq oilfield, failed exploration elsewhere and weak oil prices. Co-founders Tony Hayward, the former BP chief executive, and Nathaniel Rothschild announced their departures in recent months, followed by board members Chakib Sbiti and Simon Lockett as well as CFO Monaghan. Genel's board was left dominated by some of its Turkish shareholders, who are among the country's richest families, until the ousting of Tolga Bilgin by other shareholders at the company's annual general meeting this month. Genel is now focused on developing its gas fields in Iraqi Kurdistan and is in talks with Turkish state-backed energy firm TEC to become a partner in the project.

Investment-grade credits, in general, traded 1bp-2bp wider, due to higher rates and weaker risk sentiment,  said a Hong Kong-based trader. The iTraxx Asia IG index was slightly wider, being indicated at 86.25bp/87.50bp. High-yield segment was also weaker. Chinese property names fell 0.25-0.5 points due to increased supply of new bonds from the sector with Evergrande complex still under water, according to the trader. Yuhuang Chemical's 6.875% 2020s were flat today at 95.50. The bonds slumped 4 points yesterday on news that the group may face demand under guarantees it gave to another group. New issues traded mixed with IG names doing well and high-yield credits facing sell-offs. For the IG new issues, Korea Development Bank's US$300m 5-year Green floaters, priced at 72.5bp over three-month US dollar Libor, traded around 4bp tighter. China Gold International Resources' US$500m 3-year US dollar bonds, priced at 185bp over Treasuries, traded 2bp tighter.

For many Poles,  The Chairman's Ear  accurately represents how their country is governed, with all real power in the hands of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, even though he holds no government post. Since the privately-funded show began to air on YouTube in January, some of its episodes have received up to 10 million clicks, compared to an average of six million viewers of the most popular TV program, a long-running family drama.  The Chairman's Ear  appears to resonate both with critics of Kaczynski, who accuse him of tilting Poland toward authoritarianism, and with supporters who warm to its portrayal of the  Chairman  as a cat-loving, slightly other-worldly bachelor who needs help using the phone and reheating dinner.  It's no secret that the (PiS) chairman is the true leader of the country and that the prime minister and president are subordinate to him,  said Robert Gorski, 46, the show's creator and lead actor.  Getting access to him is power.   Everybody whispers in his ear and he needs to decide whom to trust. Like any ruler, he is to some extent a tragic figure.  Arguably Poland's most polarizing politician since the end of communism in 1989, Kaczynski's nationalist, eurosceptic views have hardened since the death of his twin brother Lech, then Poland's president, in a plane crash over Russia in 2010.  The PiS government remains broadly popular 20 months after sweeping to power, despite concerns among liberal Poles and in the European Union about its conservative social policies and efforts to tighten control over state media and the judiciary. For many voters, Kaczynski, 68, represents Poland's best hope of protecting its traditional Catholic identity and national sovereignty in the face of globalization and EU pressures. Robert Gorski, 46, creator and lead actor of the show  The Chairman's Ear  during filming in Warsaw, Poland February 2, 2017. Karolina Grabowska/Ucho Prezesa/Handout via REUTERS Letting Off Steam  Some say  The Chairman's Ear  provides a healthy safety valve for Poles, allowing them to have a good laugh at themselves amid the serious challenges the country faces.  Every time when the atmosphere gets tense, people try to let off steam with laughter and jokes,  said Andrzej Mleczko, one of Poland's most popular cartoonists since the 1980s.      Slideshow (4 Images) Like many others, I wonder if these shows are true criticism of the government, or an intended or unintended effort to soften Kaczynski's image,  he added. The show - bought by the video streaming service ShowMax - doesn't pull its punches when it comes to mocking Kaczynski's scepticism toward the EU and his deep distrust of Germany. In one episode, ahead of a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Chairman's assistant - resembling Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak - pulls an EU flag out of a rubber boot to decorate the office. The assistant says he usually uses the flag to keep his feet warm while picking mushrooms in the forest. A globe showing a huge Poland surrounded by the oceans adorns the Chairman's desk - a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that Poland is indeed the whole world for Kaczynski. Merkel is only able to meet the Chairman after his formidable secretary grants her clearance.  The real Kaczynski appears to be taking the show in his stride.  It's good (people) are laughing, you need to laugh,  Kaczynski said in a radio interview.  And the fact that they are laughing at me? Well, you can say its my own fault.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms.  He is being treated in a hospital in the northern city of Shenyang for late-stage liver cancer after he was granted medical parole, his lawyer told Reuters on Monday. Branstad said his heart went out to Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the peace prize.  We Americans would like to see him have the opportunity for treatment elsewhere if that could be of help,  Branstad said in his first remarks to journalists in Beijing since he was confirmed in May as President Donald Trump's top representative to China.  And because of the relationship I have with both President Xi and President Trump, I hope I can be a go-between that can help address some of these challenging issues in the future,  he said outside the ambassador's residence in leafy central Beijing after arriving earlier on Tuesday. Branstad, a former Iowa governor, has been described by Beijing as an  old friend  of China. He hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping, then a county-level Communist Party leader, in Iowa in 1985, and again in 2012 when Xi was vice president.  Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2010 for his activism in promoting human rights in China, which responded by freezing diplomatic ties with Norway. They normalized ties last December. The prison bureau of Liaoning province said on Monday that Liu was being treated by eight  well-known tumour experts , but Western politicians and rights activists have voiced concern about the quality of treatment. Protesters wearing masks of Chinese Nobel rights activist Liu Xiaobo stand outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China June 27, 2017.Bobby YipA video of Liu Xia crying and talking about her husband's condition was shared online late on Monday, saying doctors could not perform radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A source close to the family said Liu was being treated using targeted therapy and that he and his wife wanted to return to Beijing for treatment but authorities rejected their request. The U.S. Embassy called for Liu's release on Tuesday but declined to comment on whether it was speaking with China about him being transferred to the United States for treatment. The embassy said its main focus was that Liu be  released on his own recognizance . Slideshow (5 Images)Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International, told Reuters late on Tuesday that he had been authorized by several people close to the family to say that Liu Xia had told Chinese authorities she wants her husband to receive medical treatment abroad.  Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official People's Daily, said there was a precedent for prisoners on medical parole to be allowed overseas for treatment, but that as a Nobel Laureate Liu  could motivate more Western public opinion attacks against China than other dissidents .  If he is willing to go abroad, that is perhaps partly out of the despair he feels from being marginalized by Chinese society and constitutional order,  the newspaper said. China has acknowledged problems of mistreatment in the criminal justice system in the past and has repeatedly vowed to crack down to address them. It has also said other countries should not use individual cases to interfere in China's internal affairs.  Liu Xiaobo is a Chinese citizen. Why should there be discussions with other countries about the issue of a Chinese citizen who is serving his sentence?  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters at a regular briefing when asked about Branstad's remarks. Lu said he believed the ambassador was  very clear about his duties  to increase mutual understanding and political trust.

Tullow has been under pressure to lower its mounting debt pile, racked up as it borrowed money to pay for the 2016 start-up of its giant TEN oilfields off Ghana, and to rein in spending elsewhere amid weak oil prices. On Wednesday, it reported a 17 percent fall in net debt to $3.8 billion in the second quarter, a level it had targeted by the end of the year.  The company used proceeds from a surprise $750 million cash call made in March to reduce borrowings. Tullow also reported a year-on-year increase in gross profit to $300 million, up from $200 million a year ago, as it benefited from rising production and an insurance payment to cover lost output during a shutdown. The company also cut its annual capital expenditure budget by another $100 million to $400 million as it expects to have to spend less this year. However, as oil prices have fallen around 15 percent in just four weeks, Tullow's share price has fallen by nearly 30 percent over the same period and bearish price expectations mean analysts are expecting further impact on Tullow's valuation. Tullow shares were down 2.8 percent at 0819 GMT.  Although Tullow is working hard to deliver on its potential, we continue to expect the stock to trend with the oil price,  analysts at RBC Capital Markets said. Tullow reported a $600 million net pre-tax impairment charge on the back of weak prices in the first half. As an exploration company, Tullow continues to drill for fresh resources and is focusing much of its exploration campaign on offshore Guyana and Suriname, a region where oil major Exxon Mobil and its partners earlier this month sanctioned a $4.4 billion project.  The prospect we are drilling is of the scale of the Greater Jubilee discovery in Ghana, it's a massive prospect,  CEO McDade told Reuters. He said explorations costs continued to fall and that the well Tullow is drilling off Suriname is costing around $60 million less than the company would have paid a few years ago.

The pan-European STOXX 600 hit its lowest since April 24 in early deals, down 1 percent, in step with euro zone stocks and blue-chips. Technology stocks fell 1.6 percent to a two-week low, the worst performer with every stock on the index in the red. The losses came after a ransomware attack swept the globe, disrupting computers at banks and large companies including WPP , Moeller Maersk and Metro. Shares in affected companies were not hugely or uniformly dented, with WPP down 0.4 percent, Maersk up 0.2 percent and Metro up 0.5 percent. Anti-virus provider Sophos fell 4.9 percent, a top UK mid-cap faller, and security firm NCC Group slid 2.1 percent. Both had been among the best performers when a global 'WannaCry' ransomware attack hit computers in mid-May. In Helsinki, digital security firm F-Secure, which had also made gains in the previous cyber-attack, was down 1 percent. But investors said tech stocks were falling in the wake of U.S. peers.  Tech generally is weak following the lead of U.S. tech which sold off aggressively last night,  said Neil Campling, head of global telecoms, media and technology research at Northern Trust, adding that a downgrade to 'hold' was also weighing on Sophos.  After high profile attacks you have a massive spike in corporate activity - shutting the door after the horse has bolted,  he added.  We see the downgrade today on Sophos as giving an opportunity to buy.  Semiconductor makers AMS, Dialog Semiconductor , ASM International and STMicro were among the worst performers on Wednesday, falling 2 to 4.1 percent. Interest-rate sensitive utilities and real estate stocks tumbled, weighed by hawkish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and a slew of Federal Reserve policymakers including Fed Chief Janet Yellen. Germany's utilities RWE and E.ON were the worst-performing on the DAX, down 2 to 2.2 percent. Adding insult to injury, lower oil prices weighed on oil and gas stocks, with Tullow Oil the biggest faller after its first-half results. Meanwhile, positive results and acquisitions drove the handful of gainers. Business supplies distributor Bunzl bounced 4 percent after saying a boost in recent acquisitions would help it increase first-half revenue 7 percent.  We anticipated an acceleration in underlying growth to 7 percent in the second half but organic growth is tracking ahead of our forecasts already at Q2,  said UBS analysts.  New M&A; announced today should have a positive impact of around 0.5 percent to the top-line when fully annualised,  they added. French industrial group Legrand also rose 2.8 percent after saying it would buy U.S. infrastructure company Milestone.

But the Supreme Court on Monday ruled there could be partial restrictions placed on refugees.  The decision is  an indication of the decision of the leaders of that country to discriminate against Muslims,  Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi was cited as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).  The Islamic Republic of Iran, after carefully examining the recent decision of the Supreme Court of America, will take proportional and reciprocal action,  Qassemi said. He did not elaborate. U.S. citizens must apply for tourist visas before traveling to Iran, as opposed to others including Germans who are able to obtain these on arrival.  During his presidential campaign in 2016, Trump campaigned for  a total and complete shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States, arguing the measure is needed for national security. The court also gave examples of who may qualify for exemptions, including those with close family ties in the United States, obtaining a place at a U.S. university, or offers of employment. Qassemi also said the United States was targeting the wrong countries for a visa ban.   It's regrettable that the American government, because of their economic and commercial short-sightedness, have closed their eyes to the main perpetrators of terrorism in America,  he said. Iran blames Saudi Arabia, a long standing U.S. ally, for Islamic militancy. Saudi citizens are not affected by the travel ban.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index had fallen 0.6 percent to 7,391.88 points by 0831 GMT, while British mid caps were also down 0.6 percent. Fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown was the biggest faller, dropping around 3 percent and hitting a one-month low following an industry report by Britain's markets watchdog. In a drive to improve funds transparency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed a number of changes to the asset management industry, adding it supported the disclosure of a single, all-in fee. It also said it would launch a market study into investment platforms.  Rather than having the management fee and then also trading commission as well and then other sorts of fees on top of that, I think the regulator would rather that wealth managers charged just one fixed percentage that encompassed everything, so consumers would know exactly what they were paying,  Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at Killik & Co, said. Winter added that, because performance reporting has been a big part of Europe's upcoming Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II regulation, wealth managers had already been looking at their fee structures and considering one fee. A weaker oil price was also a drag on UK blue chips, with shares in majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP both dropping nearly 1 percent. Shares in mining firms Glencore and Antofagasta also fell following a dip in the copper price. Shares in Bunzl, a provider of distribution and outsourcing services, bounced more than 4 percent and were the biggest gainers by some way on the FTSE 100. Bunzl was set for its best day in a year after issuing an upbeat trading statement in which it said it saw a 7 percent rise in first-half revenue at constant currency, as well as a boost from recent acquisitions. Outside of the large caps, results dragged down shares in Stagecoach, which slumped 8 percent after its full-year earnings missed expectations. Stagecoach's full-year pretax profit dropped 15.3 percent as economic conditions hit its domestic bus business.

The proposed notes are rated at the same level as Evergrande's senior unsecured rating as they constitute direct and senior unsecured obligations. The proceeds will be used to refinance debt and general corporate purposes. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 21 June 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Improved Debt Structure: Evergrande's leverage and payables-to-gross inventory ratio has been improving further in 2017. This had been on an upward trend since 2010, but stabilised in 2016. The improvements came in as a result of its strong contracted sales growth, redemption of most perpetual debt in 1H17, and also receiving the full proceeds from its CNY70 billion equity-raising for its onshore subsidiary from new investors. Fitch will review its 1H17 result to assess the impact of the improvement. Stronger Land Bank Profile: Evergrande has shifted its sales away from lower-tier cities, reducing risks to sales and profitability. The company's land bank has swung sharply to Tier 1 and 2 cities, with these two categories making up 74.7% of its land bank by value and 57.9% by gross floor area at end-2016. Contracted sales from Tier 1 and 2 cities accounted for 67.4% of total sales in 2016, compared with 59% in 2015. Evergrande's average selling price (ASP) is still rising, and reached CNY10,269 per square metre (sq m) in May 2017 and CNY9,786 per sq m in the first five months in 2017 from CNY8,355 in 2016. Large Interest Burden: Evergrande's gross interest expense and distributions to holders of perpetual capital instruments in 2016 totalled CNY42.3 billion, a jump from CNY25.4 billion in 2015. Evergrande's gross interest expense exceeded capitalised interest for the first time. Interest expenses as a proportion of contracted sales improved to 11.3% from 12.5% in 2015, although the improvement is much smaller if an adjustment for Evergrande's cheaper funding cost in 2016 is included. We believe that Evergrande's high expenditure will continue to limit its operating cash flow generation and limit its ability to deleverage meaningfully. Shareholder-Friendly Moves Pressure Credit: Evergrande has bought back shares totalling HKD6.3 billion (CNY5.6 billion) since 29 March 2017, after its 2016 results announcement. Evergrande also plans to make a dividend payment of 50% of profit of 2016 and 1H17, only after it successfully lists its onshore property operation in China's A-share market, despite sustaining high negative FCF before dividend. This puts creditors at a disadvantage as the company is not building up a healthy buffer to improve its financial flexibility. DERIVATION SUMMARY Evergrande's business profile is more reflective of that of 'BB' category peers as Evergrande has a diversified geographical and product profile. This offsets its very aggressive financial profile, which is comparable with that of companies in the weak 'B' category. Its peers, like Country Garden Holdings Co. Ltd. (BB+/Stable), Greenland Holding Group Company Limited (BB+/Negative) and Sunac China Holdings Limited (BB/Negative), are similarly aggressive in expanding their scale and are among the 10 largest Chinese homebuilders. Country Garden's leverage of around 30% and churn rate of over 1.5x, is commensurate with a high 'BB' category profile and explains the multiple notch rating gap between it and Evergrande. Greenland's leverage is as high as that of Evergrande but Greenland has a large level of uncollected sales to mitigate its high leverage. Greenland, as a state-owned enterprise, has a stronger position in acquiring land at low costs, especially for new city districts that local governments are keen to develop. This enhances Greenland's business profile over that of Evergrande. Sunac's leverage is low at between 40%-50% and it does not have high payables risks, unlike Evergrande. Sunac's sales are also mostly in major cities and is reflected by its higher ASP of CNY20,480 per sq m, more than double that of Evergrande. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - large homebuilders continue to win market share, which supports Evergrande's aim to increase sales by 15% to 25% between 2017 and 2019 - ASP in 2017 to match 1Q17 level and continue to climb at around 3%-5% thereafter, with higher-tier cities making up a larger share of sales - land acquisition volume to stay at 120% of the gross floor area sold in the same year - trade payables and receivables to grow in line with contracted sales growth RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Net debt/adjusted inventory sustained below 50% (59% in 2016) - Contracted sales/gross debt sustained above 0.8x (0.57x in 2016) - EBITDA margin sustained above 18% (16.5% in 2016) Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Net debt/adjusted inventory sustained above 60% - Total payables/gross inventory sustained above 0.45x (0.42x in 2016) - Tighter liquidity position due to weaker access to financing channels LIQUIDITY Large Liquidity Gives Flexibility: Evergrande has continued to maintain a large cash balance totalling CNY304 billion, including CNY106 billion of restricted cash, and CNY138 billion of available undrawn but uncommitted facilities to meet its debt servicing and operation needs. This was higher than CNY164 billion in total cash (CNY61 billion restricted) and CNY155 billion in facilities in 2015. The company also issued USD2.5 billion of senior notes in 1Q17 to refinance its existing debt.

There is no agreement on this type of action,  CFDT head Laurent Berger told Europe 1 radio on Wednesday.  The law will be on the table in the beginning of September. We will decide on our position,  he added. President Emmanuel Macron is promising more flexibility in the labor market with a reform due to be presented over the coming weeks. The government is holding a series of talks with unions about the reform and is seeking special legislative powers to push the reform through parliament in the coming months without lengthy negotiations. While the moderate CFDT has said that strikes and demonstrations were a last resort, the Communist-rooted CGT has promised a tough fight against the reform, which it sees as an attack on hard-won labor rights. The CGT said earlier this week that the reopening of schools in September should be the time  to act on our discontent and to work on economic and social change .

It was a lively start to European trading. The bond market sell-off and jump in the euro came as a dive in technology stocks after the latest global cyber attack sent European shares to a two-month low. The euro was eyeing up $1.14 and was at a 7-month high versus the pound after an upbeat ECB President Mario Draghi on Tuesday opened the door to changes to the bank's aggressive stimulus policy. The currency is now up almost 10 percent this year. The head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, and one of her lieutenants, Patrick Harker, said on Tuesday that they expected to continue raising U.S. interest rates, but it couldn't rally the dollar. That provoked the banking world's single biggest cheerleader for a stronger dollar, Deutsche Bank, to declare the end of the greenback's bull run which dates back to 2014.  I do think the euro now has got quite significant momentum behind it and I think that will build towards the confirmation of some tapering announcement this year. So I would be long the euro on a tactical basis for the rest of the year,  JPMorgan Asset Management's Global Market Strategist, David Stubb, said. At the same time core European bonds are the significant area of vulnerability to better euro zone growth and to changes in ECB policy, he added.  If you are looking at a 10-year maturity and further out, it is a global bond market and the extremely low yields in core Europe stick out alongside Japan and Switzerland as the places that seem stretched in terms of valuation.  Amid all the choppiness, safe-haven gold rose for a sixth day in the last seven. In Asia overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4 percent as it pulled back from a two-year high hit on Monday. Japan's Nikkei share average ended down 0.5 percent, as the yen at 111.900 also took advantage of the weaker dollar. The banking and insurance sectors however outperformed on expectations of higher rates. The yield on U.S. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last stood at 2.22 percent, well up from Monday's 2.14 percent levels. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen had said in London that it was appropriate to  gradually  raise U.S. rates, although there was an acknowledgement that inflation had seen some slippage.  Yellen's comment is supporting Japanese financial stocks today, and for the long-term, Japanese stocks are on the rising trend supported by U.S.-led global economic recovery,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. Overnight, Wall Street's S&P; 500 posted its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks and closed at its lowest point since May 31. It was spooked after the U.S. Senate delayed voting on a healthcare reform bill, rekindling worries about the timeline of Donald Trump's business-friendly policies. The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major counterparts, edged down 0.2 percent to 96.227, well below its previous session high of 97.447. The euro was up 0.5 percent at a one-year high of $1.1373 with FX traders waiting for another flurry of ECB policymaker speeches at a conference hosted by the central bank in Portugal. The greenback also slumped against the Canadian dollar after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told CNBC that it looked like the central bank's rate cuts have done their job. Commodity markets were also on the move. Crude oil futures gave back some of Tuesday's near 2-percent jump that had come on the back of the weaker dollar and expectations that U.S. crude inventories might decline for a third consecutive week. Brent crude futures were down 0.2 percent at $46.55 per barrel. U.S. crude futures were down 0.5 percent at $44.04. The weaker dollar helped bolster spot gold, which was up 0.4 percent at 1,251.59 per ounce.

The officials said Trump was looking at options including tariffs on steel imports, which Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross already has said he is considering as part of a national security study of the U.S. steel industry.  Whether Trump would take any steps against China remains unclear. In April, he backed off from a threat to withdraw from NAFTA after he said Canadian and Mexican leaders telephoned him asking him to halt a planned executive order in favor of opening discussions. The officials said there was no consensus on the way forward with China and they did not say what other options were being studied. No decision was expected this week, a senior official said. Chinese steel already is subject to dozens of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy orders. As a result it has only a small share of the U.S. market.  What's guiding this is he ran to protect American industry and American workers,  one of the U.S. officials said, referring to Trump's 2016 election promise to take a hard line on trade with China. On North Korea, Trump  feels like he gave China a chance to make a difference  but has not seen enough results, the official said. The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can.  They did a little, not a lot,  the official said.  And if he's not going to get what he needs on that, he needs to move ahead on his broader agenda on trade and on North Korea.  U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, spoke reporters outside his residence on Wednesday and said the United States hoped to collaborate with China.

We want to work together to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,  he said.  The death of American university student Otto Warmbier last week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, has further complicated Trump's approach to North Korea, his top national security challenge. Trump signaled his disappointment with China's efforts in a  tweet last week:  While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!  Trump had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping when he played host to Xi in April at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.

Since then, however, North Korea's tests of long-range missiles have continued unabated and there have been reports it is preparing for another underground nuclear test. Trump dropped by last Thursday as White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner were meeting Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi, an official said. China's inability to make headway on North Korea was one of the topics that was discussed, according to two people familiar with the meeting. In a statement last week, China's foreign ministry said Yang had met McMaster and Kushner, but it gave no details. Ministry spokesman Lu Kang did not directly answer a question about that meeting, but said China and the United States had discussed North Korea, among other issues, during a security dialogue Yang attended. Yang also had a separate meeting with Trump. The ministry said last week that Yang told Trump that China was willing to work with all sides, including the United States, to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula and promote an  appropriate  resolution.  Trump met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday at the White House and made a point of noting that the United States, India and Japan would be joining together in naval exercises soon in the Indian Ocean, a point that seemed aimed at India rival Beijing. Trump also thanked India for joining the United States in imposing new sanctions against North Korea.

The IIF, one of the most authoritative trackers of capital flows, said in a note late on Tuesday that global debt amounted to 327 percent of the world's annual economic output (GDP) by the first quarter of 2017 and the rise was driven principally by emerging market borrowing. While advanced economies continued to deleverage, cutting total public and private debt by over $2 trillion in the past year, the report found total debt in developing countries had risen by $3 trillion to $56 trillion. This amounted to 218 percent of their combined GDP, five percentage points above the first 2016 quarter. China accounted for $2 trillion of this rise, with its debt now at almost $33 trillion, led by households but also company borrowing the IIF said.  Rising debt may create headwinds for long-term growth and eventually pose risks for financial stability,  the report said.  In some cases, this sharp debt build-up has already started to become a drag on sovereign credit profiles, including in countries such as China and Canada.  High debt levels may soon come into greater focus if central banks from the U.S. Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank start unwinding some of the stimulus they have pumped into world markets. U.S. interest rates are already on the rise, potentially boosting the dollar and global borrowing costs. Recent ECB comments have also fuelled expectations it will announce a reduction in stimulus as soon as September . The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) this week urged policymakers to press on with rate rises notwithstanding financial market turbulence. Higher global borrowing costs could weigh most heavily on those who took out dollar debt and will need to repay it or roll over in coming years. The IIF report found that emerging markets had over $1.9 trillion of emerging bonds and loans falling due by end-2018, and 15 percent of this was denominated in dollars. The biggest redemptions were in China, Russia, Korea and Turkey, it said. Emerging hard currency-denominated debt rose by $200 billion in the past year - growing at its fastest pace since 2014 - and 70 percent of this has been in dollars, the report found.  Rollover risk is high,  the IIF added. (Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Toby Chopra)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/emerging-debt-iif-idUSL8N1JP1B6"},

Slideshow (2 Images)The far-left Linke party lost 1 point to 9 percent, and the pro-business Free Democrats dropped 1 percentage point to 7 percent, in the poll of 2,502 eligible voters that was conducted on June 19-23. It showed Merkel's Christian Democrats at their highest support level since September 2015, shortly after Merkel's decision to open the doors to more than 1 million migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Afghanistan. Forsa said 52 percent of those polled would back Merkel for a fourth term if the chancellor were elected directly, a drop of 1 percentage point, compared with an unchanged 22 percent who would back SPD leader Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament. Under Germany's complex electoral system, voters cast ballots for parties, not for chancellor. The chancellor is usually the top candidate from the party that wins the most votes, and must be approved by the newly elected members of parliament in a secret ballot. Only 9 percent of eligible voters trusted the SPD to solve Germany's problems, compared with 40 percent for Merkel's conservatives, its highest competency rating since October 2013, shortly after the previous national election.

The decision, which was in line with growing market practice, is likely to lead to more trading of LNG cargoes by buyers in Japan, the world's biggest importer of the fuel, and could see challenges to similar restrictions elsewhere in Asia. Asian LNG buyers have long complained that having destination clauses in LNG contracts unfairly restricts trading of the fuel at times when it would make more economic sense for buyers to on-sell supplies to other markets. The ruling comes as new LNG projects have boosted supply and many producers have already relented on the issue, offering contracts without resale or destination restrictions.  It is not unexpected ... this is very much consistent with Japan's efforts to liberalise the gas market,  said Neil Beveridge, oil and gas analyst at AB Bernstein in Hong Kong.  By removing the destination clauses, the idea is to increase liquidity in the market which is going to be a key step towards market liberalisation and development of a pricing hub,  he said. A spokesman for Jera, a joint venture between Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric that is the world's single biggest LNG buyer, said that easing or scrapping destination clauses was essential to boosting liquidity of LNG and developing a healthy LNG market in Asia. Japan is in a strong position to renegotiate supply terms given it spent about $30 billion to import nearly 85 million tonnes of LNG in the year to end-March, according to official trade data, about a third of globally traded LNG.  This is obviously a reflection of a market where buyers have a lot of power over sellers at the moment given the oversupply that we are seeing,  Beveridge said. The move is a reprise of the upheaval in Europe in the early 2000s when the European Union found certain gas market practices anti-competitive. Japan's Fair Trade Commission late last year ordered the country's LNG buyers to provide details on contract requirements that prevent them from reselling the liquefied fuel to third parties.  They had been talking about this for quite a while. A lot of the sellers already loosened their restrictions. It will probably impact the Qatari contracts especially in this oversupply climate,  a Singapore-based LNG trader said. Producers in Qatar have several long-term LNG contracts up for negotiation with Japan between now and 2021, while producers in Malaysia will also be affected.

Three-time Wimbledon champion McEnroe said Williams was  the best female player ever  but said her performance on the men's circuit would be an  entirely different story.  Williams responded on Twitter asking the 58-year-old to leave her out of his statements and called for respect and privacy as she takes time off to have her first child.  I felt the need, however unfortunately, to defend myself and say what I really felt, which is about what I think she would be (in the men's rankings),  McEnroe told American TV show CBS's This Morning on Tuesday.

The ruling opens the door for further regulatory actions against more crucial parts of Google's business – mobile phones, online ad buying and specialised search categories like travel - while easing the standard of proof for rivals to mount civil lawsuits showing Google has harmed them.     So far, investors have shrugged off the EU's threatened crackdown, with Google's holding company Alphabet's shares down 1.8 percent in early U.S. trade amid a continued selloff in technology stocks.  The stock has doubled in the two years since European authorities vigorously stepped up investigations of it.     It trades just behind rival Apple as the world's most valuable stock with a $666 billion market capitalisation.     The real sting is not from the fine for anti-competitive practices in shopping search but the way the EU has thrown the issue back to Google to solve, meaning the company won't be able to comply through an easy set of technical steps.     In effect, the Commission is forcing Google to demonstrate that rivals have made substantial inroads into its businesses before there is much chance of it being let off the regulatory hook.  EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager promised Google was in for years of monitoring to guard against further abuses.      Just being put on notice can limit Google's strategic options into the future,  said Matti Littunen, a digital media and online advertising analyst with Enders Analysis in London.     The EU's 2004 ruling that Microsoft Corp had abused its dominant market position in Windows and other markets is now seen as having curtailed the software giants moves over the subsequent decade to expand more quickly into emerging markets such as online advertising, opening the way for Google's rise.     Putting the onus on the company underlines regulators' limited knowledge of modern technologies and their complexity, said Fordham Law School Professor Mark Patterson.      The decision shows the difficulty of regulating algorithm-based internet firms,  he said.  Antitrust remedies usually direct firms that have violated antitrust laws to stop certain behaviour or, less often, to implement particular fixes.     People visit Google's booth at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason Lee This decision just tells Google to apply 'equal treatment,' not how to do that .     Warning Shot The EU ruling is a warning shot for two on-going EU probes into Google's Android mobile operating system and AdSense ad system, said Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile players, including Google.      If the European Union turns around and says Google can no longer bundle its Google Play app store as a default feature on many Android smartphones, this opens up the market to other handset makers to put their own software and services front and centre on their phones,  he said.     Littunen of Enders Analysis agreed, saying while Google may be able to meet EU objections in the AdSense case by making relatively modest changes to its advertising systems to enable website customers to run ads from Google advertising rivals, the Android case has many complicated factors with no easy solution.     More importantly, Google must find ways change its business practices without harming its very lucrative advertising business model, which accounted for around 85 percent of the $90.3 billion in revenue of parent company Alphabet in 2016.      The EU's identification of 'super-dominance' in internet search throughout the European Economic Area is confirmed and will provide a cornerstone for assessment of other ongoing cases, especially regarding Android and AdSense,  said Jonas Koponen, competition chief at Linklaters law firm in Brussels.      This could result in a profound change to the company's business models,  he predicted.     Yet another worry for the company could be a wave of lawsuits in the future.  We can expect to see a series of damages claims brought by the rivals that were excluded from the market by Google's conduct,  said Peter Wills, co-head of competition law for Bird & Bird in London, setting the stage for national court battles. With the EU's Vestager giving no ground in her record demand last year to collect 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from Apple and stopping Google from squeezing out rivals, other tech giants will probably think twice before testing her further.

For the past decade, Prague Zoo has been the only one continuing that tradition and it holds the studbook of a species whose ancestors - unlike other free-roaming horses such as the wild mustangs of the United States - were never domesticated. The zoo completed its seventh transport last week, releasing four mares born in captivity in the Czech Republic, Germany and Denmark in the Gobi desert. They will spend the next year in an enclosed area to acclimatize before being freed.  All the mares are looking very well, they are not hobbling, they are calm, eating hay and trying to test the taste of the new grass,  Prague Zoo veterinarian Roman Vodicka said after making observations a few days after the release. Prague has released 27 horses in total and officials estimate around 190 are now back in the wild in the Gobi B park, where the most recent arrivals were sent.

On Tuesday, most of the  shares he named abruptly plunged, pointing to chronic regulatory problems over small-cap shares in the Asian financial hub. Webb's report mapped out a complex web of cross-shareholdings between companies listed on both the main board and its sibling, the Growth Enterprise Market, which he said created a breeding ground for volatility. Tuesday's biggest decliners showed characteristics that have long worried regulators and which Webb highlighted in his report: high shareholding concentrations, unrealistic valuations, and complex relationships between companies and listed brokerages. The Hong Kong government and regulators are growing increasingly concerned that a series of company scandals, many of them centered on mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, have tarnished the territory's reputation as a financial center as it marks the 20th anniversary of its handover to China this weekend. Webb, a successful investor and author who studied mathematics at Oxford, told Reuters on Wednesday he had come across the network through his own research into annual reports and company disclosures.   I picked up on this network years ago when they started building it. The meltdown shows these stocks are closely related,  he said. His report only covers cross-shareholding relationships but the companies also have many directors in common as well as related transactions, Webb said. The purpose of such networks, Webb said,  is to defraud investors - extract and misappropriate money and part of that involves manipulating stocks.  'Dump and Run' Webb, an outspoken critic of the Hong Kong market since he quit the HKEX board in 2008, said it was unclear what triggered Tuesday's sell-off.   “I can only speculate. But it’s possible margin calls have been triggering the sell-off. It’s possible the brokers involved have been told to stop lending against those shares ... Maybe the people operating the network have decided to dump and run.” Webb said he never shorts Hong Kong shares.  The bigger picture here is that this again reminds us that the current regulatory system is not working and these problems have been allowed to build up by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX).  He also blamed the independent market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),  for not stopping it.  Activist shareholder David Webb poses in Hong Kong, China June 28, 2017.Bobby YipAn SFC spokesman declined to comment on whether the regulator was investigating any of the companies in the network. In a statement, the SFC said:  The stocks which have experienced large price declines yesterday occupy a market segment characterized by thin turnover, small public floats, high shareholding concentrations, and multiple relationships between different companies and listed brokerage firms.

On Tuesday, most of the  shares he named abruptly plunged, pointing to chronic regulatory problems over small-cap shares in the Asian financial hub. Webb's report mapped out a complex web of cross-shareholdings between companies listed on both the main board and its sibling, the Growth Enterprise Market, which he said created a breeding ground for volatility. Tuesday's biggest decliners showed characteristics that have long worried regulators and which Webb highlighted in his report: high shareholding concentrations, unrealistic valuations, and complex relationships between companies and listed brokerages. The Hong Kong government and regulators are growing increasingly concerned that a series of company scandals, many of them centered on mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, have tarnished the territory's reputation as a financial center as it marks the 20th anniversary of its handover to China this weekend. Webb, a successful investor and author who studied mathematics at Oxford, told Reuters on Wednesday he had come across the network through his own research into annual reports and company disclosures.   I picked up on this network years ago when they started building it. The meltdown shows these stocks are closely related,  he said. His report only covers cross-shareholding relationships but the companies also have many directors in common as well as related transactions, Webb said. The purpose of such networks, Webb said,  is to defraud investors - extract and misappropriate money and part of that involves manipulating stocks.  'Dump and Run' Webb, an outspoken critic of the Hong Kong market since he quit the HKEX board in 2008, said it was unclear what triggered Tuesday's sell-off.   “I can only speculate. But it’s possible margin calls have been triggering the sell-off. It’s possible the brokers involved have been told to stop lending against those shares ... Maybe the people operating the network have decided to dump and run.” Webb said he never shorts Hong Kong shares.  The bigger picture here is that this again reminds us that the current regulatory system is not working and these problems have been allowed to build up by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX).  He also blamed the independent market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),  for not stopping it.  Activist shareholder David Webb poses in Hong Kong, China June 28, 2017.Bobby YipAn SFC spokesman declined to comment on whether the regulator was investigating any of the companies in the network. In a statement, the SFC said:  The stocks which have experienced large price declines yesterday occupy a market segment characterized by thin turnover, small public floats, high shareholding concentrations, and multiple relationships between different companies and listed brokerage firms. These characteristics can be especially conducive to extreme volatility and also to market misconduct.  The exchange denied speculation on Tuesday it was planning to delist thinly traded shares.  WLS Holdings (8021.HK), which had a market value of HK$409 million, was the biggest loser on Wednesday with its shares sliding 47 percent, while Greaterchina Professional Services Ltd (8193.HK) dropped 34 percent after a 93 percent drop on Tuesday.

Shares in the company fell as much as 10.1 percent on Wednesday, but later pared losses to trade down 4.9 percent at 108.09 pence at 0739 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

The conglomerate that spans postal delivery, banking and insurance, booked a loss in the year ended March - its first in at least a decade - due to a $3.6 billion writedown on Toll Holdings Ltd that it bought in 2015. And last week, Japan Post said it was not looking to buy Nomura Real Estate Holdings, with sources attributing this to a failure to agree on a deal value with the target firm's largest shareholder, Nomura Holdings Inc.  There is enough we can do to achieve growth organically,  CEO Masatsugu Nagato said at a press conference on Wednesday. But Nagato did not rule out mergers and acquisitions, saying Japan Post would continue to consider as takeover targets companies that could contribute to its profitability and growth. He has previously said the company needed to acquire more businesses in a bid to look beyond postal services to increase its revenue. Japan Post earned 28 percent of its ordinary income in the year to March from its postal services arm. Eighty percent owned by the Japanese government, Japan Post was partly privatised in 2015. The government is preparing a second offering of shares, but the onus is on Japan Post to convince investors of its growth prospects. Japan Inc has spent heavily on overseas deals in recent years, often paying huge premiums to tap offshore growth amid dismal prospects at home. But many bets have failed, including high-profile failures of foreign takeovers by Japanese firms such as Toshiba Corp, raising questions about the country's corporate governance reforms.

Cambodia's embattled opposition did well in the local election, which government critics hope will pave the way for an opposition victory to end Hun Sen's 32-year rule in the impoverished country come a general election in 2018. Hun Sen's CPP won 1,156 communes to the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party's (CNRP) 489, according to official results released on Sunday. Hun Sen has repeatedly said he will hold onto power.

Hun Sen on Wednesday proposed an amendment to a law that would make it illegal for convicted politicians to take part in politics, including posting messages of support online, in a further move aimed at straitjacketing the opposition. He singled out former opposition leader Sam Rainsy who lives in France. Rainsy faces a jail term after he was convicted in absentia for posting a fake government pledge to dissolve the Southeast Asian country's border with Vietnam.

The arrests, organized by Spanish police in conjunction with police in Germany and Britain, detained four people in Palma de Mallorca, one in Britain and one in Germany, the ministry said. The police forces from the different countries co-operated using European Union agencies set up to help share information related to fighting crime within member states - Europol, Eurojust and Sirene, the ministry said. Those arrested devised and circulated videos with violent content and organized secret weekly meetings to recruit young people to travel to conflict zones to fight. The police investigation began in 2015 after discovering a web page with a series of videos showing the indoctrination, capture and journey to Syria of a young Muslim resident in Spain.  The producer of the films, an ultra-conservative Salafi imam, was arrested in Britain as part of the operation. He was already under surveillance by several European countries, the ministry said. He recently traveled to the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca where he met the four arrested in Spain, urging them to capture and indoctrinate others, the ministry said. The man arrested in Germany had contact with the others and had taken part in recruitment videos made by the group. Since Spain raised the security alert to level 4, the second highest, in June 2015, Spanish police have arrested 178 people accused of links to Islamist militancy.

We continue to have close communication with the Chinese government,  ASE chief operating officer Tien Wu told reporters on the sidelines of a shareholders' meeting.  We hope to complete this merger case as soon as possible.  Wu said anti-trust regulators in jurisdictions, including Taiwan, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and South Korea, have already given the nod for the merger, first announced in mid-2016, between Taiwan's two largest chip test and packaging companies. The deal would put ASE and Siliconware Precision Industries Co (SPIL) under one holding company that would then operate the two businesses, which ratings agency Fitch said in May would give the combined entity a stronger market position though a worse credit profile. Earlier this month, ASE said it had re-filed its merger application with China's commerce ministry, which needed more time to review the deal, after first receiving the plans in August 2016. The deal is set to expire at the end of this year if it is not consummated, but Wu said it was  very likely  that both companies would agree to an extension, while also dismissing possible non-economic factors affecting its review in China.  From a business (view), the economic principles and competition consideration of this merger case are very clear,  he said. The deal capped months of effort by ASE to wrestle control of SPIL first by buying SPIL shares in the open market and then beating back rival suitors Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and China's state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup. The hold-up in ASE-SPIL's anti-trust review in China comes as relations have cooled between Taiwan and China since the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took power on the island last year. China deems Taiwan as its own, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Taiwan has also protected its prized chip industry from becoming too reliant and open to China. Tsinghua Unigroup saw its more than $2 billion in deal-making that it had hoped to seal on the island unravel at the start of this year when the last of three Taiwan companies it wanted to partially acquire scrapped the plans, citing regulatory hurdles in Taiwan.

He faced a promising future and was keen to broaden his view of the world. It was likely that sense of adventure that convinced him to join a tour group traveling from China to North Korea - a country few outsiders understand.  Unfortunately, it did not take long for Warmbier to discover that North Korea was a pot of misery and inhumanity. In January 2016, North Korean authorities arrested Warmbier at Pyongyang airport for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel. Two months later, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for acts against the state. Fifteen months after that sentencing, Warmbier was flown back to the United States in a vegetative state. He died a few days later.  The brutal mistreatment of a 22-year-old American in North Korea’s custody has shocked the country, with President Donald Trump describing Warmbier’s incarceration and likely torture as  a total disgrace” that  should never ever be allowed to happen.”  There is no question that the Trump administration will need to respond in some formal way to Warmbier’s untimely death, and there has been no shortage of pundits and experts recommending tough action against Pyongyang. Suggestions include everything from unilaterally slapping secondary sanctions on Chinese firms that do business with the North Korean government to cutting off any possibility of talks in the future. The editors at the National Review even recommended a U.S.-led campaign to kick North Korea out of the United Nations, a bid that would be an international humiliation to leader Kim Jong-un if successful.  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY John Lloyd: The secret of Macron's success Peter Apps: The dangers of putting Putin under pressure Otto Warmbier is taken to North Korea's top court in Pyongyang, North Korea, in this photo released by Kyodo March 16, 2016.Kyodo/File PhotoThe problem with North Korea, however, is that we are not talking about a normal state operating under normal protocols. Its political leadership does not respect the normal moral value of right and wrong. This is exactly why the Trump administration must tread cautiously before doing anything that could turn a heartbreaking loss into a regional cataclysm.  Incremental, but effective, measures against Pyongyang in retaliation for Warmbier’s suspicious death would send a stark warning to Kim that his regime will be held accountable. But just as importantly, it would stop shy of goading the North Koreans into reacting in a violent or irrational way.  There are several policies that the Trump administration should and must implement. The most obvious recommendation - and one that senior lawmakers are already leaning towards - is Trump prohibiting U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea as tourists. Although the U.S. State Department has repeatedly warned Americans not to travel to North Korea, that travel warning does not carry any legal weight. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman was, in fact, just arriving in North Korea for a visit when Warmbier was released.  Family and friends carry Otto Warmbier's casket to a hearse in Wyoming, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2017.John Sommers IIThe White House can take the State Department’s optional bulletin and transform it into a mandatory edict. Trump can do this either by issuing his own executive action or by publicly supporting a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives that would ban the Treasury Department from issuing a license related to tourism to any individual or entity subject to U.S. jurisdiction.   Pyongyang must understand that it will no longer be able to profit from several hundred Americans visiting North Korea every year as long as the regime continues to arbitrarily arrest and prosecute U.S. citizens. In addition, the three Americans currently detained in North must be transferred immediately into U.S. custody.  Another option for the White House is an expansion of sanctions against any firm, individual, entity, financial institution, or government that accepts North Korean workers onto their territories.  In February 2017, the U.N. Security Council’s Panel of Experts on North Korea reported that the Kim regime  earns money by dispatching migrant workers overseas” - a practice that South Korea’s Unification Ministry has estimated brings in roughly $900 million a year to Pyongyang’s coffers. While $900 million not seem like a lot for a national government, it is a valuable source of revenue for North Korea, which needs every penny it can get to finance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Any country that continues to import forced labor from North Korea is contributing to the problem and does not deserve to operate within the U.S. financial system.  Regrettably, none of these measures will bring Warmbier back to life.  Many lawmakers in Washington would like to go a lot further, including indefinitely suspending any talks between the U.S. and North Korea as long as Kim flouts the principles of common humanity.  But as terrible as this entire ordeal is for the Warmbier family, it would be imprudent for the United States to terminate negotiating channels with Pyongyang that could be valuable  in the future. The most prudent action that the U.S. can take is to ensure that no other American suffers the terrible fate of Otto Warmbier.  About the AuthorDaniel R. DePetris is a fellow at Defense Priorities.

David Peralta and Chris Herrmann took their turn in the Diamondbacks' 6-5, 10-inning victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday, Arizona's second walk-off victory in three games and its 28th comeback win of the year. Peralta homered off Cardinals closer Seung Hwan Oh leading off the ninth inning to cap a comeback from a three-run deficit, and Herrmann singled home the game-winner in the 10th to give the D-backs their 13th victory in the past 15 games.  Sometimes I leave the dugout shaking my head,  D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said.  These guys believe, and that's a pretty powerful thing. This team never shuts down. These are the types of wins that show the character and the heart and the desire that we have. That's what we're building here. They believe in one another. They believe in the moment.  Rey Fuentes singled to open the 10th inning off Matt Bowman (1-3) before pitcher/pinch hitter Zack Godley sacrificed Fuentes to second. The D-backs were down to one position player when shortstop Nick Ahmed was removed after sustaining a fractured right wrist from being hit by a pitch in the eighth inning. Herrmann followed with his game-winning hit, a day after he homered in the first inning of his first career start in the leadoff spot in a 6-1 victory over Philadelphia on Monday. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at DiamondbacksSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch A lot of good vibes,  Herrmann said.  I feel really confident. I'm not trying to do too much. It was a tough win for us, but we got it done. We believe in that. Whatever it takes. We're going to find a way to win a game.  Right-hander Fernando Rodney (2-2) pitched the 10th for the victory. He has not given up a hit in his past 10 appearances and has not given up an earned run in his past 19. D-backs third baseman Jake Lamb had three hits and Daniel Descalso had two, his fourth straight multiple-hit game. Arizona (50-28) is three games ahead of the record pace set but the 2001 team. The D-backs are 30-10 at Chase Field and have won 15 of their past 17 home games. St. Louis scored three runs on three hits and three errors in the seventh inning to take a 5-2 lead. Luke Voit singled before throwing errors by catcher Chris Iannetta and pitcher Taijuan Walker loaded the bases. Stephen Piscotty singled off Walker's leg to drive in one run before Jedd Gyorko's sacrifice fly. Shortstop Ahmed bobbled a relay throw after Yadier Molina's single to enable another run to score for a 5-2 lead. Gyorko drove in two runs for the Cardinals (35-41), who have lost four of six. Arizona got close with two runs in the eighth off Trevor Rosenthal. Descalso had an RBI single and pinch hitter Herrmann hit a sacrifice fly on which left fielder Randal Grichuk made a diving catch with the bases loaded.  We handed it to the back end (of the bullpen),  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.  Those guys didn't get it done today. It was one of those days.  Oh has converted 16 of 19 save opportunities, but he left a changeup over the middle of the plate that Peralta took to left field for his eighth homer leading off the ninth.  Not making those pitches, and those are ending up as a hit or a homer,  Oh said through a translator.  I need to get those out pitches right, especially in these one-run differences.  St. Louis starter Carlos Martinez gave up two runs on four hits in six innings. He struck out 10 and walked three. Walker, Arizona's starting pitcher, gave up five runs (three earned) and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked five and did not have any strikeouts. NOTES: Arizona recalled RHP Braden Shipley from Triple-A Reno before the game and optioned RHP Silvino Bracho to Reno. ... Arizona OF Yasmany Tomas (groin) was 0-for-2 in his first rehab game in the rookie-level Arizona League on Tuesday. The D-backs are 16-5 without Tomas, who has been out since June 3. ... The Cardinals had a 15-game home run streak broken. It was the longest active streak in with majors.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-diamondbacks-writethru-idUSMTZED6S8SULYL"},

A turnaround in India's coal sector, from crippling shortages three years ago to a surplus thanks to faster government clearances, is seen as a major success for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The production boost means Coal India (CIL), the world's largest coal miner, is for the first time scouting for buyers abroad. But it is sticking to its plans to nearly double coal production to 1 billion tonnes a year by the end of this decade.  A careful assessment of demand for coal-based power is needed so that the over $1 billion annual investment being made by CIL in raising its production capability is not left stranded,  the NITI Aayog said in its Draft National Energy Policy released late on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2rXZmWK) Given that power demand was only growing at 5 percent a year at present, the coal sector should respond as needed, rather than pursue a  target-led strategy , it said. Some experts say the weaker-than-expected power demand, though growing slightly faster than previous years, is also an indication of the softness in India's $2 trillion economy, whose growth in the January-March quarter unexpectedly slipped to its lowest in more than two years. NITI Aayog, or the policy panel, added that nearly 304 million Indians are still not connected to the grid, suggesting there was scope for demand to rise. The panel also proposed splitting Coal India's seven units into independent companies to improve efficiency through competition. It also called for more private participation in coal mining.  The resulting competitive pressure will foster efficiency and bring about substantial reduction in coal prices,  the panel said.  It is entirely conceivable that our coal industry will emerge as an exporter of coal.  Piyush Goyal, India's power and coal minister, has repeatedly said Coal India will remain a single entity.

The delay came as the conglomerate sued its chip business partner Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) for interfering in the sale, one day after the U.S. firm resubmitted a bid for the unit. The lawsuit pushes acrimony between the two to new heights and further complicates prospects for a deal. Scrambling to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit, Toshiba had pledged to have a signed agreement for the sale of the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - by Wednesday, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. The hotly contested auction has seen a consortium, led by Japanese government investors and including U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, chosen as preferred bidder but the group's offer was only hastily and awkwardly put together this month. That bid has been largely orchestrated by Japan's trade ministry, which is keen to keep semiconductor technology under domestic control. Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said the firm was now aiming for an agreement with the preferred bidder consortium as early as possible and a completed transaction by the end of the financial year in March.  It is taking time to smooth out differences in opinion among members of the consortium,  he said, after apologising for a string of humiliating setbacks that include Toshiba's demotion to the second section of the Tokyo bourse. Related CoverageToshiba says chip unit pact delayed as talks with preferred bidder ongoingThere appears, however, to be little likelihood of a quick and smooth conclusion to the deal. Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, claims that its partner is breaching joint venture contracts and is seeking a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent - actions that prompted Toshiba's lawsuit on Wednesday. Toshiba executives continued to offer a string of mixed messages on their willingness to resolve the spat with the California-based firm. On one hand, Tsunakawa lambasted the Western Digital at the shareholders meeting, saying it had been interfering in the sale. But the head of Toshiba's chip unit also said the Japanese company was prepared to make concessions and hoped to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. Staff members greet shareholders as they arrive at Toshiba Corp.'s annual shareholders meeting in Chiba, Japan June 28, 2017.Issei KatoToshiba argues that Western Digital's bid for the memory unit presents anti-trust issues and is too low in price. Western Digital has said it offer meets the 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) minimum demanded by Toshiba - a figure that appears to match the amount offered by the preferred bidder. Western Digital Tries Again It is not clear if the terms of the bid that Western Digital resubmitted on Tuesday with partner U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) had significantly changed. Slideshow (5 Images)Western Digital said it will provide debt financing to facilitate a sale. Sources with knowledge of the matter have said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) which are currently part of preferred bidder consortium - would be invited to join the resubmitted offer. While it was not immediately clear what parts of Toshiba's talks with the preferred bidder consortium were taking time, sources have said some Toshiba board members are concerned about technology leaks to South Korean chip rival SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), which is part of the consortium and will provide Bain with financing. Western Digital has also said it is strongly opposed to SK Hynix's participation and has threatened further legal action. Toshiba's lawsuit, filed with the Tokyo District Court,  seeks around $1 billion in damages. The Japanese firm also said it had shut out Western Digital employees based outside their Yokkaichi chip plant from accessing information relating to the two companies' joint venture - a move that threatens to impede R&D; work on next-generation NAND memory chips. Western Digital declined to comment on the lawsuit. It said in statement it had reiterated its concerns about the sale process and SK Hynix's participation to Toshiba.  The U.S. court hearing for its injunction request is scheduled for July 14.

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.8 percent, to 3,646.17 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent to 3,173.20 points. Most sectors lost ground, led by real estate and consumer stocks that rallied the most recently. China is capable of achieving its full-year growth target and controlling systemic risks despite challenges, Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday, adding that maintaining medium to high-speed long-term growth will not be easy. China has targeted 6.5 percent growth this year. The economy, which grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter, generally remained on a solid footing in May, but tighter monetary policy, a cooling housing market and slowing investment reinforced views that it will gradually lose momentum in coming months. Li said Beijing has been taking steps to identify and resolve financial risks, to  uphold the bottom line of no systemic risks , indicating tight financial regulations and liquidity conditions could continue as Beijing pushes forward deleveraging efforts. However, there are signs of strong foreign appetite for Chinese blue-chips, after MSCI's decision to include 222 Chinese  A-shares  in its emerging markets benchmark. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's biggest yuan-denominated exchange-traded fund (ETF) attracted its largest daily inflow this year. The CSOP FTSE China A50 ETF, which buys Chinese shares under the so-called RQFII scheme, drew inflows of roughly 1.5 billion yuan ($220.56 million). Fund manager CSOP Asset Management attributed the jump in inflows to the high correlation between the FTSE China A 50 Index and MSCI's A-share inclusion plan, as well as a stabilizing yuan. MSCI's inclusion would  help prop up the value of China's quality blue-chips, and would help stabilize its stock market,  Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a seminar on Tuesday.

Operating through its Hong Kong catering and retail arm Best Food Holding (1488.HK), Hony Capital will kick-off its hospitality expansion by launching one of its Chinese cuisine outlet brands in London by year end, managing director Bruce Wang told Reuters in an interview.   When we were working on the takeover of PizzaExpress in Britain, we struggled to find a nice Chinese restaurant at the time. Given the large Chinese population residing there and lack of authentic Chinese food chains, it's a huge opportunity for us,  said Wang. Hong Kong-based Best Food, which currently has over 150 stores in mainland China, will open new outlets of its Beijing Hehegu fast food chain in London's business districts with a localised menu that should also be palatable for Western customers, he said.  If Beijing Hehegu can make a success in the U.K., other Best Food's Chinese cuisine brands will certainly follow the lead,  Wang said.  Hony Capital's food and beverages global growth push comes at a time when the restaurant industry is seeing intense competition that has hurt sales at giants such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).  Wang did not comment on the investment needed for Hony Capital's growth plan or how it will be financed but said funding won't be a hurdle to its ambitions.   Hony, which has $10 billion under management and is backed by Legend Holdings Corp (3396.HK) - parent of personal computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) - bought PizzaExpress for about 900 million pounds in 2014. It plans to boost the British restaurant's numbers in mainland China to more than 200 by 2021 from the current 35, Wang said. He added Best Food hoped to leverage PizzaExpress's distribution network and client base in Britain, where it has nearly 500 restaurants - although the company would have to overcome global concerns over Chinese food safety standards following a series of scandals in the country. Wang said Best Food will try to source more than 50 percent of its ingredients locally and continue to team up with large Chinese suppliers to ensure food safety.   Hony's founder John Zhao told Reuters in February that the private equity firm would continue to scout for acquisition targets abroad - including in the United States - to further its expansion, while looking for investment targets closer to home. Late last year Hony was a lead investor in a $11.5 million fundraising round by Chinese burger franchise Xishaoye Roujiamo which is also looking to enter the British market.

The journalists were taken into military custody in northern Shan State on Monday after covering a drug-burning event organised by the rebel Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), which demands more autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic group. The journalists' detention comes amid rising concern that press freedoms are being eroded in Myanmar despite a transition from full military rule, and underlines the challenge de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi faces in achieving peace. Clashes between government troops and loosely allied rebel groups close to Myanmar's border with China have set back peace talks prioritsed by Suu Kyi when she took power last year. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the army - known as the Tatmadaw - had clashed five times with insurgents since the army discovered a TNLA training camp on June 20.  During the engagements, several Tatmadaw officers and troops were killed and a few were wounded. Four bodies of enemy troops were also found,  the newspaper said, citing unidentified military officials. The clashes took place while the three journalists were in the TNLA zone for the drug-burning. Two community groups said on Tuesday they had documented extrajudicial killings, mass detention of civilians and torture by the military in recent days. In a statement, the Ta'ang Women's Organisation and the Ta'ang Students and Youth Organisation also said the military was responsible for mortar strikes that killed two villagers and wounded one on Monday. Military spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. The army almost always rejects accusations of rights abuses although it has in recent years acknowledged occasional violations by soldiers and promised action. 'Unlawful Associations' In a separate report, the Global New Light of Myanmar said the TNLA and the Kachin Independence Army were responsible for the attack on the villagers, citing the office of the commander in chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The military has not disclosed the exact whereabouts of the three reporters - Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing of Democratic Voice of Burma and Lawi Weng, a senior reporter with the Irrawaddy magazine. Both publications, which operate in English and Burmese, were formed in exile during military rule but have set up bureaus in the commercial hub Yangon since pre-publication censorship was officially abolished in 2012. Lawi Weng is among the most experienced journalists covering Myanmar's conflicts, and has reported from TNLA-controlled territory in the past. Suu Kyi's spokesman said on Tuesday the three would be charged with a colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act that outlaws contact with rebel groups. They were being held at a military facility but would be transferred to police custody within days, said Zaw Htay, the spokesman. The group the Committee to Protect Journalists said the three should be released immediately and allowed to carry on with their work.  Using the archaic Unlawful Associations Act to incarcerate journalists is an affront to democracy in Myanmar,  the group's Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler said in a statement. Following landmark elections in 2015, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi came to power last year after decades of rule by military generals or their proxies. Suu Kyi does not have oversight over the armed forces, but she has not used her party's parliamentary majority to repeal many of the laws used by previous regimes to stifle dissent. Journalists demonstrated in Yangon this month against what they said were increasing curbs on free speech, especially the use of a telecommunications law to prosecute reporters and social media users for defamation.

They were raised above the governor's house in Sydney, Australia's largest city and the capital of Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), where the fledgling colony was settled as an outpost of the British Empire in 1788.  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are our first people,  New South Wales Governor David Hurley said at the flag- raising, where a traditional smoke, or cleansing, ceremony was performed.  You have fought and died alongside Australians under the Australian flag ... even before being counted as part of the population,  he said. Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders make up 2.8 percent of Australia's population of 24.5 million but have disproportionately high rates of suicide and incarceration, ranking near the bottom in almost every economic and social indicator. Denied the vote until the mid-1960s, they face a 10-year gap in life expectancy compared with other Australians and make up 27 percent of the prison population. The United Nations has criticized their living standards.

Patrick Dodson, one of Australia's most senior indigenous politicians, said the ceremony was  an indicator of progress at an institutional level .  Slideshow (9 Images) The redress of injustice travels slowly but inevitably,  Dodson told Reuters. Last month, indigenous leaders rejected symbolic recognition of Aboriginal people in the Australian constitution and instead called for a constitutionally enshrined indigenous voice in parliament. The flags raised on Wednesday had previously flown over government house in Sydney for short periods but it is the first time in any state they have been installed permanently above a public building.

Figures released last month showed organizers had trimmed budget estimates to 1.685 trillion yen ($15.7 billion) including contingencies, from 1.8 trillion yen in their initial budget unveiled in December. Coates, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of the IOC Coordination Commission on its fourth visit to Tokyo, said the IOC was pleased with the reduction as well as organizers' emphasis on reducing costs further.  It is important to us that with these costs of the Games and the final analysis that become public, they are going to be a reason to attract candidate cities,  he said.  To attract them to bid, rather than to scare them off.  A construction worker walks past at a construction site of a building displaying Tokyo 2020 Olympics emblem in Tokyo, Japan May 23, 2017.Issei KatoIn September last year, a Tokyo city government panel had warned that expenses could balloon to 3 trillion yen. That would have been some four times the estimate Tokyo had made when it won the bidding in 2013, and prompted a worried IOC and local organizers to form a working group on cutting costs. The IOC is worried soaring costs could scare off future bidders, after four cities dropped out of the 2024 race over such concerns.  That is not only important to you, your taxpayers and the public, but it is very important to the IOC,  Coates said of reducing costs.  It's for our own future that we're doing it, just as much as you want to do it for your taxpayers.  The latest budget figures also show a reduction in the amount of public money to be used. Meanwhile, the organizing committee has increased its portion - paid through sponsorship, IOC contributions and other private funds - to about 43 percent of the budget excluding contingencies.

Trump,Junichi Sugawara,YUJI YAMAMOTO,US,JAPAN,EU,TRADE,European Union,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Japan,Western Europe,Europe,International Trade,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Economic News (3rd Party),Economic Events","sector":"Markets","content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese and European Union negotiators meeting in Tokyo aim to reach a free trade deal that would stand against a protectionist tide threatening the global economy, and make the United States think twice over pursuing inward-looking policies. Japan and the EU have been negotiating since 2013, but talks  have intensified since last week, with almost daily meetings to overcome key hurdles, including tariffs on Japanese automobiles and car parts and European wine, cheese, pasta and other foods. A Japan-EU deal could leave U.S. firms at a disadvantage, especially after President Donald Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, earlier this year.  There is an atmosphere among negotiators that Japan and the EU need to stop protectionism that is prevailing in the world,  said a source familiar with the issue who declined to be identified because talks are ongoing.   The momentum is building for Japan and the EU to take leadership in promoting and executing free trade.  In a sign of optimism, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said on Monday she could sign a provisional deal with Japan as early as next week. An agreement between the EU and Japan would  send a strong message to the United States that free trade is important and that you shouldn't be too inward looking,  said another source, who declined to be named while negotiations were underway. Trump favors bilateral trade deals over multilateral accords and his decision to walk away the TPP, left the other 11 members of the Pacific Rim trading bloc, including Japan, in limbo. Although, together Japan and the EU account for about a third of global GDP, their trade relationship has a lot of room to grow - EU forecasts reckon by as much as a third.     Their bilateral trade totaled $144 billion last year, whereas Japan-China trade was $262 billion and Japan-US trade was $192 billion. After unsuccessful attempts to conclude a deal with Tokyo the past two years, there is a sense in the EU camp that people will start to lose faith if they cannot wrap it up this year, an EU official familiar with the talks said. Japan wants to phase out the EU's 10 percent tariff on Japanese passenger cars over the next five to 10 years and scrap a 4 percent tariff on many car parts. The Europeans, meanwhile, would like Japan to reduce its 15 percent tariff on wine and up to 30 percent on cheese.  For now, the Japanese side is digging in on dairy.  Our number of dairy farmers is in decline, but we have a plan to strengthen our dairy industry, so I would like to ask for understanding,  Agriculture Minister Yuji Yamamoto told reporters on Tuesday.  I don't think there is room to compromise any further.  An agreement would put American companies at a disadvantage in Japan because they compete against European businesses in many of the same markets, said Junichi Sugawara, senior research officer at Mizuho Research Institute. It could even be used by Tokyo to convince Washington to rejoin the TPP, he said.  The U.S. side is likely to come at Japan with strong requests for better market access, but Japan can use a deal with the EU as leverage to lure the United States back to TPP,  he said.

The shake up in an area sometimes viewed as a backwater by ambitious employees reflects a push by Italian banks to claw back bad debts that make up some 15 percent of total loans -- three times the European average. Instead of the lawyers that have traditionally dominated loan recovery, Ricci hired as his No.2 a former senior executive at Goldman Sachs' Realty Management Division. Italian banks have largely held onto loans backed by property and are now seeking to manage these assets more actively, as repossessions take years and judicial sales curtail their value.  We brought in some big guns ... but also several mid-level people from loan recovery specialists. And we moved staff with a more business-like approach from other areas of the bank to complement customary legal and technical skills,  Ricci said.  The challenge is to make everyone sing from the same hymn sheet.  Even after crises at Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca are resolved, Italy's banks will be sitting on 300 billion euros ($335 billion) of loans that soured during a harsh recession. The fragility of Italian banks, compounding chronic low growth and a huge public debt, make the country a dormant risk to euro zone stability. As the economy recovers, inflows of new problem loans have slowed to pre-crisis levels. But banks are struggling to shift impaired debts off their balance sheets, hurting their already weak profitability. Accounting rule changes and a European Central Bank review next year of assets held by small cooperative lenders could fuel fresh loan losses, warned Katia Mariotti of consultancy EY. Gross bad loan sales in Italy totalled just 15 billion euros in 2015-2016, according to the Bank of Italy. Sales Up to 70 billion euros in sales are now in the pipeline, driven by ECB-enforced clean-ups at Monte dei Paschi, Italy's fourth-largest bank, and the two Veneto lenders. Together the three are set to offload 45 billion euros in bad loans, using taxpayers' money to cover the bulk of ensuing losses. Italy's top bank UniCredit is meanwhile preparing to sell 18 billion euros of its bad loans, having already raised fresh capital to cover the hit to its balance sheet. Bank of Italy officials have publicly advised healthy lenders against selling their problem loans, however, warning that fire sales enrich only a handful of specialised buyers and risk blowing a hole in banks' capital. The ECB, which is yet to respond to bad loan reduction plans banks submitted in the spring, may see matters differently.  We don't know yet if our goals will be seen as sufficiently ambitious. It'll be a moment of reckoning when we hear back from the ECB,  one source at an Italian bank said.  If the ECB takes a hard stance it'll be hard to avoid the significant sales that the Bank of Italy is warning against.  A person familiar with the matter said the ECB, which directly supervises Italy's 13 largest banks, was analysing the heaps of data banks provided and assessing how realistic each lender's projections were. The euro zone's central bank can take measures to ensure compliance with its bad loan guidelines, which the Bank of Italy is set to adapt for the smaller banks still under its supervision. Senior supervisor Ignazio Angeloni said in May the ECB expected the guidelines to significantly speed up disposals. Cultural Shift Battling with a sluggish judicial system and patchy loan records, Italian banks on average recover in a year a sum equivalent to around 4 percent of their impaired loan stock. To boost that, some banks have struck joint ventures with collection specialists while others are bringing in fresh skills to explore ways of recouping debts while steering clear of Italian courts. But insiders say a cultural shift is required as well as an overhaul of processes that, partly because banks have not invested in technology, still rely largely on paper documents.  Italian banks will be given some time, even a year maybe, but, without selling, it will be hard for them to meet their non-performing loan reduction targets and the ECB will then be in a position to step up pressure,  said Andrea Resti, an academic who advises the European parliament on banking supervision. After writing down about 174 billion euros of debt and raising 63 billion euros via share issues since 2008, according to consultancy Prometeia, Italian banks have roughly halved the book value of their impaired loans. They value insolvent loans at less than 40 percent of their nominal value. The Bank of Italy calculates this is line with the recovery rate of 43 percent recorded by Italian banks in 2006-2015. But the average market price is around 20 percent of a loan's nominal value, meaning banks can only sell at a loss. Reuters calculations based on central bank data show that cutting Italy's gross impaired loan ratio to match UniCredit's 2019 target of 8.4 percent would require banks to raise some 19 billion euros in capital.  The market is thawing after years of paralysis but I believe that, at least over the medium term, some cash calls will be necessary if banks want to get rid of bad loans,  said Claudio Scardovi, Managing Director at AlixPartners.

When he saw Philadelphia Phillies teammate Maikel Franco in the dugout after the seventh inning, the right-hander walked straight up and gave his third baseman a hug.  He said, 'Nice play, sick play,'  Franco said. Franco made a diving stop on a hard one-hopper down the third base line by Seattle's Jean Segura and got up to throw out the speedy shortstop by a stride, preserving a one-run lead, and the Phillies went on to defeat the Mariners 8-2 on Tuesday night at Safeco Field.  I don't know how I made that play,  Franco admitted. It came right after Phillies manager Pete Mackanin visited Nola on the mound, with runners at first and second and two outs.  You know, I don't know if he thought I was taking him out or not, but I just wanted to let him know that this was his game,  Mackanin said.  He'd pitched so well up to that point. I told him this is your game, finish (the inning) for us, and he did thanks to Franco's play.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MarinersPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchSaid Nola, who threw a career-high 113 pitches:  I told (Mackanin) I felt good, and he let me finish the inning. It was a pretty good sinking curveball (to Segura) and Mikey made a heckuva play.  Franco also was one of the offensive standouts for the Phillies (25-51), who snapped a three-game losing streak. He led off the fourth with a double down the right field line against Seattle starter James Paxton, the first hit the left-hander allowed. That sparked a two-run rally as the Phillies tied the score at 2-2. Franco snapped the tie in the seventh, leading off with a home run, his 10th of the season, into the Phillies bullpen in left field. Aaron Altherr added a two-run shot, his 13th, in the ninth as the Phillies won for only the second time in 10 interleague games this season. Nola (5-5) won his second straight start. He allowed two runs and five hits, walked four and struck out a season-high nine in seven innings.  It was great to see Nola pitch like we've grown accustomed to,  Mackanin said.  His ball-to-strike ratio wasn't the greatest, but he just kept nibbling in the right spots, made pitches when he had to. He set a good pace and was attacking the hitters.  Paxton (5-3) lost his third straight decision despite allowing only three runs on four hits in seven innings. Paxton walked three and matched his season high with nine strikeouts. The Mariners (39-40) led 2-0 after four innings, but they ultimately dropped their third in a row to fall below .500.  I think (Nola) threw plenty of off-speed pitches to keep us off balance and moved the fastball and breaking ball around,  Mariners catcher Mike Zunino said.  He was just flirting with the edges and got us in swing mode and (was) able to get us in jams with it.  Freddy Galvis went 3-for-5 for the Phillies, with run-scoring singles in the eighth and ninth innings. In the eighth, Daniel Nava led off with a double off the wall in right-center field against reliever Tony Zych, and Galvis grounded a run-scoring single to right. In the ninth, Cameron Rupp led off with a single to center off reliever Edwin Diaz. Ty Kelly put down a sacrifice bunt, with Diaz fielding the ball and throwing it away down the right field line to put runners at second and third. Galvis lined a single into right field to bring home Rupp. Howie Kendrick then fouled out to right field, with Kelly tagging from third to make it 6-2. Altherr hit his two-run shot on a 3-2 pitch from Diaz to end the Seattle closer's night. The Mariners had threatened to break a 2-2 tie in the sixth, putting runners at first and third with no outs on a walk to Ben Gamel and a single by Robinson Cano. However, Nola struck out Nelson Cruz for the third time and got Kyle Seager to ground into a double play to end the inning. Segura broke a scoreless tie with a two-run homer with two outs in the third. Jarrod Dyson walked with one out, and Segura hit the first pitch he saw from Nola into the first row of seats in right field. It was Segura's fifth home run of the season. NOTES: Phillies OF Aaron Altherr appeared to have an infield single leading off the second inning, but a two-minute video review overturned the safe call by first base umpire Ben May. ... Phillies CF Odubel Herrera didn't start, but he came on as a pinch hitter with the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the eighth. Herrera flied out to center field, snapping his 10-game hitting streak. ... Howie Kendrick, who had missed the previous four games with a sore left hamstring, served as the Phillies' designated hitter. He went 0-for-4 with a sacrifice fly. ...

The Nikkei share average shed 0.5 percent to 20,130.41 while Topix declined 0.3 percent, with its drop mitigated by a 2.0 percent climb for the banking index. The Topix Large, which covers the top 100 companies, was flat while the Topix Small, which has outperformed large cap shares this quarter, fell 1.0 percent on profit-taking ahead of the end of quarter. Traders said overall sentiment was subdued as investors remain cautious after the vote on a healthcare bill was delayed in the U.S. Senate, raising fresh questions about President Donald Trump's domestic agenda.  The news raised worries on overall sentiment and makes it hard for the market to take a firm direction,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. Tech shares languished after a sell-off in big tech names on the Nasdaq, which tumbled 1.6 percent. Google parent Alphabet fell 2.5 percent after EU antitrust regulators hit the tech giant with a record $2.7-billion fine. In the Tokyo bourse, Canon Inc tumbled 3.2 percent while Tokyo Electron Ltd shed 4.3 percent and Murata Manufacturing Co dropped 2.5 percent. Decliners outnumbered advancers by 1,383 to 503. In a boost to bank stocks, the U.S. Benchmark 10-year notes yield rose to 2.22 percent overnight, up from 2.14 percent late on Monday after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that it is appropriate to gradually raise rates.  Yellen's comment is supporting Japanese financial stocks today, and for the long-term, Japanese stocks are on the rising trend supported by U.S.-led global economic recovery,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group gained 2.6 percent, Mizuho Financial Group soared 3.0 percent and SMFG advanced 2.2 percent.

Increased appetite from India, which typically churns out its own sugar to use in everything from fizzy drinks to sticky snacks, could support benchmark global prices that have been trading near their lowest in 16 months. However, it would pressure Indian prices, potentially making it difficult for mills that process sugar cane to pay farmers rates stipulated by the government.  At the current (international) price level, refiners can import sugar for domestic consumption and make profit,  said Rohit Pawar, chief executive of Baramati Agro, which operates sugar mills in the western state of Maharashtra. Dealers estimate the cost of sweetener produced from raw sugar shipped in from abroad, including the 40-percent import duty, is around 32,000 rupees ($496) per tonne, around 8 percent cheaper than local sugar at 34,600 rupees. A stronger rupee also makes the dollar-denominated price tag on overseas cargoes more affordable for Indian mills. The rupee has risen more than 5 percent against the greenback so far this year. That comes after the government in April allowed the duty-free import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar to keep a lid on prices after local production fell by a fifth from a year ago.  Right now refiners are processing duty-free imports. From the next month they could start importing (duty-paid) sugar for local consumption,  said a sugar miller based at Kolhapur in Maharashtra. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. Traders said predicting the scale of potential imports was tricky.  It is difficult to estimate how much Indian refiners will import ... (while) paying tax,  said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.  The market has not anticipated additional imports. Once imports start, local prices could crash and could make larger imports unviable.  Local sugar prices have already fallen to their lowest level in three months in the wake of the duty-free imports and due to cooler summer than usual, which curbed appetite for cold treats such as ice cream.  There is a need to raise import duty on sugar to 70 percent. Otherwise imports will pull down prices further and make it impossible for mills to pay the government fixed cane price,  said Baramati Agro's Pawar. The South Asian country has increased by nearly 11 percent the price sugar mills must pay cane growers in the next sugar season beginning in October.  Mills cannot pay higher prices for cane unless they manage to sell sugar at higher prices,  said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.  There is need to stop imports as next season we will be self-sufficient in sugar production.  India's 2017/18 sugar output is expected to jump a quarter from the previous year to 25 million tonnes.

The 10,000-tonne warship was launched at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, the official Xinhua news agency said, making it the first of the People's Liberation Army Navy's  new generation  destroyers.  It is equipped with new air defense, anti-missile, anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons,  Xinhua said, without giving further details. The state-run Global Times newspaper said the ship was believed to be the first Type 055 destroyer, which is considered to be a successor class to the smaller Type 052D guided missile destroyers. China is still producing the latter and commissioned one, the Xining, in January. Chinese media showed photos of the new ship covered in streamers and flags and flanked by rows of sailors. The vessel will have to undergo planned testing before it is commissioned into use. China is producing warships at a rapid clip as it modernizes its navy, which has been taking an increasingly prominent role among the country's armed forces. State media has said that the navy commissioned 18 ships, including destroyers, corvettes and guided-missile frigates in 2016.  In April, China launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier, a conventionally powered ship that likely won't enter service until 2020.  China's naval build-up, and it's increasingly assertive stance over disputed territory in the South China, has unnerved its neighbors. China claims almost all the South China Sea, believed to have huge deposits of oil and gas, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, and has been building up military facilities like runways on the islands it controls. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.

It's a relief,  he said. The left-hander threw six scoreless innings, and Johan Camargo hit a two-run double as Atlanta beat the San Diego Padres 3-0 on Tuesday night. Newcomb (1-2), in his initial career road start, was sensational in securing his first win in the majors. The former first-round pick surrendered six hits and recorded seven strikeouts. The southpaw, who struggled with his command in the minors, issued only one walk.  The difference is I am competing on every single pitch,  Newcomb said. In all four of Newcomb's outings since being called up from Triple-A Gwinnett on June 10, he has gone at least six innings. Newcomb, who was acquired by the Braves in a trade that sent shortstop Andrelton Simmons to the Los Angeles Angels in 2015, has allowed one run in his past 12 innings.  He's been impressive for us,  Atlanta's Ender Inciarte said.  Watching from center field, it looks nasty, his curveball and fastball. He has been really sharp, and it has been great for us.  Related CoveragePreview: Braves at PadresBraves manager Brian Snitker said the rookie doesn't seem fazed pitching at this level.  It's been refreshing to see from the get-go,  Snitker said.  He's got a nice delivery, and he is going to be a guy that gets you deep into the game, I think.  Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 16th save. The surprising and rebuilding Braves (37-39) have won eight of their past 10 games to move within two games of .500. San Diego starter Jhoulys Chacin (6-7) went seven innings for the third time in four games and likely deserved better. He was charged with two runs on seven hits in losing his second straight start. Chacin retired the final 10 batters he faced. Camargo got to Chacin in the fourth, and that was enough with the Padres being stymied by Newcomb and three Braves relievers.  I could've made a better pitch to (Camargo),  Chacin said.  After that, I was just trying to keep the game there, trying to go deep into the game.  The Padres left nine runners on base and were blanked for the sixth time. Atlanta added an unearned run in the eighth. Inciarte's infield single ended with him on second thanks to Carlos Asuaje's throwing error. After reaching third, Inciarte came home on Nick Markakis' sacrifice fly.  It was a really good team win,  Inciarte said. Newcomb wiggled from a jam in the second when the Padres had two on with one out. Luis Torrens flied out and Chacin popped up. The Braves seized a 2-0 lead in the fourth on Camargo's double off the left field fence. Matt Adams, aboard on a leadoff double, and Tyler Flowers, who reached on a single, both scored. Camargo was thrown out at third trying to extend his double. San Diego's Matt Kemp had a great opportunity when batting with two outs and two runners on in the third. However, Chacin got Kemp on a first-pitch comebacker to end the rally. The Padres thought they took a 1-0 edge in the first when Wil Myers rocketed a ball to right-center. Myers believed his blast cleared the fence, but it was ruled that the ball ricocheted back onto the field off the top of the fence, which kept Myers at second, where he was stranded. The call on the field was confirmed by the review crew in New York.  Regarding our ground rules, on top of that wall is a home run,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  I have no clue how New York interpreted it the way it did. It's hard to even understand. It's frustrating for the team, and it's frustrating for Wil. That ball is clearly a home run the way our ground rules are written.  Added Myers:  That would have been nice, a home run and a RBI right there. But that's baseball. It happens sometimes, and you just keep going.  NOTES: Braves INF Freddie Freeman (wrist) took soft-toss swings. He could advance to batting practice this weekend. ...

The Dodgers only had four hits, were missing four starters from the lineup and didn't look like the team that had just won 10 straight games before Monday with a combination of power hitting and stingy pitching. However, they were extremely sharp in key situations, starting with pitcher Kenta Maeda, and they got a three-run homer from Joc Pederson to cap a four-run sixth inning. Maeda, who was 16-11 last season, had lost his spot in the 2017 rotation because of a lack of focus, and he was only starting Tuesday because the Dodgers wanted to give the rotation an extra day's rest. Maeda (6-3) took the demotion and the opportunity seriously. He had his best outing of the season, allowing just four hits and no walks while striking out six in seven innings. Only two of the hits were out of the infield, and he didn't allow a runner to get past second. He made two relief appearances and one spot start after being removed from the rotation. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at DodgersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch I definitely felt a sense of urgency,  he said.  I didn't start the season very well. What I learned is that whether I'm starting or relieving, I have to start strong. Relieving gave me less time to get a feel for the game. I had to just come in and throw strikes.  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said,  Kenta was very good tonight. They had very few good swings against him. He was aggressive and filled up the strike zone.  The Dodgers' four-run rally was quintessential baseball. Chase Utley led off with a line drive to left against Angels starter Jesse Chavez (5-8), and he hustled it into a double because he knew left fielder Ben Revere does not have a strong arm. A walk and fly ball put runners on the corners for Cody Bellinger against left-handed reliever Jose Alvarez. With the Angels in a shift and shortstop Andrelton Simmons shading second base, Bellinger went with an outside pitch to the spot vacated by Simmons for a single to score Utley, giving the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.  I was comfortable in that situation,  said Bellinger, who has 24 home runs and 56 RBIs in his first 59 major league games.  I was looking for a slider or fastball away.  Pederson, a left-handed hitter, was up next. Justin Turner had a bat in his hands in the dugout, and it appeared Roberts might send Turner up to pinch-hit for Pederson, who has a career .177 average against left-handers.  I thought about it,  Roberts said.  But if I use Turner, they probably walk him. Joc's been working very hard against left-handers, and Alvarez had even splits. I wanted to take a chance with Joc.  Pederson hit an 0-1 pitch by Alvarez over the center field fence for a three-run home run and a 4-0 lead. It was his seventh home run of the season and first against a left-hander. He was 5-for-30 (.167) versus lefties coming into the game, with just one RBI. He hit .125 against left-handers last season.  He's had a tendency to try and do too much against lefties,  Roberts said.  Today he kept his front side closed and had a nice, sweet balanced swing.  Angels manager Mike Scioscia was confident with Alvarez, as he has been with his entire bullpen this season.  They're the reason why we've been able to stay around .500 this season,  he said of the bullpen.  If not for them, we're probably 10 games under.  Chavez was charged with two runs on two hits in 5 1/3 innings, and the first hit was a fluke double by Chris Taylor when center fielder Eric Young Jr. lost track of his fly ball. Brandon Morrow allowed a hit in two innings of relief for Maeda. The Dodgers have won 17 of their last 19 games. The loss snapped the Angels' modest three-game winning streak. The series continues with games in Anaheim on Wednesday and Thursday. NOTES: Angels CF Cameron Maybin was out of the lineup, getting a day off. DH Albert Pujols, who played first base Monday in the interleague game, also did not play. ... The Dodgers had four starters out of the lineup: SS Corey Seager (hamstring), RF Yasiel Puig (hamstring), 3B Justin Turner (rest) and C Yasmani Grandal. ... Puig had his one-game suspension rescinded by Major League Baseball. He will make a donation to a charity in lieu of missing a game. The punishment stems from him making an obscene gesture during a recent game.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED6S8RQKWZ"},

Financial spreadbetters see weaker openings for European markets, with Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 all seen losing ground in early trade. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.4 percent, pulling further away from more than two-year highs probed earlier this week. On Monday, it touched its highest level since May 2015  We've had a pretty good run,  said Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies.  I suspect what people have owned has done very well, and they want to sell some of those positions.  Japan's Nikkei share average ended down 0.5 percent, facing headwinds from the dollar's reversal of its rise against the yen. But the banking and insurance sectors outperformed on expectations of higher rates. The yield on U.S. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 2.213 percent in Asian trade, above its U.S. close of 2.198 percent on Tuesday. It rose from 2.14 percent late on Monday after Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that it is appropriate to gradually raise U.S. rates.  Yellen's comment is supporting Japanese financial stocks today, and for the long-term, Japanese stocks are on the rising trend supported by U.S.-led global economic recovery,  said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. On Tuesday, the benchmark S&P; 500 posted its biggest one-day drop in about six weeks and closed at its lowest point since May 31, after the U.S. Senate's move to delay voting on a healthcare reform bill rekindled worries on the timeline for President Donald Trump's business-friendly policies. U.S. stocks accelerated their losses after Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to put off a planned vote on a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act until after the Senate's July 4 recess, to get more time to garner sufficient votes for its passage. Against the perceived safe-haven yen, the dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 112.135 after rising as high as 112.285 yen, its highest since May 17. The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major counterparts, edged down 0.1 percent to 96.300, well below its previous session high of 97.447. The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.13610 after rising to a one-year high of $1.13665 after Draghi, speaking to a conference in Portugal, said the ECB could adjust its policy tools as economic prospects improve in Europe. Some strategists said that once the dust settled from the impact of his comments, the euro could give back some of its gains.  To me, it seems the change in policy will not be very substantial, so I think in the coming days, ECB officials will try to water down Draghi's comments,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. The greenback slumped against the Canadian dollar after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told CNBC in an interview that it looks as if the central bank's rate cuts have done their job. The U.S. dollar was down 0.4 percent at C$1.3144, after plumbing its lowest levels since February. Crude oil futures gave back some of their overnight surge. Prices rose nearly 2 percent on Tuesday on the weaker dollar, short-covering and expectations that U.S. crude inventories might decline for a third consecutive week. Brent crude futures were down 0.2 percent at $46.55 per barrel. U.S. crude futures were down 0.5 percent at $44.04. The weaker dollar helped bolster spot gold, which was up 0.4 percent at 1,251.59 per ounce.

NetLink lodged a preliminary prospectus on 27 June 2017 for a listing on the Singapore Exchange mainboard, and expects to raise net proceeds of up to SGD2.6 billion. The public offer comes ahead of a mandated April 2018 deadline set by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) to divest its shareholdings in NetLink to less than 25%. Fitch forecasts Singtel's FFO-adjusted net leverage for financial year ending March 2018 (FY18) at around our downgrade trigger of 2.0x (FY17: 2.2x), following the completion of the USD310 million Turn acquisition in April 2017. Our projections assume Singtel will use SGD1.5 billion of the proceeds from the divestment of NetLink towards deleveraging in FY18. The listing is timely, as the group undergoes heavy capex expansion to drive its mobile and ICT businesses, as well as large spectrum payments in Singapore and Australia. Singtel expects to spend SGD2.4 billion in cash capex, and another SGD1.0 billion in spectrum payments in FY18. Following the IPO, Singtel will continue to hold a less than 25% stake in NetLink, which owns and operates the passive infrastructure for Singapore's next-generation national broadband network (NGNBN). The divestment will nonetheless have only a limited impact on Singtel's EBITDA. The business trust is already equity accounted at the parent company despite Singtel's 100%-ownership due to the absence of effective control in the trust - in line with IMDA's structural separation requirements for NGNBN.

However, the rupee was under pressure on an expected rise in imports. The spot rupee, which has been trading for the seventh straight session after being inactive for six weeks, traded at 153.32/40 per dollar at 0536 GMT, unchanged from Tuesday's close. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5 when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50.  The (dollar) demand is there and state banks were on the buying side, probably to cover import bills,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Dealers said they expect seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. Investors shrugged off a policy rate decision by the central bank, which held key rates steady as expected, dealers said. The central bank kept its benchmark interest rate steady on Friday, saying the current monetary policy was appropriate as it expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank said it would allow gradual depreciation of the currency and set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year, mainly to meet a target set by the International Monetary Fund for a three-year $1.5 billion loan. Analysts have said that if the U.S. Federal Reserves tightens monetary policy more aggressively than the market expects over the coming months, there is a risk of further falls in the rupee against the U.S. dollar.

Speculation mounted last week that Governor Carney's grip on decision-making at the BoE was weakening when chief economist Andy Haldane said he might break ranks and join dissenters who voted this month for Britain's first rate hike in a decade. But Cunliffe said he wanted more time to see how improvements in business investment and exports could compensate for a consumer slowdown before deciding to raise interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent. He stressed weak wage growth and said the lesson from the last few years was that Britain's economy had not generated much domestic inflation pressure, despite a sharp fall in unemployment. Asked in a BBC radio interview if now was the right time to raise interest rates, Cunliffe said:  (Consumer spending) is slowing as households' real incomes are squeezed by higher inflation, we expect some of that slowing to be offset by growth in business investment, growth in exports. And I want to see how that plays out.   (We) do have to look at what's happening to domestic inflation pressure, and I think that on the data we have at the moment, gives us a bit of time to see how this evolves,  Cunliffe said. Earlier this month the BoE said a recent jump in inflation to 2.9 percent meant it was likely to exceed 3 percent this autumn - higher than the BoE forecast just a few weeks ago and well above its 2 percent inflation target. Three out of eight members of the Monetary Policy Committee unexpectedly voted to raise interest rates, jolting financial markets. The ninth seat on the MPC is currently vacant. The unexpectedly tight vote added questions over monetary policy to uncertainty over Britain's political outlook since Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a parliamentary majority in an election earlier in the month. Cunliffe said inflation overshooting the BoE's target was  not a comfortable place  for any member of the MPC. But he said it was important to consider how much of the overshoot was generated domestically, rather than as a product of the pound's fall in the aftermath of last year's Brexit vote. Cunliffe highlighted that average earnings excluding bonuses rose at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the three months to April, the weakest increase since January 2015. Even with Haldane's surprise intervention last week, most economists think interest rates are unlikely to rise in the next few months. One of the three MPC members who voted to hike rates, Kristin Forbes, has completed her term and has been replaced by Silvana Tenreyro, a trade-focused London School of Economics academic. On Tuesday, the BoE tightened its controls on bank credit to more normal levels, deciding the risk had passed of a big hit to the economy and to lending after last year's Brexit vote.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Only a year after throwing caution to the wind to shore up the UK economy following the shock Brexit referendum result, the Bank of England is in a bind. At the centre of the problem is the exchange rate. Sterling's plunge since the Brexit vote is fueling the highest inflation in four years. But that very inflation is eroding earnings, squeezing consumers and hampering growth. If the Bank keeps policy loose to ride out the economic slowdown, it risks triggering another slide in sterling and subsequent jump in inflation. If on the other hand it tightens to curb inflation, it risks hitting consumers and homeowners where it hurts. Or maybe there's a third way. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee on Tuesday raised capital requirements for UK banks to tackle the growing risk of lax lending, forcing them to set aside an extra 11.4 billion pounds. This could be increased in November, the Bank said.  Consumer credit has been growing much faster than household incomes,  the BoE said, adding that there were  pockets of risks that warrant vigilance.  The consumer also figures prominently in the sudden shift of sentiment on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee that has made an interest rate hike more likely than at any time in a decade. Annual inflation is 2.9 percent, well above the Bank's 2 percent target and unnerving a growing number of policymakers that it could spiral out of control. Economists at Nomura even think the BoE will raise rates at its next meeting in August. But where are these inflationary pressures coming from? Wage growth has for years undershot the Bank's expectations and the economy is slowing as Brexit gets underway. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reckons the UK economy will grow 1 percent next year, the lowest growth of all 32 countries in its global outlook bar one. If the OECD is right, Britain will be the only one of these 32 countries to post slowing growth over the four years 2014-2018. Few observers see strong domestic inflation pressures. Sole Driver Although the world economy is in its rudest health for six years, global inflation is low too. The global price of oil has fallen 20 percent in the last two months to around $45 a barrel. If oil prices stay where they are, some measures of headline U.S. and euro zone consumer price inflation will likely be below 1 percent early next year, predict economists at Citi. Ultimately, the Bank of England's inflation worries come down to one thing: sterling. The narrow 5-3 vote to keep rates on hold at the last MPC meeting and chief economist Andy Haldane's Damascene conversion last week to consider voting for higher rates show that the exchange rate is the key variable in setting policy. Haldane estimated that the currency's 3 percent fall since the Bank's May Inflation Report would mechanically add around 0.2 percentage points to growth and inflation over the next two to three years. The BoE doesn't specifically target the exchange rate, and policymakers do their best to avoid commenting on it publicly. But while they'd never say it, the last thing they want is another wave of depreciation that will lift the cost of imports and inflation even higher. For example, a slide to $1.20 in the coming months from $1.27 currently isn't a far-fetched scenario. It would represent a fall of nearly 6 percent, adding a further 0.4 percentage points to inflation over the coming years, by Haldane's metrics. The British public's longer-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years rose to 3.1 percent in June from 3.0 percent in May, Citi said last week. That's close to February's peak of 3.2 percent. Another sterling slide would probably result in a new high. The Bank refrained from raising rates when inflation hit 5 percent in 2011, when the post-crisis recovery was fragile and in its infancy. Now, the global economy and banking system is in better shape, so a policy response to inflation is more likely. The BoE's problem is exacerbated by the yield curve. Yields are falling and the curve is its flattest since October. With stock markets rising - the FTSE 100 hit a record high this month - financial conditions are easing, not tightening. A stable or higher exchange rate will help offset that and bring inflation back to target.

Some 12 hours later, the Boston bench coach and local product was a winner in his managerial debut as the Red Sox blasted the Minnesota Twins 9-2 in the second contest of a four-game series.  Growing up around here, I don't think I'm going to appreciate it until the season's over and looking back and having a day like this,  DiSarcina said after the Red Sox beat the Twins for the second straight night to move into first place in the American League East.  It was different, but it's part of the job.  The game was delayed 50 minutes at the start and then for 1:16 after the second inning. Red Sox starter Drew Pomeranz (7-4) was perfect in the two innings before the delay, and he kept himself warm enough to come back out. He got through five innings and notched his first win in four starts.  Very impressed,  DiSarcina said.  We hit the stopwatch as soon as the tarp was pulled to go on. He did a great job staying loose in between ... kept heat on his arm, he rode the bike, played a little toss, kept his body warm, so it was very impressive. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at Red SoxMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatch Usually like 45 minutes, an hour, it's pretty close, you're pushing it (to having a pitcher return from a delay), but talking to Carl (Willis, the pitching coach), seeing how he was going to respond after his first inning out there ... I think the first pitch was hit off the wall and then Christian (Vazquez) threw (Eddie Rosario) out at third base on the stolen base, and he settled down after that.  Vazquez snapped a 265-at-bat homerless streak with a two-run shot before the rain, Chris Young hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning, and Dustin Pedroia had three hits, a walk, an RBI and two runs in the rout. With the New York Yankees surrendering a late lead and losing to the Chicago White Sox, the Red Sox (43-34) moved into first by one game. The Twins (39-36) remain a half-game behind the Cleveland Indians in the AL Central. Pomeranz allowed only an unearned run and four hits while striking out seven. It was his first career start allowing no earned runs and no walks while striking out seven or more.  It was kind of crazy,  he said.  I didn't even realize it was supposed to rain at all tonight. I found out about two minutes before I was about to go out and get ready for a normal start time. I didn't know there was a second cell coming, either.  His mound opponent, Hector Santiago, wasn't around after the second delay. He came off the disabled list to make the start and became a hard-luck loser because of the Vazquez homer. Santiago yielded two runs in two innings. He has lost six in a row and is 4-7 with a 5.37 ERA after starting the season 4-1, 2.76.  Kind of a strange game in that you played two innings and then you go through the long delay right out of the chute,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  I guess they kind of miscalculated there.  Long night. I've seen some really good games here and I've seen some ugly ones, and that would fall in the latter category for sure.  DiSarcina had a different perspective.  Your day kind of changes, in preparation, obviously talking to Carl about the pitching and talking to John about the pitching before he left ... it's a lot of fun,  he said.  It's a lot of adrenaline. I can see and appreciate the trials and the tribulations and the struggles John goes through daily, and nightly, when it comes to removing a pitcher in a game, making those tough decisions because it's difficult.  Rosario, who made three fine catches in left field Monday night, had three hits. Eduardo Escobar led off the eighth inning with his eighth homer of the season. The Twins made three errors, leading to five unearned runs. NOTES: Red Sox manager John Farrell said Major League Baseball allowing a pool reporter to talk to umpires after games is a step toward making umps accountable for their actions. He also remained adamant he was right in protesting a balk call on Saturday. ... Boston DH Hanley Ramirez was out for a second straight game with a bruised left knee. ... RHP Dillon Gee, sent to the minors to make room for Twins LHP Hector Santiago, will pitch, either as a starter or reliever, for Triple-A Rochester on Wednesday and could be back with Minnesota soon. ... Twins INF Ehire Adrianza, on the disabled list with an abdominal problem, starts a rehab assignment Wednesday. ...

That is largely thanks to big investments in infrastructure from Beijing as the region - with its links to much of central Asia - is critical to Chinese  President Xi Jinping’s new Silk Road initiative. But traders, business owners and residents in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, are seeing little benefit from the central government's cash injection, according to about 20 interviews with people in the city. One major reason for that, they say, is due to tightened security as the Chinese government seeks to control one of its biggest domestic threats. Beijing accuses separatist extremists among the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority of plotting attacks on the ethnic Han majority in Xinjiang and other parts of China, following a series of violent events in recent years. As a result, there are roadblocks and stringent security checks across the region, including at restaurants, hotels and shops, making it slow and frustrating to move around. The new Silk Road, officially known as the Belt and Road initiative, is Xi’s signature foreign and economic policy which aims to increase economic and political ties through roads, railways and other projects that link China to Central Asia and beyond. But the contrast between that ambition and the views at street level in Urumqi reflects the difficulty Beijing faces in trying to balance security against its other top priorities. This is particularly the case as China is determined to avoid any trouble ahead of a critical Communist Party congress in the autumn at which Xi is expected to consolidate his power, and as it faces the threat from some Uighurs who have become battle-hardened Islamic State fighters in the war in Syria and Iraq and may return home. Deliveries Difficult The impact of the clampdown is clear at the Frontier International Trade Centre in Urumqi,  where padlocked stores outnumber traders.  Business became really bad last year. I've got nothing to do except a stock-take,  said Wei Chun, a shoe trader, surrounded by piles of high-heels. She blames poor sales partly on the impact of sluggish economies in neighbours Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, among the eight countries with which Xinjiang has borders.  But she also says the Chinese authorities’ obsession with keeping Xinjiang secure at all costs is making it tough to do business here.  It's very difficult to send and receive deliveries because of the security crackdown,” she said, complaining that authorities will often shut down the delivery system for “security reasons”. The Xinjiang government declined to make officials available for comment for this article. It also did not respond to a series of faxed questions. Xu Bin, the head of the Xinjiang government’s statistics bureau,  told reporters in February that its growth – which was 7.6 percent last year - is mostly fuelled by fixed asset investment. But he then added: “Xinjiang faces slowing economic growth, falling industrial prices, companies are feeling the pain of falling profits and the growth rate of our tax revenue has dropped off.” Xinjiang's trade with other countries fell in the first quarter of this year, according to the customs bureau, and is still below the level it recorded in the first quarter of 2013, the year that Belt and Road launched. Much of that drop was because a slump in the rouble in 2014-2015 hurt Xinjiang’s neighbours, and following the 2015 establishment of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). That aims to develop Central Asia and lessen its reliance on Chinese goods. Events Cancelled People here point to many disruptions in ordinary life as one reason the economy doesn’t feel buoyant at street level. Group gatherings, whether for charity fun runs or trade expos, are often banned or cancelled at the last minute, they say. Phone lines sometimes go dead, and there's no 4G internet because the authorities fear high-speed internet would help militants organize. While Belt and Road has created opportunities, small businesses complain these projects often reward large state-owned enterprises.  The Belt and Road Initiative doesn't help small businessmen like me,” said Zhou Bangquan who sells men's shoes in Urumqi. “It helps big state-owned enterprises that do energy or have big infrastructure projects.  Among the projects financed are a highway to Pakistan and a network of high-speed railroads connecting cities in Xinjiang and the rest of China, with 1.5 trillion yuan ($220 billion) in capital investment expected in the region this year alone. But it is unclear how much of the money is used to buy materials from factories outside the region or ends up being sent to other provinces by workers brought in temporarily from elsewhere in China. It’s not just heightened security measures that concern businesses. People are required to attend flag ceremonies and other patriotic education, instead of working, say locals. Such events are meant to encourage Uighurs to become patriotic Chinese citizens but can also be used to monitor their behaviour. Patriotic Education  I'm losing my mind, I've already had six staff sent back to their hometowns this past month for study,  said a restaurant manager in Urumqi who, like many people Reuters spoke to in Xinjiang, declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. His Uighur staff were required to return home to southern Xinjiang for one month's study of Mandarin Chinese, another month learning about China's legal system and a month of vocational training, he said.  We all spend so much time doing things that aren't our actual jobs. I have to take my staff to watch a flag-raising forty weeks of the year. If I don't, I will be taken away for thirty days of study,  he said. As well as the time spent on such matters, Uighurs – who represent just over 45 percent of the population – are being increasingly marginalized by the Han Chinese, undermining the overall economy. Three Han Chinese entrepreneurs told Reuters local authorities had told them not to employ Uighurs. And a Han Chinese real estate agent in Urumqi said he had been told not to sell properties to Uighurs from southern Xinjiang. There has been a change in attitude towards balancing stability and economic growth in Xinjiang since Chen Quanguo became its new Communist Party boss last August in what analysts say was an implicit endorsement of his previous hard-line management of ethnic strife in Tibet.  Xinjiang used to have a policy of 'with one hand we maintain stability, with the other hand we grow the economy' but now it's just 'maintain stability with both hands, at all costs',  said a local businessman and former government official. Chen said in a speech last September that  all our work in Xinjiang revolves around maintaining a tight grip on stability.

Official data for domestic production, imports via pipelines and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) show the total amount of natural gas available in China in the first five months of the year was the equivalent of 72.01 million tonnes of LNG. This was up nine percent, or 5.94 million tonnes, on the 66.07 million tonnes that were either pumped domestically or imported in the first five months of 2016. China has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in energy consumption from 5.9 percent in 2015 to 10 percent in 2020, an average annual increase of 4.1 percent. So far this year, China's output and imports of the fuel are running at more than double the annual rate needed to reach the official target. The biggest gainer has been imports of LNG, which are up 38.4 percent in the first five months of 2017 to 12.86 million tonnes, while pipeline imports have dropped 4.4 percent to 12.65 million tonnes. Domestic natural gas production has been a strong gainer, rising almost 7 percent in the January to May period to 62.88 billion cubic metres, equivalent to 46.5 million tonnes of LNG. The rise in natural gas output stands in sharp contrast to the decline in crude oil production, which fell to the lowest on record in May as output declines from older fields. Natural gas has also outperformed coal, with domestic output of the polluting fuel up 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes in the first five months of the year. The jump in imports of LNG shows how the super-chilled fuel is becoming more competitive with pipeline imports from central Asia. Customs data from May shows that the average landed cost of LNG was $7.28 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This is higher than the $5.25 per mmBtu of pipeline imports, however, the customs price excludes the cost of internal pipeline and distribution, meaning imports from central Asia still have to pay to get from the border to demand centres. In contrast, much of the LNG is consumed near to where it is offloaded and re-gasified, meaning it doesn't suffer from the additional costs associated with the pipeline imports. Lng from Australia Surges Among China's LNG suppliers Australia has fared best, with imports rising 42.7 percent in the first five months to 5.39 million tonnes, almost double that of second-placed Qatar at 2.84 million tonnes. Malaysia is the third-biggest supplier to China, with 1.82 million tonnes in the first five months, up 90 percent from the same period in 2016. The price being paid by China for LNG tells part of the story, with cargoes from Australia landing at $6.80 per mmBtu in May, well below the $8.95 for Qatar and slightly ahead of the $6.49 for Malaysia. Australia's price advantage is still largely tied to the 25-year supply deal from the North West Shelf venture, signed in 2002 at a fixed price of $3.80 per mmBtu. At the time it was Australia's biggest export deal and hailed as a breakthrough in accessing China's markets, with former prime minister John Howard calling deal a  gold medal performance.  Since then, as spot LNG prices first rose dramatically to peak at over $20 per mmBtu in 2014, the deal was seen as too generous to the Chinese, given it lacked any mechanism for re-negotiation or linking the price to crude oil, as is common in most long-term LNG contracts. The spot price of Asian LNG LNG-AS was $5.40 per mmBtu in the week to June 23, down from the northern winter peak this year of $9.40 in early January. This means China is still paying more for its LNG than the spot price, but not so much as to make LNG imports uncompetitive against pipeline supplies. LNG imports in June appear set to remain robust, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts showing 2.7 million tonnes has already been discharged, or is discharging, at Chinese ports as of Tuesday. With three days still remaining in the month, the data suggests that an additional eight vessels carrying 560,000 tonnes may discharge before the end of June, taking total imports for the month to around 3.26 million tonnes. While natural gas has policy support boosting its use in China, it remains more expensive than coal when used to generate electricity. The best chance for natural gas to continue to make inroads is not only for LNG prices to remain relatively low, but also for the authorities in Beijing to push for natural gas to be used more in areas like residential heating and smaller factories, many of which still use coal.

Operating through its Hong Kong catering and retail arm Best Food Holding (1488.HK), Hony Capital will kick-off its hospitality expansion by launching one of its Chinese cuisine outlet brands in London by year end, managing director Bruce Wang told Reuters in an interview.   When we were working on the takeover of PizzaExpress in Britain, we struggled to find a nice Chinese restaurant at the time. Given the large Chinese population residing there and lack of authentic Chinese food chains, it's a huge opportunity for us,  said Wang. Hong Kong-based Best Food, which currently has over 150 stores in mainland China, will open new outlets of its Beijing Hehegu fast food chain in London's business districts with a localised menu that should also be palatable for Western customers, he said.  If Beijing Hehegu can make a success in the U.K., other Best Food's Chinese cuisine brands will certainly follow the lead,  Wang said.  Hony Capital's food and beverages global growth push comes at a time when the restaurant industry is seeing intense competition that has hurt sales at giants such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).  Wang did not comment on the investment needed for Hony Capital's growth plan or how it will be financed but said funding won't be a hurdle to its ambitions.   Hony, which has $10 billion under management and is backed by Legend Holdings Corp (3396.HK) - parent of personal computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) - bought PizzaExpress for about 900 million pounds in 2014. It plans to boost the British restaurant's numbers in mainland China to more than 200 by 2021 from the current 35, Wang said. He added Best Food hoped to leverage PizzaExpress's distribution network and client base in Britain, where it has nearly 500 restaurants - although the company would have to overcome global concerns over Chinese food safety standards following a series of scandals in the country. Wang said Best Food will try to source more than 50 percent of its ingredients locally and continue to team up with large Chinese suppliers to ensure food safety.   Hony's founder John Zhao told Reuters in February that the private equity firm would continue to scout for acquisition targets abroad - including in the United States - to further its expansion, while looking for investment targets closer to home. Late last year Hony was a lead investor in a $11.5 million fundraising round by Chinese burger franchise Xishaoye Roujiamo which is also looking to enter the British market.

The report, which also investigated the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, made no suggestion that either Russia or Qatar should lose the right to stage the tournament, despite detailing numerous attempts to influence voting officials. The 430-page report had been under wraps since being completed by FIFA's then-ethics investigator Michael Garcia in November 2014.  FIFA, soccer's global governing body, chose to publish on Tuesday after the document was leaked to the German newspaper Bild.  Although we question the timing of the leak, we welcome the publication of the Garcia report,  Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said in a statement.  We believe that the extent of our cooperation with this investigation and the conclusions drawn represent a vindication of the integrity of our bid.  Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup and Qatar the 2022 tournament in a single vote in Zurich in December, 2010. Qatar will be the first country in the Middle East to host the tournament. In the report, Garcia wrote that Qatar  may not have met the standards set out in the FIFA code of ethics or the bid rules  but added, in mitigation, that it only was due to its cooperation that the issues were uncovered.    Qatar said earlier this month a rift with fellow Gulf Arab states that includes economic sanctions on Doha has not affected its preparations to host the World Cup, and alternative sources for construction materials had been secured. FIFA has said it is in  regular contact  with Qatar, after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt severed ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting Iran and funding Islamist groups. Qatar denies the charges. In the running alongside Russia to stage the 2018 World Cup were England and joint bids from Spain/Portugal and the Netherlands/Belgium. Qatar's rivals for the 2022 tournament were Australia, Japan, the United States and South Korea. Football Federation Australia, whose publicly funded $35 million-bid to host the 2022 World Cup garnered one vote, also welcomed the report and said it contained no new  substantive  matters which have not already been investigated or reported.   FFA has said repeatedly that the bid process for 2018 and 2022 was deeply flawed and that mistakes were made by the Australian bid team,  read a statement.    However, FFA notes that FIFA continues to reform its governance, including relating to future tournament bids, and is confident mistakes of the past will not be repeated.

The 10,000-tonne warship was launched at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, the official Xinhua news agency said, making it the first of the People's Liberation Army Navy's  new generation  destroyers.  It is equipped with new air defence, anti-missile, anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons,  Xinhua said, without giving further details. The state-run Global Times newspaper said the ship was believed to be the first Type 055 destroyer, which is considered to be a successor class to the smaller Type 052D guided missile destroyers. China is still producing the latter and commissioned one, the Xining, in January. Chinese media showed photos of the new ship covered in streamers and flags and flanked by rows of sailors. The vessel will have to undergo planned testing before it is commissioned into use. China is producing warships at a rapid clip as it modernises its navy, which has been taking an increasingly prominent role among the country's armed forces. State media has said that the navy commissioned 18 ships, including destroyers, corvettes and guided-missile frigates in 2016. In April, China launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier, a conventionally powered ship that likely won't enter service until 2020. China's naval build-up, and it's increasingly assertive stance over disputed territory in the South China, has unnerved its neighbours. China claims almost all the South China Sea, believed to have huge deposits of oil and gas, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, and has been building up military facilities like runways on the islands it controls. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.

He got it and came through in a big way. Abreu's walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth gave the Chicago White Sox a comeback 4-3 victory over the New York Yankees. In the eighth inning, Abreu came up with bases loaded and nobody out trailing 3-1, but he struck out swinging against Yankees reliever Tyler Clippard.  In the inning after that at-bat where I struck out, I went to thinking, 'God, please give me one more opportunity. Give me one more opportunity to do my job.' I'm glad that I got that opportunity because I was able to help my team win the game and it was very special for me,  Abreu said through an interpreter. The single capped off what White Sox manager Rick Renteria referred to as  an interesting last two innings.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi may have a different description for the final two innings, when his bullpen walked six batters and hit another, blowing the 3-1 lead they had grabbed in the top of the eighth.  We put ourselves in a position to win and we just gave too many free base runners in the last two innings,  said Girardi. The bullpen implosion overshadowed sensational starting pitching on both sides. Yankees righty Luis Severino was overpowering with a career-high 12 strikeouts while giving up only one earned run. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at White SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch He threw the ball well,  Girardi said.  He had a really good slider tonight and a really good fastball. He threw some good changeups, I think he mixed them in well. ... You hope it's going to be enough, but it wasn't.  White Sox southpaw Jose Quintana continued his scintillating June, giving up zero runs in 6 1/3 innings while striking out six.  I feel pretty good. I try to do the same as the last couple of starts,  said Quintana, who is sporting a 1.78 ERA in June.  I threw pretty good. All of my command was good. I'm happy with that when I keep doing the same. I want to put my team in a really good position.  Quintana has gone 17 innings without allowing a run. The White Sox (33-43) had given him 22 runs of run support in his past two starts, but scored only one Tuesday night for him on an RBI double from Abreu in the third inning.  It's just been him commanding the zone, attacking. A lot more strikes,  said Renteria.  He still had some at-bats today where he got to 3-2, but then he'd execute, he'd finish and make a pitch that induced a very weak fly ball or groundballs.  The Yankees rallied with two outs in the top of the eighth thanks to clutch hitting from Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez. Judge hit a single up the middle off White Sox reliever Tommy Kahnle for his 60th RBI, driving in pinch-hitter Tyler Wade, who worked a walk in his first major league at-bat. With Judge on first and Jacoby Ellsbury on second, catcher Gary Sanchez drilled the second pitch he saw from Kahnle to the right-center gap for a two-run double to put the Yankees (41-34) ahead. Dan Jennings (3-1) relieved Kahnle and pitched a scoreless 1 1/3 innings for the win. Yankees relievers Domingo German and Tyler Clippard each walked two batters in the eighth, as the White Sox cut the lead to 3-2. In the ninth inning, Dellin Betances (3-2) -- pitching for the third day in a row -- induced a lead-off groundout to shortstop Tim Anderson before back-to-back walks and then a hit batter. Melky Cabrera fouled out to shallow left before Abreu stepped to the plate and hit a grounder through the whole on the left side for the victory.  (Betances) was just a little off tonight,  Girardi said. In the series opener, the White Sox scored four in the ninth in a 6-5 loss. On Tuesday night, they could celebrate their late-inning offense.  For them to get that right now after coming back last night, today finishing it, I think it's a huge lift for them,  said Renteria.  At least today, they experienced the joys of being able to battle and come out on top. Those are huge victories morally speaking.  NOTES: Yankees 2B Starlin Castro went on the 10-day disabled list with a Grade 1 right hamstring strain. ... Yankees RF Aaron Judge's walk in the first inning extended his streak to 29 consecutive games reaching base. ... The White Sox optioned RHP Juan Minaya to Triple-A Charlotte following the game. LHP Carlos Rodon will make his first start of the 2017 season Wednesday. He had been on the DL with bursitis in his left biceps.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED6S8OV7UI"},

Platts, a unit of S&P; Global Inc, initiated a review on June 6 on the deliverability of crude loading from Qatari ports in its Middle East crude price assessments after Saudi Arabia and the other states moved to isolate Qatar over charges that it was supporting terrorism.

The latest round of voting covers parts of the restive southern plains that border India and there are concerns about possible violence after Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN), a group that dominates the area, said it would boycott the vote and called for a general strike. In 2015 and 2016 scores of people were killed, mainly in clashes with police, in protests by the local ethnic Madhesi against a new constitution that they say leaves them marginalized and favors those living in the hills of the Himalayan nation. The Madhesis are demanding a unified homeland, and greater participation in state organs including parliament, the judiciary, bureaucracy and the national army.   Elections cannot be held before our demands are met,” said Hridayesh Tripathi, a RJPN leader.  The local elections - the first in Nepal since 1997 - mark an attempt by the government to restore democracy at the local level hit by a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006 and years of instability after the monarchy was abolished in 2008.  This election will empower local bodies and open the floodgate of social and economic prosperity,  President Bidya Devi Bhandari said in a statement. Television channels showed lines of voters carrying umbrellas bearing candidates' pictorial symbols including a glass, torch light, house and rhinoceros, but no names. The first phase of municipal polls was held on May 14 and a final round is set for September 18 after the end of the monsoon rains. Local polls serve as a barometer of public opinion ahead of parliamentary elections expected before the year end.  (This story was refiled to add missing words in 8th paragraph.)

The rapidly spreading cyber extortion campaign, which began on Tuesday, underscored growing concerns that businesses have failed to secure their networks from increasingly aggressive hackers, who have shown they are capable of shutting down critical infrastructure and crippling corporate and government networks. Businesses in the Asia-Pacific region reported some disruptions on Wednesday with the operations of several European companies hit, including India's largest container port, although the impact on companies and governments across the wider region appeared to be limited. The ransomware virus includes code known as  Eternal Blue , which cyber security experts widely believe was stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and was also used in last month's ransomware attack, named  WannaCry .  Cyber attacks can simply destroy us,  said Kevin Johnson, chief executive of cyber security firm Secure Ideas.  Companies are just not doing what they are supposed to do to fix the problem.  The virus crippled computers running Microsoft Corp's Windows by encrypting hard drives and overwriting files, then demanded $300 in bitcoin payments to restore access. More than 30 victims paid into the bitcoin account associated with the attack, according to a public ledger of transactions listed on blockchain.info. Microsoft said the virus could spread through a flaw that was patched in a security update in March.  We are continuing to investigate and will take appropriate action to protect customers,  a spokesman for the company said, adding that Microsoft antivirus software detects and removes it. Australia, India Hit Operations at one of the three terminals of Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) in Mumbai, India's largest container port, were disrupted. The impacted terminal is operated by Danish shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk, which also reported disruptions in Los Angeles. JNPT chairman Anil Diggikar told Reuters the port has been trying to clear containers manually and is operating at about a third of its capacity. India-based employees at Beiersdorf, makers of Nivea skin care products, and Reckitt Benckiser, which owns Enfamil and Lysol, told Reuters the ransomware attack had affected some of their systems. In Australia, a Cadbury chocolate factory was hit, a trade union official said. Production at the Hobart factory on the island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Cadbury owner Mondelez International Inc said in a statement overnight staff in various regions were experiencing technical problems but it was unclear whether this was due to a cyber attack. Cybersecurity firms Kaspersky Lab and FireEye Inc told Reuters they had detected attacks in other Asia-Pacific countries but did not provide details. Globally, Russia and Ukraine were most affected by the thousands of attacks, according to Kaspersky Lab, with other victims spread across countries including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United States. The total number of attacks was unknown. Security experts said they expected the impact to be smaller than WannaCry because many computers had been patched with Windows updates in the wake of the WannaCry ransom attack last month to protect them against attacks using Eternal Blue code. Still, the attack could be more dangerous than traditional strains of ransomware because it makes computers unresponsive and unable to reboot, Juniper Networks said in a blog post analysing the attack. Other security experts said they did not believe that the ransomware released on Tuesday had a  kill switch , meaning that it might be harder to stop than WannaCry was last month. Researchers said the attack may have borrowed malware code used in earlier ransomware campaigns known as  Petya  and  GoldenEye . Following last month's attack, governments, security firms and industrial groups aggressively advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft patches to defend against the threat. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was monitoring the attacks and coordinating with other countries. It advised victims not to pay the extortion, saying that doing so did not guarantee access would be restored. 'Don't Waste Your Time' The White House National Security Council said in a statement there was currently no risk to public safety. The United States was investigating the attack and determined to hold those responsible accountable, it said. The NSA did not respond to a request for comment. The spy agency has not said publicly whether it built Eternal Blue and other hacking tools leaked online by an entity known as Shadow Brokers. Several private security experts have said they believe Shadow Brokers is tied to the Russian government, and that the North Korean government was behind WannaCry. Both countries' governments deny charges they are involved in hacking. The first attacks were reported from Russia and Ukraine. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said its systems had suffered  serious consequences  but said oil production had not been affected because it switched over to backup systems. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Pavlo Rozenko said the government's computer network went down and the central bank reported disruption to operations at banks and firms, including the state power distributor. WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, said it was also infected. A WPP employee who asked not to be identified said workers were told to shut down their computers.  The building has come to a standstill,  the employee said. A Ukrainian media company said its computers were blocked and had received the ransom demand.  Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service,  the message said, according to a screenshot posted on Ukraine's Channel 24. Russia's central bank said there were isolated cases of lenders' IT systems being infected. One consumer lender, Home Credit, had to suspend client operations.

The delay put the future of a longtime top Republican priority in doubt amid concerns about the Senate bill from both moderate and conservative Republicans. With Democrats united in their opposition, Republicans can afford to lose only two votes among their own ranks in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been pushing for a vote ahead of the July 4 recess that starts at the end of the week. The legislation would repeal major elements of Obamacare and shrink the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor.  We're going to press on,  McConnell said after announcing the delay, adding that leaders would keep working to make senators  comfortable  with the bill.  We're optimistic we're going to get to a result that is better than the status quo.  At the White House meeting with most of the 52 Republican senators, Trump said it was vital to reach agreement on the Senate healthcare measure because Obamacare was  melting down.    So we're going to talk and we're going to see what we can do. We're getting very close,  Trump told the senators. But he added,  If we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like, and that's okay.  McConnell, whose party has a razor-thin majority in the 100-member Senate, told reporters that Republican leaders would work through the week to win over the 50 senators needed to pass the bill, with a vote planned after the recess. Vice President Mike Pence could provide the crucial vote needed to break a tie.  I think we can get 50 votes to yes by the end of the week,  Republican Senator Roger Wicker said after the White House meeting. Related CoverageTop Senate Republican expresses optimism on healthcare bill after Trump meetingRepublican Opposition Grows The House of Representatives last month passed its own version of a healthcare bill, but the Senate bill has been criticized from both the left and the right. Moderate Republicans worried millions of people would lose their insurance. Conservatives said the bill does not do enough to erase Obamacare. The bill's prospects were not helped by a Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday saying it would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade, although it would reduce the federal deficit by $321 billion over that period. The report prompted Senator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, to say she could not support the bill as it stands. At least four conservative Republican senators said they were still opposed after the CBO analysis. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Senate Republicans about healthcare in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017. Trump is flanked by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).Kevin LamarqueThree more Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said after the delay was announced that they oppose the current draft. Portman and Capito cited the bill's Medicaid cutbacks and how that would hurt efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that has taken a heavy toll in their states. The Medicaid program was expanded under former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.  I think giving time to digest is a good thing,  Republican Senator Bob Corker said after the delay was announced.  Uncertainty  on Wall Street Slideshow (12 Images)U.S. stock prices fell, as the decision to postpone the vote added to investor worries about Trump's ability to deliver on his promises of tax reform and deregulation, as well as changes to the health sector. Those expected changes have driven a rally in U.S. stocks this year. The benchmark S&P; 500 index closed down 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.46 percent. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty. What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration?  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions Inc. Passing the measure would be a win for Trump as he seeks to shift attention after weeks of questions over Russia's role in last year's U.S. presidential election. McConnell has promised since 2010 that Republicans, who view Obamacare as a costly government intrusion, would destroy the law  root and branch  if they controlled Congress and the White House. Republicans worry a failure to deliver will cost them votes in next year's congressional elections. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, it will either have to be approved by the House or the two chambers would reconcile the differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and send it back to the Senate. Lawmakers are expected to leave town by Friday for their July 4 holiday break, which runs all next week. The Senate returns to work on July 10, the House on July 11. Lawmakers then have three weeks in session before their month-long August recess.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1345, having hit a high of around $1.1355 earlier on Wednesday, its strongest level since August 2016. The common currency has gained 1.4 percent this week. The euro's rally came after ECB President Mario Draghi said at a conference in Portugal on Tuesday that deflationary forces had been replaced by reflationary ones. But any change in the ECB's stance should be gradual as  considerable  monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favourable global financing conditions, he added. Traders said the euro could add to its gains in the near term.  With the hawkish tone of Draghi, we should see European rates moving higher, especially on the 10-year part of the curve, and I think the euro has more room to move higher,  said Tareck Horchani, head of sales trading for Asia-Pacific for Saxo Bank Group in Singapore. The euro now faces resistance at $1.14, and could get a further boost if that level is breached, Horchani said. Against the yen, the euro eased 0.1 percent to 127.23 yen . The euro had touched a high of around 127.47 yen on Tuesday, its strongest level since April 2016. Draghi's comments were taken as pointing to the possibility that the ECB may announce a tapering of its massive bond purchases in coming months, possibly as early as September, said Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore. At the same time, the ECB probably won't want to see the euro rise too rapidly, he said.  There could be a push-back if the euro is perceived to have strengthened in a manner that is too fast for the ECB's liking,  Sim said, adding that the ECB might highlight the risk that the euro's rise could exert downside pressure on inflation. The dollar remained on the defensive after U.S. Senate Republican leaders postponed a vote on a healthcare overhaul on Tuesday, as they faced resistance from party members. Market participants are concerned that the Trump administration will find it hard to follow through with tax cuts and fiscal stimulus steps, without first getting the healthcare bill passed. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped to 96.322 at one point on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than seven months. It last stood at 96.385. Against the yen, the dollar eased about 0.2 percent to 112.15 yen. The dollar had risen to levels around 112.46 yen on Tuesday, its strongest level in more than a month, as U.S. bond yields edged higher in sympathy with a rise in European bond yields.

But Melvin had an inkling of its gravity thanks in large part to the forceful hand slap Healy delivered when he returned to the visiting dugout. Healy hit his first career grand slam to snap a tie and lead the Oakland Athletics to a 6-4 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park. Healy smacked his 18th home run the opposite way to right field off Astros right-hander James Hoyt, who entered with two outs in a 1-1 game in relief of Houston starter Mike Fiers (5-3). Healy ran the count full before his drive plated Matt Joyce, Jed Lowrie and Yonder Alonso, whose two-out walk chased Fiers.  I knew he was just going to slider the heck out of me so it was really just trying to get a pitch up in my zone,  Healy said of Hoyt.  Fortunately, it took about 7-8 pitches and I finally got one and I didn't miss it.  Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at AstrosHouston Astros - PlayerWatchSaid Hoyt:  At the end of the day, I let the team down. I take full responsibility for that. They put me out there in a big time of the game, and I didn't do my job.  Athletics left-hander Sean Manaea (7-4) notched his first career win in seven starts against the Astros (52-26) by continually sidestepping danger. He allowed nine hits and three walks over 5 2/3 innings, yet Houston managed only one run.  The first six innings are really the story of the opportunity (missed),  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  I think we left nine or 10 guys on base in those innings alone.  We did a great job of getting guys on base, getting guys in scoring position, having that two-out at-bat, and we really couldn't win any of those at-bats.  Oakland (35-42) stretched its winning streak to four games -- all on the road. The Astros rallied in the ninth against Athletics reliever Liam Hendriks, with George Springer drilling an opposite-field, three-run homer -- his 23rd -- to chase Hendriks and summon Oakland closer Santiago Casilla. Casilla inducing a pop up from pinch-hitter Josh Reddick and a game-ending double play by Brian McCann after Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa greeted Casilla with consecutive hits. Houston finished 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10. Squandered opportunities proved detrimental to the Astros early, with Manaea stranding six baserunners -- all in scoring position -- through the fourth inning. Complicating matters were the decisions of third base coach Gary Pettis to hold Correa and Marwin Gonzalez at third base following two-out doubles from Evan Gattis and Jake Marisnick in the first and second innings. Both calls were prudent, but when the Astros continually failed to cash in on scoring opportunities, those calls resonated. It wasn't until the fifth that Houston tied the game, but even that frame came with a measure of frustration. The Astros loaded the bases with no outs only for Gattis to hit into a double play that scored Springer.

Beijing targets economic growth of around 6.5 percent in 2017, compared with the 6.7 percent pace delivered in 2016 - the slowest in 26 years. In a speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the northeastern city of Dalian, Li said the Chinese economy remains steady in the second quarter, as domestic demand has become a key pillar for the world's second-largest economy.   China's economy in the second-quarter maintained the first-quarter's steady and improving momentum. We are fully capable of achieving the main economic targets for the full year,  Li said.  Currently, China also faces many difficulties and challenges, but we are fully prepared,  he said. China's economy, which grew a robust 6.9 percent in the first quarter, generally remained on solid footing in May, but tighter monetary policy, a cooling housing market and slowing investment reinforced views that it will gradually lose momentum in coming months. Financial Risks Beijing has been taking steps to identify and resolve financial risks, which remain generally under control, Li said. Among those risks is high levels of debt, which recently prompted Moody's to cut its sovereign credit rating on China. Li said that the capital adequacy ratios and provisions for bad loans at Chinese banks were at relatively high levels.  There are indeed some risks in the financial sector, but we are able to uphold the bottom line of no systemic risks,  he said.  We are fully capable of preventing various risks and making sure economic operations will be within a reasonable range.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers an opening speech at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, Liaoning province, China June 27, 2017. CNS/Liu Zhen via REUTERSLi also said Beijing will facilitate foreign investment by relaxing restrictions on how much overseas firms can own of China ventures and making it easier for them to register new companies locally. China will give foreign investors greater market access to  services and industrial sectors as well as treat foreign and domestic firms equally, the premier said - pledges that the government has made before.  He added that China will encourage foreign firms to reinvest their profits in the country but will not restrict the cross-border movement of their earnings. Slideshow (2 Images)Driving Demand China is trying to bolster consumer-driven growth while curbing excess and outdated capacity in industries such as steel and coal, cuts that Li said will continue.  Li stressed the importance of job creation, and noted that while new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics could cause job losses, those are offset by growth sectors such as e-commerce, mobile payments and bike-sharing. Employment has remained stable, Li said, with the survey-based jobless rate at around 4.9 percent in May – the lowest in many years.  China wants to maintain medium- to high-speed economic growth over the long term, as  no development is the biggest risk for China , Li said, noting that the economy's sheer size made it harder to rack up high growth rates.  It will not be easy for China to sustain a medium- to high-speed growth rate over the long term,  he said.          Global markets continue to fret about the outlook for China as policymakers have tightened financial conditions and cracked down on wanton growth in debt to defuse bubble risks.  Authorities have also taken steps to stabilize the yuan currency and reassure investors that Beijing remains committed to reforms of the capital markets, even as it puts up curbs to stem the outflow of funds.

Asian shares fell on Wednesday after Wall Street took a hit as U.S. Senate Republican leaders delayed a vote on a healthcare overhaul on Tuesday until next month, adding to investor worries about Trump's ability to deliver on his promises of tax reform and deregulation.     MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent, pulling further away from more than two-year highs probed earlier this week.      We're trying to see how the Trump administration will be reacting to this news but I think it's showing that there is no solidarity or that Trump cannot really hold onto his government,  said Mikey Macanaig, an analyst with Sunsecurities Inc.         Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen reiterated on Tuesday her view that the U.S. central bank would continue to raise interest rates only gradually.     Malaysian shares lost more than other markets in the region in percentage terms, with IHH Healthcare Bhd and IJM Corp Bhd declining 1.3 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.      Singapore edged down 0.2 percent, dragged by declines in DBS Group Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings which fell 0.3 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.     Vietnam slid as much as 0.6 percent to a one-week low, retreating from a nine-year high hit during the previous session.      Vietnam's trade deficit is expected to continue to widen. June 2017 trade figures will be on tap tomorrow and consensus is expecting a trade deficit of $230 million,  DBS Group said in a note.       This will bring overall trade deficit for the first six months of the year to about $2.38 billion, down sharply from a surplus of $1.29 billion.

To campaign against the obligatory wearing of headscarves - or hijabs - Alinejad last month encouraged women to take videos or photos of themselves wearing white and upload them on social media with the hashtag #whitewednesdays.  My goal is just empowering women and giving them a voice. If the government and the rest of the world hear the voice of these brave women then they have to recognize them,  Alinejad told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  Under Iran's Islamic law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes for the sake of modesty. Violators are publicly admonished, fined or arrested. Although no official records have been collected, a report by campaign group Justice for Iran in 2014 found over 10 years nearly half a million women were cautioned and more than 30,000 women arrested in cities across Iran over the hijab law. The #whitewednesdays campaign is part of a larger online movement started three years ago by Alinejad, a journalist who has lived in self-imposed exile since 2009. She has received death threats since her campaigning started. She created social media platforms and a website called My Stealthy Freedom where women in Iran take photos of themselves without hijabs to oppose Iran's dress code.  The 40-year-old activist wanted to raise the visibility of her online movement so women could identify each other in the streets of Iran by wearing white,  the color of peace .   I want people to talk. I want people to have a platform and talk together because having a free conversation is something Iranian society needs,  said Alinejad, who now lives in New York.  Some of the videos, which are subtitled by volunteers, have several hundred shares on the My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page that has more than a million followers. Some Iranian men have taken part in the campaign, and Alinejad also invites Iranian women who wear the hijab willingly to join as well - emphasizing that the campaign is not against hijabs, but being forced to wear them.  Alinejad said she doesn't consider herself courageous -  unlike the Iranian citizens before the lens.   They are more brave ... Honestly, these are the leaders and I am following them,  she said.

But Hong Kong stocks sagged, as sentiment was hurt by a stumble on Wall Street overnight and more losses on the city's second board following the previous session's nearly 10 percent tumble. China's blue-chips CSI300 index dipped 0.1 percent, to 3,671.24 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent, to 3,192.82 points. The SSE50 Index, which tracks China's biggest 50 listed firms by market capitalization, is on course for its highest closing level since mid-August, 2015. Index publisher MSCI's decision last week to include 222 Chinese  A-shares  into its emerging markets benchmark would  help prop up the value of China's quality blue-chips, and would help stabilize its stock market,  Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a seminar on Tuesday. Fang said China's securities regulator will strive to reduce policy uncertainty and will adjust capital control mechanisms if necessary to expedite foreign investment in A-shares. There are already signs of strong foreign appetite for Chinese blue-chips. On Tuesday, the CSOP FTSE China A50 ETF, Hong Kong's biggest yuan-denominated exchange-traded fund (ETF) that buys Chinese shares under the so-called RQFII scheme, attracted inflows of roughly 1.5 billion yuan ($220.16 million), the biggest daily inflow this year. Fund manager CSOP Asset Management attributed the inflow jump to the high correlation between the FTSE China A 50 Index, and MSCI's A-share inclusion plan, as well as a stabilizing yuan. Sector performance was mixed, as banking shares posted robust gains, but consumer stocks corrected. Hong Kong Hong Kong stocks fell, in line with most Asian markets, after Wall Street was knocked hard in the wake of a delay to a U.S. healthcare reform vote. The Hang Seng index dropped 0.4 percent, to 25,747.90 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.5 percent, to 10,447.92. Sentiment was also soured by a slump in the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), which skidded further, having tumbled nearly 10 percent on Tuesday to close at a record low. Shares of penny stocks such as Greaterchina Professional Services Ltd plunged yet again as investors raced to reduce their exposure to the highly volatile market.

The global shipping sector is reeling from a near-decade-long downturn, which has seen companies collapse and banks scale back exposure or exit entirely from providing finance. While there are signs of returning confidence in shipping, as players eye better prospects and the worst of the recession abates, the industry faces a financing black hole estimated at $30 billion this year. In an annual survey by international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, 41 percent of respondents said funding would become even tighter - a level that was much higher than counterparts polled in aviation, rail and logistics. In addition, 54 percent of those canvassed said they expected that enforcement actions taken on troubled shipping loans would increase over the next five years.  As assets reach a certain value, lenders are becoming more confident that enforcement action will enable them to recover the value of their loans,  Harry Theochari, Norton Rose Fulbright's global head of transport, told Reuters.  More lenders are becoming prepared to force the issue with borrowers.  Of those polled, 23 percent said bank debt was expected to remain the shipping industry’s primary source of funding, while a smaller proportion - 15 percent and 14 percent - saw private equity and shareholders providing financing.  Respondents are losing confidence in the industry’s ability to access finance,  Theochari said. A glut of vessels, concerns over the world economy and potential protectionism are among the risks faced by the shipping sector.  A global downturn would also have serious repercussions for shipping, which has not yet recovered from the (2008) financial crisis and continues to suffer from the effects of stubbornly low commodities prices,  Theochari said.  While it is encouraging to see that sentiment has improved over the past year, the industry remains on a long path towards recovery.  The survey - which polled 196 respondents across the transport industry including companies, financiers and government entities - said rail and aviation prospects were more upbeat, partly due to better markets and more funding.

Tobacco firms see Japan as a test ground for vaping products, as e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country's pharmaceutical regulations. While Marlboro maker Philip Morris's heat-not-burn  IQOS  tobacco device is already enjoying strong demand in Japan, Japan Tobacco's launch of its  Ploom Tech  product has run into delays due to production shortages. Japan Tobacco, a former state monopoly still a third owned by the government, will start selling Ploom Tech at its flagship shops on Thursday and 100 tobacco stores on July 10 in Tokyo. The company has said it plans to sell it nationwide in the first half of the next year. Shop assistants explain to customers how Japan Tobacco Inc's Ploom Tech smokeless vaping products work at its Ploom Shop in Tokyo, Japan June 28, 2017.Toru HanaiThe company test-launched the product in southwestern city of Fukuoka in March last year and at its online shop. It had to temporarily suspend sales after demand overwhelmed supply. Japan Tobacco said it had sold 250,000 Ploom Tech devices by the end of last year.  Unlike Philip Morris's IQOS, Ploom Tech does not directly heat tobacco leaves. Instead, the battery-powered device generates vapor that goes through a capsule packed with tobacco leaves.  Slideshow (8 Images)Japan Tobacco said the mechanism produces less smell than  heat-not-burn  products, and the company hopes it will be a strong differentiating factor against rivals. It said Ploom Tech emits smell a five-hundredth of a conventional cigarette.  The company said about 80 smoke-free restaurants, cafes and other public places in Fukuoka allow the use of Ploom Tech. In Tokyo, there are about 120 such facilities, it said.   The number of smoke-free places that allow Ploom Tech is increasing,  Chito Sasaki, president of the company's Japanese tobacco business, told reporters.

Pacquiao, who was defeated by American Mayweather in an unanimous points decision in Las Vegas in 2015, will defend his WBO welterweight belt against former schoolteacher and rank outsider Horn in Brisbane on Sunday.  He wants a re-match with Mayweather,  Roach told Sky News of 38-year-old Pacquiao.  To get Mayweather, you have to look good.  Against Horn, he's got to look good, he has to be impressive.  Mayweather, who retired in 2015 with an unbeaten record of 49-0, has agreed to come out of retirement for a 12-round fight against mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor. Pacquiao has failed to win by knockout since a 12th round TKO win over Miguel Cotto in 2009 but Roach said the fighter was primed to cause a stoppage against 29-year-old Horn, who is undefeated in 17 fights against mostly obscure opponents.  (Pacquiao) doesn't like to predict knockouts and so forth but I do,  Roach said at a media conference on Wednesday.  I think it's going to be short and sweet. If our opponent comes out like he says he's going to, Manny will fire back and I think it's going to be great fight (but) it won't last too long. And someone will get knocked out.  The 'Battle of Brisbane' at Lang Park, a 55,000-seat venue used mainly for professional rugby matches, is the biggest fight in decades 'Down Under', throwing Pacquiao's unheralded opponent Horn into a huge spotlight. Horn reminded Pacquiao of his 2012 knockout loss to Juan Manuel Marquez and said the Filippino had lost some of the power in his punches.  Ever since that knockout loss against Juan Manuel Marquez, Manny doesn’t pull the trigger like he used to when he was on his big run of wins,  the 29-year-old told local media.  He's looked good in his last two fights but he hasn't been able to win inside the distance for a long time and I think that's because of the KO loss he suffered against Marquez in 2012.

The attack, similar to the ransomware that infected more than 300,000 computers last month, also affected computers at Russia's biggest oil company, Ukranian banks and multinational firms. The Indian port has been trying to clear containers manually, but operational capacity has dropped to a third at the terminal, Anil Diggikar, chairman of Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT), told Reuters.  This is fallout of global cyber attack. We are hopeful that operations will normalise in a day,  he said.

President Xi Jinping will visit the city to commemorate the 20-year anniversary of its triumphant return to Chinese control. But Beijing’s grip over hearts and minds in Hong Kong is weakening. That is a problem, since this a primarily ethnically Chinese, ruthlessly pragmatic city - people who one would expect to be sympathetic. Graphic: 1997 handover: tmsnrt.rs/2tj2NKV     Hong Kong University surveys show increasing proportions of Hong Kongers no longer identify as Chinese. Localist sentiment has risen in the wake of massive pro-democracy protests in 2014. Judging by a subdued recent vigil, younger people now appear alienated to the extent they even view the bloody suppression of demonstrations in Beijing in 1989 as a Chinese event that has nothing to do with them.  That bodes ill for Xi's  China Dream of National Rejuvenation , with which he hopes to rally the Chinese diaspora to the Communist Party's banner.     The wider world, watching how Beijing has reinterpreted its commitments to make Hong Kong more democratic, and to work within a “one country, two systems” framework, has good reason to distrust Xi's intent.      In Hong Kong, China has revealed an unfortunate pattern duplicated in other countries: a preference for working with elites, popular or not; a willingness to use money - or force - to silence criticism; disregard for the rule of law when it doesn't suit current needs; and a general disdain for the carrot when the stick will do.      The irony is that Beijing is spending as never before on  soft power,  a phrase best simplified as  convincing other people to like you, and to want what you want.  It is rolling state television stations out across Africa, buying newspapers in Australia and radio stations in the United States. The Confucius Institutes, an unapologetic propaganda effort, subsidize pro-China education around the world.      But this hasn't drowned out headlines from Hong Kong. For all the spending, Pew Global Research polls show negative views of China have increased in recent years. Beijing can throw money around all it wants, but if even Hong Kong won't buy the message China is selling, it is hard to see it travelling well elsewhere.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

It has been a while for the Baltimore Orioles right-hander. He had not won since May 31, a span of four winless starts in which he had three losses. Against the Toronto Blue Jays, however, he pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings, leading the Orioles to a 3-1 victory in the opener of a three-game series.  I felt like earlier in the season I got way too fastball-happy in some counts where I should probably be pitching,  Gausman said.  That's really something I'm trying to do better, mixing up my pitches, moving up and down and in and out, just trying to keep these guys off balance.  Mark Trumbo hit a two-run double in the first inning, and Adam Jones had an RBI single in the third. That was all Gausman (4-7) needed as he allowed four hits and two walks while striking out four.  He's got a great arm,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  He was hitting his spots for the most part, just enough off-speed stuff to keep you honest.  Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at Blue JaysBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchThe Orioles (38-38) posted their third win in a row, while the Blue Jays (36-40) lost for the fourth time in five games and fell to 2-8 against Baltimore. Brad Brach allowed Troy Tulowitzki's fourth homer of the season with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning before earning his 14th save of the season. Blue Jays starter Joe Biagini (2-7) allowed five hits, four walks and three runs in 5 1/3 innings. The right-hander struck out three and was charged with a wild pitch.  It was kind of a weird night for him,  Gibbons said.  There were times when he was really good and dominated them, and then he seemed to lose the zone. He kept us in it, and then the bullpen did a nice job. Not many chances to get things going tonight ... a lean night.  Biagini was replaced by Dominic Leone in the sixth inning after Trey Mancini extended his hit streak to seven games with a single. Leone pitched around a walk to finish the inning.  We didn't beat (Biagini), we just figured out a way to scratch across some runs,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  He was good. Three runs usually, in this park, you don't like your chances.  Mychal Givens took over from Gausman in the sixth after Jose Bautista singled with one out and Russell Martin walked.  (Gausman) was really working the bottom of the zone,  Showalter said.  He pitched a lot with his fastball early and went to some other pitches the second and third time round the order.  A wild pitch by Givens moved the runners to second and third. Josh Donaldson lined out to third. Justin Smoak walked on four pitches to load the bases for Kendrys Morales, who struck out on a pitch that was high and outside. Givens completed a perfect seventh before being replaced in the eighth by Darren O'Day, who allowed only a single. The Orioles took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on a two-out single by Jonathan Schoop, a walk to Jones and a double by Trumbo. A two-out double by Schoop and a single by Jones in the third produced a 3-0 Baltimore lead.  After the first inning, I felt pretty good, I kind of settled in,  Biagini said.  I think there were a couple of balls up a little bit in the first inning, I had made an adjustment but need to make a slightly more quick adjustment on. I feel like it was kind of a struggle for me to make sure I was limiting the damage and staying efficient after the first inning. I felt like I battled well for the rest of the game.  NOTES: Blue Jays RHP Jason Grilli was designated for assignment, and RHP Chris Smith was called up from Triple-A Buffalo. Grilli was 2-4 with a 6.97 ERA in 26 games this season. Smith was 1-2 with four saves and a 3.93 ERA at Buffalo. He pitched around a two-out single to throw a scoreless ninth inning in his major league debut Tuesday. ... Toronto OF Ezequiel Carrera (fractured right foot) was activated from the 10-day disabled list and OF Dwight Smith Jr. was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo. Carrera came off the bench and went 0-for-2 on Tuesday. ... Baltimore LHP Wade Miley (3-5, 4.48 ERA) will face Toronto RHP Marcus Stroman (7-4, 3.69 ERA) in the second game of three-game series Wednesday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-bluejays-writethru-idUSMTZED6S8KAANN"},

A generic of Dolutegravir (DTG), first approved in the United States in 2013, is being given to 20,000 patients in Kenya before being rolled out in Nigeria and Uganda later this year, with the backing of the health agency UNITAID. DTG is the drug of choice for people with HIV in high-income countries who have never taken antiretroviral therapy before and for those who have developed resistance to other treatment.  I had constant nightmares and no appetite,  said Nairobi resident Doughtiest Ogutu, who started taking the drug this year because of her resistance to other treatments.  My appetite has come back... My body is working well with it.  Ogutu, who has been living with HIV for 15 years, said her viral load - the amount of HIV in her blood - has fallen tenfold from 450,000 to 40,000 since she started on DTG.  Sub-Saharan Africa has been at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic for decades and home to nearly three quarters of all people with HIV/AIDS. Daughtie Ogutu who lives with HIV and takes part in the Dolutegravir pill trial used in the treatment of HIV talks to Reuters during an interview in Nairobi, Kenya, June 27, 2017.Baz RatnerUNAIDS aims for 90 percent of people diagnosed with HIV to receive antiretroviral treatment by 2020. The brand name version of DTG is Tivicay, produced by ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline.  About 15 percent of HIV patients are resistant, which means the medicines do not work on them, said Sylvia Ojoo, Kenya country director for the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who is monitoring the introduction of DTG. Doctor Martin Sirengo, deputy director of medical services in the Kenyan ministry of health talks to Reuters during an interview in Nairobi, Kenya, June 27, 2017.Baz RatnerUNITAID works to bring medicines to market quickly and to reduce manufacturing costs by allowing generic companies to access patents for a small royalty and produce them cheaply for the developing world. Kenya, with one of the world's largest HIV positive populations, has made great strides in addressing HIV in its public medical facilities.   The health systems we have in place allow for rapid deployment,  said Ojoo.  It makes it relatively easy to introduce new interventions.  About 1.5 million Kenyans are HIV positive, with more than two-thirds on treatment, said Martin Sirengo, head of Kenya's National AIDS and STI Control Program. The number of new infections in Kenya has almost halved over the last decade to 80,000 a year, he said, thanks to increased testing, treatment and awareness.
