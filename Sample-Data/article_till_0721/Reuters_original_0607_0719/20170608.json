Sources told Reuters the choice has narrowed to one bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) and U.S. tech fund Silver Lake and another from Toshiba chip partner Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) and Japanese government-related investors. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the world's second-largest producer of NAND chips, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. The laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate will hold a board meeting on June 15 to decide on the preferred bidder, two sources said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.  Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant in Yokkaichi, western Japan, has complicated the sale effort with a legal challenge, accusing Toshiba of a serious breach of contract over the joint venture. It argues that the unit cannot be sold without its consent and has demanded exclusive negotiating rights. But in a letter seen by Reuters, Toshiba struck back, again asking Western Digital to stop challenging the plans.  Toshiba encourages Western Digital to redirect the considerable efforts that it has put into disrupting Toshiba's sale process into more productive channels.  FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital Corporation hard drive is pictured here in Encinitas, California April 19, 2011.Mike Blake/File PhotoToshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Western Digital confirmed in a statement that it had received Toshiba's letter but added that any move by Toshiba to sell the unit without its consent  clearly violate the transfer restrictions in the joint venture agreements.    FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoWestern Digital said it was  best positioned to assist Toshiba in addressing its challenges and advancing its legacy of technological innovation in Japan.  The Broadcom-Silver Lake bid is seen as attractive because of its higher price of 2.2 trillion yen ($20 billion), sources have said.  Western Digital by comparison has an offer of less than 2 trillion yen and could also face antitrust hurdles because the firm is the third-largest maker of NAND flash-memory chips.   Naturally, for the Toshiba corporate side, Broadcom is the best choice,  one source said. Toshiba shares rose as much as 6 percent on Thursday on the news that the company was closing in on a buyer. The stock has lost some 36 percent since late December when the company flagged huge losses at its U.S. nuclear power operations.  Other bidders include U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), and Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) with its Japanese unit Sharp Corp (6753.T) .

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- So far it's been a June to remember for Jacob Faria. Last week, the Tampa Bay Rays pitcher got engaged to his long-time girlfriend Jessica and Wednesday he earned his first major league win in his debut as the Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 3-1 on Wednesday at Tropicana Field. Faria, a former 10th-round pick, went 6 1/3 innings and gave up one run on three hits. He struck out five on 95 pitches (62 strikes) as the Rays improved to 30-31, while the White Sox fell to 25-32. Alex Colome pitched the ninth for his 16th save. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RaysChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch It's been the best two-week span of my life, nothing compares,  Faria said.  Usually after my starts my legs would be exhausted. But I feel like I could go run a mile right now. I've still got a ton of adrenaline going. It feels great.  White Sox starter Mike Pelfrey (2-5) labored through 5 1/3 innings but managed to pitch himself out of trouble on most occasions and held the Rays to 1-for-12 with runners in scoring position to keep the game close.  I think that was maybe the worst my stuff has been since I've been here,  Pelfrey said.  My command was pretty shaky and for the most part. I don't think I gave in and I made pitches to try and limit the damage, but I was a little off. Tampa didn't help the matter by grinding through it.  Pelfrey gave up three runs (two earned) on six hits and walked three. He threw 96 pitches but only 54 for strikes.  I thought (Pelfrey) did a nice job,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  He kept us in. Everybody kept us in the game. We just weren't able to string together enough to score enough runs.  Chicago got to Faria in the first inning and took a 1-0 lead on an RBI single by Jose Abreu. But Faria quickly settled down and retired the White Sox in order in the second, fourth and sixth innings.  I got those first couple of hitters out of the way and then was able to get my blood pressure down,  Faria said.  I just had to sit back and think. It's baseball, I just had to go back and do what I know how to do.  The Rays put the leadoff runner on base against Pelfrey in the first four innings. They were able to cash in during the third when Tim Beckham hit a two-run single with the bases loaded that scored Evan Longoria and Logan Morrison to give Tampa Bay a 2-1 lead.  Through my at-bat he was pounding me with the sinker and the two-seam,  Beckham said.  I wanted to see something out over the plate that I can get the barrel on and didn't want to chase it.  The next batter, Daniel Robertson, grounded into a fielder's choice at third. Chicago third baseman Todd Frazier went home with the throw, but Colby Rasmus slid under the attempted tag by Kevan Smith to make the score 3-1.  Pretty exciting win for the team and obviously for (Faria),  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Not a ton of hitting going around but Tim Beckham came up and we got the big hit with guys on base.  NOTES: Major League Baseball is investigating allegations of domestic abuse against Rays C Derek Norris that were made by his ex-fiance Kristen Eck. Norris denied the allegations in a statement through his agent, telling the Tampa Bay Times they  could not be further from the truth  and that  I have never been physically or emotionally abusive toward her, or anyone else in my life.  Rays manager Kevin Cash said that the team was going to let the investigation run its course.  I think we're basically out of it,  Cash said.  We're going to let Major League Baseball handle it; obviously they do a good job of investigating and then we'll go from there.  Norris was in the starting lineup and batted ninth. ... White Sox RHP James Shields (strained right lat) will make his second rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Charlotte. ... The Rays placed SS Brad Miller on the 10-day DL with a hip strain. ... White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon (left bicep bursitis) is scheduled to make his second rehab start with Charlotte over the weekend.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED687J1HXY"},

Japan's economy, the world's third largest, expanded at an annualized rate of 1.0 percent in the first quarter, less than half the initial estimate of 2.2 percent growth and 2.4 percent gain seen by economists, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday. The data follows a recent run of indicators that suggests continued economic growth in the current quarter due to solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain lackluster, despite a tight job market. The Bank of Japan is now expected to stand pat at its next rate review on June 15-16, although a majority of the economists in a Reuters poll last month forecast the BOJ's next move would be to pull back its stimulus. The GDP data was revised as primary oil distributors squeezed their crude oil inventory because some refineries were offline for repairs, bringing crude oil inventory levels at the end of March to the lowest since 2000, Cabinet Office officials said.  The data is not as bad as the headline figure appears. It supports the BOJ's upbeat view on the economy,  said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Steam is emitted from factories at sunset in Keihin industrial zone in Kawasaki, Japan February 13, 2017.Issei Kato Excluding the revision to inventory, private final demand including capital expenditure was strengthening, suggesting that export-led recovery is broadening gradually. It's true private consumption is weak, but it will likely firm up from now on.  On the quarter, the Japanese economy grew a revised 0.3 percent in real, price-adjusted terms, against a preliminary reading of a 0.5 percent increase and the median estimate of a 0.6 percent expansion. Capital expenditure, a key component of GDP, rose 0.6 percent for the quarter, outstripping the preliminary estimate of a 0.2 percent increase. Inventories shaved 0.1 percentage point off growth, revised down from a 0.1 percent point contribution originally posted.  Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.3 percent, down from the preliminary 0.4 percent gain. Tame wages and consumer spending have kept Japan from beating deflation, posing a key challenge for the BOJ in meeting its 2 percent inflation goal via a massive bond-buying program. Taken together, government, business and household demand  contributed 0.1 percentage point to growth, versus the initial 0.4 percentage point recorded. Net exports added 0.1 point to growth, unchanged from the preliminary estimate.

With a few more years of experience, the right-hander is finally paying dividends for the Detroit Tigers. Farmer pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings to outduel Alex Meyer and lead the Tigers to a 4-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday at Comerica Park. Farmer, 26, was recalled from Triple-A Toledo earlier in the day and collected his second straight victory after going winless the previous three seasons, spanning 32 appearances and eight starts. He tossed 6 1/3 scoreless innings May 27 against the Chicago White Sox in his only other major league outing this season.  He was probably rushed out of necessity to the big leagues,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.  He made his first start here at Comerica a few years back. Now he's had parts of a few years at Toledo and Detroit. There was a split camp in the organization -- is he a starter or a reliever? We kind of held fast to pitching him in a starting role, and he's pitching well for us now.  Farmer (2-0) gave up three hits -- all singles -- walked one and struck out five. He replaced Matthew Boyd in the rotation. Boyd was optioned to Toledo last week to work on mechanical issues. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at TigersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch There's a lot of confidence,  Farmer said.  I'm confident every time I go out there, especially with the guys I have behind me. With the defense and lineup we throw out there every night, it's hard not to go out there with confidence.  Justin Upton blasted a three-run homer for Detroit (29-29), which has won five of its last six. Upton, who leads the team in homers (12) and RBIs (34), also had a walk-off three-run homer against the White Sox on Sunday.  Last year, he got off to an extremely slow start, especially by his standards,  Ausmus said.  This year, he's been one of the more consistent offensive contributors we've had. He's come up with some big hits twice in the last few games.  Detroit relievers Alex Wilson and Justin Wilson combined to pitch the final 2 1/3 innings and complete the shutout. Meyer (2-3) held the Tigers to three singles and struck out a career-high nine over six innings. The lone run he allowed was unearned.  Alex had good stuff,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  His command wavered a little bit, four walks in six innings. But he was making pitches and putting guys away.  The Angels (30-32) are 4-5 since perennial All-Star Mike Trout went down with a torn thumb ligament. The Tigers scored a run in the third but came out of the inning feeling a bit empty. Leadoff hitter Ian Kinsler was hit in the helmet with a pitch but was still able to trot to first base. A walk and an error by third baseman Yunel Escobar loaded the bases, and Kinsler scored on Victor Martinez's double-play grounder. Meyer then struck out J.D. Martinez. Detroit also squandered a two-on, one-out situation in the sixth. Meyer struck out Nick Castellanos and retired Alex Presley on a flyout to extinguish that threat. Farmer did not allow a baserunner to get past first before he was removed after issuing a two-out walk to Luis Valbuena in the seventh.  We didn't get too many good looks at him,  Scioscia said.  He wasn't overpowering with his stuff, but he definitely had some movement on his ball and changed speeds, kept us off-balance. We knew what he was going to do and he did it well.  Upton gave the Tigers some breathing room with his homer in the eighth off Yusmeiro Petit. NOTES: Detroit C James McCann will be activated from the 10-day disabled list Friday barring any setbacks, according to manager Brad Ausmus. McCann (left hand laceration) was hit by a pitch in Houston on May 25. ... Detroit RHP Justin Verlander will throw a bullpen session Thursday, which will go a long way in determining whether he will make his scheduled start Saturday. He had a clean MRI exam Monday after departing his Sunday start in the third inning because of right groin tightness. ... The Angels have won 26 of their last 35 games against the Tigers. ... Angels RHP Cam Bedrosian had a setback in his rehab from a right groin strain that has kept him on the DL since April 22. Bedrosian felt some lingering discomfort but manager Mike Scioscia said he believes it will only push back his return by a couple days.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED687IUSXW"},

A strap on the large brace snapped after Sabathia retired Hanley Ramirez for the first out of the fourth and he pitched to three more hitters before it was replaced. He got a new one by the fifth, which began with a triple by Josh Rutledge but it also was the last Red Sox hit as Sabathia retired the last 12 hitters.  I didn't know what to expect,  said Sabathia, who has worn the brace since Aug. 2015.  I didn't feel any pain. I didn't feel any pain, so it was good.  Sabathia (7-2) won a fifth straight start for the first time since April 17-May 10, 2012, which was a year before a noticeable drop in velocity and a frustrating three-year stretch that saw him post a 23-27 record while getting right knee surgery in 2014 and dealing with alcoholism the following year. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at YankeesBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchHe showed glimpses of past seasons at various points of 2016 by going 9-12 with a 3.91 ERA and started decently before allowing 22 runs in a span of four starts. Since struggling in Cincinnati on May 9, the 2007 AL Cy Young award winner has lowered his ERA from 5.77 to 3.66. He struck out five without a walk and allowed two earned runs or fewer for the eighth straight time against Boston after throwing 64-of-95 pitches for strikes Wednesday.  He's pitched really well this year,  New York manager Joe Girardi said.  He had a few starts where had lost his command of his cutter and he found it again. It sets up everything for him but I think he takes a lot of pride in it. He's been that guy his whole career you can turn to when you needed a big win and he still does it.  It was Sabathia's 25th start without allowing a run in eight innings and his longest outing since April 20, 2015 at Detroit. It was his first start with eight scoreless innings since Sept. 21, 2012 against Oakland and it gave him his 230th career win.  To me he didn't miss any over the middle of the plate,  Boston center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. said.  Everything was pretty much corners.  More importantly for the Yankees, Sabathia's performance occurred after a rough outing by Masahiro Tanaka. It was his fifth straight victory following a Tanaka loss and gave the Yankees something more pleasant to discuss than their No. 1 starter's woes.  He's been holding us down the last three years,  Sabathia said.  It's up to us as a staff to pick him up and we know that he'll come out of whatever he's in and he'll be fine for us.  Sabathia worked out of minor trouble all night, but his biggest play occurred after Rutledge tripled over center fielder Aaron Hicks' head. He speared a comebacker by Bradley with his bare hand on a ball clocked at 97.9 mph.  That's a great play because that's probably a hit when you look at it,  Girardi said. Sabathia had a 5-0 lead through five innings on a three-run homer by Chris Carter, a solo homer by Didi Gregorius and a RBI single by Gary Sanchez. He finished the game up by eight runs after Matt Holliday, Carter and Brett Gardner added RBI singles. Carter nearly had a second homer but right fielder Mookie Betts made a leaping catch at the wall after the ball went through the arms of a fan in the first row. Most of New York's runs occurred against Rick Porcello (3-8), who is struggling to defend his Cy Young Award from last season. Porcello allowed six runs (five earned) and eight hits over 6 1/3 innings in his third straight loss. Porcello yielded at least eight hits for the eighth time this season and leads the majors with 104 hits allowed.  We have the ultimate confidence in him,  Bradley said of Porcello.

Swiss-based Kempinski Hotels SA will inaugurate its Gran Hotel Manzana in the heart of the capital on Wednesday, billing it as Cuba's first true luxury hotel.  The five-star property, managed by Kempinski but owned by the Cuban government, occupies the top floors of a renovated Belle Epoque shopping mall filled with glitzy Gucci and Montblanc stores. Farther down the iconic Paseo de Prado boulevard toward the Caribbean Sea, workers are developing two other sites into luxury hotels to be operated respectively by Spain's Iberostar and France's Accor SA ACCP.SA, the largest hotel group in Europe.  Tourism is the one bright spot in Cuba's moribund economy, which is struggling with falling exports and upheaval in major trade partner Venezuela.  Cuban Tourism minister Manuel Marrero said in May that more than 4.2 million tourists were expected this year, up from 4 million in 2016. He said the country was adding 2,000 hotel rooms a year to its stock of 65,000 hotel rooms and 21,000 homes renting to tourists. Visits by Americans have soared since U.S.-operated cruises and scheduled flights were relaunched last year as part of the detente pursued by former President Barack Obama after a half-century hiatus. However, his successor Trump is considering tightening those rules when he announces his Cuba policy as soon as this month, according to current and former U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions. That would likely hurt tourism, at least in the short run, and might slow the pace of hotel construction.    We hope that trade and travel restrictions eased by the Obama administration will not be tightened again by the current U.S. government,  said Alessandro Benedetti, a marketing director at Kempinski.   That would not be favorable for any kind of businesses connected to tourism, such as cruise ship operators, airlines or hotel chains.  The Cuban government has courted foreign hotel operators to develop untapped markets, particularly in high-end tourism. With its gleaming white stone facade and French bay windows, the Gran Hotel Manzana features a rooftop infinity pool overlooking Havana's central park, as well as a spa with steamroom and sauna. There is also a cigar lounge with a tobacco sommelier. Industry experts say Cuba, which offers a plethora of low- and mid-range accommodation, is right to bet on luxury, although it will be a challenge for operators to maintain standards in a tightly controlled Soviet-style economy.  We have travel agencies contact us saying they had never worked with Cuba because it didn't offer anything up to their standards,  said Benedetti.  But now that's changed,  he said, citing strong interest from U.S. tourists seeking more luxurious destinations. Cubans Have Mixed Feelings It remains unclear how far Trump will go in rolling back Obama’s changes. Any reinstatement of U.S. restrictions on Cuba travel would face criticism from American travel companies as well as a growing number of U.S. lawmakers.  Cuba's Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero attends the official inauguration of the Gran Hotel Manzana, owned by the Cuban government and managed by Swiss-based Kempinski Hotels SA, in Havana, Cuba June 7, 2017.StringerThe number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year, but Americans are still not officially allowed to visit as tourists. Because their trips must fit certain categories, like educational travel, most descend on Havana rather than the coastal resorts. While Cuba has been building resorts around the island, it has redoubled its focus on the capital, where hotels are fully booked year-round and demand is growing.  With this increase, it would be appropriate to have products of high standard,  said Francisco Camps, Cuba deputy general manager for Spain's Meliá Hotels International S.A. (MEL.MC), which wants to introduce its two main luxury brands. Despite assurances tourism revenues will benefit all Cubans, the move has stirred mixed feelings in a country that prides itself on social equality.  The hotels are very pretty, but they are too expensive for Cubans,  said retiree Antonio Cazamayor, who lives on a monthly pension of $10. Rooms at the Gran Hotel Manzana will range from $360 for a low-season double to $5,000 for the 150-square-meter (1,600-square-foot) presidential suite. Slideshow (19 Images)Cazamayor's home in the densely populated back streets of central Havana is just a few blocks from the hotels but feels like a different world. His building appears derelict from the outside, with the ground-floor windows boarded up, but inside it teems with families packed into tiny units. Many neighborhood buildings, which date to the 1920s and 1930s, are missing walls or balconies. Collapses are common. An apartment block in front of Cazamayor's was recently evacuated after its stairwell caved in.  If that one collapsed, and this one is falling apart, why don't they build homes?  Cazamayor asked.  Hobbled by an inefficient, centrally planned economy and a U.S. economic embargo, Cuba has struggled to maintain its infrastructure in a punishing tropical climate. Since the country opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, Havana reinvested much of its revenue in renovating historic buildings, from Art Deco hotels to colonial palaces.   They have returned the sparkle to part of Old Havana,  said Abraham Rodriguez, 45. He attended a school in the building that now houses the Gran Hotel Manzana and recalls how the classrooms flooded when it rained. But much of the rest of the city is still falling into ruin. Cubans working in the private sector as restaurateurs, taxi drivers and tour guides say the arrival of Kempinski and its rivals spells good business for them. Yet the benefits for the more than two-thirds of the government employees are less obvious. Josefa Cespedes, 73, has been living for a quarter-century in a building that houses a unit of the Communist Party charged with keeping tabs on the neighborhood because her home collapsed.  The poor have to wait for the state to help,  she said. Reporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-tourism-idUSKBN18Y1D0"},

Korea missile test TOKYO, June 8 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average hovered in positive terrain on Thursday, with the yen moving away from recent highs and Wall Street edging up, but market participants were on guard ahead of key events. The Nikkei was up 0.1 percent at 19,993.97 at the end of morning trade.  We are just moving in a range on either side of 20,000,  said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management, referring to the milestone broken last week, when Japanese shares climbed to their highest since August 2015. UK voters head to the polls for a general election, the European Central Bank holds a regular policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey will testify to the U.S. Senate later on Thursday.  All of these three events add some macro benchmarks or catalyst potential,  said Stefan Worrall, director of Japan equity sales at Credit Suisse.  People remember the UK referendum last year was something that affected the Friday trading day in Japan. This is not the same scale or likelihood of shock factor, but the results are unclear,  he said. Comey accused U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday of asking him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The ECB is widely expected to keep its policy unchanged, but sources told Reuters last week the central bank will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement. Meanwhile, a decisive victory for UK Prime Minister Theresa May would ensure a smooth exit from the European Union, though opinion polls have shown May's Conservative party's lead over the opposition Labour party has narrowed. Shares got a bit of a tailwind from a modestly weaker yen. But sentiment was curbed by economic data early on Thursday. Japan's economic growth in the January-March period was revised to less than half its original estimated pace because of a downward adjustment in business inventories,  underscoring the fragility of its export-led expansion. Japanese markets had a muted reaction to North Korea's latest missile tests. The rogue state fired what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast on Thursday, South Korea's military said, ignoring world pressure to curb its weapons development. Toshiba Corp rose 4.5 percent after sources told Reuters it aims to name a buyer for its semiconductor business next week. The choice has narrowed to one bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd and U.S. tech fund Silver Lake and another from Toshiba chip partner Western Digital Corp and Japanese government-related investors, sources said. Dentsu Inc shares dropped 2.8 percent, after the advertising group said on Wednesday its net sales for May fell 6.8 percent from the same month a year ago. Japan Display was down 3.3 percent, after a source said the company was considering restructuring beyond cutting jobs and consolidating production, as its late entry into OLED technology caused loss of business with Apple Inc.

I said I'm just grabbing my bat and going up there,  Kivlehan said.  I'm not taking any swings. Probably not the best long-term strategy.  It worked this time. Kivlehan tied the score with a three-run homer, and Joey Votto's go-ahead, two-run shot capped a five-run seventh inning, lifting the Reds to a 6-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals at Great American Ball Park. Scott Schebler also homered for Cincinnati (28-30), which has won the first three games of the series to improve to 6-2 this season vs. St. Louis. It was the Reds' 13th come-from-behind victory of the year.  Sometimes you're just amazed it's happening,  Reds manager Bryan Price.  You never get tired of it, I can tell you that. With the offense the way it is and the defense playing well, you always feel like we have a chance.  Raisel Iglesias notched his 11th save. Wandy Peralta (3-1) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the victory. Matt Carpenter homered for the Cardinals (26-31), who have lost six straight for the first time since 2013. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at RedsSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchSt. Louis' defeats keep getting more and more brutal. Wednesday marked the 14th time this season the Cardinals led by two or more runs and lost. In five of the six losses during the current streak, they've been leading or tied in the sixth inning or later.  You're going to go through them,  said Cardinals starter Lance Lynn of the team's slide.  You hope that when you do go through them, they're not long.  Reds second baseman Scooter Gennett, coming off his historic four-homer night on Tuesday, went 1-for-4. He grounded hard into a 4-6-3 double play in the second inning to snap his home run streak at four at-bats. There would be plenty of other heroes for the Reds on Wednesday night, though Cincinnati's starting pitcher wasn't one of them. Bronson Arroyo's recent struggles against the Cardinals continued when he allowed four runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. In his past 10 starts vs. St. Louis, Arroyo is 0-6 with a 6.34 ERA. However, the offense picked him up in the seventh. Cincinnati trailed 4-1 before Schebler and Gennett singled to begin the inning. With one out, Kivlehan launched his first career pinch-hit home run off Brett Cecil, a three-run shot to tie the score.  I was so pumped for Kiv there,  Cozart said.  He was like, 'I didn't even go in there and get loose, I just stepped up and hit.' I told him maybe he should do that more often.  After Cozart's two-out double, Trevor Rosenthal entered the game, and Votto hit a two-run blast on his first pitch to put Cincinnati ahead. Cecil (0-2) was charged with four runs in two-thirds of an inning.  We've had some guys throwing some good outings, just getting the consistently good ones is the challenge right now,  said Matheny.  That seventh inning certainly stands out as one that's been difficult to get through.  Lynn allowed a run on three hits over five innings but exited after only 78 pitches, leaving things up to the bullpen.  We'd probably get one more inning (from him),  Matheny said.  We're trying to get a little more room. We've been having trouble scoring runs. Need to try to take a chance.  With two outs in the second inning, Carpenter crushed an 0-1 pitch from Arroyo as estimated 420 feet to center for his 10th home run, putting the Cardinals ahead 1-0. Later in the inning, Tommy Pham walked and scored on Piscotty's double. Piscotty raced home on Jed Gyorko's single, making the score 3-0. Lynn didn't allow a hit until Votto's hard grounder caromed off his glove for an infield single with one out in the fourth. Schebler led off the fifth with his 17th home run of the season on Lynn's first pitch to reduce the Reds' deficit to 3-1. St. Louis increased its lead to three on Dexter Fowler's pinch-hit RBI double in the sixth. Eric Fryer attempted to score on the play but was thrown out at home on a relay from Gennett.  We just keep battling, it's fun,  Cozart said.  I feel like we've had a lot of those lately where we all of a sudden score four runs in an inning or we have a lead, and we're as confident as ever with our bullpen when we have a lead. It's nice to see us keep battling.  NOTES: Reds SS Zack Cozart doubled in the seventh inning to extend his on-base streak to 29 games, longest active streak in the major leagues. ...

Like Coles, who has barely played this season because of knee and calf injuries and concussion symptoms, captain Kieran Read and fellow loose forwards Liam Squire and Jerome Kaino were also were included in the 33-man squad despite not being fully fit. Five additional players -- center Jack Goodhue, hooker Liam Coltman and loose forwards Akira Ioane, Vaea Fifita and Matt Todd -- have been named as injury cover.    Uncapped fullback Jordie Barrett, flyhalf Beauden and lock Scott became the first trio of brothers to be named in the same All Blacks squad. Hansen said he had no reservations about selecting Wellington Hurricanes' 20-year-old Jordie.   His performances for the Hurricanes have been outstanding,  he said.  If you're ready, you're ready.  It's your ability to cope with pressure and display your skills and perform at that level.  He has done that very easily ... and we think he is ready to step in and face whatever is chucked at him  Hansen also selected bullocking inside center Ngani Laumape after his scintillating season with the Hurricanes.  He has been a standout, hasn't he?  Hansen added of the uncapped Laumape, who played union as a teenager, signed with rugby league's New Zealand Warriors before switching codes to union and joining the Hurricanes last year.  For a young man who has just come back to rugby after spending a wee time in the wilderness playing league, to have him playing as well as he is, is great for New Zealand rugby.  Laumape's selection and the introduction of Canterbury Crusaders center Goodhue as injury cover has resulted in Malakai Fekitoa, who was part of the 2015 World Cup winning squad, missing out altogether. Other notable exclusions include winger Nehe Milner-Skudder after an injury-ravaged 16 months and Damian McKenzie, who played two tests last year and was pipped to a place by Jordie Barrett. Milner-Skudder and McKenzie, however, have been named in a strong Maori All Blacks squad to face the Lions in Rotorua on June 17. Hansen, perhaps preferring to stick with players proven at test level, has also selected prop Charlie Faumuina and flyhalf Aaron Cruden despite both having signed with European clubs for next season. The All Blacks assemble in Auckland on Sunday to prepare for a test against Samoa on June 16. The first Lions test is on June 24. Rieko Ioane, his brother Akira and Tawera Kerr-Barlow will be released to play for the Maori All Blacks on June 17, Hansen added. Waisake Naholo, Lima Sopoaga and Liam Squire will also play for the Otago Highlanders against the tourists four days earlier in Dunedin. Prior to the tour, the Auckland Blues and Canterbury Crusaders were the only teams given approval to select their All Blacks.

(Reuters) - The man accused of murdering two men and wounding a third on a Portland, Oregon, train was led away from a courtroom on Wednesday by sheriff's deputies as he shouted that he had acted in self defense.  Jeremy Christian, 35, had stood quietly in a glass-walled holding cell in the courtroom throughout a brief appearance until its conclusion, when he blurted out that he was “not guilty of anything but defending myself against violent aggression by Micah Fletcher,  the surviving victim of the attack. Fletcher was in court for the hearing. Christian was charged with murder in the May 26 stabbing deaths of two men who intervened on a commuter train when he shouted religious slurs at two African-American women, one of whom was wearing a Muslim head scarf. Fletcher, who tried to intercede, was also stabbed. Christian did not enter a plea on Wednesday to charges of aggravated murder, assault, unlawful use of a weapon, intimidation and menacing.  Jeremy Christian, arrested in the fatal stabbing of two men and wounding of another aboard a MAX train, is arraigned on a 15-count indictment in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, Oregon, U.S., June 7, 2017.          Stephanie Yao Long/PoolProsecutors have said that Christian, who had served a prison sentence for a 2002 armed robbery, slashed the men in their necks before fleeing the train when it stopped. One victim stumbled to his death on a station platform and another died in the rail car where he was stabbed.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it was investigating the incident as a possible federal hate crime.  Slideshow (9 Images)The attack became an undercurrent in dueling rallies staged in Oregon's largest city on Sunday by supporters of President Donald Trump and counter-demonstrators who accused Trump of  divisive political rhetoric that was encouraging acts of racial and ethnic hatred. Prosecutors have said that Christian confessed to the train stabbings in a profanity-laced rant recorded in the back of a police vehicle after he was taken into custody. In an initial appearance before a judge days after the attacks, he entered the courtroom shouting,  Free speech or die, Portland ... This is America - get out if you don't like free speech.

The launches come less than a week after the United Nations Security Council passed fresh sanctions on the reclusive state, which said it would continued to pursue its nuclear and missile programme without delay. It also comes a day after South Korea said it will hold off on installing remaining components of a controversial U.S. anti-missile defense system that has angered North Korea's main ally, China. The missiles were launched Thursday morning from the North Korean coastal city of Wonsan and flew about 200 km (124 miles), South Korea's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the mainland United States. Compared to the different types of ballistic missiles Pyongyang has recently tested, the missiles launched on Thursday are considered to be more defensive in nature, designed to defend against threats such as enemy warships. North Korea unveiled a number of new weapons at a massive military parade on April 15 to mark the birth anniversary of the state's founding leader and has since tested some of them.  Looking at North Korea’s pattern of missile launches, it has been revealing what it brought to the recent military parade,  said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.  What appeared to be a new type of land-to-ship missile equipped with four launching canisters was unveiled at the parade. I think this might be what was used today.  Thaad Defence Delayed South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been briefed on the latest launch, the military said, declining to give further details. Thursday's launch is the fourth missile test by North Korea since Moon took office on May 10 pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang, saying sanctions and pressure alone have failed to resolve the growing threat from the North's advancing nuclear and missile programme. Moon had also promised to review the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea. On Wednesday, his presidential office said installation of four additional launchers would be halted until an assessment of the system's impact on the environment was completed. The introduction of the THAAD system, which includes a far-reaching radar that China worries could upset the regional security balance, has sparked protests in South Korea and a backlash in China against South Korean business interests. There was no immediate reaction from China to the latest test. Seoul and Washington were analysing the launches for further information, South Korean officials said. Japan is on high alert and will analyse information in cooperation with the United States and South Korea, Kyodo news agency quoted Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida as saying. Japan's navy and air force conducted military drills with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan last week, following similar joint U.S.-South Korea exercises.  North Korea likely wanted to show off its ability to precisely target a large warship, in relation to the joint military drills involving U.S. aircraft carriers,  Roh Jae-cheon, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman told a media briefing.  By testing different types of missiles, North Korea also appears to be aiming to secure the upper hand in relations with South Korea and the United States.  In the three earlier launches, North Korea tested different kinds of ballistic missiles, two medium-to-long range missiles as well as a short-range Scud class weapon. The isolated country, which has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016 in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, says the programme is necessary to counter U.S. aggression.

U.S. Open runner-up Pliskova will be guaranteed toppling Germany's Angelique Kerber if she prevails against Halep who would need to go on and take the title to seize the top ranking. It would be tempting to suggest that Saturday's champion will come from their sixth career clash. But that would be to discount the threat of Latvia's fearless youngster Jelena Ostapenko and Swiss 30th seed Timea Bacsinszky who are first on Court Philippe Chatrier. Both have their birthdays on Thursday -- Ostapenko her 20th and Bacsinszky her 28th -- but only one of them will be celebrating with a maiden grand slam final. Related CoveragePlayer profiles: Simona Halep vs Karolina Pliskova2017 record: Simona Halep vs Karolina PliskovaHalep's hopes of reaching a second French Open final, having lost to Maria Sharapova in 2014, looked over when she trailed by a set and 5-1 in her quarter-final against Elina Svitolina. But the Romanian survived, saving a match point in the process, and will perhaps think her name is on the trophy.  It's going to be a very different match than today, it's going to be like playing the ball machine,  Halep, who leads Pliskova 4-1 in head-to-heads, said. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 7, 2017   Romania's Simona Halep in action during her quarter final match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina   Reuters / Gonzalo FuentesCzech second seed Pliskova had never made it past the second round in Paris before this year and so had hardly given much thought to the possibility of becoming number one in the world.  Coming into this tournament, there were a few people who told me, 'you have to be in the final to be number one'. I was like, there is no chance I make the final here,  she said.  And now it's close, but it's close and it's far because I'm playing against somebody who I would say one of the best girls on clay. It's not like you're going to get it for free.  Ostapenko thrashed 38 winners past former world number one Caroline Wozniacki to become the first teenager to reach the semi-finals since Ana Ivanovic in 2007. There are many similarities with the Serb who also relied on an all-out attacking style and Ostapenko is unlikely to reel in her game against the vastly more experienced Bacsinszky. Three-times French Open champion Mats Wilander has watched Ostapenko's progress while working for broadcaster Eurosport and has liked what he has seen.  Her chances are excellent if she plays with 90 percent of her ability, I think she would have a chance to win the whole thing,  Wilander told Reuters.  She has so much power but the worrying thing is she throws in matches where she is less than 50 percent and she could beat herself. Is she mature enough to play Bacsinszky and not just close her eyes and blaze away?

The Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane vanished on early Wednesday afternoon after takeoff from the coastal town of Myeik on a weekly military flight. The plane, heading north to Myanmar's largest city Yangon, carried 122 passengers, including 108 soldiers and their family members and 14 crew. Among them were 15 children, 58 adults and 35 soldiers and officers, according to a military statement.  We haven't found any sign of the plane,  Win Myat Aye, minister for social welfare, relief and resettlement, told Reuters on Thursday. He said local government officials were cooperating with the army to search for the missing aircraft. Nine navy ships, five military planes and two helicopters were mobilized on Thursday to search for the missing aircraft, the army said in its latest news release. Some 500 people, including medics and emergency officials, continued the search on the shore near the town of Launglon, close to the area where the naval search was concentrated, according a policeman and member of a local funeral association. The plane lost contact 29 minutes after takeoff while flying at 18,000 feet (5,485 metres) over the sea, about 43 miles (70 km) west of the town of Dawei, the military said. It is monsoon season in Myanmar, but a civil aviation official said the weather had been  normal  with good visibility when the plane took off. The aircraft was bought in March 2016 and had a total of 809 flying hours. It was carrying 2.4 tons of supplies, the military said. Aircraft incidents, both civilian and military, are not uncommon in the Southeast Asian country. A military helicopter crashed last June in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel on board. Five military personnel were killed last February after an air force aircraft crashed in the country's capital, Naypyitaw, according to media reports. Two people were killed and 11 injured after a small plane crashed in central Myanmar in 2012.

LA 2024 Chairman Casey Wasserman said in a statement that when the idea of a dual award for the 2024 and 2028 Games was initially raised, LA did not respond with a  now or never  ultimatum.   We could have used that strategy, but we didn't because we thought it was presumptuous to tell the (International Olympic Committee) what to do and how to think. We're better partners than that,  he said.  LA's primary focus is not on itself but rather on the Olympic movement and the world, he said.   That may be a surprising statement for an American bid; but, it shouldn't be because America's support for the Games has never wavered - ever,  he said.  LA is competing against Paris to host the 2024 Olympics. Some think the City of Lights is due after its bids for 1992, 2008 and 2012 were all rejected. The 2024 Games would also mark 100 years since the French capital last hosted the international competition. Last month Wasserman and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti rolled out the red carpet for an International Olympic Committee (IOC) delegation visiting LA, whisking them around to the city's many sports venues and to a star-studded dinner at Wasserman's home.  Garcetti told Reuters during the IOC's visit that winning any Olympic Games would constitute a victory for the city, but also said to reporters  why wait for 2028?   LA claims it can put on a low-cost, environmentally sound Olympics because it already has all of the necessary infrastructure in place while Paris would need to build several expensive venues including an aquatic center and an Olympic Village.  The IOC will announce its decision in Lima, Peru in September.  Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2024-la-idUSKBN18Y2XQ"},

The move could mean substantial delays in a full deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, as the review may take well over a year, according to a senior official at the presidential Blue House. South Korea said last week four more launchers had been introduced, months after the controversial battery was deployed in March with just two of its maximum load of six launchers. The additional launchers had been brought in to the deployment site in the southeastern region of Seongju without being reported to the new government or to the public, new President Moon Jae-in's office said last week, asking for a probe into why it was not informed of the move by South Korea's defense ministry. The four launchers have yet to be installed and made operational.  It doesn't make sense to withdraw the two initial launchers which had already been deployed and installed, but additional installation will be decided after the environmental impact assessment is over,  the administration official told reporters on Wednesday.  Whether we must urgently move forward with additional installment by ignoring legal transparency and due procedure is a question.  The Pentagon said it would continue to work transparently with Seoul but did not signal any expectation that the decision to deploy THAAD would be upended.  The U.S. trusts the (South Korean government's) official stance that the THAAD deployment was an alliance decision and it will not be reversed,  a Pentagon spokesman said.  We look forward to continuing our close coordination with the Moon administration,  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Anna Richey-Allen said when asked about the South Korean decision. U.S. Congressman Republican Ed Royce said in a statement that the missile system was critical to protecting South Korea.  I hope any environmental concerns related to the full deployment of THAAD will be dispelled with a quick and thorough review,  said Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. U.S. defense company Lockheed Martin Corp is the lead contractor for the THAAD system. North Korea has conducted three ballistic missile tests since Moon took office, maintaining its accelerated pace of missile and nuclear-related activities since the beginning of last year in defiance of U.N. sanctions and U.S. pressure. During his successful election campaign, Moon had pledged to review the previous South Korean government's decision to deploy THAAD, saying the deployment was rushed without assessing its environmental impact or seeking parliamentary approval. Moon's decision to order an investigation into the deployment came amid signs of easing tensions between South Korea and China, North Korea's sole major diplomatic ally. The decision to deploy the system was made by Moon's conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and thrown out of office in a corruption scandal that engulfed South Korea's business and political elite. Moon took office on May 10 without a transition period because a snap presidential election was held just two months after Park was ousted. He inherited her defense minister, along with the rest of the cabinet, and has yet to name his own. Moon has said his order for the probe at the defense ministry was purely a domestic measure and not aimed at stopping the deployment, which has drawn angry protests from China.

The discoveries were made on a nondescript side street just behind the city's colonial-era Roman Catholic cathedral off the main Zocalo plaza on the grounds of a 1950s-era hotel. The underground excavations reveal a section of what was the foundation of a massive, circular-shaped temple dedicated to the Aztec wind god Ehecatl and a smaller part of a ritual ball court, confirming accounts of the first Spanish chroniclers to visit the Aztec imperial capital, Tenochtitlan.  Due to finds like these, we can show actual locations, the positioning and dimensions of each one of the structures first described in the chronicles,  said Diego Prieto, head of Mexico's main anthropology and history institute. Archaeologists also detailed a grisly offering of 32 severed male neck vertebrae discovered in a pile just off the court.  It was an offering associated with the ball game, just off the stairway,  said archaeologist Raul Barrera.  The vertebrae, or necks, surely came from victims who were sacrificed or decapitated.

Early Spanish accounts relate how a young Moctezuma played against an elderly allied king on the court and lost, which was taken as sign that the Aztec Empire's days were numbered. Slideshow (7 Images)The building would have stood out because of its round shape among the several dozen other square temples that dominated the Aztecs' most sacred ceremonial space before the 1521 conquest. Aztec archaeologist Eduardo Matos said the top of the temple was likely built to resemble a coiled snake, with priests entering though a doorway made to look like a serpent's nose. Once excavations finish, a museum will be built on the site, rubbing shoulders with modern buildings in the capital. Mexico City, including its many colonial-era structures with their own protections, was built above the razed ruins of the Aztec capital, and more discoveries are likely, Matos said.  We've been working this area for nearly 40 years, and there's always construction of some kind ... and so we take advantage of that and get involved,  he said.

North Korea fired what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast earlier on Thursday, less than a week after the United Nations Security Council passed fresh sanctions on the reclusive state. Thursday's launch was the fourth missile test by North Korea since Moon took office in Seoul on May 10, pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang. Arrangements were being made for Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, the second-most powerful politician in the ruling party after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, to visit South Korea from June 10 to 13, an official at Nikai's office said. A meeting with Moon was being planned but the timing was not yet set, the official said. Nikai will be accompanied by a delegation that includes four other national lawmakers, regional officials and business leaders and could number  several hundred . Abe has pledged to work with Moon, who has taken a more conciliatory line towards North Korea than the Japanese leader. Moon has also suggested he could try to reverse a landmark agreement reached with Japan in 2015 to resolve the issue of  comfort women , as those forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels are known, an issue that has long plagued ties between the two nations.

The 1992 world champion, who won his title with Williams but was loved by the Ferrari fans as 'Il Leone' (The Lion) during his earlier time at Maranello, told Reuters he was skeptical of the claim.  That's rhetoric. I don't believe they're underdogs,  said the 63-year-old Briton, who was speaking before being inducted into the Motor Sport Magazine Hall of Fame at a gala dinner on Wednesday.  I think they are very close.  Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel has won three of the six races so far, with closest rival Lewis Hamilton 25 points behind after two victories. Finland's Valtteri Bottas has also won for Mercedes. Mercedes have won the last three drivers' and constructors' championships without conceding more than three races in any of those seasons. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said after Ferrari finished one-two in Monaco last month that the champions were now underdogs and revisited the theme ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix.  It's painful, but we are not the favorites for this year's championship. At the moment it's Ferrari,  said the Austrian in a race preview. Mansell said that Ferrari had done  an absolutely outstanding job through the winter to come out and challenge Mercedes like they have  and was delighted for his old team.  But now it's going to be a race on development, whatever manufacturer develops at a faster rate will ultimately win the world championship,  he added. The Briton tipped Mercedes to work through their issues and said triple world champion Hamilton remained  a class act  who was lightning quick and would be in contention right to the end providing reliability held up.  What Lewis has got to do when things are not quite right is get the best he can possibly out of himself and the team,  he said.  But Lewis still can win the championship this year, it's going to be very close between them,  added Mansell, describing Bottas as a clear number two despite doing a great job since joining in January as replacement for retired champion Nico Rosberg. Mansell also spared a thought for Honda, McLaren's beleaguered engine partners, after comments by the team's executive director Zak Brown casting doubt on the future of the partnership.  I'd suggest probably something has got to change,  said Mansell, who won races in Honda-engined cars at Williams.  And fast. And hopefully it can change where McLaren and Honda get it right together.  They should now be competing for the wins and the world championship. And sadly, for whatever reason best known to them, it's not happening.  Editing by Peter Rutherford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-fame-mansell-idUSKBN18Z078"},

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc, Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd. Woodside Petroleum, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year. Woodside said on Thursday that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator from Britain's Cairn Energy PLC. FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal. Woodside said it did not believe that FAR's claims had any merit.  These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin,  Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement. FAR Managing Director Cath Norman, who has kept a low profile over the ownership dispute up to now, said given that Woodside was not operator of the field, it could not claim that development would be delayed.  We are correcting the mistruths that are in the announcement by Woodside stating that the development will be delayed. Cairn is the operator, not Woodside,  Norman told Reuters. FAR is planning to take the dispute to international arbitration if the pre-emptive rights are not resolved, Norman said, as the SNE project is its core asset, with an estimated resource of 641 million barrels. Woodside has flagged the Senegal development as one of its key near term growth projects. FAR has a 15 percent stake in the project, while Cairn Energy has a 40 percent stake and the state owns the remainder. Spokesmen for Cairn were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced the 60-day review of sage grouse conservation rules in a Wednesday conference call with reporters, saying Western governors have complained that federal implementation of the plan has been alternately  heavy-handed  and inconsistent. Environmental groups immediately protested the move, saying it might lead to unraveling a complex and delicately balanced strategy that took federal agencies years to negotiate with state and local governments, scientists, ranchers and other private interests. The Obama administration launched the plan in September 2015 as an alternative to listing the ground-dwelling bird under the Endangered Species Act, a move that would potentially have entailed even tougher habitat protections. Zinke insisted he was seeking to perfect, not dismantle, sage grouse conservation measures, while allowing greater innovation and  flexibility  by individual states on  such things as jobs and energy development.  He said greater focus might be placed on factors other than strict habitat protection, such as predator, disease and wildfire control. Zinke also said some states have suggested the overall strategy place more emphasis on grouse population numbers than on habitat size.

Bob Wick/Courtesy BLM/Handout via REUTERSTwo Western governors, Democrat John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Republican Matthew Mead of Wyoming, who co-chair a federal-state sage grouse task force, contradicted such a shift in a letter to Zinke last month.  We understand that you are considering ... moving from a habitat management model to one that sets population objectives for the states. We are concerned that this is not the right decision,  they wrote in the May 26 letter. The plight of the grouse, a key indicator species for America's dwindling sagebrush ecosystem, has pitted conservation groups against oil and gas drilling, wind farms and cattle grazing in one of the biggest industry-versus-nature conflicts in decades. The landmark measures implemented 21 months ago were aimed at saving the grouse while allowing activities such as energy development, mining and ranching to co-exist with the chicken-sized prairie fowl. The greater sage grouse, known for its elaborate mating rituals, once ranged by the millions across a broad expanse of the western United States and Canada. They are now believed to number between 200,000 and 500,000 birds across 11 Western states and southern Alberta. Besides a patchwork of conservation programs for state and private lands representing 45 percent of sage grouse habitat, the new strategy includes a set of tiered limits on commercial development inside 67 million acres (27 million hectares) of designated habitat on federal land. Unlike many Western land-use battles of the past, sage grouse conservation drew wide support from commercial interests. Many ranchers, in particular, found common cause with efforts to protect the rangelands on which their livestock depend, citing the axiom:  What's good for the bird is good for the herd.

The Wall Street bank's consumer arm, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, plans on Wednesday to raise the rate it offers customers on deposits to 1.2 percent, slightly higher than rivals Synchrony Bank, CIT Bank and New York Community Bank's My Banking Direct. FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016.David Gray/File PhotoGoldman had previously offered savers 1.05 percent. The average national rate for savings accounts is currently 0.06 percent, according to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The move makes Goldman the highest interest paying bank, according to personal finance website Bankrate.com. The firm is aggressively trying to boost its deposit base and attract Main Street clients.  Goldman's online deposits from individuals total $12 billion, a small but growing fraction of the $128 billion in overall deposits on the firm's overall balance sheet. Still, that is far less than large commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co with $1.4 trillion in deposits. Goldman hopes increasing its deposit base will help it boost profits if it can find ways to lend them profitably. The bank is looking to make further inroads into lending broadly across wealth management and investment banking, as businesses like trading struggle to generate the type of returns they once did. Deposits also represent a more stable type of funding and are less likely to disappear during times of stress than other funding sources. Regulators may have been pushing banks to rely more on deposits since the 2008 financial crisis.  Last year, the bank launched Marcus, its first major foray into consumer lending. It also acquired Honest Dollar, an online retirement savings platform for small businesses and startups.

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc, Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd. Woodside Petroleum, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year. Woodside said on Thursday that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator from Britain's Cairn Energy PLC. FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal. Woodside said it did not believe that FAR's claims had any merit.  These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin,  Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement. FAR Managing Director Cath Norman, who has kept a low profile over the ownership dispute up to now, said given that Woodside was not operator of the field, it could not claim that development would be delayed.  We are correcting the mistruths that are in the announcement by Woodside stating that the development will be delayed. Cairn is the operator, not Woodside,  Norman told Reuters. FAR is planning to take the dispute to international arbitration if the pre-emptive rights are not resolved, Norman said, as the SNE project is its core asset, with an estimated resource of 641 million barrels. Woodside has flagged the Senegal development as one of its key near term growth projects. FAR has a 15 percent stake in the project, while Cairn Energy has a 40 percent stake and the state owns the remainder. Spokesmen for Cairn were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced the 60-day review of sage grouse conservation rules in a Wednesday conference call with reporters, saying Western governors have complained that federal implementation of the plan has been alternately  heavy-handed  and inconsistent. Environmental groups immediately protested the move, saying it might lead to unraveling a complex and delicately balanced strategy that took federal agencies years to negotiate with state and local governments, scientists, ranchers and other private interests. The Obama administration launched the plan in September 2015 as an alternative to listing the ground-dwelling bird under the Endangered Species Act, a move that would potentially have entailed even tougher habitat protections. Zinke insisted he was seeking to perfect, not dismantle, sage grouse conservation measures, while allowing greater innovation and  flexibility  by individual states on  such things as jobs and energy development.  He said greater focus might be placed on factors other than strict habitat protection, such as predator, disease and wildfire control. Zinke also said some states have suggested the overall strategy place more emphasis on grouse population numbers than on habitat size. Two Western governors, Democrat John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Republican Matthew Mead of Wyoming, who co-chair a federal-state sage grouse task force, contradicted such a shift in a letter to Zinke last month.  We understand that you are considering ... moving from a habitat management model to one that sets population objectives for the states. We are concerned that this is not the right decision,  they wrote in the May 26 letter. The plight of the grouse, a key indicator species for America's dwindling sagebrush ecosystem, has pitted conservation groups against oil and gas drilling, wind farms and cattle grazing in one of the biggest industry-versus-nature conflicts in decades. The landmark measures implemented 21 months ago were aimed at saving the grouse while allowing activities such as energy development, mining and ranching to co-exist with the chicken-sized prairie fowl. The greater sage grouse, known for its elaborate mating rituals, once ranged by the millions across a broad expanse of the western United States and Canada. They are now believed to number between 200,000 and 500,000 birds across 11 Western states and southern Alberta. Besides a patchwork of conservation programs for state and private lands representing 45 percent of sage grouse habitat, the new strategy includes a set of tiered limits on commercial development inside 67 million acres (27 million hectares) of designated habitat on federal land.

PETERSBURG, Russia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  Russia is seeing stronger climate change impacts, from deadly storms in Moscow to river flooding in the country's south, but efforts to adapt to the growing problems remain limited, experts warn. With around 10 million of the country's people facing immediate climate-related risks, according to Russian researchers, there is a need for federal and regional climate adaptation strategies, including better early warning systems and modernized infrastructure, the experts said. Last week, a hurricane with winds up to 30 meters per second (67 miles per hour) hit Moscow at rush hour, leaving 16 people dead and more than 200 others injured, according to Russia's Emergency Ministry. At the other end of the country, in southeastern Siberia, forest fires have repeatedly destroyed settlements with thousands of local residents evacuated and relocated.  In the south of Russia heavy rains and river flooding that threatened a dam in the Stavropol region led to the evacuation of a few thousand people in late May. “These are all visible effects of climate change happening in Russia now. It is finally clear for everyone that the global climate crisis also has highly negative impacts for Russia, with more disasters to come,” Alexey Kokorin, head of the climate and energy program at WWF-Russia, said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Nikolay Gudkov, the spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources, said the government was increasingly aware of the problem. “Yes, all these disasters come as a result of climate change, we do acknowledge that,  he said.  For years there was a public image that climate change only meant rising temperatures, but now we see that it is much more about unexpected natural disasters happening in various parts of the country,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Russia's leaders - long skeptical about human-induced climate change - are now taking the issue more seriously, at least on paper, experts say.  Rising Temperatures - and Risks According to state meteorological service Roshydromet, average temperature in Russia in 2016 grew 2.5 times quicker than the global average. The World Meteorological Organization has said that temperatures in parts of Artic Russia around the Ob River estuary and Novaya Zemlya are 6 to 7 degrees Celsius above the 1961-90 average, while worldwide temperatures are closer to 1 degree Celsius above that average. Both 2015 and 2016 were the warmest years in Russia since the beginning of meteorological observations, the agency said.  Most international climate risk indices put Russia at medium or low risk from climate change. The most recent World Risk Report, put together by United Nations University, for instance, puts Russia in 128th place worldwide in terms of risk. But researchers say assessments of overall country risk are not a good fit for Russia, where the population is distributed highly unevenly, with both sparsely populated areas and large concentrations of people in cities. Sergey Donskoy, Russia’s environment minister, has said that the negative effects of climate change are already costing the country 30 to 60 billion rubles ($530 million to $1 billion) yearly. Forecasts suggest that climate change-related losses may reach as much as 1 to 2 percent of the country's GDP by 2030, he said. Over the last 15 to 20 years the number of dangerous meteorological events in Russia has doubled, with around 590 last year, ranging from strong winds and storms to heavy rain, Russian climatologists said last month, at the opening of Russian Climate Week in Moscow. The country is also seeing - or expected to see - stronger heatwaves and cold snaps, droughts in southern agricultural areas, increasing numbers of forest fires and thawing of permafrost, which covers more than 60 percent of Russia's territory, the climatologists said. “There will be more high waters, including floods, in the areas where we already have a lot of water, and there will be even less water in dry regions”, Mikhail Georgievsky, a researcher from the State Hydrological Institute, said at a Russian-British seminar on climate risks in March in Moscow. Stepan Zemtsov, a researcher with the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, noted that more than 10 million people are  highly exposed  to climate risks in Russia. Planning Ahead Researchers and environmentalists have called for both federal and regional strategies to adapt to the growing problems to be drafted soon. “Russia is far too slow in its adaptation policy measures,” said Kokorin, of WWF-Russia.  The country has plans to develop and approve a national adaptation plan by mid-2018, as part of its plan to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change. Russia is the only large carbon emitter that has not yet ratified the 2015 global climate accord, in part because of pressure from the country's coal and metal industries, which are worried about possible carbon regulation measures, experts said. So far just six of 85 regions in Russia - including Moscow and St. Petersburg - are working on regional climate adaptation strategies. “New climate adaptation strategy should certainly modernize early warning systems, especially in the area of spreading of information,  Zemtsov said. According to polling of residents in Russia's most climate-vulnerable regions by Zemtsov and his team, 69 percent of people do not know evacuation routes, 55 percent have never taken part in any training activity and 14 percent openly say they will ignore any alarm raised, he said. Zemtsov said he believed all of those percentages could be higher in other parts of the country. Researchers say Russia will need to modernize its infrastructure - including its drainage systems - to deal with problems such as increasingly heavy rain. Storm drains in St. Petersburg, for instance, are already at capacity while rainfall is predicted to become much heavier by the end of the century.   “Climate change should become an important factor in urban planning in Russia. We need to start thinking in terms of climate-resilient architecture and city planning,  said Ksenia Mokrushina, a director of the Centre of Urban Studies at Skolkovo Moscow School of Management.  Fighting with disasters and adapting to climate change is not a one-off action, it is a regular set of measures,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. For the moment, she said, government action is disproportionately focused on responding to disasters and recovering from them instead of preparing for them and trying to reduce risks. “The shift towards adaptation planning and risk management must happen at the local level rather than waiting for the federal Ministry for Emergency to come and rescue when it is already too late,  she said.

Over 2,290 refugee and asylum seeker children were held in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia at the end of 2016, according to Save the Children and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network in a report released on Thursday. The three nations have been on key transit routes for thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, from countries including Myanmar, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who are trying to flee violence or poverty at home to reach Australia. But they are often intercepted during these journeys, and authorities typically treat asylum seekers and refugees as illegal immigrants, subjecting them to arrest or detention.  These children should not be treated like criminals,  said Mike Novell, Save the Children's interim director for Asia.  The impact this environment has on children is extremely damaging... It can lead to developmental delays and self-harm while putting children at very real risk of violence, sexual abuse and exploitation.  Based on analysis of immigration policies and interviews with a small number of child detainees, the report found children often being detained with unrelated adults and separated from their families. Some were forced to sleep in  cramped and substandard  conditions, including on cardboard or directly on the floor, the report said, and were given food that was  unpalatable . It found some children were housed in cells so hot it was difficult to breathe, and on some occasions in rooms so overcrowded they could not lie down at night with their legs fully extended.  There's a lot of germs... the weather was so hot... we cannot breathe ourselves easily because it's really hot inside,  the report quoted a 14-year-old girl, who was detained in a cell with 150 other people, as saying. The charities said although the number of child detainees in Asia-Pacific had fallen by over 50 percent at the end of 2016 compared with 2014, countries must move to end child detention entirely. In Australia, where nearly all children have been released from detention in recent years, the two rights groups called for a review of the country's laws which still allow the practice. Governments should adopt community housing or foster care for unaccompanied child instead, the charities urged, saying they are a more humane and cheaper alternative.

A modest 0.5 degree Celsius rise in average temperatures in India over the last 50 years has led to a nearly 150 percent hike in heatwaves that kill at least 100 people, said researchers at the University of California in Irvine. But with India now on a path to between 2.2 and 5.5 degrees Celsius of temperature rise by the end of the century, the rate of heatwave deaths in India – and other Asian nations – could soar, scientists say.  I was taken aback by how large the increase in the likelihood of these mass mortality events was with a modest increase in temperature,  said Steven J. Davis, an earth systems science professor at the university and one of the authors of the report, published in the journal Science Advances.  Even under the lower global warming scenario, you still see temperature increases of 2, 3 or more degrees. We're looking at a small temperature increase and still seeing a big increase in heatwave deaths. It seems pretty shocking,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. With such temperature rises expected across much of the world by the end of the century, higher heat levels  may make low-latitude developing nations in the Asian subcontinent, the Middle East, Africa and South America practically uninhabitable during the summer months , the report noted. The study, based on temperature and heat death data from India between 1960 and 2009, looked at heatwaves defined as three or more consecutive days of very high temperatures.  It noted that in the years since 2009 heatwaves in India killed more than 1,300 people in 2010, 1,500 in 2013, and 2,500 in 2015 as summers grow hotter. Recorded heatwave deaths in India are likely underestimates, the researchers said, because deaths, particularly in rural areas, may not be classified as being the result of heat. Access to electricity – particularly for air conditioning – can help curb heat deaths, the study found, but about a quarter of Indians have no electric power, and nearly a quarter earn less than $1.25 a day, which can make electricity unaffordable. The poor are particularly hard-hit by heatwaves, researchers said, not only because many lack power but also because they often struggle to access clean drinking water and shelter from the heat, and may have health conditions aggravated by high temperatures and limited medical care. India's government is trying to expand access to electric power, in part to cope with rising heat, and aims to connect all homes by 2019 – a huge task in a nation of 1.3 billion people.  Access to air conditioning and electricity is key to address heat-caused mortality and that requires significant investment,  said Amir AghaKouchak, one of the report's authors.  India's government is trying, they're doing great. But the population is also growing. It's not an easy challenge.  Some Indian cities also have put in place heat action plans that provide emergency cooling centers, cancel leave for doctors and broadcast warnings when temperatures reach critical levels.  India is quite proactive in climate-related education and outreach,  AghaKouchak said by telephone.  Awareness is the low-hanging fruit  in dealing with the problem, he added. But bigger temperature rises expected in coming decades will make it harder to find effective coping strategies, Davis warned.  An ongoing heatwave in the Indian states of Odisha and Gujarat has killed nearly 20 people in recent days, with the summer only just getting underway, he noted. A half degree of warming over the last 50 years already has boosted deadly heatwaves from one every eight years to one every three years on average, Davis said.  Assuming that relationship holds for another half degree – or more – it could be much worse,  he said. The findings, the researchers said, are  a wake-up call to governments and international organizations to devote resources and efforts to improving the resilience of areas most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change . As the United States prepares to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement,  we shouldn't be turning our backs on the world that is suffering these effects , Davis said.

When traditional communication channels like phone lines are down, it can take too much time to figure out where people need help.  The maps will reflect the movements and location of people before, during and after disasters to help aid agencies work out where they should deliver food, water and medical supplies. Zuckerberg said the new maps would help build  safe communities, and we will keep doing more initiatives like this . The company worked with the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the World Food Programme, among others, to identify what data would be most useful. They would all have immediate access to the new maps, with other agencies to follow. Facebook said it would provide three types of maps: - Location density maps will show people's location before, during and after a disaster. - Movement maps will illustrate flight between neighborhoods or cities over several hours. - Safety check maps will show when users let their family and friends know they are out of harm's way.

The head of the world's largest social networking company met with Lola Omolola, who is based in Chicago, and posted late on Tuesday about Female IN (FIN), which was founded in 2015.  It's a no-judgment space ... helping end the culture of silence that exists for women in some parts of the world,  the 33-year-old billionaire said in a post on his Facebook page.    Zuckerberg, who visited Nigeria last year, said he would be meeting more Facebook group leaders such as Omolola at the first ever Facebook Communities Summit later this month in Chicago.  The summit will help group administrators to  do even more to build community ... and common understanding , he added. In response to Zuckerberg's post, Omolola said Facebook had helped women worldwide to find their voices through the FIN group, and thanked the entrepreneur for  helping me create the world I wish to live in and have my 8 and 10 year old inherit .  Although the FIN group is secret - meaning that only members can invite others to join and view its content - Omolola said in a public video that it aimed to disrupt the status quo and change the landscape in communities where women are not heard.   I come from a community where lots of the time women have a lot to say, but we have been conditioned and we have been raised to keep silent, because someone is going to get embarrassed by something we say,  Omolola said in the video interview with Facebook's diversity director, Maxine Williams. Nigeria's Senate last year threw out a gender and equality law that pledged to end discrimination in politics, education and employment, protect women's rights and tackle violence against women after lawmakers opposed it on religious grounds. Women's rights activists said the dismissal showed the government was ignoring the dangers facing Nigerian women, ranging from sexual assault and abduction to forced marriages.

{"news_time":"2017-06-07 21:22:00","news_title":"Ex-FBI chief Comey tells U.S. senators Trump pressured him on Russia probe","keywords":"Russia,United States,Adam Schiff,Andrew Wright,Bruce Green,Donald Trump,James Comey,Jared Kushner,Marc Kasowitz,Michael Flynn,Mike Flynn,Paul Ryan,Reince Priebus,Richard Burr,USA,TRUMP/RUSSIA,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In written testimony released the day before he appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said Trump told him at a meeting in the White House in February:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.  The testimony puts more pressure on Trump, a Republican, whose presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that Moscow helped him win last year's election. Some legal experts said Comey’s testimony could strengthen any impeachment case built on obstruction of justice, but U.S. markets shrugged off the news from the testimony for lack of any major disclosures. To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation. While a sitting president is very unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Comey said he had told Trump on three occasions he was not being investigated, confirming an earlier account from the president. Trump, who spent part of Wednesday in Ohio talking about the need to fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure, ignored reporters’ shouted questions about Comey. On returning to the Oval Office, Trump went into a meeting with top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. Later, his outside counsel released a statement saying Trump felt  completely and totally vindicated  by Comey's account.  The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,  Marc Kasowitz, Trump's attorney, said in a statement. 'Awkward Silence' Several congressional committees, as well as the FBI and a special counsel, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November's election in Trump's favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion. Trump abruptly fired Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe, on May 9. Comey painted a vivid picture for senators of awkward encounters with Trump in seven pages of testimony. Comey described a private dinner in the Green Room of the White House on Jan. 26, where Trump asked him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director, telling him:  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.   I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence,  Comey said in his testimony, explaining he became concerned that Trump was trying to create  some sort of patronage relationship.  On Feb. 14, after an Oval Office briefing on counterterrorism, Trump asked Comey to stay behind, dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who lingered, and waving off Priebus, who peeked through the door.  When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn,'  Comey said in his testimony. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States. The FBI has been investigating Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey quoted Trump as telling him:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  On March 30, Trump phoned Comey and asked what  we could do to lift the cloud  of the FBI's Russia investigation.  He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia,  said Comey, who had briefed Trump on  salacious material  that had arisen in a counter-intelligence investigation. Legal Fallout? Some legal experts said Comey’s written statement could be used to show that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. “It shows the president was doing everything he could to shut down the Flynn investigation,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of criminal law at Savannah Law School. Bruce Green, a professor of law at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult, however, to show that Trump intended to obstruct justice. Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn's character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function effectively as president, Green said. Democrats jumped on the testimony, expressing concern that Trump had inappropriately meddled with the probe.  It's certainly very possible that this is evidence, in combination with other actions by the president, that could amount to obstruction. It's certainly an effort to interfere in the investigation,  the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, told CNN. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about Trump's request for loyalty from Comey, said it was  very, very critical  that FBI directors remain  independent.  But Republican Senator Richard Burr, who heads the Senate intelligence panel, said he did not take issue with Trump's request.  I don't think it's wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody in an administration,  Burr said.

Trump,Hannah Shearer,Michele Hoitenga,Rick Snyder,USA,GUNS/MICHIGAN,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Legislation to allow Michigan gun owners to carry a concealed handgun without a permit was approved in the state House of Representatives on Wednesday, in a move that follows the lead of a dozen other states. The package of four bills, which cleared the Republican-controlled House with support from a handful of Democrats, now moves to the Senate, also dominated by Republicans. It was not immediately clear whether Michigan's Republican Governor Rick Snyder supports the bill. But the measure, if also approved in a Senate vote, could automatically become law 14 days after reaching the governor's desk unless he vetoes it. The legislation would lift a requirement that handgun owners obtain a concealed pistol license with a $100 fee to legally carry the weapon in public. Handgun owners also would be allowed carry a concealed pistol in public without the firearms training that is currently mandated. Advocates framed the issue as upholding a U.S. constitutional right to bear arms.  We all know criminals are not paying fees, taking classes and waiting for approval to come in the mail before they begin carrying guns,  Michigan state Representative Michele Hoitenga, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. The legislation  levels the playing field for honest people,  she said. Opponents of the bill criticized it as dangerous. Twelve other U.S. states already allow gun owners to carry their weapons without a concealed-carry permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Most are conservative-leaning with Republican-majority legislatures but Vermont, where Democrats control the statehouse, is among the 12.  The states that have eliminated the permit requirement are basically making it easier to carry a gun in public than drive a car,  said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress this year would, if approved and signed by President Donald Trump, require all states to allow firearm owners to carry their guns under the regulations of their home state, even if visiting elsewhere. For instance, a person allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in North Dakota could do so when visiting California or New York state, where permits are required, Shearer said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-guns-michigan-idUSL1N1J5019"},

Arenado, who went 3-for-5 with three RBIs, tied his career high with four strikeouts Tuesday. On Wednesday, he doubled home two runs and had an RBI triple in the third inning in support of rookie left-hander Kyle Freeland.  Obviously yesterday was pretty tough,  Arenado said.  I don't know what got me going. Maybe it was the fact I didn't strike out my first at-bat. That made me feel good. 'All right, I can still hit the ball a little bit,' even though it was a little dribbler (to third).  The Rockies have outscored opponents 32-6 while winning four straight. They are a season-high 15 games above .500 (38-23) and have a series record of 14-3-3. Freeland, who held the Indians scoreless until the seventh when Jose Ramirez belted his eighth home run, gave up one run on six hits in 6 1/3 innings. He didn't issue a walk for first time in his 12 career starts, had five strikeouts and got nine outs on ground balls. It was the team-leading ninth quality start for Freeland (7-3), who leads all major league rookie starters with a 3.34 ERA.  It was a heavy day of a lot of sinkers, a lot of sliders,  Freeland said.  From the bullpen into the game, those two pitches were working really well. We were able to mix fastballs in and out when we needed to, but mostly that sinker-slider combo got the job done.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at RockiesCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchAustin Jackson followed Ramirez's homer with a single that ended Freeland's 100-pitch workday. The crowd of 36,909 then showed its appreciation for the effort by Freeland, who was born and raised in Denver.  Walking off the mound, I got chills from that standing ovation,  Freeland said.  So that was pretty awesome. Day game, middle of the week, getting a crowd like that -- it's great for the city and great for this team.  Chris Rusin replaced Freeland and gave up a bunt single to Bradley Zimmer. With two outs and runners on second and third, Rusin got pinch hitter Edwin Encarnacion to tap back to him. The loss was the fifth in seven games for the defending American League champion Indians (29-28).  The only thing we're really consistent in is being inconsistent,  Indians manager Terry Francona said.  In our game, if something comes up short, you usually pay for it. Either we make an error or starting pitching doesn't got deep or we don't get any hits.  But what I really care about more than anything is just our ability to just value how important every game is and leave it out on the field. If it's not good enough, then we'll come back tomorrow. If we do that, we're going to be OK.  Arenado's two-run, two-out double with the bases loaded gave the Rockies a 2-0 lead in the third. Indians starter Trevor Bauer (5-5) then issued his third walk of the inning to load the bases again but struck out Mark Reynolds, who disgustedly slammed down his helmet after his foul tip was caught. The Rockies made it 4-0 in the fourth on Charlie Blackmon's two-run double. It came with one out after Bauer gave up a leadoff single to Ian Desmond and walked Trevor Story. Bauer gave up four runs on five hits in 3 1/3 innings with five walks and three strikeouts as he came back with two days' rest after a Sunday start was halted by rain after 1 2/3 innings.  Got myself in trouble by walking people,  Bauer said.  That's on me, I wasn't very good. When I got in jams, I feel like I executed pitches to try and get out of them and did the best I could to minimize the damage. The ball didn't go to people today. I don't know why.  With the Rockies leading 2-0, Freeland got a big lift in the fourth after Francisco Lindor led off with a double. Center fielder Blackmon cut down Lindor when he tried to tag up and take third on Michael Brantley's deep drive. Blackmon's throw made it in the air to third baseman Arenado, but he had to come well off the base for the ball. With a dive, he tagged Lindor on the left foot as he was sliding head-first. Lindor was originally called safe, but the call was overturned.  I saw Charlie get behind it well,  Arenado said.  I knew we had a chance. I made up my mind I was going to dive for him, no matter what. Luckily, I got his foot. But it was all Charlie; he made a great throw.  Blackmon said,  I didn't think there was really much of a chance. I don't think I had time to pop it in there, so I tried to put it right on the bag and it wasn't. Nolan made a good play.

Slideshow (6 Images)In Caracas on Wednesday, security forces using armored vehicles, water cannons and tear gas blocked opposition supporters from marching to the national election board's headquarters, sparking clashes around the city.       Masked youths with homemade shields hurled stones and Molotov cocktails, and set up burning roadblocks, while businesses and schools closed, and residents ran for cover.  Among hundreds of injuries reported in Caracas and other cities, the government highlighted the case of two National Guard soldiers wounded by gunshots when they were clearing a barricade in the El Paraiso district of the capital.   Seeking to keep the pressure on Maduro, the opposition announced further upcoming activities including a planned censure vote against the interior minister in the National Assembly and a rally in honor of Lander on Thursday. Maduro has sought to take the heat out of the situation by announcing the creation of a super-body called a constituent assembly with powers to rewrite the constitution, but foes say that is a sham purely designed to keep the socialists in power.  The national election board announced on Wednesday that votes for the new assembly would still go ahead on July 30, despite an opposition boycott, criticism from some within government, and a legal appeal by state prosecutor Luisa Ortega who said it threatened to  eliminate  democracy. The pro-government Supreme Court rejected her petition in a ruling made public on Wednesday.

Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor, setting a June 20 deadline to be in  substantial compliance  with the decrees.     Lawyers representing the state's 3 million Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over the state fully funding other priorities, including debt service on bonds and pensions.  Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the state's bills, has not offered a  lawful basis  for not paying the Medicaid providers the $2 billion they are owed.  Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this court’s previous orders,  the judge's latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. As a result of the stalemate, Illinois' backlog of unpaid bills reached $14.9 billion this week.  Mendoza said the real solution is enacting a budget.   The lack of a budget for the last two years has created a situation in which we now have more court-ordered and state-mandated payments than we have revenues to cover them,  she said in a statement. Tom Yates, executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing Medicaid recipients in court, said more money is being sought at this time to ensure access to medical care, not an immediate payment in full.  I think the talks will have little different tenor now because the judge makes it pretty clear she expects more money to flow to Medicaid providers,  he said.  The consent decrees, which require the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems, stem from two 1992 cases.

Four pitches later, Donaldson launched Frankie Montas' 98 mph fastball over the left-center field fence for a two-run homer against his former team, and the Blue Jays held on for a 7-5 victory at Oakland Coliseum. The Blue Jays expected nothing less from Donaldson, who has made a habit of late-game heroics.  The game's on the line in a big situation, we always expect that,  said Blue Jays first baseman Justin Smoak, who hit his 16th and 17th home runs of the season.  He's done it so many times.  Smoak hit two solo home runs -- one in the second inning and one in the 10th -- and Pillar hit a three-run homer in the second for Toronto, which won the series finale to avoid a three-game sweep. Leading off the 10th, Pillar fell behind in the count 0-2, but Montas drilled him with a pitch. Then Donaldson hit Montas' 1-2 pitch for his seventh home run of the season, this one coming against the team that traded him to Toronto after the 2014 season. Donaldson said there's still something special about coming up big at the Coliseum, where his major-league career began.  I was able to do that a few times when I played here too,  said Donaldson, who was the American League's MVP in 2015.  So it was nice to kind of be able to come back and hit one in a timely situation.  Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at AthleticsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchBlue Jays manager John Gibbons wasn't surprised when Donaldson went deep.  Once again, Josh does something big when we need it,  Gibbons said.  That's what MVPs do. He's good, but he knows he's good. He'll tell you he's good. That's what star players do.  Two batters later, Smoak hit an opposite-field homer to right-center field off Montas (1-1), who has allowed nine home runs this season.  He left some balls up in the zone,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Montas.  The second one was a breaking ball. May have sped him up. You know he's got a good fastball. He's proud of the heater, but you know when you get it into the middle of the plate at the big league level against good hitters they're going to turn it around, as you saw.  Blue Jays right-hander Roberto Osuna gave up a run in the bottom of the 10th but got his 14th save of the season. Rajai Davis doubled with two outs and scored on Matt Joyce's single before Osuna struck out Jed Lowrie. Toronto's Danny Barnes pitched perfect sixth and seventh innings with three strikeouts in relief of Francisco Liriano. Joe Smith pitched a perfect eighth with two strikeouts, and Ryan Tepera (4-1) a perfect ninth with one strikeout.  They've been on a nice little roll,  Gibbons said of his bullpen. Rajai Davis went 4-for-5 with a triple and two doubles and scored four runs for the A's. He matched his career high for hits. Trevor Plouffe hit a solo home run, and Khris Davis had a double and two RBIs in four at-bats.  I think I just was able to simplify everything, not do too much and just use my hands,  Rajai Davis said. Liriano allowed four runs (three earned) and six hits in five innings in a no-decision. Making his second start since a stint on the disabled list for right shoulder inflammation, Liriano struck out five, walked one and threw 92 pitches. A's right-hander Jharel Cotton gave up four runs and four hits in six innings, striking out four and walking four. He blanked the Blue Jays in five of his six innings but gave up four runs and two homers in the second inning. Cotton made his third start since being recalled from Triple-A Nashville on May 27. The A's took a 1-0 lead in the first when Rajai Davis hit a leadoff double to center field, moved to third on wild pitch and scored on Khris Davis' double. Toronto answered with four runs in the second. Smoak, who had his first two-homer game of the season, led off with an opposite-field shot to left-center field.  I can't describe it,  Gibbons said of the season Smoak is having.  Nobody's ever seen him this good with us. I can't say enough good things about this guy.  Cotton struck out the next two batters he faced, but then walked left fielder Chris Coghlan and gave up a single to Ryan Goins. Pillar followed with a three-run shot to left center, his eighth homer of the season, making it 4-1. Oakland cut Toronto's lead to 4-2 with an unearned run in the third. Plouffe made it 4-3 in the fourth with a leadoff home run that snapped his career-high 0-for-25 streak. In the fifth, Rajai Davis led off with a triple to deep left field that Coghlan couldn't grab and scored on Pinder's sacrifice fly to make it 4-4. Five innings later, Donaldson got the lead back for Toronto with one swing.  I was able to get a fastball over the heart of the plate and get enough on it to get it out,  Donaldson said. NOTES: Oakland 1B Yonder Alonso, who has a career-high 16 home runs, was out of the starting lineup but pinch hit in the 10th and remained in the game. ... A's RF Matt Joyce (strained right quad), who missed Tuesday's game, pinch hit in the eighth inning and remained in the game in right field. ...

The package of four bills, which cleared the Republican-controlled House with support from a handful of Democrats, now moves to the Senate, also dominated by Republicans.  It was not immediately clear whether Michigan's Republican Governor Rick Snyder supports the bill. But the measure, if also approved in a Senate vote, could automatically become law 14 days after reaching the governor's desk unless he vetoes it. The legislation would lift a requirement that handgun owners obtain a concealed pistol license with a $100 fee to legally carry the weapon in public.  Handgun owners also would be allowed carry a concealed pistol in public without the firearms training that is currently mandated.  Advocates framed the issue as upholding a U.S. constitutional right to bear arms. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder is seen at a bill signing event in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. on June 20, 2014. Picture taken on June 20, 2014.Rebecca Cook We all know criminals are not paying fees, taking classes and waiting for approval to come in the mail before they begin carrying guns,  Michigan state Representative Michele Hoitenga, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.  The legislation  levels the playing field for honest people,  she said. The Michigan Capitol building is pictured in Lansing, Michigan, U.S. on December 19, 2016. Picture taken on December 19, 2016.Rebecca CookOpponents of the bill criticized it as dangerous. Twelve other U.S. states already allow gun owners to carry their weapons without a concealed-carry permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Most are conservative-leaning with Republican-majority legislatures but Vermont, where Democrats control the statehouse, is among the 12.  The states that have eliminated the permit requirement are basically making it easier to carry a gun in public than drive a car,  said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress this year would, if approved and signed by President Donald Trump, require all states to allow firearm owners to carry their guns under the regulations of their home state, even if visiting elsewhere. For instance, a person allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in North Dakota could do so when visiting California or New York state, where permits are required, Shearer said.

The common currency was fetching $1.1251, having regained some footing after slipping to as low as $1.1204 on Wednesday, pressured by reports suggesting the ECB would lower its inflation targets. Bloomberg, citing unnamed euro zone officials, said the central bank was preparing to lower its annual inflation forecast for the next three years to 1.5 percent, from 1.7 percent, 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. The new estimate which is subject to approval by the Governing Council, would signal a softer line than many in currency and bond markets have been expecting. The ECB declined to comment. The euro later pared losses after a Reuters report cited sources as saying the ECB is likely to nudge up its forecasts for economic growth in the euro zone even as it trims its inflation estimates.  To me, the risk for the euro is tilted toward the upside, given that the market already traded yesterday based on a dovish image (of the ECB),  said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. The euro is likely to be bought if the ECB were to keep its inflation estimates unchanged, Okagawa added. The ECB is widely expected to keep its policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying programme and pledge to keep rates low. Sterling held steady at $1.2961, trading near Wednesday's peak of $1.2970, its highest level since May 25. The pound gained 0.4 percent on Wednesday, with investors increasingly taking the view that May's party will win a majority in the election on Thursday. Opinion polls showed on Wednesday that May is on course to increase her majority in parliament in the election, suggesting her gamble to call the vote to bolster her position in Brexit negotiations will pay off. Traders also remained watchful ahead of Thursday's U.S. Senate testimony by James Comey, the former Federal Bureau of Investigation fired by President Donald Trump in May. Comey accused Trump on Wednesday of trying to get him to water down the FBI probe into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to testimony posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, held steady at 96.774. Against the yen, the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 109.94 yen, having pulled up from Wednesday's low of 109.115 yen, the greenback's weakest level since April 21. The yen showed little reaction to reports of missile launches by North Korea. North Korea fired what appeared to be several land-to-ship missiles off its east coast on Thursday, South Korea's military said, the latest in a fast-paced series of missile tests defying world pressure to rein in its weapons programme.

(Reuters) - Bill Cosby told the mother of the woman who has accused him of sexual assault that he was a  sick man  and apologized, the mother testified on Wednesday at the comedian's criminal trial. Gianna Constand, Andrea Constand's mother, told a Pennsylvania jury that she had a 2-1/2-hour phone conversation with Cosby after her daughter told her about the alleged 2004 assault a year after it happened.  He admitted he was a sick man,  she said, as the 79-year-old entertainer, sat with his head bowed and shook his head vigorously.  He said, 'I apologize to Andrea and I apologize to you.'  The claim came after Andrea Constand finished more than six hours of testimony, as defense lawyers sought to undermine her credibility by portraying her as an opportunist who pursued Cosby's affections before manufacturing a story in order to go after his fortune. Cosby has faced sexual assault allegations from dozens of women, but Constand's accusation is the only one to lead to criminal charges. The man once known as  America's dad  for his role in the 1980s television hit  The Cosby Show,  has denied all wrongdoing. Defense attorneys were quick to assert that the elder Constand had misconstrued the conversation, which contained graphic details, and said Cosby had asked the younger Constand to  tell the truth  about the encounter.  He was sorry that you were upset,  defense lawyer Angela Agrusa said, providing an alternate explanation for Cosby's apology. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby arrives with spokesman Andrew Wyatt (not pictured) for the third day of his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 7, 2017.Brendan McDermid No, he was sorry for what he did,  Gianna Constand shot back. Constand recorded a subsequent conversation with Cosby that was played for the jury. During that call, Cosby avoided any discussion of the incident and instead suggested he would be willing to pay for Constand to attend graduate school. Slideshow (15 Images)The testimony came a day after Andrea Constand described the alleged assault, which she said came after Cosby gave her three unidentified bills that left her feeling  frozen  and unable to resist. Phone records showed Constand called Cosby 53 times between Jan. 20, 2004, days after the incident, and March 31, 2004, when she left Temple University, including twice on Valentine's Day. They also indicated she called lawyers specializing in civil litigation before reporting the alleged assault to police. Constand told jurors she had only spoken with Cosby a  handful of times, all related to her administrative job with the women's basketball program at Temple. Cosby, a university trustee, followed the athletics department closely, she said. Agrusa noted that Constand and Cosby exchanged numerous gifts, and that the comedian gave her cashmere sweaters, perfume and a $225 hair dryer. Constand sued Cosby in 2005 after prosecutors initially decided not to charge him. The lawsuit was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed sum.

A decree published by the environment ministry raised the maximum amount of sulfur dioxide, a byproduct of smelting copper and other base metals, that can be emitted to 250 micrograms per cubic meter per 24 hours, from the 20 micrograms per cubic meter previously. Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer and mining accounts for 60 percent of its exports. Mining companies had criticized Peru for having overly strict air quality standards, complaining the technology to meet them does not exist. A third auction of a smelter in La Oroya, one of the world's most contaminated cities, failed to find a new operator in March. The lack of interest was in part because potential bidders were waiting for new environmental standards to be released. Kuczynski said in July of last year that air quality standards were  unrealistic  and more stringent than in Finland. The situation had slowed investment in Peru, he said.  He said air quality standards used in other mining countries were more reasonable.

Kaepernick, who is a free agent after opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers, chose not to stand for the United States national anthem before games last year, instead kneeling with his head bowed.   None of the NFL's 32 teams were willing to bring the 29-year-old on even as a backup for this season, however, with some conceding that his political stance would be a distraction and a turn-off for some fans.  Jackson said one of foundation traditions of the U.S. was a protest against taxes and said that had brought about positive changes in the areas of civil and women's rights.  Colin Kaepernick kneeled to protest 'out of control police misconduct' that led to greater awareness, conversations and actions that in many instances correct these wrongs,  Jackson said in a statement.   Protests are as American as apple pie, yet now it appears that Mr. Kaepernick is being punished by the NFL, its teams, management and owners for taking a courageous and correct stand,  he said. Jesse Jackson arrives to attend the  third and final 2016 presidential campaign debate between Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at UNLV in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., October 19, 2016.Mike BlakeJackson called out New York Giants owner John Mara, who said he would not consider signing Kaepernick due to objections from fans, but signed kicker Josh Brown to a new contract last season even after he was arrested for domestic violence.  The Giants cut Brown in October after he admitted to abusing his wife.   Mr. Kaepernick has been a model player who has not done anything illegal! There seems to be a double standard in this picture,  Jackson said. Jackson vowed to protest the quarterback's exclusion from the league at NFL games.  Kaepernick has said he has no plans to renew his protest during the upcoming season, saying last year's demonstration succeeded in sparking a dialogue about injustice in America. The use of force by police against African-Americans in cities such as Baltimore, New York, and Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked periodic protests in recent years and prompted the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which Kaepernick supports.

The  Foundation 500  list features the portraits and careers of 500 female entrepreneurs in 11 emerging markets where women are often refused the same access to education, financial services and bank loans as men. The list, an initiative of humanitarian agency CARE and the non-profit H&M; Foundation, mirrors the Fortune 500 list of U.S. companies but highlights unusual chief executives, ranging from a Zambian woman who set up a mobile drug store to a woman in Jordan who set up a temporary tattoo studio. Karl-Johan Persson, CEO of Swedish retailer H&M; that founded the H&M; Foundation, said the project was designed to create role models for women in emerging markets and challenging perceptions in developed countries of business leaders.  The entrepreneur is our time's hero and a role model for many young but the picture given of who is an entrepreneur is still very homogenous and many probably associate it to men from the startup world,  Persson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email. He said all the women in the list had made an incredible effort.  But one that stands out to me is Philomene Tia, a multi-entrepreneur from the Ivory Coast who has overcome setbacks such as war and being a refugee, and who has, in spite of it, always returned to the entrepreneurship to create a better future – and a strong voice in society.  Buses, Fish, Tattoos Tia is the owner of a bus company in the Ivory Coast, a chain of beverage stores, a hotel complex, and a cattle breeding operation. H&M Foundation Global Manager Diana Amini poses with portraits of women on its Foundation 500 list of female entrepreneurs in emerging markets in Stockholm, Sweden, June 2, 2017. Picture taken June 2, 2017.Anna Ringstrom I often tell other women that it is the force inside you and your brains that will bring you wherever you want to go. I mean, I started with nothing and I don't even speak proper French, but look at me now,  she was quoted on the project's website www.foundation500.com. The women featured are from Indonesia, the Philippines Nepal, Sri Lanka, Peru, Guatemala, Jordan, Zambia, Burundi, the Ivory Coast and Yemen. One of the women portrayed is Andrea Gala, 20, a trout farm manager in Peru and president of the women-only Trout Producers Association. Slideshow (6 Images) This business has worked out so well for us now we don’t depend on our fields anymore, which is hard work and often badly paid,  Gala said in a report on the project.  With the association we want to open a restaurant one day, next to the trout farm, so we can attract more visitors. We want to turn the area into a tourist zone, where people can come and relax and enjoy our restaurant with trout based dishes.  The H&M; Foundation, privately funded by the Persson family that founded retailer H&M;, said this was part of a women's empowerment program started with CARE in 2014 in Latin America, Asia and Africa. As part of this project H&M; Foundation Manager Diana Amini  said about 100,000 women in 20 countries had received between 2,000-15,000 euros in seed capital and skills training to start and expand businesses. In Burundi, the average rate of increase in income among women in the program was 203 percent in the three years to the end of 2016, she said.

Woodside Petroleum, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, said FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to become operator of the deepwater SNE project.

Woodside was due to become operator of the project later this year, after having bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year. FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal.  These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin,  Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement.

In his second intervention in the row in as many days, Trump urged action against terrorism in a call with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, a White House statement said.  The President offered to help the parties resolve their differences, including through a meeting at the White House if necessary,  it said. Trump, in a later call with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, called for unity among Gulf Arabs  but never at the expense of eliminating funding for radical extremism or defeating terrorism,  the White House said. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday over long-standing allegations that Doha is courting Iran, which they deem the region's biggest external threat, and supporting Islamist groups, seen as the biggest internal danger.  The four countries also cut transport links to tiny gas-rich Qatar, disrupting food and other supplies and deepening uncertainty about the future of trade and investment ties. In a sign of economic damage from the dispute, Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt on Wednesday as the country's riyal currency fell to an 11-year low amid signs that portfolio investment funds were flowing out because of the rift. S&P; cut its long-term rating of Qatar by one notch to AA- from AA and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there was a significant chance of a further downgrade. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Reuters there would be more economic curbs on Qatar if necessary and said Doha needed to make ironclad commitments to change what critics say is a policy on funding Islamist militants. He later told France 24 television that any further steps could take the form of  a sort of embargo on Qatar . Regional Tensions  Reiterating comments by Gulf officials, Gargash told Reuters  there was no plan to seek a change in Qatar's leadership, only a change in its policies. Related CoverageTrump speaks to Qatar emir, offers help in resolving crisis: White HouseQatar investigation finds state news agency hacked: foreign ministryQatar debt rating downgraded by S&P as riyal hits 11-year lowRegional tensions, already high following the diplomatic dispute, ratcheted up further after militants attacked targets in Tehran on Wednesday, killing at least 12 people. Iran blamed arch-foe Saudi Arabia for the attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State militant group. Riyadh denied any involvement.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Gulf states could resolve a row with Qatar among themselves without outside help.  We have not asked for mediation, we believe this issue can be dealt with among the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council,  he told a news conference with his German counterpart during a visit to Berlin that was broadcast on Saudi state television. Jubeir declined to confirm a list of 10 demands published by Al Jazeera, which included shutting down the Doha-based news channel, but added that Qatar knew what it needed to do to restore normal relations. Meanwhile Kuwait's ruler Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah continued a regional effort to mediate the crisis, shuttling from the UAE en route to Qatar on Wednesday evening, a Kuwaiti diplomat told Reuters. Passengers wait to have their luggage checked at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, June 7, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonBut efforts to defuse the worst crisis among Gulf Arabs for two decades showed no immediate progress. The UAE threatened anyone publishing expressions of sympathy toward Doha with up to 15 years in prison and barring entry to Qataris. Turkish Support Qatar has backed Islamist movements but vehemently denies supporting terrorism. It drew some support on Wednesday when   Turkey's parliament approved a draft bill allowing its troops to be deployed to a military base in Qatar. Turkish exporters have also pledged to provide food and water to Qatar if needed.  Trump's defense secretary, James Mattis, spoke to his Qatari counterpart to express commitment to the Gulf region's security. Qatar hosts 8,000 U.S. military personnel at al Udeid, the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East and a launchpad for U.S.-led strikes on Islamic State jihadists. The sudden isolation has spurred Qatar to hold talks with Turkey, Iran and others to secure food and water supplies, said a Qatari official. He said there were enough grain supplies for four weeks and Qatar also had large strategic food reserves. Slideshow (15 Images)Abu Dhabi port authorities in the UAE have eased curbs on non-Qatari oil tankers going to and from Qatar, according to industry sources and shipping circulars seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages are threatening to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG). UAE-based newspaper Gulf News and pan-Arab channel Al-Arabiya reported the crackdown on expressions of sympathy with Qatar.       Strict and firm action will be taken against anyone who shows sympathy or any form of bias toward Qatar, or against anyone who objects to the position of the United Arab Emirates, whether it be through the means of social media, or any type of written, visual or verbal form,  Gulf News quoted UAE Attorney-General Hamad Saif al-Shamsi as saying. On top of a possible jail term, offenders could also be hit with a fine of at least 500,000 dirhams ($136,000), the newspaper said, citing a statement to Arabic-language media. Slogans against and in support of Qatar have dominated Twitter in Arabic. Newspapers and television channels in the region have also been engaged in a war of words. Complexity UAE airlines Etihad and Emirates said all travellers holding Qatari passports were currently prohibited from traveling to or transiting through the emirates. They announced details of the restrictions after Australian carrier and Emirates partner Qantas Airways said it would not fly Qataris to Dubai because of the bans. Foreigners residing in Qatar in possession of a Qatari residence visa would also not be eligible for visas on arrival in the UAE, an Etihad spokesman said in an email.  Gargash, the UAE minister, told Reuters in an interview it would be very complex to disentangle the  very diverse  business ties between Qatar and its neighbors but suggested this might be necessary.  You cannot rule out further measures. We hope that cooler heads will prevail, that wiser heads will prevail and we will not get to that.   Tensions are still high and mediation efforts by fellow Gulf Cooperation Council state Kuwait have yet to lead to a concrete solution, so investors will likely remain on edge,  said one Dubai-based trader.

PETERSBURG, Russia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  Russia is seeing stronger climate change impacts, from deadly storms in Moscow to river flooding in the country's south, but efforts to adapt to the growing problems remain limited, experts warn. With around 10 million of the country's people facing immediate climate-related risks, according to Russian researchers, there is a need for federal and regional climate adaptation strategies, including better early warning systems and modernized infrastructure, the experts said. Last week, a hurricane with winds up to 30 meters per second (67 miles per hour) hit Moscow at rush hour, leaving 16 people dead and more than 200 others injured, according to Russia's Emergency Ministry. At the other end of the country, in southeastern Siberia, forest fires have repeatedly destroyed settlements with thousands of local residents evacuated and relocated.  In the south of Russia heavy rains and river flooding that threatened a dam in the Stavropol region led to the evacuation of a few thousand people in late May. “These are all visible effects of climate change happening in Russia now. It is finally clear for everyone that the global climate crisis also has highly negative impacts for Russia, with more disasters to come,” Alexey Kokorin, head of the climate and energy program at WWF-Russia, said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Nikolay Gudkov, the spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources, said the government was increasingly aware of the problem. “Yes, all these disasters come as a result of climate change, we do acknowledge that,  he said.  For years there was a public image that climate change only meant rising temperatures, but now we see that it is much more about unexpected natural disasters happening in various parts of the country,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Russia's leaders - long skeptical about human-induced climate change - are now taking the issue more seriously, at least on paper, experts say.  Rising Temperatures - and Risks According to state meteorological service Roshydromet, average temperature in Russia in 2016 grew 2.5 times quicker than the global average. The World Meteorological Organization has said that temperatures in parts of Artic Russia around the Ob River estuary and Novaya Zemlya are 6 to 7 degrees Celsius above the 1961-90 average, while worldwide temperatures are closer to 1 degree Celsius above that average. Both 2015 and 2016 were the warmest years in Russia since the beginning of meteorological observations, the agency said.  Most international climate risk indices put Russia at medium or low risk from climate change. The most recent World Risk Report, put together by United Nations University, for instance, puts Russia in 128th place worldwide in terms of risk. But researchers say assessments of overall country risk are not a good fit for Russia, where the population is distributed highly unevenly, with both sparsely populated areas and large concentrations of people in cities. Sergey Donskoy, Russia’s environment minister, has said that the negative effects of climate change are already costing the country 30 to 60 billion rubles ($530 million to $1 billion) yearly. Forecasts suggest that climate change-related losses may reach as much as 1 to 2 percent of the country's GDP by 2030, he said. Over the last 15 to 20 years the number of dangerous meteorological events in Russia has doubled, with around 590 last year, ranging from strong winds and storms to heavy rain, Russian climatologists said last month, at the opening of Russian Climate Week in Moscow. The country is also seeing - or expected to see - stronger heatwaves and cold snaps, droughts in southern agricultural areas, increasing numbers of forest fires and thawing of permafrost, which covers more than 60 percent of Russia's territory, the climatologists said. “There will be more high waters, including floods, in the areas where we already have a lot of water, and there will be even less water in dry regions”, Mikhail Georgievsky, a researcher from the State Hydrological Institute, said at a Russian-British seminar on climate risks in March in Moscow. Stepan Zemtsov, a researcher with the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, noted that more than 10 million people are  highly exposed  to climate risks in Russia. Planning Ahead Researchers and environmentalists have called for both federal and regional strategies to adapt to the growing problems to be drafted soon. “Russia is far too slow in its adaptation policy measures,” said Kokorin, of WWF-Russia.  The country has plans to develop and approve a national adaptation plan by mid-2018, as part of its plan to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change. Russia is the only large carbon emitter that has not yet ratified the 2015 global climate accord, in part because of pressure from the country's coal and metal industries, which are worried about possible carbon regulation measures, experts said. So far just six of 85 regions in Russia - including Moscow and St. Petersburg - are working on regional climate adaptation strategies. “New climate adaptation strategy should certainly modernize early warning systems, especially in the area of spreading of information,  Zemtsov said. According to polling of residents in Russia's most climate-vulnerable regions by Zemtsov and his team, 69 percent of people do not know evacuation routes, 55 percent have never taken part in any training activity and 14 percent openly say they will ignore any alarm raised, he said. Zemtsov said he believed all of those percentages could be higher in other parts of the country. Researchers say Russia will need to modernize its infrastructure - including its drainage systems - to deal with problems such as increasingly heavy rain. Storm drains in St. Petersburg, for instance, are already at capacity while rainfall is predicted to become much heavier by the end of the century.   “Climate change should become an important factor in urban planning in Russia. We need to start thinking in terms of climate-resilient architecture and city planning,  said Ksenia Mokrushina, a director of the Centre of Urban Studies at Skolkovo Moscow School of Management.  Fighting with disasters and adapting to climate change is not a one-off action, it is a regular set of measures,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. For the moment, she said, government action is disproportionately focused on responding to disasters and recovering from them instead of preparing for them and trying to reduce risks. “The shift towards adaptation planning and risk management must happen at the local level rather than waiting for the federal Ministry for Emergency to come and rescue when it is already too late,  she said.

Television  watch parties,  typically hosted for sporting events and awards shows, are planned at homes and bars across the country for Comey’s 10 a.m. EDT appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee. During  the SUPER BOWL of Washington,  as it was billed by the Axelrad Beer Garden in Houston, the former director will testify that U.S. President Donald Trump tried to get him to scale back the agency's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Join us for an early morning beer and engage in friendly debate with fellow patrons,” a post on the Axelrad Facebook page said. The bar also is serving a drink called the impeachmint. In Washington, Shaw's Tavern was one of several bars promising to open its doors a half hour before Comey begins speaking, with a $10 “FBI” breakfast special. In this case, FBI stands not for Federal Bureau of Investigation but French toast, bacon and ice cream.

The Partisan bar just off the tourist-rich National Mall will offer “The Last Word” and “Drop the Bomb” cocktails and  The Patriot  breakfast sandwich. “We’ve got two TVs in our bar and we’re going to have the audio on full blast,” said Molly Hippolitus, a spokeswoman for the bar's owners.  I’m expecting a pretty good mix, a bipartisan crowd to show up.” The Union Pub in Washington planned to buy patrons a round of drinks every time Trump, a frequent tweeter, makes a post on Twitter during Comey's testimony. Several bars in San Francisco will open as early as 6 a.m. PDT to allow patrons to gather for the testimony.  It's important for us to be well informed,  said bartender Darren  Buddy  Jaques at the Mix, where the TV will be tuned into the hearing.

Remy took to Twitter to announce his apology, one day after he came under fire for his comments during the fourth inning of a NESN telecast. After Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild and Japanese translator Shingo Horie visited Tanaka on the mound following back-to-back homers to Mitch Moreland and Hanley Ramirez, the 64-year-old Remy said the following:  Learn baseball language,  Remy said.  It's pretty simple. You break it down pretty easy between pitching coach and pitcher after a long period of time.  Remy's remark was roundly blasted on social media. On Wednesday, the long-time Red Sox announcer offered his apology.  I sincerely apologize to those who were offended by my comments during the telecast last night,  Remy wrote. Tanaka responded to Remy's comments prior to Wednesday's game.  I don't know why that came out,  he said through an interpreter.  So it's really hard for me to comment on that. But I think little nuances could get lost in the process of trying to communicate especially when you don't know the language. I think the MLB rule allows (us) to ask for translators. So I'm just, I guess, taking advantage of it.  Major League Baseball adopted a rule in 2013 that allowed interpreters to join mound conferences. Boston manager John Farrell underscored the value of having an interpreter involved in mound discussions.  Having been in that position (and) dealt with players that I only knew certain words, I think an interpreter is needed,  Farrell said.  I think Major League Baseball changed the rule in 2013 because of the number of pitchers coming from Japan, the number of players coming from Japan.  Whether it was with Daisuke (Matsuzaka) to Hideki Okajima to guys that were on our pitching staff. I'd have liked to have an interpreter go to the mound pre-2013. We were able to have an interpreter in the bullpen sessions so while trying to learn Japanese, which is a pretty tall challenge, you can learn single words.  I found to learn single words and objects or numbers, but when you start talking concepts, let's face it, communication with players is priority No. 1. So to be clear, the interpreter is needed.  NESN and the Red Sox were quick to offer statements of their own on Wednesday.  Relative to last night's NESN telecast from New York, NESN does not agree with any such views expressed by Jerry Remy and we know from talking to Jerry that he regrets making them,  NESN's statement read.  The network sincerely apologizes to anyone who was offended by Jerry's comments.   We do not share the views expressed by Jerry Remy during last night's broadcast,  the Red Sox said in their statement.

Authorities in Thailand, which has large current-account surpluses, are trying to get citizens to invest elsewhere, to help contain an uncomfortably strong baht. On Monday, the central bank relaxed foreign exchange rules, letting more Thais buy securities overseas and commercial banks lend baht to non-residents for investment in Thailand and the Greater Mekong sub-region. The immediate reaction was telling: instead of weakening, the baht hit a near 23-month high of 33.94 per dollar. In part, that was because some investors expected the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to introduce capital controls to cool a currency that's gained more than 5 percent against the dollar this year, competing with the Malaysian ringgit to be Southeast Asia's strongest performer. The baht was at 33.90 at Wednesday's close, compared with 34.07 before Monday's announcement and 34.25 on June 2. Past moves to try to weaken the baht have failed. Thais simply don't like to invest in foreign assets, in contrast with citizens in other economies with sizable current-account surpluses.  According to Kasikornbank in Bangkok, Thailand had the world's third largest surplus in 2016 - 11.3 percent of gross domestic product, trailing only Singapore and Taiwan. Thailand began gradually relaxing curbs on capital flows in April 2015. But Association of Investment Management Companies Industry data shows foreign assets in mutual funds grew to 1 trillion baht ($29.40 billion) from about 900 billion since then, while overall mutual fund assets climbed to 4.8 trillion baht from about 4 trillion baht.  Thais still want to invest more at home,  said Saharat Chudsuwan, head of wealth advisory at Tisco Asset Management in Bangkok. Loosened Limits Drawn by low interest rates - the benchmark is 1.50 percent - foreign investors have purchased 13.34 billion baht in equities and 136.44 billion baht in government debt this year, according to Maybank analysts. The 2015 measures loosened limits on foreign currency deposits and property purchases. The Thai central bank later allowed direct purchases of overseas equities and derivatives by qualified investors, and relaxed the wealth threshold for such investing. Thai business groups complain about the baht's strength.  The baht's rapid appreciation since late May may hurt Thailand's competitiveness,  said Kalin Sarasin, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade, urging smaller exporters to hedge against currency risks. Jane Namchaisiri, Federation of Thai Industries chairman, said the central bank should consider additional short-term measures in case volatility picks up. Thailand is treading carefully after a 2006 episode that tarnished its reputation. It imposed capital controls, triggering a 15 percent plunge for the stock market. The controls were later aborted. Trade Surplus Scrutiny Decisive moves with its currency now would bring extra scrutiny as Washington is monitoring countries that run large trade surpluses with the United States. Thailand's one in 2016 was $18 billion, the 11th biggest. Thailand's FX reserves have been rising as a result of the BOT's efforts to contain baht appreciation in the face of a massive current account surplus, analysts at ANZ said. Headline reserves are $184 billion but a $29 billion asset on the central bank's forward book implies total reserves are about $213 billion. Since April, the central bank has been reducing the size of its weekly bond issues, in a bid to curb the incentives for short-term capital inflows to park their funds in BOT bonds. Assistant Governor Chantavarn Sucharitakul told Reuters the BOT has made  an adjustment to the combination in the use of its monetary absorption instruments .

New female 'Foundation 500' list challenges stereotypes","keywords":"Burundi,Côte d'Ivoire,Guatemala,Indonesia,Jordan,Peru,Sri Lanka,United States,Yemen,Zambia,Andrea Gala,Diana Amini,Karl,Johan Persson,US,SWEDEN,WOMEN,ENTREPRENEURS,Nepal,Jordan,Western Europe,Burundi,Military Conflicts,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Yemen,Africa,Sweden,Asia / Pacific,Middle East,Nordic States,Apparel and Accessories (TRBC),Conflicts / War / Peace,South America / Central America,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,Guatemala,Fashion,Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties,Zambia,Women's Issues,Europe,Philippines,Emerging Market Countries,Sri Lanka","sector":"Markets","content":"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - From a Peruvian trout farm manager to the head of an Indonesian meatball company, a list of 500 women entrepreneurs in emerging markets was launched on Thursday to challenge the stereotype of a typical company boss and inspire women globally. The  Foundation 500  list features the portraits and careers of 500 female entrepreneurs in 11 emerging markets where women are often refused the same access to education, financial services and bank loans as men. The list, an initiative of humanitarian agency CARE and the non-profit H&M; Foundation, mirrors the Fortune 500 list of U.S. companies but highlights unusual chief executives, ranging from a Zambian woman who set up a mobile drug store to a woman in Jordan who set up a temporary tattoo studio. Karl-Johan Persson, CEO of Swedish retailer H&M; that founded the H&M; Foundation, said the project was designed to create role models for women in emerging markets and challenging perceptions in developed countries of business leaders.  The entrepreneur is our time's hero and a role model for many young but the picture given of who is an entrepreneur is still very homogenous and many probably associate it to men from the startup world,  Persson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email. He said all the women in the list had made an incredible effort.  But one that stands out to me is Philomene Tia, a multi-entrepreneur from the Ivory Coast who has overcome setbacks such as war and being a refugee, and who has, in spite of it, always returned to the entrepreneurship to create a better future – and a strong voice in society.  Buses, Fish, Tattoos Tia is the owner of a bus company in the Ivory Coast, a chain of beverage stores, a hotel complex, and a cattle breeding operation. H&M Foundation Global Manager Diana Amini poses with portraits of women on its Foundation 500 list of female entrepreneurs in emerging markets in Stockholm, Sweden, June 2, 2017. Picture taken June 2, 2017.Anna Ringstrom I often tell other women that it is the force inside you and your brains that will bring you wherever you want to go. I mean, I started with nothing and I don't even speak proper French, but look at me now,  she was quoted on the project's website www.foundation500.com. The women featured are from Indonesia, the Philippines Nepal, Sri Lanka, Peru, Guatemala, Jordan, Zambia, Burundi, the Ivory Coast and Yemen. One of the women portrayed is Andrea Gala, 20, a trout farm manager in Peru and president of the women-only Trout Producers Association. Slideshow (6 Images) This business has worked out so well for us now we don’t depend on our fields anymore, which is hard work and often badly paid,  Gala said in a report on the project.  With the association we want to open a restaurant one day, next to the trout farm, so we can attract more visitors. We want to turn the area into a tourist zone, where people can come and relax and enjoy our restaurant with trout based dishes.  The H&M; Foundation, privately funded by the Persson family that founded retailer H&M;, said this was part of a women's empowerment program started with CARE in 2014 in Latin America, Asia and Africa. As part of this project H&M; Foundation Manager Diana Amini  said about 100,000 women in 20 countries had received between 2,000-15,000 euros in seed capital and skills training to start and expand businesses. In Burundi, the average rate of increase in income among women in the program was 203 percent in the three years to the end of 2016, she said.

Calling the move  unprecedented  the CBF said the two games would be shown on its website, Facebook page, mobile phone apps through their sponsor Vivo, Brazil's largest wireless carrier, and on UOL, one of its biggest online media sites. Two small government-run channels TV Brasil and TV Cultura will also broadcast the games live.  This is a way to further democratise the reach of Brazil matches, offering fans new alternatives to see the Brazilian national team on the field,  the CBF said in a statement. Brazil, the only team to win the World Cup five times, take on South American rivals Argentina at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday and then face the host nation at the same venue on June 13. The move is seen as a rebuke to TV Globo, the media conglomerate which has broadcast Brazil games for decades and which remains one of the main rights holders, and biggest funders, of Brazil's domestic leagues. Globo said it tried to negotiate the rights to the two games but was unable to come to an agreement with the CBF.  Grupo Globo defends market competition and believes it has the best solution for our national team through visibility and involvement, both with audience (share) as well as with the quality of transmission and the economic model, but we respect that the CBF thinks differently,  it said in a statement. The CBF's initiative follows a similar move by club side Atletico Paranaense, which in March became the first big club to broadcast their games live on YouTube.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries cut their ties with Doha on Monday in part because of comments posted briefly on the Qatar News Agency's website on May 23. The article quoted Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani as cautioning against confrontation with Iran, as well as defending the Palestinian group Hamas and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi'ite movement allied with Tehran.  The Ministry said the investigation team confirmed that the piracy process had used high techniques and innovative methods by exploiting an electronic gap on the website of the Qatar News Agency,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. It did not say who might have carried out the hack. U.S. and European officials said that while United States government agencies and experts were convinced that the news agency and the Qatari government's Twitter feed were hacked, they have not yet determined who did the hacking. A CNN report quoted unidentified U.S. officials briefed on the investigation as saying that Russian hackers were suspected. Moscow said the report was false. One U.S. intelligence official said that while Russia has the expertise and an incentive to sow division among Arab states allied with the United States, Russian hackers were available for hire to other countries and criminal groups.  Arab countries at odds with Qatar accuse it of supporting militant groups and advancing their arch-rival Iran's agenda in the region - charges Doha calls baseless. U.S. military officials, also speaking anonymously to discuss political issues, said the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar is vital to American air support against Iranian paramilitaries and Iranian-backed forces on the side of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war. Qatar's foreign ministry thanked the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the British National Crime Agency for cooperating in the investigation, without elaborating.

As a result of this significant investment in infrastructure over the next five years, there will be better and faster passenger journeys through and around our airport,  chief executive Adrian Littlewood said in a statement. New Zealand is in the midst of a visitor boom, with a record number of people entering the country and tourism overtaking the dairy industry as the nation's top export earner. The number of passengers at Auckland Airport has grown by almost a quarter in the past three years to around 18 million a year, leaving infrastructure struggling to keep up. National carrier Air New Zealand has urged the airport to upgrade its facilities. The airport said average international passenger charges over the next five years would decrease around 1.7 percent a year in real terms, while domestic passenger fees would rise 0.8 percent, targetting a return on investment of 6.99 percent. Auckland Airport is also planning a second international runway for 2028, and would charge a runway land charge of NZ$1.19 for each passenger from 2020 or 2021 when construction is expected to start. $1 = 1.3904 New Zealand dollars Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield; Editing by Richard Pullin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/auckland-int-air-investment-idUSL3N1J45G8"},

But rather than getting a shocked response, Wang simply shrugged his shoulders, Li told Reuters.  He told me he looks after garbage collection, water pipes, that sort of thing. Same-sex marriage isn't up to him,  said Li, who works for the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.  That's the problem in China. Who is in charge of this stuff?  After decades of Communist prudery about sex of all kinds, during recent years of economic reform and growth, gay Chinese have sprung forward to reclaim the country's long history of relative tolerance towards homosexuality. With no clear, bureaucratic way forward to legalise same-sex marriage, unlike in Taiwan which approved the step last month, and deeply conservative attitudes among the older generation towards sex, gay Chinese are pushing against old social norms and legal uncertainty to assert their rights. Until 2001, China listed homosexuality as a mental disorder, but it is not illegal to be gay. Many big cities have thriving gay scenes, although gay men and women still face family pressure to marry and have children, fulfilling the Confucian tradition of honouring ancestors by ensuring the family line. While Taiwan's decision paving the way for same-sex couples to marry was largely ignored by the mainstream Chinese media, it got big play on social media, with many supportive comments. Next week, China's cosmopolitan business capital Shanghai will host its ninth gay pride event, four days of films, talks and parties, though without a parade that accompanies such events in other cities around the world. Evie Wu, Shanghai Pride's director, told Reuters that about 6,000 people were expected to attend. For the 10th anniversary next year, organisers hope to hold Pride events in other cities, including Beijing.  People have told us that attending Pride has led to them accepting themselves, that they have a community and that they are not alone. That's inspired us to continue,  Wu said. 'Family First' It is hard to gauge the degree of popular acceptance of homosexuality in the world's most populous nation. Sexologist Li, who has backed parliamentary proposals to legalise gay marriage that went nowhere, said a survey she had conducted in 2007 showed many people simply had no view about homosexuality.  Since ancient times there's been no particular feeling that homosexuality is wrong, unlike in Christianity or what the Bible says,  she said. But Chinese society had always placed huge importance on the family line, and that is what has driven opposition to homosexuality, Li said.  It's always family first, happiness second.  Li's old friend Wang is now in the Communist Party's elite ruling inner core, and heads the powerful anti-corruption watchdog, which did not respond to requests for comment about her conversation with him when he was Beijing's mayor. While the government often turns a blind eye to gay events, the Communist Party has intensified a crackdown on civil society since President Xi Jinping took office four years ago. Last month, police in the city of Xian briefly detained nine gay activists, saying the city did not welcome gay people, after they tried to organise a conference. Unbowed, the same group is organising an event in Chengdu this month, encouraged by support on social media. One of the organisers, who asked to be identified only as Matthew, said he was nervous the Chengdu event could draw official attention.  I've held events in Chengdu before, and I've never had any official notification I either can or cannot do this,  he told Reuters.  Even with the Xian event, before it all went down we didn't get any sort of message.  Still, on the weekend before Taiwan's marriage decision, gay activists held a packed fund-raising event at a Beijing bar complete with lip-synching drag queens that went off without a hitch. The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which technically has oversight over civil issues like marriage, declined to comment on questions from Reuters about the possibility of same-sex marriage or whether there was an institutionalised problem with homophobia in China. Activists say the government vacillates on its attitudes towards homosexuality, pointing out that gay clubs and bars are often left alone while gay dramas are banned on television. Overtly hostile opinions do surface publicly from time to time. Zeng Weizhu, a philosopher at China's Shanxi Agricultural University, wrote an open letter to the people of Taiwan last month on the Confucian Net website denouncing the marriage decision as a  disaster  perpetrated by youth  ignorant of worldly affairs .  Parents of Taiwan, come to the mainland! Your children and grandchildren will multiply, your life will be extended and your latter years won't be lonely,  Zeng wrote. The comments section underneath his letter largely scorned his view as absurd and offensive.  Dying of laughter. Support gays and oppose discrimination,  wrote one person, using the handle  When Love Comes To Call . Zeng declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Corey Seager homered and Yasmani Grandal doubled home the go-ahead run to lift the Dodgers to a 2-1 victory over the Nationals at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday. Kershaw (8-2) struck out nine with three walks. He allowed one run on three hits in seven innings to help the Dodgers (36-25) end a three-game slide. Kershaw joins Colorado Rockies rookie Antonio Senzatela as the National League's only eight-game winners. Kershaw said he didn't have his best stuff. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at DodgersWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch Yeah, I didn't have much today in the tank,  said Kershaw, who is 4-1 with a 2.40 ERA in seven starts at home.  I felt fine, it just wasn't coming out the way I wanted to. I felt like I threw a lot of off-speed pitches, I don't know exactly. That's a good lineup, too. They've got a really good team over there. Fortunate to get a win there and it feels good to kind of salvage the series a little bit.  Closer Kenley Jansen got the final four outs for his 10th save. It was the fifth save this season in which he got four outs or more. Kershaw earned the edge over Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg in their first-ever matchup. Although Strasburg blanked the Dodgers for five innings, they rallied for two runs in the sixth. A passed ball extended the inning and eventually cost him and the Nationals. Strasburg (7-2) fanned eight with one walk, allowing two runs (one earned) on three hits in six innings with 104 pitches (70 strikes).  He would have had plenty of gas to go out and pitch the seventh,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said, blaming his club's mistakes.  Then, we had the lead-off triple and we didn't score. So, when you play in close games like that with two great pitchers, a mistake here or a mistake there is the difference in the game.  Regardless, Strasburg was pleased with his outing and refused to point any fingers.  I really thought I executed really well today, but the balls didn't bounce our way but I tried to keep it close,  said Strasburg, who had his four-game winning streak end and lost for the first time since April 29. Ryan Zimmerman hammered the first pitch from Kershaw into the seats in left for a solo shot to open the second inning for the lone Nationals run. It was Zimmerman's club-high 17th home run this season. Seager's solo blast with two outs in the sixth tied the score at 1. For Seager, it was his eighth home run and first since May 20, a span of 16 games.  He's really good,  Seager said of Strasburg.  He's pretty much really good all of the game. Really good change-up today, threw strikes, was in and out, he was effective. (I was looking) for just something out over the plate, really. Fortunately, I got one.  Adrian Gonzalez kept the inning alive by reaching on a third strike that got past catcher Jose Lobaton, and Gonzalez advanced to second on a wild pitch. Grandal followed with his run-scoring double for the lead. Washington's Trea Turner led off the eighth with a triple. However, he was tagged out at the plate after getting caught in a rundown for the second out in the inning when Bryce Harper hit a comebacker to reliever Pedro Baez. The Nationals (37-21), who own the best record in the National League, had their three-game winning streak snapped. They capped their nine-game West Coast swing with a 7-2 record.  You feel pretty good. You certainly would have wanted to win this one but they're tough to sweep here,  Baker said.  But we did have them on the ropes in the eighth.

Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor to reach a goal of  substantial compliance  with the decrees. Lawyers representing Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over other priorities the state was fully funding such as debt service on bonds and pensions. Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the state's bills, has not offered a  lawful basis  for not fully paying the Medicaid providers, who are owed about $2 billion.  Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this court’s previous orders,  the judge's latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session last week without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk.

Islamic State claimed responsibility and threatened more attacks against Iran's majority Shi'ite population, seen by the hardline Sunni militants as heretics. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted:  Terror-sponsoring despots threaten to bring the fight to our homeland. Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy.   He did not explicitly blame any country but the tweet appeared to refer to comments made by Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud, in May, saying that that Riyadh would bring  the battle  for regional influence to Iran. Sunni Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the Tehran attacks, but the assault further fuels tensions between Riyadh and Tehran as they vie for control of the Gulf and influence in the wider Islamic world. It comes days after Riyadh and other Sunni Muslim powers cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing Tehran and militant groups. They were the first attacks claimed by Islamic State inside the tightly controlled Shi'ite Muslim country, one of the powers leading the fight against IS forces in nearby Iraq and Syria. The deputy head of Iran's National Security Council, Reza Seifollhai, told state TV late on Wednesday that the attackers were people from Iran who had joined Islamic State. Iranian police said they had arrested five suspects     Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said:  These fireworks have no effect on Iran. They will soon be eliminated.   They are too small to affect the will of the Iranian nation and its officials,  state TV quoted him saying. The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps accused Riyadh of being behind the attacks and vowed to seek revenge.  This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the U.S. president (Donald Trump) and the (Saudi) backward leaders who support terrorists. The fact that Islamic State has claimed responsibility proves that they were involved in the brutal attack,  a Guards statement said. Trump said in a statement that he prayed for the victims of the attacks but added that  states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.  The U.S. State Department and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres both condemned the attacks.

Dressed as Women Attackers dressed as women burst through parliament's main entrance, deputy interior minister Mohammad Hossein Zolfaghari said, according to the Tasnim news agency. One of them detonated a suicide vest, he said.  On a video released by the IS news agency Amaq a man purportedly inside the parliament says in Arabic:  Oh God, thank you. [Gunshots]. Do you think we will leave? No! We will remain, God willing.  Police helicopters circled over parliament, with snipers on its rooftop. Within five hours, four attackers were dead and the incident was over, Iranian media said.  I was inside the parliament when shooting happened. Everyone was shocked and scared. I saw two men shooting randomly,  said one journalist at the scene. Soon after the assault on parliament began, a bomber detonated a suicide vest near the shrine of the Islamic Republic's revered founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, a few kilometers south of the city, Zolfaghari said.

The shrine is a main destination for tourists and religious pilgrims.  The terrorists had explosives strapped to them and suddenly started to shoot around,  said the shrine's overseer, Mohammadali Ansari. By late evening, deputy interior minister Zolfaghari put the death toll at 13, with 43 wounded. The Intelligence Ministry said security forces had arrested another  terrorist team  planning a third attack. The National Security Council's Seifollhai said Iran had foiled 58 similar attacks, without specifying a time period. Regional Animosity  The attacks follow several weeks of heightened rhetorical animosity between Riyadh and Tehran. Slideshow (23 Images)In unusually blunt remarks on May 2, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is Saudi defense minister and a son of King Salman, said he would protect his country from what he called Iranian efforts to dominate the Muslim world. Any struggle for influence between the Sunni Muslim kingdom and the revolutionary Shi'ite theocracy ought to take place  inside Iran, not in Saudi Arabia,  he said without elaborating.  The next day Iran accused Saudi Arabia of seeking tension in the region, saying the prince had made  destructive  comments and it was proof that Riyadh supported terrorism.   The attacks could also exacerbate tensions in Iran between newly re-elected President Hassan Rouhani, who positions himself as a reformer, and his rivals among hardline clergy and the Revolutionary Guards. But Rouhani said Iran would be more united and more determined in the fight against regional terrorism and violence.  We will prove once again that we will crush the enemies' plots with more unity and more strength,  he said. In an appeal for unity, Rouhani’s chief of staff, Hamid Aboutalebi, took to Twitter to praise the security services.  Applause to the power and firmness of our revolutionary guards, Basij (volunteer militia), police and security forces,  he wrote. However, two senior government officials, who asked not to be named, said the attacks might prompt a blame game.  They (hardliners) are very angry and will use every opportunity to grow in strength to isolate Rouhani,  said one. The other said the attacks would push Iran toward  a harsher regional policy . Militant attacks are rare in Tehran and other major cities although two Sunni militant groups, Jaish al-Adl and Jundallah, have been waging a deadly insurgency, mostly in remote areas, for almost a decade.    Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan province, in the southeast on the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to the Balouch minority and has long been a hotbed of Sunni insurgents fighting the Shi'ite-led republic. Last year Iranian authorities said they had foiled a plot by Sunni militants to bomb targets in Tehran and other cities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Wray, who must be confirmed to the post by the Senate, and Comey served together in the Justice Department under former President George Bush, and both worked on the government's case in the Enron Corp fraud scandal in the early to mid-2000s. Trump's announcement that he will nominate Wray as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came a day before Comey's eagerly anticipated public testimony before a Senate committee. In written testimony released by the panel on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him on Jan. 27 that  I expect loyalty,  and in a Feb. 14 meeting asked him to back off from a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia. The Republican president's search for a replacement for Comey after firing him May 9 was difficult. Leading candidates including former Senator Joe Lieberman took their names out of consideration, and Trump interviewed a series of contenders. In a statement, Trump called Wray  an impeccably qualified individual  who will serve  as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity.  The White House has given shifting explanations on why Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians to help him with the 2016 presidential election. Trump has said he was thinking of  this Russia thing  in dismissing Comey. Wray served from 2003 to 2005 at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department's Enron task force. Related CoverageTrump FBI nominee's corporate legal work could exclude him from some probesWray and Comey helped bring the case against Kenneth Lay, the former Enron chairman convicted in 2006. Also involved in the Enron matter was Robert Mueller, then FBI director and now special counsel named after Comey was fired to investigate the Russia affair, as well as Andrew Weissman, who is now working for Mueller. The web of Enron connections underscores the reliance in Washington, even under a president who vowed to  drain the swamp,  on an elite corps of corporate lawyers whose varied careers often intersect and who sometimes present conflict-of-interest issues. For instance, after he left the Justice Department and joined top international law firm King & Spalding, Wray represented Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal over massive traffic jams created as political punishment for a local mayor. 'Partisan Activity' Christopher Wray is seen in an undated photo released by King and Spalding, New York, U.S., on June 7, 2017.  King and Spalding/Handout via REUTERSThat case and others taken on by Wray while in private practice could pose problems, said American Civil Liberties Union National Political Director Faiz Shakir in a statement.  Christopher Wray's firm's legal work for the Trump family, his history of partisan activity, as well as his history of defending Trump's transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the FBI,  Shakir said. Wray represented Christie in a scandal that resulted in two of the governor's aides being convicted. Christie, who was a close adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and whose name was floated as a possible Comey replacement, was never charged. Christie on Wednesday called Wray  an outstanding choice, a non-political choice  to head the FBI. Wray works as a King & Spalding litigation partner and represents companies and individuals in a white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters. King & Spalding has represented Russian companies including state gas monopoly Gazprom, according to its website. According to the website, the firm's energy practice also has represented businesses taking part in deals involving Russian entities including state-owned oil major Rosneft. The firm has previous ties to Trump. Bobby Burchfield, a partner in its Washington office, serves as ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate Trump from the day-to-day operations of the Trump business organization. The agreement has been criticized by some ethics experts as inadequate. Apart from possible conflicts, another question about Wray is whether the longtime white-collar lawyer is equipped to take over an agency that is increasingly focused on detecting and combating terrorism, espionage and cybercrime.  There are questions about whether he is experienced enough in intelligence, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, computer crimes, and issues like that,  said one senior U.S. law enforcement official who asked not to be identified.  The biggest test the bureau is likely to face is not another Enron,  the official said. Trump announced his selection of Wray in a surprise, early-morning Twitter message. Some Democratic lawmakers said the president's timing seemed intended to distract from Comey's scheduled testimony.  It is imperative that the next FBI director be of unimpeachable integrity and independence,  Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, said.  In light of the president's constant efforts to block the truth, the nomination of Christopher Wray should be subject to the utmost scrutiny.  Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wray's  impressive credentials make him more than ready  to lead the FBI. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he did not know Wray but that his resume suggests he is  the perfect kind of person  for the job.

While he spent many years as a government attorney earlier in his career, Wray for the past 12 years has been a white- collar defense lawyer with the Atlanta-based firm of King & Spalding and is currently head of its government investigations practice.  If there are investigations of a client he'd need to recuse himself,  Steven Lubet, a legal ethics professor at Northwestern University, said. At the firm, Wray, a graduate of Yale University and its  law school, defended Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit in a Justice Department probe over off-label use of anti-psychotic drug Risperdal.  He also represented Credit Suisse [CSAG.UL] in a major tax prosecution by the Justice Department, which alleged the Swiss financial group helped clients hide offshore accounts from the Internal Revenue Service.  According to King & Spalding's website, clients of the practice led by Wray include AT&T;, Deutsche Bank, CVS Caremark, General Motors, Wells Fargo and others. It was not clear if Wray personally represented all of the companies listed.     Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of law, said professional ethics rules would specifically bar Wray as Federal Bureau of Investigation director from participating in investigations of former clients who shared confidential information with him.  In addition, she said, federal regulations would prohibit him from participating in matters opposite King & Spalding for up to two years, though the government can waive those restrictions.     Wray would not be the first FBI director to come from the private sector. But he served longer in private practice and has a more extensive corporate client base than other FBI chiefs.  James Comey, the man whom Wray would replace, worked as an in-house lawyer for Lockheed Martin and hedge fund group Bridgewater Associates before he became FBI head in 2013. Robert Mueller briefly worked at two law firms between longer stints in government service before becoming FBI director in 2001.Mueller's conflicts from his post-FBI law career emerged as an issue last month after he was named special counsel to investigate ties between Trump's campaign team and Russia. Although the FBI is better known for its role fighting violent crime and espionage, the agency is charged with investigating corporate and securities fraud. In recent years, the bureau has launched probes against corporations including GlaxoSmithKline and Takata Corp, which resulted in billions of dollars in criminal penalties. Neither Wray nor King & Spalding responded to requests for comment on potential conflicts. The FBI referred a call on the matter to the Justice Department, which did not respond. Wray served as a federal prosecutor in Atlanta from 1997 to 2001. He then moved to the U.S. Department of Justice, where he eventually became assistant attorney general and head of the criminal division, where he oversaw the fraud investigation of Enron. He joined King & Spalding in 2005. Deputy Director Could Step in  Wray represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who at one time led Trump's presidential transition, in the Bridgegate scandal. In addition, King & Spalding partner Bobby Burchfield is serving as the ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate the president from the day-to-day operations of Trump businesses. Burchfield praised his partner as having the  highest integrity  and said he saw no conflict between his own work and Wray serving as FBI director. Lubet said he did not think Wray's conflicts would present an  unsolvable  problem if he becomes FBI director. He noted that investigations could proceed at the field level without the issue arising.  Most decisions are not made at the director level,  he said. In the event the director has to recuse himself,  that's what deputy directors are for,  said Lubet.

May has seen her once-commanding lead over the Labour Party and its veteran hard-left leader Jeremy Corbyn narrow sharply since she surprised almost everyone by calling a snap election in April. Of six polls published on Wednesday, two showed the Conservatives widening their lead over Labour, two showed a narrowing and two were unchanged.  But they mostly suggested she would increase the small majority she inherited from David Cameron last year, shortly after the surprise referendum decision to take Britain out of the European Union.  Polling firm ICM said Conservatives' wide lead of 46 percent to 34 percent for Labour would give May a majority of 96 seats, up sharply from the working majority of 17 she has had until now and bigger than any Conservative majority since the days when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. The Independent newspaper said the 44-34 lead for the Conservatives in a poll it commissioned from ComRes would give May a majority of 74. YouGov, which found the Conservatives' lead had increased to seven percentage points from four during the weekend, also said May would bolster her power in parliament.  The seven-point Conservative lead is the same as at the previous election, but we think it is likely they will nevertheless be returned with an increased majority,  YouGov Director Anthony Wells said. The polls were conducted after a deadly attack by Islamist militants in London on Saturday. ICM and ComRes have tended to give the Conservatives bigger leads than other polling firms.  At the other end of spectrum, Survation said the Conservatives' lead stood at just one percentage point, echoing two polls it published in recent days which called into question whether May would get a majority at all. Polling experts have said the main difference between the polls which give the Conservatives a big lead and ones such as Survation which suggest a tighter race is largely down to varying estimates of how many young voters, who typically support Labour, are likely to actually vote on Thursday. Investors took the latest findings as a sign May was likely to emerge victorious, giving her a boost before the start of Brexit talks this month. Sterling rose by nearly half a cent against the U.S. dollar after the ICM poll was published. Gamble  ComRes Chairman Andrew Hawkins said May was in the clear after securing the support of around 2 million voters - worth about six percentage points in the polls - who backed the anti-EU UK Independence Party in Britain's last election in 2015, and who have warmed to her tough stance on negotiating Brexit.  Despite Mrs May’s ratings taking a hit during the campaign, older voters in particular have stuck with her party and it appears that the electoral gamble is about to pay off,  he said in a blog. The big differences in the poll findings in the run-up to Thursday's vote have added to scepticism among critics of polling who point to how the industry largely failed to accurately predict the outcome of the 2015 election and last year's referendum vote to exit the EU.

In recent years, the bureau has launched probes against corporations including GlaxoSmithKline and Takata Corp, which resulted in billions of dollars in criminal penalties. Neither Wray nor King & Spalding responded to requests for comment on potential conflicts. The FBI referred a call on the matter to the Justice Department, which did not respond. Wray served as a federal prosecutor in Atlanta from 1997 to 2001. He then moved to the U.S. Department of Justice, where he eventually became assistant attorney general and head of the criminal division, where he oversaw the fraud investigation of Enron. He joined King & Spalding in 2005. Deputy Director Could Step in Wray represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who at one time led Trump's presidential transition, in the Bridgegate scandal. In addition, King & Spalding partner Bobby Burchfield is serving as the ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate the president from the day-to-day operations of Trump businesses. Burchfield praised his partner as having the  highest integrity  and said he saw no conflict between his own work and Wray serving as FBI director. Lubet said he did not think Wray's conflicts would present an  unsolvable  problem if he becomes FBI director. He noted that investigations could proceed at the field level without the issue arising.  Most decisions are not made at the director level,  he said. In the event the director has to recuse himself,  that's what deputy directors are for,  said Lubet.

The decision to cut aid for some believed to be on the brink of famine comes as the onset of the annual rains threaten to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. Farmers have been unable to plant or harvest crops for years due to the Islamist insurgency.  The plan was from the beginning to reach 1.8 million (people) this year but due to the funding constraints WFP has been forced to come up with a contingency plan,  said Peter Lundberg, the U.N.'s Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria. The WFP is now focusing on supplying 1.4 million people deemed to be most at risk, with assistance for the remainder cut by around a third, Lundberg told Reuters in Maiduguri, capital of the hardest-hit state of Borno. The U.N. says it needs $1.05 billion this year to deal with the crisis - one of three humanitarian emergencies unfolding in Africa - but has only received just over a quarter of that.  The reductions in Nigeria come a month after the WFP halved the monthly rations of more than 800,000 South Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda because of a lack of funds. Marooned More than 20,000 people are thought to have died and 2.7 million have been displaced in Boko Haram's bloody eight-year battle to establish a medieval Islamic caliphate.

However, according to the latest U.N. assessments, huge swathes of land remain no-go zones, even with military escorts. As many as 700,000 people might still be trapped in these areas, Lundberg said. The rainy season also makes it harder to bring in emergency supplies of food and medicine as dirt roads turn to rivers of mud for up to three months. Slideshow (7 Images) Some of these places will be completely locked in because of the rain,  Lundberg said.  When the rain comes, we know there will be very big challenges.  Furthermore, aid agencies have been prevented from building up large supply centres outside cities such as Maiduguri for fear they will be attacked. In the town of Rann near the Cameroon border, nearly 50,000 people are about to become marooned with only two weeks' supply of food to hand, said Dana Krause, an emergency coordinator for the Swiss arm of the aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  The populations along the border are pretty much entirely dependent on external aid,  Krause said.  And by the end of July, Rann will literally be an island.  As a last resort, a WFP spokeswoman said it was considering air drops for the most inaccessible areas. Nigeria's military did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion and the limit can only be increased by a vote of Congress. The need to raise the debt limit usually creates partisan debate in Washington.

The gleaming, modern clinics have names featuring words such as  Miracle  and  Perfect  to help them stand out amid the dusty surrounding roads and highways in the Lao capital of Vientiane, close to the Thai border.  Laos has the best governance. Surrogacy or egg donation is not illegal!  one clinic, Thai Perfect IVF, said in a recent WeChat post in Chinese, hoping to attract clients from a country where surrogacy services have been illegal since 2001.   Rights groups say communist Laos, one of Asia's poorest countries, is a linchpin of transnational crime, and a transit center for contraband from drugs and wildlife to timber - and recently, semen. In April, Thai police arrested a man trying to smuggle six vials of human semen into Laos in a tank of liquid nitrogen, which police said was destined for a fertility clinic. Laos is becoming an international destination for infertile couples, officials of two surrogacy advisory groups told Reuters, although there are no official estimates of how many IVF clinics and surrogacy agencies have sprung up there.    Many are turning to Laos,  said Sam Everingham, global director of Australian non-profit Families Through Surrogacy, which says its conferences and advisory sessions have drawn about 600 Australian couples and singles in the last four years. But there was a risk that Laos would also ban commercial surrogacy, he warned, a fear aired in February by another group, the Nevada-based Sensible Surrogacy, which warned couples to avoid Laos and halted services in Southeast Asia. The office of the Laos prime minister did not respond to Reuters requests for comment by email or through social media site Facebook. Paid surrogacy is illegal in much of Asia, having been forbidden in neighboring Thailand in 2015, after a series of high-profile cases, with Cambodia following suit last year. Despite the bans, would-be parents are drawn by Asia's lower costs, as compared to wealthier countries. Service packages, from the screening of potential surrogates to the birth of a baby, typically cost $51,150 in Southeast Asia, says surrogacy agency New Genetics Global, making it the third most affordable option after Ukraine and Kenya. An Australian couple can expect to pay around A$75,000 ($56,000) for a baby through a Laos surrogate - less than in the United States, though more than Ukraine, Everingham said. The surrogate mothers receive only a small fraction of that sum, but it far outstrips what many could earn elsewhere. Fertility clinic Miracle IVF Center is seen in Vientiane, Laos June 7, 2017.Phoonsab ThevongsaOne 28-year-old Lao surrogate, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said she was paid $8,000, or 72 times the country's monthly minimum wage, to carry twins. She received accommodation in Bangkok, the Thai capital, during her third trimester of pregnancy, she added. Born in Thailand But few medical centers in Laos are equipped for surrogate births, particularly the twins often resulting from the multiple embryo implants used in In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), who are more likely to be born premature and require specialist care.  Neonatal intensive care units are only available in neighboring Thailand,  said Everingham, whose group includes two Thai hospitals and two Vientiane medical centers for surrogate births. Fertility clinic Miracle IVF Center is seen in Vientiane, Laos June 7, 2017.Phoonsab ThevongsaThailand's ban on surrogacy services followed scandals such as one in which an Australian couple was accused of abandoning a surrogate baby born with Down's syndrome. But it remains a key center for surrogate births, thanks to sophisticated medical care.  Surrogates who deliver babies in Thailand are not breaking the law, said Thongchai Keeratihuttayakorn, deputy director of the Department of Health Service Support.  If a Lao woman is hired to be a surrogate, but close to the birth they come to Thailand to deliver, we don't consider this a violation of Thai law,  Thongchai told Reuters, adding that the surrogate must identify the biological father, however.  At no time did we carry out surrogacy procedures in Thailand, or use a Thai surrogate,  said Australian Anthony Fisk, whose baby was born in Bangkok after being implanted in Cambodia prior to the ban there.  Our child was born to two foreign nationals in Bangkok, and handled as such,  Fisk told Reuters in an email. But three Bangkok hospitals contacted by Reuters said they would not accept surrogate births. Besides Western couples, the Laos clinics are increasingly eyeing China, where health officials estimate that 90 million couples have become eligible to have a second child after a decades-old one-child policy was relaxed in 2015. But such couples face tougher odds in getting pregnant, as 60 percent of them include women aged 35 or above, with half of them over 40.   There are no official estimates of the number of Chinese babies delivered by surrogates, but media say it exceeds 10,000 every year.

Security was tight nationwide after two Islamist attacks killed 30 people in Manchester and London in less than two weeks, thrusting the issue of how to counter violent extremism to the top of the agenda in the closing stages of the campaign. A final flurry of opinion polls gave May's Conservatives a lead ranging between five and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority - but not win the landslide foreseen when she called the election seven weeks ago. Voting begins at 0600 GMT and ends at 2100 GMT. There will be an exit poll as soon as voting finishes. The first handful of seat results are expected to be announced by 2300 GMT, with the vast majority of the 650 constituencies due to announce results between 0200 GMT and 0500 GMT on Friday morning. Both main parties were on the defensive after Saturday's van and knife attack in the heart of London. May faced questions over cuts in the number of police officers during her six years as interior minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn drew criticism for, among other things, voting against some counter-terrorism legislation. In the final hours of campaigning, both leaders returned to their core campaign messages.  If we get Brexit right, we can build a Britain that is more prosperous and more secure, a Britain in which prosperity and opportunity is shared by all,  May said in a last appeal to voters to trust her to  knuckle down and get the job done . After becoming prime minister without an election taking place in the turmoil that followed last year's EU referendum, May wants a personal mandate and a parliamentary majority bigger than the one she inherited from predecessor David Cameron. Basing her campaign on the slogan of  strong and stable leadership , she has said she alone could face the 27 other EU leaders and clinch a deal that would give Britain control over immigration policy while ensuring favourable trading terms. She has portrayed Corbyn as the weak and hapless leader of a spendthrift party that would hit voters with a  tax bombshell , crash the economy and flounder in the Brexit negotiations. Corbyn has hit back that Conservative fiscal austerity imposed since 2010 has hurt the poor and widened social inequalities. Views from Brussels May's campaign has not gone to plan, and as the poll leads of 20 points or more she was enjoying when she called the early election in April have shrunk, talk of a landslide victory has faded and her personal standing has taken a hit. As a result, the extent of her control over her fractious party and of her margin for manoeuvre going into the Brexit talks will hinge on the size of her majority, and on whether it is perceived to be a significant improvement on Cameron's. Provided she wins, she will have averted at least one risk: by pushing back the date of the following election to 2022 rather than 2020 as originally planned, she has ensured she will not face crunch time in the Brexit talks at the same time as an election. Some in the EU are hoping May does increase her majority, on the basis that the main risk for the bloc is a collapse in talks, and that is more easily avoided with a British government that is not vulnerable at home.  We need a government strong enough to negotiate,  a senior EU lawmaker told Reuters this week. But others have sought to downplay the impact of the election regardless of the outcome, suggesting that it was little more than a domestic political sideshow.  Will the election of more Tory (Conservative) MPs give May a greater chance of securing a better Brexit deal? For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance,  wrote Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, in an opinion column in the Guardian newspaper.  Maybot  May's troubles began on May 18, when she announced a new policy on care for the elderly that quickly proved unpopular. She backtracked days later, prompting opposition critics to pour scorn on her central claim to offer strong leadership. Opponents were quick to remind voters that May had campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU before embracing Brexit after the referendum, and that she had insisted for months an election would not be in the national interest before calling one. May has reacted by sticking steadfastly to her campaign messages, endlessly repeating the same slogans and appearing mostly at tightly controlled events - prompting many in the media to deride her as an uninspiring  Maybot . Meanwhile, veteran left-winger Corbyn, who was written off as a no-hoper by most political analysts, surprised on the upside with a policy-rich campaign that drew large, fervent crowds to his events - although sceptics say his appeal in the broader electorate is limited. He proposes building a fairer society through policies such as raising taxes for the richest 5 percent, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds ($315 billion) in infrastructure - plans which the Conservatives say are fiscally irresponsible.  Labour’s campaign has already changed the face of British politics,  Corbyn said in a final campaign rally.  As we prepare for government, we have already changed the debate and given people hope. Hope that it doesn’t have to be like this, that inequality can be tackled, that austerity can be ended, that you can stand up to the elites and the cynics.  There was only one point of agreement between May and Corbyn, which was that the strongest signal that Britons could send to show they were not cowed by the recent spate of attacks would be to go out and vote.

The currency bloc's economy has been on its best run for a decade but ECB President Mario Draghi is yet to be convinced that the recent rebound in inflation is durable because wage growth remains sluggish. Against this backdrop, the ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.59 trillion) bond-buying programme and sub-zero interest rates, despite resistance from cash-rich Germany.  We expect Thursday's press statement to reiterate that an 'exceptional degree of monetary accommodation' is still needed,  said Luigi Speranza, an economist at BNP Paribas. Sources have told Reuters the ECB is likely to nudge up its growth forecasts but trim its estimates for inflation when it presents its new staff projections for 2017-19. The mixed outlook was seen strengthening the case for keeping the ECB's easy policy in place, including a pledge to cut rates further if necessary to bring inflation back to the central bank's target of just under 2 percent.  It raises the probability that the ECB makes no changes to its language of forward guidance at this meeting,  economists at Nomura wrote in a note to clients. Among other factors making the ECB cautious are big debts overhanging governments and companies, the piles of unpaid loans weighing on banks in countries like Italy and Portugal, and political uncertainty ahead of elections in Germany and Italy. Sources told Reuters last week the ECB will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement. But any announcement on its quantitative easing (QE) programme is likely to be put off until the autumn, when policymakers hope the economic picture will have become clearer. Asset purchases under the programme are due to continue at least until December at a pace of 60 billion euros per month.  We still expect a compromise to be reached, implying more QE into next year, but at a reduced monthly pace,  economists at Societe Generale said in a note.  While data-dependent, we also expect further quarterly 10 billion euro reductions, ending QE in September 2018.  Draghi is also certain to face questions about failing Spanish lender Banco Popular, which was bought by rival Santander on Wednesday in an ECB-orchestrated rescue. Investors were wondering if the ECB move on Popular would have implications for two struggling banks in Italy's Veneto region, which like Popular are weighed down by bad loans. Having failed to raise capital on the market, Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca have applied for state help, for which they need ECB and European Commission approval. $1 = 0.8877 euros Editing by Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-policy-idUSL8N1J45HP"},

While most of the competitors in the year’s second major in Wisconsin are taking this week off to hone their swings at home, Fowler is among 32 players in the St. Jude field who have qualified to play in Erin Hills next week. “I like playing the week before majors,” the popular American told reporters at TPC Southwind on Wednesday. “It allows me to see where the game’s at, what I need to work on, what needs to be tightened up. “(I prefer to be) able to do that through the week here and minimize what I’m trying to do Monday through Wednesday the week of a major. “Ultimately I want to be in contention here but part of that is making sure the game is in a good spot.” Fowler is coming off a near-miss at the Memorial tournament on Sunday, where he stood in the final fairway thinking a birdie would probably be good enough to get into a playoff with eventual winner Jason Dufner. But he pulled his approach shot into thick rough for a closing bogey and instead finished tied for second. It was yet another close call for the ever-polite Fowler, 28, who has four PGA Tour victories to go with 10 second-placings. He also has won twice on the European Tour and once in Europe. Fowler said he had not played to his full potential at the Memorial, and took solace from being in contention without his best stuff. “Last week I did a good job of scoring. Didn’t have my best at times and was able to still get it around,” he said. Joining Fowler in a pretty good field this week are Australian former world number one Adam Scott and defending champion Daniel Berger. Five-times major winner Phil Mickelson is also playing, before skipping the U.S. Open to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, barring a last-minute switch in the schedule for the ceremony. Mickelson said he enjoyed playing at TPC Southwind. “It’s so fun to play, has such great subtlety and nuance,” Mickelson said. “It’s not the most visually spectacular course with beautiful waterfalls and all that stuff but it’s one of the best playing courses we have on tour. “It has become one of my favorite courses.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-stjude-idUSKBN18Y392"},

The gleaming, modern clinics have names featuring words such as  Miracle  and  Perfect  to help them stand out amid the dusty surrounding roads and highways in the Lao capital of Vientiane, close to the Thai border.  Laos has the best governance. Surrogacy or egg donation is not illegal!  one clinic, Thai Perfect IVF, said in a recent WeChat post in Chinese, hoping to attract clients from a country where surrogacy services have been illegal since 2001.   Rights groups say communist Laos, one of Asia's poorest countries, is a linchpin of transnational crime, and a transit center for contraband from drugs and wildlife to timber - and recently, semen. In April, Thai police arrested a man trying to smuggle six vials of human semen into Laos in a tank of liquid nitrogen, which police said was destined for a fertility clinic. Laos is becoming an international destination for infertile couples, officials of two surrogacy advisory groups told Reuters, although there are no official estimates of how many IVF clinics and surrogacy agencies have sprung up there.    Many are turning to Laos,  said Sam Everingham, global director of Australian non-profit Families Through Surrogacy, which says its conferences and advisory sessions have drawn about 600 Australian couples and singles in the last four years. But there was a risk that Laos would also ban commercial surrogacy, he warned, a fear aired in February by another group, the Nevada-based Sensible Surrogacy, which warned couples to avoid Laos and halted services in Southeast Asia. The office of the Laos prime minister did not respond to Reuters requests for comment by email or through social media site Facebook. Paid surrogacy is illegal in much of Asia, having been forbidden in neighboring Thailand in 2015, after a series of high-profile cases, with Cambodia following suit last year. Despite the bans, would-be parents are drawn by Asia's lower costs, as compared to wealthier countries. Service packages, from the screening of potential surrogates to the birth of a baby, typically cost $51,150 in Southeast Asia, says surrogacy agency New Genetics Global, making it the third most affordable option after Ukraine and Kenya. An Australian couple can expect to pay around A$75,000 ($56,000) for a baby through a Laos surrogate - less than in the United States, though more than Ukraine, Everingham said. The surrogate mothers receive only a small fraction of that sum, but it far outstrips what many could earn elsewhere. Fertility clinic Miracle IVF Center is seen in Vientiane, Laos June 7, 2017.Phoonsab ThevongsaOne 28-year-old Lao surrogate, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said she was paid $8,000, or 72 times the country's monthly minimum wage, to carry twins. She received accommodation in Bangkok, the Thai capital, during her third trimester of pregnancy, she added. Born in Thailand But few medical centers in Laos are equipped for surrogate births, particularly the twins often resulting from the multiple embryo implants used in In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), who are more likely to be born premature and require specialist care.  Neonatal intensive care units are only available in neighboring Thailand,  said Everingham, whose group includes two Thai hospitals and two Vientiane medical centers for surrogate births. Fertility clinic Miracle IVF Center is seen in Vientiane, Laos June 7, 2017.Phoonsab ThevongsaThailand's ban on surrogacy services followed scandals such as one in which an Australian couple was accused of abandoning a surrogate baby born with Down's syndrome. But it remains a key center for surrogate births, thanks to sophisticated medical care.  Surrogates who deliver babies in Thailand are not breaking the law, said Thongchai Keeratihuttayakorn, deputy director of the Department of Health Service Support.  If a Lao woman is hired to be a surrogate, but close to the birth they come to Thailand to deliver, we don't consider this a violation of Thai law,  Thongchai told Reuters, adding that the surrogate must identify the biological father, however.  At no time did we carry out surrogacy procedures in Thailand, or use a Thai surrogate,  said Australian Anthony Fisk, whose baby was born in Bangkok after being implanted in Cambodia prior to the ban there.  Our child was born to two foreign nationals in Bangkok, and handled as such,  Fisk told Reuters in an email. But three Bangkok hospitals contacted by Reuters said they would not accept surrogate births. Besides Western couples, the Laos clinics are increasingly eyeing China, where health officials estimate that 90 million couples have become eligible to have a second child after a decades-old one-child policy was relaxed in 2015. But such couples face tougher odds in getting pregnant, as 60 percent of them include women aged 35 or above, with half of them over 40.   There are no official estimates of the number of Chinese babies delivered by surrogates, but media say it exceeds 10,000 every year.

Hawaii Governor David Ige signed a bill on Tuesday requiring state officials to plan a response to climate change that aligns the state with the standards and goals of the Paris pact, according to Scott Glenn, an environmental adviser to the governor.  People come to Hawaii to enjoy its environment,  Glenn said.  When climate change is threatening our reefs and threatening our weather ... then it's threatening our economy, too.” Although Hawaii already has strong environmental rules, the new law is the first to directly refer to the standards of the Paris agreement, said Glen Andersen, who tracks energy and climate issues at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Along with setting climate change as a priority for the state, the bill creates a state commission dedicated to studying climate change and putting out detailed plans for responding both to sea-level rise and climate change as a whole, with the stipulation that the plans align with the Paris agreement. Trump said on Thursday that the landmark 2015 climate agreement threatened millions of jobs and productivity, and that he would start a multi-year process to withdraw from the deal, which has been signed by almost every other nation on Earth. The governors of Washington, California and New York on the same day announced the creation of a  climate alliance” of states that would remain committed to the Paris goals. Ige joined the alliance on Friday. An overwhelming majority of scientists say human activity - including the burning of oil, gas and coal - is the main driver of rising global temperatures. Scientists at the University of Hawaii said in April that sea-level rise driven by global warming will cause flooding of low-lying areas in the state dozens of times per year by 2050, and increase the risk of dangerous interactions between tropical storms and seasonal high tides.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-climatechange-hawaii-idUSL1N1J423T"},

Earlier this week, Dominion said it will begin a  strategic reassessment  of the 2,088-megawatt Millstone plant after another bill that would allow the state to buy power from the plant failed to get enough votes. That other bill was Senate Bill 106. Senate Bill 778, which the Senate passed this morning, authorizes the commissioner of the state Department of Energy & Environmental Protection to conduct an appraisal to determine whether the state will conduct a competitive procurement process for nuclear power. Before it becomes law, Bill 778 has to pass the state house before the session ends at midnight Wednesday and be signed by the governor. Connecticut is one of several states looking for ways to boost their nuclear plants' revenues to keep them in service to preserve benefits they provide, including carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and energy diversification. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing before their licenses expire as cheap and abundant shale gas has cut power prices over the past several years, making it uneconomic for nuclear operators to keep some units operating. While other generators with mostly gas-fired plants, like NRG Energy Inc, Dynegy Inc and Calpine Corp , challenge those New York and Illinois rules in federal court, other states - Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey - have considered adopting similar rules to protect their reactors.  We don't believe that fair and equitable power markets can be sustained when giving handouts or subsidies to nuclear operators. The suggestion that Dominion is somehow in a lesser position to participate in the power market is pure fiction,  said NRG spokesman David Gaier. If the Connecticut commissioner decides to go forward with the nuclear power purchases, the state can either require electric utilities to buy nuclear power for a period of three to ten years, or issue a solicitation for baseload zero-carbon resources, including nuclear. Ken Holt, a spokesman at Millstone, said it was premature to speculate on what the company may do if Bill 778 does not pass. He said Dominion has already sold 85 percent of the power Millstone is expected to generate in 2017 to hedge funds and other purchasers. While the company usually sells some of the plant's power three years in advance, Holt said Dominion has not sold Millstone's power beyond this year because it was waiting to see where prices would go and the outcome of the legislation. Next-day power prices in New England averaged $35.40 per megawatt hour in 2016, the lowest on record, according to Reuters data going back to 2001. That compares with a 10-year average (2007-2016) of $59.02.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/connecticut-dominion-inc-idUSL1N1J423R"},

Residents of the poor hillside neighborhood instead watched from their windows and sidewalks as groups of armed, black-clad men wearing balaclavas rode motorbikes through their streets. Venezuela's opposition calls such shows of force by so-called colectivo groups an intimidation tactic to prevent protests in Caracas' poorer west end communities that have long been a stronghold of the Socialist government. In the face of such threats, slum residents who oppose Venezuela's unpopular Socialist leader are organizing behind closed doors. They hold discrete meetings in apartments and offer social services to those suffering from the country's brutal economic crisis. They say that winning the support of Venezuela's traditionally pro-government poor could prove a tipping point for the opposition as it seeks general elections, freedom for jailed activists and autonomy for the opposition-controlled National Assembly.  As these armed groups are threatening us here, opposition supporters must express themselves in clandestinity,  said Celia Fernandez, an activist with the hardline opposition Popular Will party who lives in 23 de Enero.   How do we do politics? We call it 'having a coffee.' We visit up to 40 houses a day,  she said.  That's how we organize ourselves to go to marches or bang pots at night, which you have to do with the lights off because they can shoot you or threaten your family.  At least 65 people have died in protests, riots, and lootings across the oil-rich nation since early April, with gunmen blamed for deaths on both sides. Colectivo members reject accusations that they use scare tactics and violence. They describe themselves as defenders of the legacy of late leftist leader Hugo Chavez and point to their charity work.  While the colectivos have spooked some anti-government supporters, the opposition says it has made significant inroads in the once fiercely  Chavista  slums which they feared to enter prior to the 2013 election of President Nicolas Maduro.  Some opposition-affiliated groups have launched initiatives in poor Caracas neighborhoods to provide food to schoolchildren left hungry by chronic shortages - services once offered by government agencies when high oil prices swelled state coffers.  Children have lunch in a dining room run by opposition supporters at La Vega slum in Caracas, Venezuela May 23, 2017.Carlos Garcia Rawlins Don't Play With Food    Up until 2013, we couldn't even enter many areas in La Vega,  said Esteban Farias, a member of the Justice First opposition party that works in the poor Caracas neighborhood through a non-profit called Mi Convive or  My Buddy , which also organizes sports activities.   Here we're doing a healthy form of politics, from a social point of view, and we've advanced quite a bit in poor areas,  Farias said standing inside a soup kitchen in La Vega, one of seven the organization operates in poorer parts of Caracas. Staple products like milk and rice are running short or are so expensive that they are out of the reach of the poor, a problem that has steadily turned the government's backers against Maduro.  Leandro Buzon (R), volunteer, talks with kids about a basketball tournament organized by opposition supporters at the 23 de Enero slum in Caracas, Venezuela May 19, 2017.Marco Bello I really believed in Chavismo, it was 'fatherland or death' for me,  said Jaqueline Arguinzone, 51, speaking in the hallway of her home in 23 de Enero, which partially collapsed due to heavy rains this year.   So many bad things have happened in the last few years that I didn't believe in anyone. But in these people, yes. They're young people with a new vision,  she said, pointing to a group of Justice First activists offering to help her clear the hallway. The shift has been reflected in elections, too. While the ruling Socialist Party won seven of nine National Assembly seats in Caracas in 2010, it only pocketed one in the 2015 vote when the opposition swept to victory.  To help rebuild its popularity, Maduro's government launched a food distribution system last year, known as CLAP, in which Venezuelans can buy a subsidized food bag once a month.  Opposition activists say that too is being used to stifle dissent, such as the beating of pots and pans - a traditional Latin American protest known as a 'cacerolazo.'   We don't do cacerolazos in my area. They reached a deal to avoid putting the CLAP bags at risk,  said Farias, in reference to opposition supporters and organizers of the food distribution system. Other areas of La Vega are venting anger at the government through cacerolazos, even though they know they may get cut from CLAP.      People aren't accepting this anymore. You can't play with food,  said Farias. Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Andrew Hay","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-slums-idUSKBN18Y37R"},

Comey was leading a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election when Trump fired him last month. Comey said he had a total of three face-to-face meetings with Trump and six phone calls with him. Following are details of what Comey said occurred in some of the conversations. Jan. 6 Briefing at Trump Tower in New York, when Trump was president-elect. At conclusion of a briefing given with other intelligence community officials, Comey remained alone with Trump to provide a private briefing on material that was  salacious and unverified.   Comey said he was prepared to tell Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally, because the agency did not  have an open counter-intelligence case on him.    I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-elect,  Comey said, saying he began to  type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting.   Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward,  Comey said. Jan. 27 Dinner at the White House  Comey had dinner with Trump in the Green Room at the White House. Trump called him earlier in the day to extend the invitation and Comey had assumed that other people would be present, but it was just him and the president. Trump asked Comey if he wanted to remain FBI director, which Comey said he  found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him I intended to.   My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship.  Comey said.  Because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not 'reliable' in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth,  Comey said.  A few moments later, the President said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed.  Trump returned to the subject of Comey's job near the end of the dinner, and said: “I need loyalty.” Comey said he replied:  You will always get honesty from me.” Trump paused and said: “That’s what I want, honest loyalty.” Comey said he paused, and said: “You will get that from me,” although Comey said it was possible he and Trump  understood the phrase 'honest loyalty' differently.  Feb. 14 Oval Office meeting Comey went to the Oval Office for a counterterrorism briefing with other officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. At the end of the briefing, Trump indicated he wanted to speak to Comey alone, and when Sessions lingered, Trump said he wanted to speak only to Comey. Once alone, Trump began by saying:  I want to talk about Mike Flynn,  who had been fired as national security adviser the previous day. Trump said of Flynn:  He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” Comey said he replied only that  he is a good guy,  and said that  I did not say I would 'let this go.'  Comey discussed the conversation with the FBI leadership team and it was agreed not to report the conversation to the attorney general. But shortly afterward, Comey said he spoke in person to Sessions to pass along Trump's concerns about leaks.  I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened – him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind – was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply.  March 30 Phone call Trump called Comey at the FBI.  He described the Russia investigation as 'a cloud' that was that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country,  and asked what could be done to  lift the cloud.  Trump wanted to know why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the prior week. Comey said the FBI had briefed congressional leaders on which individuals it was investigating and said Trump was not being personally investigated. Comey said he reminded Trump that he had previously told him that. Trump, he said,  repeatedly told me, 'We need to get that fact out.'  April 11 Phone call Trump called Comey and asked what he  had done about his request that I 'get out' that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back.  Trump again said  the cloud  was interfering with his ability to do his job.

Hawaii Governor David Ige signed a bill on Tuesday requiring state officials to plan a response to climate change that aligns the state with the standards and goals of the Paris pact, according to Scott Glenn, an environmental adviser to the governor.  People come to Hawaii to enjoy its environment,  Glenn said.  When climate change is threatening our reefs and threatening our weather ... then it's threatening our economy, too.” Although Hawaii already has strong environmental rules, the new law is the first to directly refer to the standards of the Paris agreement, said Glen Andersen, who tracks energy and climate issues at the National Conference of State Legislatures. FILE PHOTO: Tourists and locals watch the sunset from White Sands Beach Park in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, January 31, 2016.Canice Leung/File PhotoAlong with setting climate change as a priority for the state, the bill creates a state commission dedicated to studying climate change and putting out detailed plans for responding both to sea-level rise and climate change as a whole, with the stipulation that the plans align with the Paris agreement. Trump said on Thursday that the landmark 2015 climate agreement threatened millions of jobs and productivity, and that he would start a multi-year process to withdraw from the deal, which has been signed by almost every other nation on Earth. FILE PHOTO: A view of Honolulu, Hawaii is seen from the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific November 9, 2011.Chris Wattie/File PhotoThe governors of Washington, California and New York on the same day announced the creation of a  climate alliance” of states that would remain committed to the Paris goals. Ige joined the alliance on Friday. An overwhelming majority of scientists say human activity - including the burning of oil, gas and coal - is the main driver of rising global temperatures. Scientists at the University of Hawaii said in April that sea-level rise driven by global warming will cause flooding of low-lying areas in the state dozens of times per year by 2050, and increase the risk of dangerous interactions between tropical storms and seasonal high tides.

Earlier this week, Dominion said it will begin a  strategic reassessment  of the 2,088-megawatt Millstone plant after another bill that would allow the state to buy power from the plant failed to get enough votes. That other bill was Senate Bill 106. Senate Bill 778, which the Senate passed this morning, authorizes the commissioner of the state Department of Energy & Environmental Protection to conduct an appraisal to determine whether the state will conduct a competitive procurement process for nuclear power. Before it becomes law, Bill 778 has to pass the state house before the session ends at midnight Wednesday and be signed by the governor. Connecticut is one of several states looking for ways to boost their nuclear plants' revenues to keep them in service to preserve benefits they provide, including carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and energy diversification. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing before their licenses expire as cheap and abundant shale gas has cut power prices over the past several years, making it uneconomic for nuclear operators to keep some units operating. While other generators with mostly gas-fired plants, like NRG Energy Inc, Dynegy Inc and Calpine Corp, challenge those New York and Illinois rules in federal court, other states - Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey - have considered adopting similar rules to protect their reactors.  We don't believe that fair and equitable power markets can be sustained when giving handouts or subsidies to nuclear operators. The suggestion that Dominion is somehow in a lesser position to participate in the power market is pure fiction,  said NRG spokesman David Gaier. If the Connecticut commissioner decides to go forward with the nuclear power purchases, the state can either require electric utilities to buy nuclear power for a period of three to ten years, or issue a solicitation for baseload zero-carbon resources, including nuclear. Ken Holt, a spokesman at Millstone, said it was premature to speculate on what the company may do if Bill 778 does not pass. He said Dominion has already sold 85 percent of the power Millstone is expected to generate in 2017 to hedge funds and other purchasers. While the company usually sells some of the plant's power three years in advance, Holt said Dominion has not sold Millstone's power beyond this year because it was waiting to see where prices would go and the outcome of the legislation.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries cut their ties with Doha on Monday in part because of comments posted briefly on the Qatar News Agency's website on May 23. The article quoted Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani as cautioning against confrontation with Iran, as well as defending the Palestinian group Hamas and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi'ite movement allied with Tehran.  The Ministry said the investigation team confirmed that the piracy process had used high techniques and innovative methods by exploiting an electronic gap on the website of the Qatar News Agency,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. It did not say who might have carried out the hack. U.S. and European officials said that while United States government agencies and experts were convinced that the news agency and the Qatari government's Twitter feed were hacked, they have not yet determined who did the hacking. A CNN report quoted unidentified U.S. officials briefed on the investigation as saying that Russian hackers were suspected. Moscow said the report was false. One U.S. intelligence official said that while Russia has the expertise and an incentive to sow division among Arab states allied with the United States, Russian hackers were available for hire to other countries and criminal groups.  Arab countries at odds with Qatar accuse it of supporting militant groups and advancing their arch-rival Iran's agenda in the region - charges Doha calls baseless. U.S. military officials, also speaking anonymously to discuss political issues, said the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar is vital to American air support against Iranian paramilitaries and Iranian-backed forces on the side of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war.

The conclusion could add to the U.S. military's view that, although much more work remains on missile defense, it is staying ahead of a mounting threat from North Korea, which has declared its intent to develop an ICBM capable of striking the U.S. mainland. Since 2012, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation had assessed only that the United States had a  limited capability  to defend against a threat like the one from North Korea or Iran using interceptors in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program, managed by Boeing Co (BA.N). But after successfully intercepting a simulated ICBM last month, the Pentagon office elevated that assessment, the memo, dated June 6, said.  GMD has demonstrated capability to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number of intermediate-range or intercontinental missile threats with simple countermeasures,  the memo said. The May 30 missile test, which experts compare to hitting a bullet with another bullet, involved a simulated launch of a type of ICBM from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The U.S. military then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The test ended with a head-on strike, resulting in obliteration. It was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM, which the military said was made even more complicated by the use of decoys designed to throw off the interceptor. Previously, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. However, the interceptor technology has been making steady advances. More tests are planned to advance U.S. defense capabilities. Vice Admiral Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a hearing in Congress he still felt the defense program needed improvement, even though his concerns about reliability had been addressed  in large part  in the past five to six years.  It's just not the interceptor, the entire system,  he said.  We are not there yet.   We have continued work with the redesigned kill vehicle. We have continued work with the reliability of the other components of the system to make it totally reliable,  he said.  We are not done yet.  At the same time, he assured he was confident in his ability to defend the United States. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles) but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Syring said the ballistic missile defense review now underway would look not only at the capability of the current interceptors but whether more were needed.  Where we need to be prudent and constantly vigilant on is what is the capacity increase we can expect from North Korea and what is our capacity needed to meet that threat,  he said.

In written testimony released by the panel on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him on Jan. 27 that  I expect loyalty,  and in a Feb. 14 meeting asked him to back off from a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia. The Republican president's search for a replacement for Comey after firing him May 9 was difficult. Leading candidates including former Senator Joe Lieberman took their names out of consideration, and Trump interviewed a series of contenders. In a statement, Trump called Wray  an impeccably qualified individual  who will serve  as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity.  The White House has given shifting explanations on why Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians to help him with the 2016 presidential election. Trump has said he was thinking of  this Russia thing  in dismissing Comey. Wray served from 2003 to 2005 at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department's Enron task force. Wray and Comey helped bring the case against Kenneth Lay, the former Enron chairman convicted in 2006. Also involved in the Enron matter was Robert Mueller, then FBI director and now special counsel named after Comey was fired to investigate the Russia affair, as well as Andrew Weissman, who is now working for Mueller. The web of Enron connections underscores the reliance in Washington, even under a president who vowed to  drain the swamp,  on an elite corps of corporate lawyers whose varied careers often intersect and who sometimes present conflict-of-interest issues. For instance, after he left the Justice Department and joined top international law firm King & Spalding, Wray represented Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal over massive traffic jams created as political punishment for a local mayor. 'Partisan Activity' That case and others taken on by Wray while in private practice could pose problems, said American Civil Liberties Union National Political Director Faiz Shakir in a statement.  Christopher Wray's firm's legal work for the Trump family, his history of partisan activity, as well as his history of defending Trump's transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the FBI,  Shakir said. Wray represented Christie in a scandal that resulted in two of the governor's aides being convicted. Christie, who was a close adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and whose name was floated as a possible Comey replacement, was never charged. Christie on Wednesday called Wray  an outstanding choice, a non-political choice  to head the FBI. Wray works as a King & Spalding litigation partner and represents companies and individuals in a white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters. King & Spalding has represented Russian companies including state gas monopoly Gazprom, according to its website. According to the website, the firm's energy practice also has represented businesses taking part in deals involving Russian entities including state-owned oil major Rosneft. The firm has previous ties to Trump. Bobby Burchfield, a partner in its Washington office, serves as ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate Trump from the day-to-day operations of the Trump business organization. The agreement has been criticized by some ethics experts as inadequate. Apart from possible conflicts, another question about Wray is whether the longtime white-collar lawyer is equipped to take over an agency that is increasingly focused on detecting and combating terrorism, espionage and cybercrime.  There are questions about whether he is experienced enough in intelligence, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, computer crimes, and issues like that,  said one senior U.S. law enforcement official who asked not to be identified.  The biggest test the bureau is likely to face is not another Enron,  the official said. Trump announced his selection of Wray in a surprise, early-morning Twitter message. Some Democratic lawmakers said the president's timing seemed intended to distract from Comey's scheduled testimony.  It is imperative that the next FBI director be of unimpeachable integrity and independence,  Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, said.  In light of the president's constant efforts to block the truth, the nomination of Christopher Wray should be subject to the utmost scrutiny.  Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wray's  impressive credentials make him more than ready  to lead the FBI. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he did not know Wray but that his resume suggests he is  the perfect kind of person  for the job.

Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek plays a Los Angeles holistic healer who ends up by chance attending a dinner party at the home of her wealthy clients.  Tension ensues as her character, Beatriz, goes head to head with Doug, played by John Lithgow, a self-satisfied billionaire real estate developer with whom she has nothing in common. Hayek said Beatriz is the most like herself than any role she has ever played.  It's really weird because it was written before this political climate and ... you read it and then you start living your life or watching the news and you can't stop thinking about - you keep going back to Beatriz,  Hayak said. 70th Cannes Film Festival - Event for the 70th Anniversary of the festival - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France. 23/05/2017.

Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman said the film  has the  distinction of being the first dramatic comedy that’s an explicit - and provocative - allegory of the Age of Trump.  Connie Britton, who plays one of Beatriz's wealthy clients, said she hoped the film would elicit a wider dialogue among audiences.

America wants to build,  Trump said.  There is no limit to what we can achieve. All it takes is a bold and daring vision and the will to make it happen.      Speaking in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump reviewed a proposal announced earlier this year to leverage $200 billion in his budget proposal into a $1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system, strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges, roads and waterways. Trump said he would not allow the United States to become a “museum of former glory.” He spoke about backing large transformative projects but did not give specifics. “We will construct incredible new monuments to American grit that inspire wonder for generations and generations,” he said. Trump pointed to a government program that allows the private sector to tap into low-cost government loans called the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act as a way to leverage federal funds with state, local, and private sector funding.

Democrats want $1 trillion in new federal spending and proposed a plan that includes $200 billion in roads and bridges,$20 billion in expanding broadband Internet access, $110 billion for water systems and $75 billion for schools. Slideshow (4 Images)Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said the Trump budget unveiled in May cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several departments, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. The Ohio visit was the second leg of a week-long White House focus on infrastructure. On Monday the president proposed spinning off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration. The proposal to privatize air traffic control has run into skepticism and opposition from Democratic senators and some Republicans.      The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy that Trump made last year during his presidential campaign.     Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russia's alleged meddling in the election. That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month, testifies before a Senate panel.

MSU players Donnie Corley Jr., Demetric Vance and Joshua King are accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a party in an on-campus apartment in January, according to campus police. The woman has not been identified. The Ingham County Prosecutor's Office charged Corley and Vance with third-degree criminal sexual conduct. King was charged with first- and third-degree criminal sexual conduct and distributing an image of an unclothed person.   Corley says he is innocent, his attorney, John Shea, said in an emailed statement. Attorneys for the other two players could not be reached.     The three men were dismissed from the Michigan State football program on Tuesday.  Sexual assault has no place in our community, and I want to share my deep concern for the young woman affected and her family,  MSU football coach Mark Dantonio said in a statement after the men were charged.  The woman said King pulled her into a bathroom and forced her into sex acts, while the other men came in and forced her to perform oral sex, Michigan State University police detective Chad Davis said in Lansing district court on Tuesday, the Detroit Free Press reported. A video of King having sex with the woman in the bathroom was found on his phone, Davis said. Karen Truszkowski, an attorney for the woman, told reporters the case reflected a larger problem.  Look how many arrests we have had for sexual assaults with football players, and these are not the only incidents. There are a whole lot more out there,  she said on Tuesday, according to video posted by the Detroit News. An investigation by a law firm into the university's handling of the case, which was released on Monday, found the coach had acted promptly. But a football team staff member violated school policy due to contact he had with the accused players, it found. The university did not renew the staffer's contract, the Free Press reported. Last month, a former Baylor University student sued the Texas college, alleging she was drugged and gang raped by football players and that the school had turned a blind eye to sexual assaults by athletes on campus. In 2016, the case of former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman stoked a national debate about campus sexual assault. He was sentenced to six months confinement in a California county jail but was released after three months.  Nearly one in five U.S. women have been victims of sexual assault, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The bipartisan group of lawmakers joined safety experts and parents with testimonials of personal tragedies to publicly press for a law they said would have averted many of the 800  deaths of children left in overheated cars since 1990.      It should be bipartisan, non-partisan, it should be America's legislation,  Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican told a Washington press conference.     The bill, known as the Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats, or HOT CARS, Act, would instruct the U.S. Transportation Department to issue a rule requiring new cars to have systems that alert drivers check their back seats after they turn off their engines.

Temer's proposal to loosen labor laws won approval from the Senate's economic affairs committee on Tuesday, clearing the way for a full-house vote and reducing expectations that a growing political crisis could jeopardize his reforms agenda.      The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.34 percent, driven higher by rising shares of banks such as Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA and Banco do Brasil SA.     Brazil's real inched up only 0.13 percent as the TSE, Brazil's top electoral court, argued whether Temer received illegal campaign funding in 2014, when he ran for vice president with his leftist predecessor, Dilma Rousseff.     Temer's opponents see a ruling as a way out of the political crisis set off by corruption allegations leveled against the center-right leader, but a decision could take weeks, if not months, and could be appealed by Temer.     Trading was muted in much of Latin America.     In Mexico, the IPC share index and the peso rose very slightly as investors eyed events scheduled for Thursday, when Britain holds a general election, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's former director testifies to Congress and the European Central Bank (ECB) meets to decide on policy.      Tomorrow may be the most important day of the quarter for investors,  analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman wrote in a note to clients.     Political noise has weighed on demand for risky assets in recent days, with MSCI's emerging stock benchmark dipping for a second day. Contributing to caution were decisions by several Arab countries to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar vehemently denies the allegations.

Comey, who was fired by Trump last month, wrote that U.S. President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But the details of Comey's testimony, expected to be delivered Thursday to a Senate Committee, appeared to be priced into the stock market. Investors were concerned that any additional revelation could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  They were hoping that there wasn’t going to be anything in there that was more inflammatory,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions.  The testimony wasn’t as disastrous as it could have been,  he said of the prepared remarks, adding that the market was relieved no damaging details emerged and his testimony  more than likely isn’t going to blow up into some big fiasco, another thing that the president has to deal with.  [For Comey's full statement, see: bit.ly/JCJune8] Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermidCosta cautioned that the market's reaction to Comey's remarks was not a particularly big move up and volume was light. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 37.46 points, or 0.18 percent, to 21,173.69, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 3.81 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,433.14 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 22.32 points, or 0.36 percent, to 6,297.38.     Wall Street was weighed by a near 2-percent drop in the S&P; 500's energy sector .SPNY. All but two of the 34 components of the sector fell as U.S. crude futures CLc1 tumbled 5 percent due to an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories. Brent crude LCOc1 fell nearly 4 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Signet Jewelers (SIG.N), which rose 4 percent, while the largest decliner was Newfield Exploration (NFX.N), down 7 percent. Investors are also keeping an eye on Britain's general election and the European Central Bank's policy meeting, both on Thursday.     Opinion polls have shown Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government. The election comes as Britain maps its exit from the European Union following a referendum on the subject last year. The ECB is expected to reiterate its plan to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy at least until the end of the year. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.60 billion shares, roughly in line with the average over the last 20 trading days.

Rising wholesale beef prices buoyed cattle futures as retailers bought to stock meat coolers ahead of the Father's Day holiday this month and the U.S. Independence Day holiday next month, both popular times for outdoor grilling.     Investors were anticipating a seasonal break in cattle and beef prices as that beef buying slows. But cattle futures remained discounted to trades in Plains cash cattle markets, underpinning futures amid nearly record-high open interest in Chicago Mercantile cattle futures.      The live cattle are responding to continued solid fundamentals. ... It's difficult to create a sustained downtrend,  Cassie Fish, an analyst and author of blog The Beef, said in a phone interview.     CME June live cattle futures        settled up 1.000 cent at 131.200 cents per pound while most-active August cattle futures        firmed by 0.575 cent to 124.175 cents.     No deliveries have been posted so far against June futures in the delivery cycle that began on Monday, according to the CME Group. Cash cattle last week in the Plains fetched $134 to $137 per cwt, up from the June futures equivalent of about $131.     The weekly Fed Cattle Exchange online auction was scheduled for Thursday, postponed one day due to technical issues, according to the auction website.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture after the close of futures trading said wholesale choice beef was up 26 cents to $250.71 per cwt, the highest in more than a year.                CME August feeder cattle        settled down 0.575 cent at 154.800 cents per pound, extending losses after tumbling nearly 3 percent on Tuesday.     CME June lean hog futures        were off 0.025 cent to 81.625 cents and most-active July hogs        were down 0.300 to 81.075 while most other deferred contracts edged higher.     Investors were taking profits after hog prices hit multimonth peaks last week and then failed to surpass those highs so far this week.      There's not a lot of enthusiasm to get long $80 hogs,  CHS Hedging analyst Steve Wagner said by phone.     Hogs were up 77 cents at an average of $76.12 per cwt in the top cash market in Iowa and southern Minnesota, the USDA said.               Wholesale pork was up 81 cents at $91.06 per cwt while the popular grilling cut of ribs gained $5.09 to $146.06 per cwt, according to government data.

Researchers applied Einstein's findings to measure how Stein 2051B's gravity warped the background star's light, a phenomenon the physicist predicted more than 100 years ago and a direct means to assess its mass. The technique could be applied to other stars.  It was like measuring the motion of a little firefly in front of a light bulb from 1,500 miles away,  astronomer Kailash Sahu of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said at a news conference. The research was presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday and also published in this week's issue of the journal Science. The measurements show the mass of Stein 2051B is about two-thirds of the sun in Earth's solar system. It is a type of star known as a white dwarf, which is what all stars smaller than eight times the size of the sun will become when they run out of nuclear fuel and collapse, leaving a hot core.  The single most important thing for the star is its mass,  Sahu said.  If we know the mass, we known what its radius will be, how bright it will be, how long it will live, what will happen after it dies. Everything depends on the mass of the star.  Scientists previously determined the mass of three other white dwarf stars using an indirect technique that required the star to have an orbiting partner for measuring gravitational pull. The bending of light was a key test for Einstein's general theory of relativity, which was published more than 100 years ago, and proven in 1919 when scientists measured the curving of starlight around the sun during a total solar eclipse. Einstein's work laid the foundation for modern physics and cosmology, providing a perspective of space and time that is shaped by gravity.     Sahu and colleagues are the first to observe the phenomenon in a star beyond the sun, Terry Oswalt of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, said in a related essay in Science.

The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Arab and Kurdish militias, on Tuesday declared the start of its offensive to seize the northern Syrian city from Islamic State, which overran it in 2014. With tens of thousands of people uprooted by the fighting, a U.N. official warned of a dire humanitarian situation, with shortages of food and fuel. The YPG militia, which is part of the SDF, called for international humanitarian aid.  We are receiving reports of air strikes in several locations in Raqqa city,  U.N. aid official Linda Tom told Reuters by phone from Damascus.      By Wednesday, the SDF had moved into the western outskirts of Raqqa and were trying to advance into an eastern neighborhood. Shelling and air strikes from the U.S.-led coalition hit targets around the city's edges, according to a war monitoring group and the YPG. West of Raqqa, the SDF cleared Hawi Hawa village and took the more than 1,000-year-old Harqalah fortress ruins, YPG militia spokesman Nouri Mahmoud told Reuters by phone.  To the east, there were clashes in the al-Mishlab district, the first quarter the SDF entered on Tuesday, Mahmoud and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said. The Raqqa assault overlaps with the final stages of the U.S.-backed attack to recapture Islamic State's capital in Iraq, the city of Mosul. Brett McGurk, the American envoy to the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said it was significant that the SDF now had a  foothold  in Raqqa.  The Islamists are  down to their last neighborhood in Mosul and they have already now lost part of Raqqa. The Raqqa campaign from here will only accelerate,  McGurk said in Baghdad on Wednesday.  A Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter takes a position inside a building in the al-Mishlab district at Raqqa's southeastern outskirts, Syria June 7, 2017.Rodi SaidBut he said the coalition and SDF were prepared for  a difficult and a long-term battle .  Islamic State has been forced into retreat across much of Syria. Its biggest remaining foothold is in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor, which borders Iraq. People on the Move Slideshow (3 Images)The U.N.'s Tom said an estimated 50,000-100,000 people were trapped inside Raqqa, far fewer than its population before the Syrian war erupted in 2011. Many have fled to camps elsewhere in Syria.  In some areas around Raqqa, where the SDF has recently taken control, people had started returning home, said Tom, but yet more were still being uprooted and the situation was very fluid. YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud told Reuters displaced people were coming from all edges of the city after finding their own routes out.  He said when refugees arrived at SDF positions they were being given tents and upplies, but much more humanitarian support was needed to cope with the large numbers.  Their situation is tragic, it is difficult. There isn't much support for them,  Mahmoud said.     McGurk said the coalition was working with the SDF on a humanitarian response.  Now in its seventh year, the Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million people from their homes.

Trump,Lynn Rhinehart,Randy Johnson,USA,LABOR/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday said it was rescinding the Obama administration's standard for determining when companies are  joint employers  of contract and franchise workers, in the agency's first major shift in labor policy under President Donald Trump. The department in a statement said it had withdrawn a 2016 interpretation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that expanded the circumstances under which a business could be held liable for wage-law violations by staffing agencies, contractors, and franchisees. Previously, companies were considered joint employers when they hired and fired workers and set wages. The Obama administration said a worker's level of  economic dependence  on a company should also be considered. The expanded definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would draw companies into lawsuits when they were not responsible for setting working conditions. Also on Wednesday, the department withdrew 2015 guidance that said that under the same law, many workers are improperly treated as independent contractors when they are actually employees, which would make them eligible for minimum wage, overtime, and other legal protections. Guidance issued by federal agencies is not legally binding, but serves as a blueprint for how agencies will enforce federal laws. A shift in enforcement priorities at the Department of Labor had been widely expected since President Donald Trump, a Republican and wealthy businessman from New York, took office. Business groups have said the department's guidance on employment and worker classification was misguided and affected nearly every U.S. industry, and they praised the agency's changes on Wednesday.  Diligent employers work hard to be compliant with the FLSA and these (department) interpretations were merely enforcement traps waiting to spring,  Randy Johnson, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Unions and workers' rights groups said they were troubled by the labor department's decision.  This was guidance that made it easier for employers, workers, unions and others to know about their rights and obligations under the law,  Lynn Rhinehart, general counsel for the AFL-CIO, said in a statement. The withdrawal of the guidance does not affect a separate expansion of the definition of joint employment by the National Labor Relations Board, which is under review by a federal appeals court. The NLRB's standard has had more of an impact than the labor department's because it is legally binding and requires joint employers to bargain with unions.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-labor-idUSL1N1J41RF"},

Hudson's Bay, which operates its namesake chain in Canada, bought Saks in 2013 for $2.4 billion. It also owns Lord & Taylor in the United States, leading German department store chain Kaufhof, and has plans to open the first international Hudson's Bay stores in the Netherlands. The retailer, which reports first quarter results on Thursday, announced plans last September for the largest Saks store in Canada, a 200,000 square-foot (18,580 sq meter) flagship in Montreal. At the time, the company said the building, which already houses a Hudson's Bay store, would undergo an  extensive  multimillion-dollar renovation. With North American department stores reporting dismal sales, shuttering outlets, and cutting costs, squeezed by online competitors like Amazon.com Inc, several retail industry consultants said a re-evaluation or delay of the project would come as no surprise. City spokeswoman Anik de Repentigny told Reuters Montreal has not received a permit application for the property, which includes refacing a portion of the exterior, according to an artist's rendering released last September. In a statement, Hudson's Bay spokeswoman Tiffany Bourre reiterated the company's intention to bring Saks Fifth Avenue to Montreal, but declined to comment on specifics including whether the project was delayed, or when it will apply for a permit. Any potential delay could mean missing the crucial holiday shopping season, industry consultants said.  The importance of being open for the holiday period cannot be underestimated,  said Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet said.  If we're thinking fall of 2018, we're 15 months out ... Certainly we would expect delays - it would be a question of how long,  said Sally Seston, a principal at Retail Category Consultants, adding that department stores across the spectrum are struggling. Saks has two full-line stores in Canada, both in Toronto, and a Calgary location set to open in January 2018. One retail consultant familiar with Hudson's Bay stores but not involved with the Montreal project, said the lack of a permit application was a  tell-tale  sign.  If you look at the physical premise, I can't imagine they would meet their deadline,  said the consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid poisoning relations with the company. It took some 19 months, from the time when permits were issued, before the 170,000 square foot Saks store in downtown Toronto opened in February 2016, behind its fall 2015 schedule. Montreal spokeswoman de Repentigny said factors including project complexity would determine how long it takes to issue a permit, noting that more than 90 percent of permits for the downtown borough were issued in under 120 days last year. Hudson's Bay spokeswoman Bourre said the company was still working through the details. Several industry consultants also question why the high-end retailer would open its largest store in Montreal, a market known for fashion, but smaller and less affluent than Toronto. Hudson's Bay does not break down sales by country, but the Saks luxury chain, which had a total of 41 locations as of Jan. 28, reported an overall drop in same-store sales in four of the last five quarters, including a 4.8 percent fall in the first quarter of 2017.  There is this concern they really aren't doing the numbers that they had thought they were going to do,  said Maureen Atkinson, senior partner with global retail advisor, J.C. Williams Group, of the Toronto locations.

The session, set to start on Monday, will seek stricter regulations on abortion clinics, including requiring annual inspections and that clinics adopt plans for potential medical complications, Governor Eric Greitens said in a statement. That came in response to a federal judge's ruling in April that blocked requirements for clinics to meet standards for surgical centers and for doctors to have hospital privileges. Greitens said he also wants to target an ordinance approved by St. Louis aldermen in February banning employers and landlords from discriminating against women who have had an abortion, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. The Missouri legislative session ended in May without approving a proposal to nullify the ordinance, which critics said would force groups that oppose abortion to sanction it and could threaten the work of anti-abortion pregnancy resource centers. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis in late May sued to overturn the ordinance.  Politicians are trying to make it illegal, for example, for pro-life organizations to say that they just want to hire pro-life Missourians,  Greitens said in a statement. Allison Dreith, executive director of the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, denounced the governor's move.  Make no mistake about it. The intent behind the governor's actions is to shame women for their personal medical decisions and make basic reproductive health care harder to access,  she said in a statement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/missouri-abortion-idUSL1N1J41Z3"},

The U.S. restrictions imposed in March currently cover about 350 flights a week originating from 10 airports, primarily in the Middle East. Extending the ban to all European airports that directly serve U.S. airports would affect nearly 400 flights a day and cover 30 million travelers and pose major logistical challenges, airlines and security officials say.  We are looking right now at an additional 71 airports,  Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told a House of Representatives panel.  We're also looking at ways that we think we can mitigate the threat  without expanding the ban. Kelly said his deputy will attend a conference in Malta next week  to present what we think are the minimum increased security standards ... and present those to people to say if you meet these standards we will not ban large electronics.  The restrictions on laptops announced in March, including on flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, came amid fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes. Kelly said many countries are working to not be added to the ban list by improving screening to  detect this very sophisticated device.  He called the danger real.  This is a very serious constant threat to knock down an airplane,  Kelly said. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan declined to identify the 71 airports that are under consideration. Any move to restrict carrying larger electronics to the cargo hold of aircraft has potential safety implications related to past problems with laptop batteries. Kelly said he is reviewing those concerns. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao at a Senate hearing on Wednesday said lithium ion batteries on airplanes can be a problem.  This is a difficult issue that the administration is grappling with especially from a security point of view,  Chao said. A laptop fire in a cabin can be detected quickly, versus a device stored in a cargo hold. On May 30, a New York JetBlue Airways Corp flight bound for San Francisco was diverted to Michigan because of a lithium battery fire from a passenger laptop in the airplane cabin.

The results indicate that at least part of the link previously seen between kids’ exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy and their risk of developing ADHD may be explained by “family factors” such as maternal depression, rather than the drugs themselves, the study authors write in The BMJ. When the researchers compared the children of women with psychiatric disorders who had either taken antidepressants during pregnancy or only before pregnancy, they found the ADHD risk among their children was similar. This was also true for siblings with the same mother but different exposures to antidepressants during pregnancy. “Pregnant women should not stop treatment because of concerns of ADHD in their children in the future,” senior study author Ian C.K. Wong, of the school of pharmacy at University College London said by email.  In the study of 190,618 kids born in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2009, just 3 percent of the children were diagnosed with ADHD or treated for the condition after an average follow-up of more than nine years.      The type of antidepressant might matter. Researchers didn’t find a meaningful association between children’s ADHD and their mother’s use during pregnancy of a family of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that includes Prozac, Zoloft and Celexa, according to the report in The BMJ.  Women who took other types of antidepressants while pregnant were 59 percent more likely to have kids with ADHD than women who didn’t use any antidepressants, however. This might be because women with milder depression typically get SSRIs first, and only try other drugs when they have more severe psychiatric problems that aren’t helped by SSRIs, the authors note.  Even when women never used antidepressants, mothers with psychiatric disorders were 84 percent more likely to have kids with ADHD than mothers without mental health problems, the study also found. One limitation of the study is that it only included births at public hospitals, the authors note, but this is where most specialist care for kids with brain development issues is provided in Hong Kong. Researchers also used prescription records to assess whether women took antidepressants, which don’t always reflect the drugs people actually take.  Four of the study authors report past grants or consulting work for companies that make antidepressants, and one is an employee of Janssen Research and Development, LLC, a Johnson and Johnson division with an antidepressant under development.  Left untreated, depression during pregnancy is associated with underweight babies who are more likely to wind up in neonatal intensive care, previous research has found. Pregnant women with uncontrolled depression may not eat well or keep up with prenatal visits, and, in the most severe cases they may be at increased risk for suicide. Like many drugs, antidepressants fall into a gray area during pregnancy, with insufficient evidence to definitively prove the harms or benefits. Often, doctors may only consider these drugs for women with more severe depression. Because some uncertainties about antidepressant use in pregnancy remain, it still makes sense to reserve them for women with serious psychiatric symptoms, Wong said.  “Pregnant women with mild depression may benefit from non-drug treatment such as psychotherapy,” Wong added.  The study findings aren’t surprising, however, and should reassure women who do need to take antidepressants during pregnancy, said Dr. Roy Perlis, a psychiatry researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.  “No one wants to take medications they don’t need,” Perlis added. “But people sometimes forget that depression itself carries risk.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2qIxcNR The BMJ, online May 31, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-depression-adhd-idUSKBN18Y343"},

Islamic State claimed responsibility and threatened more attacks against Iran's majority Shi'ite population, seen by the hardline Sunni militants as heretics. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted:  Terror-sponsoring despots threaten to bring the fight to our homeland. Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy.   He did not explicitly blame any country but the tweet appeared to refer to comments made by Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud, in May, saying that that Riyadh would bring  the battle  for regional influence to Iran. Sunni Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the Tehran attacks, but the assault further fuels tensions between Riyadh and Tehran as they vie for control of the Gulf and influence in the wider Islamic world. It comes days after Riyadh and other Sunni Muslim powers cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing Tehran and militant groups. They were the first attacks claimed by Islamic State inside the tightly controlled Shi'ite Muslim country, one of the powers leading the fight against IS forces in nearby Iraq and Syria. The deputy head of Iran's National Security Council, Reza Seifollhai, told state TV late on Wednesday that the attackers were people from Iran who had joined Islamic State. Iranian police said they had arrested five suspects     Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said:  These fireworks have no effect on Iran. They will soon be eliminated.   They are too small to affect the will of the Iranian nation and its officials,  state TV quoted him saying. The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps accused Riyadh of being behind the attacks and vowed to seek revenge.  This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the U.S. president (Donald Trump) and the (Saudi) backward leaders who support terrorists. The fact that Islamic State has claimed responsibility proves that they were involved in the brutal attack,  a Guards statement said. Trump said in a statement that he prayed for the victims of the attacks but added that  states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.  The U.S. State Department and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres both condemned the attacks.

Dressed as Women Attackers dressed as women burst through parliament's main entrance, deputy interior minister Mohammad Hossein Zolfaghari said, according to the Tasnim news agency. One of them detonated a suicide vest, he said.  On a video released by the IS news agency Amaq a man purportedly inside the parliament says in Arabic:  Oh God, thank you. [Gunshots]. Do you think we will leave? No! We will remain, God willing.  Police helicopters circled over parliament, with snipers on its rooftop. Within five hours, four attackers were dead and the incident was over, Iranian media said.  I was inside the parliament when shooting happened. Everyone was shocked and scared. I saw two men shooting randomly,  said one journalist at the scene. Soon after the assault on parliament began, a bomber detonated a suicide vest near the shrine of the Islamic Republic's revered founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, a few kilometers south of the city, Zolfaghari said.  Members of Iranian forces take cover during an attack on the Iranian parliament in central Tehran, Iran, June 7, 2017. Tasnim News Agency/Handout via REUTERSA second attacker was shot dead, he said. The shrine is a main destination for tourists and religious pilgrims.  The terrorists had explosives strapped to them and suddenly started to shoot around,  said the shrine's overseer, Mohammadali Ansari. By late evening, deputy interior minister Zolfaghari put the death toll at 13, with 43 wounded. The Intelligence Ministry said security forces had arrested another  terrorist team  planning a third attack. The National Security Council's Seifollhai said Iran had foiled 58 similar attacks, without specifying a time period. Regional Animosity  The attacks follow several weeks of heightened rhetorical animosity between Riyadh and Tehran. Slideshow (23 Images)In unusually blunt remarks on May 2, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is Saudi defense minister and a son of King Salman, said he would protect his country from what he called Iranian efforts to dominate the Muslim world. Any struggle for influence between the Sunni Muslim kingdom and the revolutionary Shi'ite theocracy ought to take place  inside Iran, not in Saudi Arabia,  he said without elaborating.  The next day Iran accused Saudi Arabia of seeking tension in the region, saying the prince had made  destructive  comments and it was proof that Riyadh supported terrorism.   The attacks could also exacerbate tensions in Iran between newly re-elected President Hassan Rouhani, who positions himself as a reformer, and his rivals among hardline clergy and the Revolutionary Guards. But Rouhani said Iran would be more united and more determined in the fight against regional terrorism and violence.  We will prove once again that we will crush the enemies' plots with more unity and more strength,  he said. In an appeal for unity, Rouhani’s chief of staff, Hamid Aboutalebi, took to Twitter to praise the security services.  Applause to the power and firmness of our revolutionary guards, Basij (volunteer militia), police and security forces,  he wrote. However, two senior government officials, who asked not to be named, said the attacks might prompt a blame game.  They (hardliners) are very angry and will use every opportunity to grow in strength to isolate Rouhani,  said one. The other said the attacks would push Iran toward  a harsher regional policy . Militant attacks are rare in Tehran and other major cities although two Sunni militant groups, Jaish al-Adl and Jundallah, have been waging a deadly insurgency, mostly in remote areas, for almost a decade.    Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan province, in the southeast on the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to the Balouch minority and has long been a hotbed of Sunni insurgents fighting the Shi'ite-led republic. Last year Iranian authorities said they had foiled a plot by Sunni militants to bomb targets in Tehran and other cities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Sebastian Galiani, secretary for economic policy, said real spending so far this year has been slightly above last year's levels because public spending grew sharply in the fourth quarter of last year as the government invested heavily in public works and stimulus to help exit a  strong recession.   In the fourth quarter real inter-annual spending will be negative, not because anything special will be done in the fourth quarter but because spending was very high in the fourth quarter of last year,  Galiani said.  This year's spending is very regular, last year's spending was very irregular.  Since taking office in December 2015, center-right President Mauricio Macri has sought to close the fiscal deficit he inherited from free-spending populist Cristina Fernandez. The Treasury is targeting a fiscal deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and 3.2 percent of GDP next year. In the year through April, primary spending grew 36 percent in nominal terms, while revenues grew 40 percent. Most of that is explained by high inflation, which totaled 40.9 percent in 2016 and is seen exceeding 21 percent this year. Primary spending increased 1.8 percent in real terms - taking inflation into account - in the first four months of 2017 compared with the same period last year, J.P Morgan said in a May 29 note. Galiani added that the government would beat its quarterly fiscal goals for a cumulative fiscal deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP in the second quarter and 3.2 percent in the third quarter.

President Donald Trump's abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comey's dismissal.  The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign:  How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017.  What did the intelligence agencies find? The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome.  The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a  clear preference  for Trump to win the White House. Putin's associates hacked information, paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result.  Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election.  How many U.S. probes are there into Russia's election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow's role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump's campaign.  The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions.  In addition there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling.  What has Trump said about Russia's role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.   I will tell you this, Russia: if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,  Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clinton's use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted.  Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.  The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration.  As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,  Trump said, although he added:  It could have been others also.   Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials.  Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed.  The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?  he wrote on Twitter on May 8.  On May 30, Trump wrote on Twitter:  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.   Did the FBI probe continue after Comey's dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey's departure.  FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey's firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 tapped former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation.  Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on  Restoring Confidence in the FBI  that recommended Comey's dismissal.  Rosenstein's memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton's use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein's view was that Comey's decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch.  Trump called Comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation.  In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called  Showboat  to air as Comey testifies. The ad claims Comey was  consumed with election meddling  at the expense of fighting terrorism.  Was Comey's firing related to the FBI's Russia probe? Whether Comey believes his firing was linked to the FBI's Russia probe will likely be a main focus when he testifies on Thursday.  Trump asked Comey to end the agency's investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear  the cloud  hanging over his presidency, according to Comey's prepared testimony.  Comey found it  very concerning  that Trump would ask him to drop the agency's probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a  duty to correct  if that changed, according to the testimony.   I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump told Comey at a January 27 dinner, according to the testimony.  Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him  mildly nauseous  that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening, and then re-closing, the Clinton email probe days before the election.  Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office.  On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6.  Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel.  Is Trump himself under investigation? In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey confirmed in his written testimony that he told Trump that he was not personally under investigation.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, unveiling a 20-year policy review that had been in the works for months, said the armed forces budget would jump by 73 percent to C$32.7 billion ($24.2 billion) in 2026/27 from C$18.9 billion in 2016/17, with the biggest increases coming in later years. The Liberal government made the announcement a day after Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada would have to play a larger global role as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump retreated from multilateralism. Sajjan told reporters the policy would result in  a Canada that is strong at home, secure in North America and engaged in the world.  Canada and the United States are traditionally close allies but the relationship has become strained under Trump, who was elected on a promise to  put America first.  David Perry, defense analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said he was pleasantly surprised by the spending plans. The center-left Liberals have traditionally been skeptical about major military purchases.  They've promised ... to spend money on a lot of needed priorities, most of it on capital investments, which is where I think the real priorities were,  Perry said by phone.  Sajjan said the boost would take total defense expenditures to 1.4 percent of GDP by 2024/25 from 1.2 percent now. Other estimates put Canada's spending at closer to 1.0 percent. North Atlantic Treaty Organization members have committed  to spend 2 percent of GDP on the military, a target few meet.

Indeed, when in government, the Conservatives promised in 2008 to boost defense spending to C$30 billion by 2027/28 from C$18 billion in 2008/09. But by end of 2014/15, their last full year in power, the budget had only edged up to C$20.1 billion.

Between 1999 and 2014, high-income people had decreases in rates of high blood pressure, smoking and high risk for heart disease. The same wasn't true for low-income people, however.     An earlier study of risk factors for heart disease in the U.S. in 1971-2002 also found more of them among low-income people - but  that was 10 years ago,  lead author Dr. Ayodele Odutayo of the University of Oxford in the UK and St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto told Reuters Health.  So, it was quite dated and we didn’t have more modern information on this.  Odutayo and colleagues write in JAMA Cardiology that great strides have been made over the past two decades in reducing the number of people at risk for heart disease due to smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. It's unclear if everyone benefited equally from those improvements, though. For the new study, the researchers used data collected from 17,199 participants, ages 40 to 79, in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, there were no significant changes in risk factors for heart disease among people living below the federal poverty line. For example, the proportion of low-income people with a 20 percent or greater risk of heart disease was about 15 percent between 1999 and 2004, and 16.5 percent between 2011 and 2014. Also, the average systolic blood pressure (the top number) among low-income people was about 128 millimeters of mercury (mm/Hg) during the earlier part of the study, and that only fell to about 127 mm/Hg at the end. A healthy reading is less than 120 mm/Hg, according to the American Heart Association. There was also no significant change in the proportion of low-income people who smoked over the study period. High-income people did experience declines in all those measures, on the other hand. The proportion at high risk for heart disease decreased from 12 percent to 9.5 percent during the study period, for example. The average blood pressure dropped by nearly 4 mm/Hg, and the proportion of smokers fell by more than five percentage points. Rates of diabetes and cholesterol did not vary by income. Odutayo told Reuters Health that it will be important to look at data after 2014 to account for the increasing number of people gaining health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.  It would be interesting to see if there are any changes,  he said. The data shows that primary care and prevention is important for people with low incomes, he added.  It’s important that the insurance that people with lower income can obtain puts an emphasis on primary care medicine and preventive medicine,  said Odutayo.

A new U.S. study has concluded that the odds of having a child with a heart malformation are 1 in 100, but that’s not nearly as pronounced as earlier data had suggested. And only at the highest dose of 900 milligrams (mg) per day was the link to heart defects clear, researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Lithium was not significantly associated with cardiac malformations for daily doses lower than 900 mg,  the chief author of the new study Dr. Elisabetta Patorno of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters Health in an email. However, she said, the data also indicate that some increase in risk cannot be ruled out for daily doses lower than 900 mg. The fact that the risk is not as severe as previously thought  can actually be very reassuring for women, specifically for women who have bipolar disorder who need medication because pregnancy is a very high-risk time for a recurrent mood episode,  said Dr. Neha Hudepohl, medical director at the Center for Women’s Behavioral Health at Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.   The highest priority is for the woman to be healthy,  Hudepohl, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health.  That's what leads to healthy pregnancies, healthy delivery and healthy mother-child relationships.  In the analysis of 1.3 million pregnancies, the overall rate of heart malformation in the babies of women treated with lithium was 2.41 percent versus 1.15 percent for women not exposed to the drug, representing a relative risk increase of 65 percent for babies of mothers taking the drug. The rise in relative risk differed significantly depending on the dose of drug the mother was taking, however. When the daily dose was 600 mg or less, the risk increased by just 11 percent, which is too small to rule out the possibility it was due to chance. The risk jumped by 60 percent when the dose was between 600 and 900 mg. And with a dose above 900 mg, the chances of the heart defect more than tripled. The good news:  Original evidence showed a much stronger association  between the drug and heart problems,” Patorno said.  We're seeing a much more modest risk in cardiac effects.  In the 1970s, there was evidence that lithium produced a five-fold increase in heart defects for newborns and that the chance of developing a specific defect, known as Ebstein's anomaly, was 400 times greater. Ebstein's, which manifests as a reduction of blood flow to the lungs, can produce no symptoms or severe symptoms. The choice of whether to give lithium in reproductive-age women is complicated because some women respond very well to lithium and alternative drugs also carry risks, Patorno told Reuters Health.  Other mood stabilizers are potentially associated with other problems.  Thus, lithium is often a first choice for women with bipolar disorder who might become pregnant. Hudepohl said she tells women,  If we don't treat your symptoms, if you're actively depressed, or have bipolar disorder, or you're suicidal or manic, that is usually quite risky for the pregnancy. And it doesn't just have an emotional and psychological impact. It has a real physical impact on the pregnancy as well. We know there are higher rates of miscarriage, preterm labor, more babies born small for gestational age, and higher rates of C-section. There can be quite significant medical complications.  Nonetheless, some women stop taking lithium on their own or have an abortion if they discover they're pregnant out of fear that it might cause birth defects. The abortion rate is 5 percent to 10 percent higher among women who take lithium than in the general population, she noted.  They just sort of assume that it's too risky to continue,  Hudepohl said.  And low and behold, their symptoms worsen, they become depressed or manic or anxious, and they get sick very quickly. Then we have to fight very hard to stabilize them and get them healthy again.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed what is known as Senate Bill 8 into law on Tuesday and it takes effect from Sept. 1. It also includes a ban on the most common method of second-trimester abortion. Texas is the most-populous Republican-controlled state. Its abortion restrictions have often been fiercely defended by the state's lawyers and copied by other socially conservative states.  Texas legislation on abortion is typically amplified because the state can be a beacon for restrictions nationwide,  said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. The anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, praised Abbott and the legislation, calling it the  most significant pro-life victory  of the regular legislative session.     Texas crafted a regulation on fetal tissue disposal last year after it suffered a stinging defeat in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court struck down separate abortion restrictions, which were backed by the state's Republican leaders, regarding doctors and facilities. The Texas fetal tissue regulations were more stringent than regulations in almost every other state, which typically allow aborted fetal tissue to be disposed of in a similar manner as other human tissue, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In January, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin put a temporary halt on the fetal tissue disposal regulation, saying the Texas rule imposed  undue burdens on a woman's right to seek a previability abortion.  After that, the Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill that included the regulation on fetal tissue disposal, with many party leaders saying the measure was necessary to preserve human dignity. Abortion rights providers have said the regulation would require the tissue to be treated differently than other human tissue, add another stigma to abortion and increase costs.

U.S. crude prices fell more than 5 percent to $45.75 a barrel after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in inventories of crude and gasoline.  It sheds light on the challenge that the oil markets are facing. OPEC can cut, but it is having very little impact on the overall price as the U.S. is offsetting production cuts out of the Middle East with production increases of its own,  Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife, said in a telephone interview. Some of the biggest weights on the index were Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, which fell 2.7 percent to C$38.54 and Suncor Energy Inc, which was down 2.6 percent at C$41.14. The overall energy group slumped to its lowest since June 27, down 3.4 percent. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.5 percent. Gold prices fell from near seven-month highs on a stronger dollar and after prepared testimony by former FBI Director James Comey - released on Wednesday in advance of his Thursday appearance before a U.S. Senate committee - was seen as containing few surprises. But declines were limited as uncertainty from Thursday's election in Britain remained. If stocks decline on Comey's testimony on Thursday, there could be a buying opportunity, Petursson said.  When we look ahead into Q2 and Q3 earnings growth, they look very robust,  he added. Telecommunication shares lost 1.4 percent. Still, the group has rallied more than 13 percent since mid-November. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed down 92.42 points, or 0.6 percent, at 15,372.14. Eight of the index's 10 main groups ended lower. The financial services group was one of only two of the index's 10 main groups to end higher. It rose 0.3 percent, helped by a 3.6 percent gain for Sun Life Financial Inc to C$45.42 after RBC raised its rating on the stock to outperform from sector perform. Canadian dollar-store operator Dollarama Inc reported a better-than-expected profit for the eighth straight quarter, as customers on average spent more at its stores, sending shares to an all-time high. Its shares rose 0.8 percent to C$129.02. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; editing by Grant McCool and Jonathan Oatis)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-stocks-idUSL1N1J41VJ"},

Crude stocks in the United States grew 3.3 million barrels to 513 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That confounded forecasters who had predicted a drop of 3.5 million barrels, especially a day after data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated an even bigger fall. Gasoline inventories also unexpectedly rose, imports increased, and exports dropped, the EIA data showed.  “These figures spell a setback to the joint effort by OPEC and some non-OPEC countries to curb their output,  said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.  However, without persistent drawdowns in U.S. oil stockpiles, the process could be painfully slow.” U.S. crude futures settled down 5 percent, or $2.47 a barrel, at $45.72 a barrel, the lowest settlement for U.S. crude since May 4. U.S. benchmark futures CLc1 have slid more than 11 percent in 10 days of trading.  Brent crude prices LCOc1 fell $2.06, or 4 percent to settle at $48.06 a barrel. Official settlement prices were delayed due to a technical issue, according to a Nymex spokesperson. A worker at an oil field owned by Bashneft, Bashkortostan, Russia, January 28, 2015.Sergei Karpukhin/File PhotoGasoline futures 1RBc1 tumbled 4 percent to $1.4921 a gallon, lowest since May 10, as rising inventories fed worries about weak demand. Overall gasoline demand is down 0.7 percent for the past four weeks from a year ago, the EIA said.  Flagging gasoline demand continues to bedevil the market. With gasoline currently the seasonal leader of the complex, its weakness is dragging everything down,  said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Some in the market remained concerned about the move by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, an OPEC member that had agreed to cut about 30,000 barrels a day as part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to reduce output. Some analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some were concerned about rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement. OPEC and other producers including Russia have pledged to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) lifted force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil, bringing all the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell sharply after the U.S. government reported an unexpected rise in crude and gasoline inventories, which added to concerns that efforts to cut output by the world's biggest oil producers have not made enough impact.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 5.1 percent to $45.74 a barrel, while Brent crude         lost 4.0 percent to $48.11.           Lower crude prices are impacting Canada's potential terms of trade ... and lowering the likelihood of a big bump in capex investment in the energy complex in Canada over the coming six to 12 months,  said Karl Schamotta, director global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.      This is turning investors slightly bearish on Canada's prospects, particularly considering that we have softness percolating across the real estate markets here.      At 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3512 to the greenback, or 74.01 U.S. cents, down 0.4 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3525, while it touched its strongest since May 29 at C$1.3427.     The loonie hit a one-week high earlier in the session as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast that Canada's economy will grow 2.8 percent this year after a 1.4 percent expansion in 2016.                   At the same time, traders are generally nervous about the triple threat that we have coming tomorrow,  said Schamotta.     The three key events that could drive market direction are a European Central Bank meeting, a parliamentary election in the UK and testimony by former U.S. FBI Director James Comey to a Senate committee on Thursday.     The Bank of Canada's review of developments in the financial system is also due on Thursday, followed by a news conference with Governor Stephen Poloz. Investors will weigh Poloz's assessment of the housing and mortgage markets in light of recent troubles at non-bank lender Home Capital.     The price of longer term Canadian government bonds were mostly lower across the yield curve. The two-year            price dipped half a Canadian cent to yield 0.715 percent and the 10-year             declined 14 Canadian cents to yield 1.410 percent.

The department in a statement said it had withdrawn a 2016 interpretation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that expanded the circumstances under which a business could be held liable for wage-law violations by staffing agencies, contractors, and franchisees. Previously, companies were considered joint employers when they hired and fired workers and set wages. The Obama administration said a worker's level of  economic dependence  on a company should also be considered. The expanded definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would draw companies into lawsuits when they were not responsible for setting working conditions.  Also on Wednesday, the department withdrew 2015 guidance that said that under the same law, many workers are improperly treated as independent contractors when they are actually employees, which would make them eligible for minimum wage, overtime, and other legal protections.  Guidance issued by federal agencies is not legally binding, but serves as a blueprint for how agencies will enforce federal laws. A shift in enforcement priorities at the Department of Labor had been widely expected since President Donald Trump, a Republican and wealthy businessman from New York, took office.  Business groups have said the department's guidance on employment and worker classification was misguided and affected nearly every U.S. industry, and they praised the agency's changes on Wednesday.  Diligent employers work hard to be compliant with the FLSA and these (department) interpretations were merely enforcement traps waiting to spring,  Randy Johnson, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Unions and workers' rights groups said they were troubled by the labor department's decision.  This was guidance that made it easier for employers, workers, unions and others to know about their rights and obligations under the law,  Lynn Rhinehart, general counsel for the AFL-CIO, said in a statement. The withdrawal of the guidance does not affect a separate expansion of the definition of joint employment by the National Labor Relations Board, which is under review by a federal appeals court. The NLRB's standard has had more of an impact than the labor department's because it is legally binding and requires joint employers to bargain with unions.

In other words, nice theory but shame about the monkey who is running it. Modern Portfolio Theory, originated by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is the idea that portfolios, by diversifying, can maximize returns for a given level of risk, or volatility. This allows investors to get a higher return than they otherwise would since the assets blended together will give a smoother ride, achieving what is often called 'the only free lunch in investing'. Since different assets perform differently in various circumstances -  i.e. are not perfectly correlated  - mixing them together improves results. The problem isn’t with the theory, which won Markowitz the Nobel prize in 1960, but, according to money managers at Newfound Investment Research, with the way it fails to take into account the impact that behavioral flaws and biases can have on how an investor actually does. In MPT, volatility, how much and how quickly an asset goes up and down in price, is used to measure risk. As shown repeatedly in times of crisis and stress, however, different asset classes have a nasty tendency to become more correlated, to all go down together, at the worst possible time. This increases the chances that an investor will lose nerve and bail out during extreme market conditions, turning what might be a passing downdraft into a permanent loss. “We often say that risk cannot be destroyed, only transformed. Beyond the 'free lunch' of traditional diversification, most reductions in one type of risk come with increases in other types of risk.

A slavish devotion to maximizing return for risk can put an investor into a portfolio she can’t tolerate, leading to either selling at the wrong time or getting greedy and buying at the wrong time. In some ways, all of this simply argues for process and for advice. Part of the value in having a process is not that it is perfect and always achieves best results but that it can guard against the worst mistakes. And while that process can certainly be run by a solitary investor, given the right skills, another message here is that a good deal of the value of wealth managers is serving as a guard rail against sudden lurches one way or another. Low-cost off-the-shelf portfolios work well in theory but are followed less often, perhaps, than ones which also have a hand-holding advisor involved. (James Saft is a Reuters columnist.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed what is known as Senate Bill 8 into law on Tuesday and it takes effect from Sept. 1. It also includes a ban on the most common method of second-trimester abortion. Texas is the most-populous Republican-controlled state. Its abortion restrictions have often been fiercely defended by the state's lawyers and copied by other socially conservative states.  Texas legislation on abortion is typically amplified because the state can be a beacon for restrictions nationwide,  said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. The anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, praised Abbott and the legislation, calling it the  most significant pro-life victory  of the regular legislative session.     Texas crafted a regulation on fetal tissue disposal last year after it suffered a stinging defeat in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court struck down separate abortion restrictions, which were backed by the state's Republican leaders, regarding doctors and facilities. The Texas fetal tissue regulations were more stringent than regulations in almost every other state, which typically allow aborted fetal tissue to be disposed of in a similar manner as other human tissue, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In January, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin put a temporary halt on the fetal tissue disposal regulation, saying the Texas rule imposed  undue burdens on a woman's right to seek a previability abortion.  After that, the Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill that included the regulation on fetal tissue disposal, with many party leaders saying the measure was necessary to preserve human dignity. Abortion rights providers have said the regulation would require the tissue to be treated differently than other human tissue, add another stigma to abortion and increase costs.

In other words, nice theory but shame about the monkey who is running it. Modern Portfolio Theory, originated by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is the idea that portfolios, by diversifying, can maximize returns for a given level of risk, or volatility. This allows investors to get a higher return than they otherwise would since the assets blended together will give a smoother ride, achieving what is often called 'the only free lunch in investing'. Since different assets perform differently in various circumstances -  i.e. are not perfectly correlated  - mixing them together improves results. The problem isn’t with the theory, which won Markowitz the Nobel prize in 1960, but, according to money managers at Newfound Investment Research, with the way it fails to take into account the impact that behavioral flaws and biases can have on how an investor actually does. In MPT, volatility, how much and how quickly an asset goes up and down in price, is used to measure risk. As shown repeatedly in times of crisis and stress, however, different asset classes have a nasty tendency to become more correlated, to all go down together, at the worst possible time. This increases the chances that an investor will lose nerve and bail out during extreme market conditions, turning what might be a passing downdraft into a permanent loss. “We often say that risk cannot be destroyed, only transformed. Beyond the 'free lunch' of traditional diversification, most reductions in one type of risk come with increases in other types of risk. For example, holding a higher cash allocation will reduce volatility but will lead to more inflation risk,” Corey Hoffstein, Justin Sibears and Nathan Faber of Newfound write in a study. (here) “A significant amount of effort can go into providing an investor with an optimal portfolio under the MPT framework, only to see it discarded before the end goal has a chance of being realized.

Our air traffic organization must be more nimble,  U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told the Senate Commerce Committee.  A bulky federal government procurement apparatus does not move fast enough to keep pace with new technologies and new demands.  President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled the plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the aegis of a nonprofit entity. Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said on Wednesday that small airports in his state oppose the plan. He said that after air traffic privatization in the United Kingdom airline passenger fees rose 30 percent.  This is a tough sell,  Wicker said. Senator Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said he remains  skeptical  of the idea of removing Congress from air traffic control oversight and handing it to a 13-member board. The administration says it would not charge the private entity for the government's air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, opposes the proposal.  Why give away billions of dollars in government assets to an entity that will be governed in large part by the airlines?  he asked. Nelson argued  a fundamental breakup of the FAA cannot advance when there are such strong divisions among aviation stakeholders and in Congress. It just won't happen.  Chao denied that the major airlines would control the board and said they would have just two seats on the board. She also pledged to address rural concerns. One big issue is whether general aviation could face higher costs and access to airspace if a private board takes over. Executives from United Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines Inc, American Airlines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, all represented by the Airlines for America lobbying group, praised the Trump plan on Monday. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-aviation-idUSL1N1J41VV"},

The session, set to start on Monday, will seek stricter regulations on abortion clinics, including requiring annual inspections and that clinics adopt plans for potential medical complications, Governor Eric Greitens said in a statement. That came in response to a federal judge's ruling in April that blocked requirements for clinics to meet standards for surgical centers and for doctors to have hospital privileges. Greitens said he also wants to target an ordinance approved by St. Louis aldermen in February banning employers and landlords from discriminating against women who have had an abortion, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. The Missouri legislative session ended in May without approving a proposal to nullify the ordinance, which critics said would force groups that oppose abortion to sanction it and could threaten the work of anti-abortion pregnancy resource centers.  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis in late May sued to overturn the ordinance.

During budget and nomination hearings, senators have pressed current and prospective officials about a Justice Department legal opinion dated May 1. The opinion said information requests to executive agencies from senior Democrats on congressional committees, called ranking members,  do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings.  The opinion, largely unprecedented, says agencies are required to give information to only committee chairs, positions held by members of the majority party in Congress. Currently, Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Most lawmakers first learned about the guidance in media reports last month. Now, they say agencies under President Donald Trump are becoming less responsive to them, making it harder to check whether the executive branch is correctly carrying out laws, as required by the constitution. Some Republicans also have questioned allowing agencies to ignore requests from Congress. Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat who is ranking member of the governmental affairs committee that looks into waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, grew enraged on Wednesday when a nominee for the White House's budget office would not commit to respond, without reservation, to her inquiries.  The nominee for Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director, Russell Vought, said that if he is confirmed for the post his responses to her would be  subject to the discretion of the director and advice of legal counsel.  He added that he was  merely reflecting the administration's policy.  Calling the legal guidance  hogwash,  McCaskill cast withholding information from her as the administration's attempt to hide problems and wrongdoing.  Welcome to the Big Leagues, administration. This is what happens, you get oversight,  she said, adding she has had a  few problems  with receiving information but not to the extent of other Democrats. A Republican on the committee, Ohio's Rob Portman, said that when he headed the budget office under former President George W. Bush, he found dealing with Congress was often frustrating.  But I felt it was my responsibility to provide information,  he said, adding he hoped Vought would do so if confirmed for the job.

Price swings for corn , soybeans  and wheat futures  following the release of the government's biggest agriculture reports, which provide a window into global demand as well as production, have fallen sharply this year. The depressed volatility on what have typically been the most active trading days of the month is weighing on the bottom line of even the biggest traders such as Bunge Ltd and Archer Daniels Midland Co. The massive grain handlers, who use the futures market both to hedge their physical purchases as well as trade it for profits, have cited slow market action as one of the reasons for weakening profitability at their operations.   If you are only moving ... 5 cents off of those reports, you cannot expect to buy or sell the market and try and make 7 cents,  said Tom Burnham, trade strategist at INTL FCStone.  In general, traders prefer more volatility and more surprises.  The price swings that come after the government's monthly supply and demand reports, acreage estimates and quarterly stocks views are down 26.88 percent from 2016, according to an analysis of Reuters data. The daily moves on report days in 2017 are 45.83 percent below the average of the previous 10 years. In 2017, corn, soybean and wheat futures have averaged just a 1.17 percent price move on major report days. That compares with an average move of 2.16 percent on report days during the previous 10 years. In 2016, the average move was 1.60 percent. USDA will release its next supply and demand report on Friday at 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT). Supplies Insulate Market  Bumper crops around the world have muted the impact of the monthly reports from the government, which used to frequently spark limit moves within minutes of their release time.  The surprises are not big enough to move the markets a long way,  said Randy Fortenbery, professor and chair of small grains economics at Washington State University.  The bigger the stocks are, the bigger surprise it takes to move the market in one direction or another.  In the past, post-report rallies provided an opportunity for farmers to lock in prices that would guarantee they booked a profit for crops they had yet to seed or grains that they had been holding in storage. So far this year, U.S. farmers who have been keeping massive crops in storage bins have seen the biggest rally following a report top out at 7-1/2 cents for corn and 25 cents for soybeans. The daily limits are 25 cents and 70 cents, respectively. The small moves have been keeping some traders away from the futures market altogether. On the day the USDA released its May supply and demand report, which gives the government's first estimate of new-crop usage and production, the volume for the most-active soybean contract was only 29.8 percent above the average for the whole month of May. A year earlier, soybean volume on the day of the May report was 90.9 percent above the May average. For wheat, volume for the most-active contract was 15.0 percent above the monthly average, compared with 26.9 percent higher in 2016. Corn volume was 45.0 percent higher than the May average, comparable to 46.5 percent in 2016.

Third seed Wawrinka outclassed Marin Cilic 6-3 6-3 6-1 in the quarter-finals on Wednesday and next opponent Andy Murray should be rightly concerned, according to the Swede who describes Wawrinka's run so far here as 'scary'.  He can win it,  Wilander, in Paris as a presenter of Eurosport's daily flagship show 'Game, Set and Mats', said.  Not many players can 'win' a grand slam like Stan, they can prevent losing it by wearing the other guy down, but he can go out there and win it off his racket.  Despite having as many grand slam titles as Murray (three), Wawrinka is often positioned just below the so-called 'Big Four' of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Murray when it comes to making predictions for majors. But Wilander does not really buy into that, especially when grand slams reach the second week. Wawrinka has won all 15 sets he has played here so far, knocking over dangerous opponents like Fabio Fognini, Gael Monfils and Cilic without any alarms.

He is playing great tennis. Very aggressive, but controlled,  Wilander said.  He blew the seventh seed off court. That's some seriously good tennis.  Wawrinka in these majors, he is as big a favourite as Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray these days, no difference between the five of them.  Second week of the slams he is part of the big four, big five. Actually of the guys left, Nadal might be a little less scared of Murray who plays a more controlled game.  Wawrinka and (Dominic) Thiem are wild, they can be scary for sure. Nadal hasn't won this yet.  While Nadal has only dropped 22 games in reaching the semi-finals -- better than when he was in his pomp in 2008 -- Wilander thinks the fact that it is three years since the Spaniard lifted the trophy could add some pressure.  He maybe has a little more to lose,  Wilander said of the 31-year-old chasing an unprecedented 10th French Open.  His confidence is high but he won't be looking too far ahead. He will be the first to say you have to hold on for a long time to win this thing.

Calif. federal judges are opting for lodestar awards in megacases","keywords":"United States,Charles Breyer,Hagen Berman,Lucy Koh,Steven Berman,William Alsup,US,OTC,LODESTAR","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - It’s always notable when a federal judge presiding over a big class action slashes a fee request by millions of dollars - but I think there’s another story lurking beneath the dollar signs in an opinion issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh of San Jose.  Three plaintiffs' firms that obtained nearly $170 million for artists and engineers whose job prospects suffered under an alleged no-poaching agreement among animation studios asked Judge Koh to award them $31.5 million for squeezing a $150 million settlement from Disney and Dreamworks. The judge instead granted them $13.8 million. She previously awarded $4.7 million in fees for a smaller classwide settlement, bringing the total fees for plaintiffs' lawyers from Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Susman Godfrey to about $18.5 million.  Notably, Judge Koh’s award was based not on the recovery the firms won for class members but on their hourly billings. The firms wanted the judge to grant them 21 percent of the class recovery, which, they argued, is less than the 25 percent benchmark established by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Judge Koh, however, applied the alternative lodestar approach.  The plaintiffs' firms, she said, billed $9.3 million in the animation case, and deserve double that lodestar because of the risk they bore and the results they obtained. That’s how Judge Koh arrived at a total fee award of about $18.5 million.  Lodestar fee awards in class actions, as you probably know, are an exception. For several decades, most judges have defaulted to the alternative method of calculating plaintiffs’ lawyers’ fees as a percentage of the common fund for class members. The California Supreme Court, in a 2016 ruling that confirmed courts in the state can use the percentage method to calculate fees, spelled out that method’s advantages: “relative ease of calculation, alignment of incentives between counsel and the class, a better approximation of market conditions in a contingency case and the encouragement it provides counsel to seek an early settlement and avoid unnecessarily prolonging the litigation.”  But the state high court and the 9th Circuit also permit judges to use the lodestar method. Judge Koh, for instance, awarded lodestar-based fees in a previous no-poaching class action. Another California federal judge, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, used the lodestar method to calculate fees in a $200 million class action against Wells Fargo in 2015.  And, most dramatically, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco opted for a lodestar fee award in the dealer wing of the clean diesel litigation against Volkswagen. Plaintiffs’ lawyers in that case had asked for $28.6 million, which was a tiny percentage – 2.4 percent - of the dealers’ billion-dollar recovery. Judge Breyer, however, said fees based on the recovery “would overcompensate” class counsel. He awarded about $3 million, double the plaintiffs’ lodestar billings of $1.5 million.  If you’re counting, that’s three highly regarded California federal judges in four recent outsized class actions who have concluded that it makes more sense to base fees on the hours plaintiffs’ lawyers worked instead of the results they obtained. Are we seeing the beginning of a pendulum swing away from percentage-based fee awards in mega class actions?  I emailed plaintiffs’ lawyers in the animation case to ask. Steven Berman of Hagen Berman – who was also class counsel in the VW dealers’ case in which Judge Breyer granted only $3 million of the requested $28.6 million in fees – said in an email that he still doesn’t think lodestar-based fees will make a comeback.  “These were cases where judges thought the risk was reduced such that a percentage yielded a windfall,” Berman’s email said, suggesting that unique facts, not overarching policy, led Judges Koh and Breyer to use lodestar calculations.  Berman, for one, isn’t hoping for a broad return of lodestar fee awards. “The effect of these rulings,” he said, is to encourage lawyers “to bill like crazy” and to discourage them from taking risky cases.  I agree with him on both points, but I also suspect the recent cluster of lodestar fee awards is more than a coincidence. Windfall has become a judicial dirty word. If plaintiffs’ lawyers are smart, they’ll start adjusting fee requests accordingly.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-lodestar-idUSKBN18Y31X"},

Trump named Clark on Wednesday to be Assistant Attorney General for environment at the Department of Justice, representing the U.S. government on environmental regulation and enforcement issues. Clark, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, represented BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture that killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history. The accident polluted large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses. Along the U.S. Gulf coast, local communities are still grappling with cleanup and restoration, and had relied on the federal government and EPA to protect them against climate change and oil and gas company accidents, said Cynthia Sarthou, director of the Gulf Restoration Network in Louisiana.  I think the enforcement of any pollution laws is going to be at risk right now,  Sarthou said.  Bossert (Clark) is unlikely to hold the oil and gas industry accountable for pollution.  Sarthou added that most of the oil and gas infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf coast is aging, putting local environmental groups on alert for future accidents.  While this administration continues to choose profits over people, South Louisiana residents continue to struggle to recover from the economic, health and environmental impacts of the BP oil drilling disaster,  said Colette Pichon Battle, of the Human Rights Network, a lawyer who represented local communities affected by the BP accident. According to a White House statement, Clark is a  complex trial and appellate litigator with especially deep experience in administrative law.   In addition to practicing law in private practice, he also served worked as deputy assistant attorney general for environment at the Justice department from 2001 to 2005. As an attorney, Clark also represented industry groups in several challenges against the previous administration's Environmental Protection Agency. This includes a lawsuit to revoke the  endangerment finding,  the scientific finding that gives the agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and one to challenge California's ability to set its own stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles.   Clark was not available for comment.   Reporting By Valerie Volcovici","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climatechange-enforcement-idUSKBN18Y31P"},

An investigation of the attack on a building in Al-Jina village identified only one person who might have been a civilian who was wounded or possibly killed, Army Brigadier General Paul Bontrager, deputy director for operations for U.S. Central Command, told a Pentagon briefing by telephone. He said the strike, in which aircraft dropped 10 bombs on the building and fired two missiles at targets fleeing the site, was believed to have killed about two dozen men attending an al Qaeda meeting at a madrassa, or religious school, under construction.   We considered media reports that indicated a large number of civilians were killed, but our investigation did not uncover evidence to support those claims,  said Bontrager, adding that investigators were unable to visit the scene or talk to anybody who was on the ground at the time. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, had said at least 49 people were killed and dozens wounded in an attack that hit a mosque with worshippers.

That assessment said the strike hit the Omar Ibn al-Khatab mosque where about 300 people had gathered for evening prayers. It said at least 38 people were killed in the strike. Responding to the Pentagon's investigation on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch issued a statement saying it had found no evidence to support the military's claim the building was being used by al Qaeda militants. HRW Washington Director Sarah Margon said in a statement the group spoke to people who were present at the mosque who denied any al Qaeda members were there. She noted that Syria Civil Defense recovered 38 bodies and relatives identified 28, including the mosque's imam and his wife. She said HRW independently confirmed 10 of those names in interviews with local residents and medical personnel. Bontrager said his investigation concluded the strike hit a religious school under construction. He said a mosque across the street was not damaged.

Comey, who was fired by Trump last month, wrote that U.S. President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But the details of Comey's testimony, expected to be delivered Thursday to a Senate Committee, appeared to be priced into the stock market. Investors were concerned that any additional revelation could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  They were hoping that there wasn’t going to be anything in there that was more inflammatory,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions.  The testimony wasn’t as disastrous as it could have been,  he said of the prepared remarks, adding that the market was relieved no damaging details emerged and his testimony  more than likely isn’t going to blow up into some big fiasco, another thing that the president has to deal with.  [For Comey's full statement, see: bit.ly/JCJune8] Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermidCosta cautioned that the market's reaction to Comey's remarks was not a particularly big move up and volume was light. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 37.46 points, or 0.18 percent, to 21,173.69, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 3.81 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,433.14 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 22.32 points, or 0.36 percent, to 6,297.38.     Wall Street was weighed by a near 2-percent drop in the S&P; 500's energy sector .SPNY. All but two of the 34 components of the sector fell as U.S. crude futures CLc1 tumbled 5 percent due to an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories. Brent crude LCOc1 fell nearly 4 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Signet Jewelers (SIG.N), which rose 4 percent, while the largest decliner was Newfield Exploration (NFX.N), down 7 percent. Investors are also keeping an eye on Britain's general election and the European Central Bank's policy meeting, both on Thursday.     Opinion polls have shown Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government. The election comes as Britain maps its exit from the European Union following a referendum on the subject last year. The ECB is expected to reiterate its plan to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy at least until the end of the year. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

A smoothly executed rescue of Spain's Banco Popular lifted bank stocks in Europe, while oil prices suffered a steep slide after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in crude and gasoline inventories.

I expect loyalty.  Comey is to testify before Senators on Thursday. Treasury prices slid after his comments were released, sending benchmark 30-, 10- and 2-year yields US30YT=RR US10YT=RR US2YT=RR to session highs.   The market was pricing in a much worse news flow from the Comey testimony than what we saw,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.  But it's one risk out of the way, and now the market is looking at the ECB meeting and the UK election,  he added. Comey's Senate appearance, Britain's national election and the ECB meeting are what ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said had been dubbed 'Triple Threat Thursday,' which he said could be  an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride.  The lead of British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party over the opposition Labour Party has halved to five percentage points, according to a Kantar poll published on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: People walk through the lobby of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 25, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File photoThe euro EUR= turned shaky after reports suggested the ECB would lower its inflation targets. It was last down 0.11 percent to $1.1260.  Maybe tomorrow's ECB meeting sees nothing but platitudes and disappoints a market that is getting ahead of itself,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes.  But (for us) that would be a huge euro buying opportunity, because ECB normalization is coming. And when it does, the euro simply won't be able to sustain undervalued levels for long.

The success of the process pushed shares in many major banks higher, supporting a recovery for Madrid's stock market .IBEX that lost steam later in the day.  The market has taken Banco Popular as positive news because essentially this is not a bankruptcy but a sort of rescue, even if its subordinated bondholders have been sharply hit,  said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan.

Price swings for corn , soybeans  and wheat futures  following the release of the government's biggest agriculture reports, which provide a window into global demand as well as production, have fallen sharply this year. The depressed volatility on what have typically been the most active trading days of the month is weighing on the bottom line of even the biggest traders such as Bunge Ltd and Archer Daniels Midland Co. The massive grain handlers, who use the futures market both to hedge their physical purchases as well as trade it for profits, have cited slow market action as one of the reasons for weakening profitability at their operations.   If you are only moving ... 5 cents off of those reports, you cannot expect to buy or sell the market and try and make 7 cents,  said Tom Burnham, trade strategist at INTL FCStone.  In general, traders prefer more volatility and more surprises.  The price swings that come after the government's monthly supply and demand reports, acreage estimates and quarterly stocks views are down 26.88 percent from 2016, according to an analysis of Reuters data. The daily moves on report days in 2017 are 45.83 percent below the average of the previous 10 years. In 2017, corn, soybean and wheat futures have averaged just a 1.17 percent price move on major report days. That compares with an average move of 2.16 percent on report days during the previous 10 years. In 2016, the average move was 1.60 percent. USDA will release its next supply and demand report on Friday at 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT). Supplies Insulate Market  Bumper crops around the world have muted the impact of the monthly reports from the government, which used to frequently spark limit moves within minutes of their release time.  The surprises are not big enough to move the markets a long way,  said Randy Fortenbery, professor and chair of small grains economics at Washington State University.  The bigger the stocks are, the bigger surprise it takes to move the market in one direction or another.  In the past, post-report rallies provided an opportunity for farmers to lock in prices that would guarantee they booked a profit for crops they had yet to seed or grains that they had been holding in storage. So far this year, U.S. farmers who have been keeping massive crops in storage bins have seen the biggest rally following a report top out at 7-1/2 cents for corn and 25 cents for soybeans. The daily limits are 25 cents and 70 cents, respectively. The small moves have been keeping some traders away from the futures market altogether. On the day the USDA released its May supply and demand report, which gives the government's first estimate of new-crop usage and production, the volume for the most-active soybean contract was only 29.8 percent above the average for the whole month of May. A year earlier, soybean volume on the day of the May report was 90.9 percent above the May average. For wheat, volume for the most-active contract was 15.0 percent above the monthly average, compared with 26.9 percent higher in 2016. Corn volume was 45.0 percent higher than the May average, comparable to 46.5 percent in 2016.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has withdrawn Corning's ratings for commercial reasons. Fitch reserves the right in its sole discretion to withdraw or maintain any rating at any time for any reason it deems sufficient. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'BBB+' Long-Term IDR reflects: Technology & Market Leadership: Fitch believes Corning's significant cumulative investments in research, development and engineering (RD&E;) and capital spending have resulted in technology and share leadership across large and growing markets, including liquid crystal display (LCD) glass, optical fiber for telecommunications, and ceramic filters for automotive applications. More Aggressive Capital Returns: Fitch expects continued aggressive capital returns, consistent with Corning's strategic framework and decision to adjust financial policies to be more in-line with a 'BBB+' rating. Fitch assumes the company will use its FCF primarily for share repurchases and acquisitions, to a lesser extent, potentially resulting in higher total leverage since the majority of Corning's cash flow is offshore. Significant Investment Requirements: Fitch expects the company's investment-intensity will remain significant to support growth initiatives. Although Corning's focus leverages three key technologies (glass science, optical physics and ceramic science), RD&E; and capex should continue representing 7%-8% and mid-teens as a percentage of revenue, respectively. The company has significant opportunities for long-term growth for Gorilla Glass from higher automotive penetration (beyond displays to windshields and doors) and continues engineering manufacturing processes to offset annual price declines in LCD glass. Solid Pre-Dividend FCF Profile: Fitch expects Corning's pre-dividend FCF profile will remain solid over the longer-term, supporting still meaningful capital spending despite Corning's ongoing expectations for reducing capital intensity. While capex will remain significant, capital requirements for fiber and filters manufacturing are lower than that for LCD glass markets potentially bolstering FCF further over time. In addition, the company is rebuilding its LCD tanks, which will result in elevated near-term capex. However, capital intensity for the LCD business continues to decline, given spending is on additional capacity, efficiency and maintenance, rather than retooling for ever larger production sizes. DERIVATION SUMMARY Corning's ratings reflect its technology and market leadership supported by meaningful barriers to entry offset to a degree by its shift to more aggressive shareholder capital returns. More highly rated peers have more conservative financial policies, greater diversification and are less exposed to adverse sectoral trends and cyclicality. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Organic sales growth in the low single-digits augmented by acquisitions focused in growth segments; --Operating EBITDA margins of approximately 32% declining to 30% with continued diversification to non-display businesses; --Acquisition spending of $1 billion in aggregate and $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in annual capex over the rating horizon; --Approximately $2 billion in aggregate common dividends and $6.5 billion in aggregate share repurchases; --Annual FCF of $600 million rising to $900 million over the ratings horizon and incremental aggregate debt issuance of approximately $4 billion to fund post-dividend shareholder capital return and acquisitions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating withdrawals. LIQUIDITY As of March 31, 2017, Corning's liquidity was adequate supported by $4.8 billion in cash ($3.2 billion held abroad), an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility expiring in September 2019 (the facility includes a maximum 50% debt to total capital financial covenant; at March 21, 2017 debt to total capital was approximately 18%), which also supports the company's $2 billion commercial paper program (the company did not have outstanding commercial paper at March 31, 2017), as well as Fitch's expectation for FCF of $600 million to $900 million annually. Total debt as of March 31st, 2017 was $5.066 billion (including the unrated $1.15 billion of convertible preferred stock after applying 50% equity credit to $2.3 billion convertible preferred stock. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed and withdrawn the following ratings: Corning Incorporated --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured revolver 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

The province's left-leaning New Democratic Party and Greens have joined forces to unseat the Liberals, who lost their legislative majority in a knife-edge election on May 9. The NDP-Greens hold 44 seats and the Liberals, who are not related to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals, 43.  The NDP-Greens have vowed to block Kinder Morgan Inc's C$7.4 billion ($5.48 billion) oil pipeline expansion in the province - setting up a conflict with Trudeau's government and the neighboring oil-producing province of Alberta - and send the C$8.8 billion Site C dam project for review.  The new parliament's first task will be to elect a speaker, a thorny issue as neither side wants to give up an elected seat to take on the role. The speaker is traditionally a neutral referee presiding over parliamentary debates who ensures that rules and procedures are followed. After the speaker election,  the government will seek to determine if it continues to enjoy the confidence of the house,  government house leader Michael de Jong said in a statement.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that settlement payments must be directed to victims impacted by the defendants' actions and then to the federal government.  The change could impact banks and other corporations, and marks the latest action by the Republican Trump administration to end policies from the previous Democratic Obama administration. Such agreements were a feature of several U.S. settlements with banks following the 2008 financial crisis. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aimed to hold banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. From 2013 to 2016, the department reached $46 billion in settlements with U.S. banks that in part directed funds to approved housing aid and other related groups. In Obama's final weeks in office, the department sued Barclays PLC (BARC.L) over similar claims.  In recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes required or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement,  Sessions said a statement.  We are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct.  The change could impact banks still under federal investigation over mortgage issues such as Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S), Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.L), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) and HSBC (HSBA.L). Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached.     Sessions, in a one-page memo dated Monday, told the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys they could not make any agreements in civil or criminal cases  that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.  Sessions’ new policy  is ill-advised and ignores the tens of thousands of families who were helped by housing service providers across the country in the wake of the financial crisis,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman was co-chair of a working group that investigated misconduct in the pooling and sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Sessions cited three exceptions to the new policy: payments or loans that directly aim to address harm such as to the environment or official corruption; legal or other professional services from the case; and restitution, forfeiture and other payments required by law. While the policy affects future deals, it would have impacted cases like the Environmental Protection Agency's diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) that required the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero-emission vehicle efforts over 10 years. Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former EPA civil enforcement director, said the new ban could prevent a similar settlement after the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) last month over excess diesel emissions. The memo could ensure  violators won’t be required to support development of low emission vehicles to compensate for illegal pollution from the dirty engines they designed,  he said. The change could still affect a proposed $12 million Justice Department settlement with Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) that was announced in August but not finalized that includes $3 million to reduce air pollution through a project to replace conventional woodstoves.

Trump named Clark on Wednesday to be Assistant Attorney General for environment at the Department of Justice, representing the U.S. government on environmental regulation and enforcement issues. Clark, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, represented BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture that killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history. The accident polluted large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses. Along the U.S. Gulf coast, local communities are still grappling with cleanup and restoration, and had relied on the federal government and EPA to protect them against climate change and oil and gas company accidents, said Cynthia Sarthou, director of the Gulf Restoration Network in Louisiana.  I think the enforcement of any pollution laws is going to be at risk right now,  Sarthou said.  Bossert (Clark) is unlikely to hold the oil and gas industry accountable for pollution.  Sarthou added that most of the oil and gas infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf coast is aging, putting local environmental groups on alert for future accidents.  While this administration continues to choose profits over people, South Louisiana residents continue to struggle to recover from the economic, health and environmental impacts of the BP oil drilling disaster,  said Colette Pichon Battle, of the Human Rights Network, a lawyer who represented local communities affected by the BP accident. According to a White House statement, Clark is a  complex trial and appellate litigator with especially deep experience in administrative law.   In addition to practicing law in private practice, he also served worked as deputy assistant attorney general for environment at the Justice department from 2001 to 2005. As an attorney, Clark also represented industry groups in several challenges against the previous administration's Environmental Protection Agency. This includes a lawsuit to revoke the  endangerment finding,  the scientific finding that gives the agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and one to challenge California's ability to set its own stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles.   Clark was not available for comment.   Reporting By Valerie Volcovici","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-climatechange-enforcement-idUSL1N1J41N7"},

Based on this review, Fitch has affirmed the following Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR): --Aberdeen Asset Management PLC (AAM) at 'A'; --Amundi Group at 'A+' (AMU); --Azimut Holding S.p.A. (AZI) at 'BBB'; --FMR LLC (FMR) at 'A+'; --Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) at 'A-'; --Janus Henderson Group plc (JHG) at 'BBB'; --Man Strategic Holdings Limited (MAN) at 'BBB+'. --Russell Investments (Russell) at 'BB'; --Schroders Plc (Schroders) at 'A+'; Rating Outlooks were revised as follows: --The Outlook on IVZ was revised to Stable from Positive; --The Outlook on JHG was maintained at Positive; --The Outlook on Russell was maintained at Negative; --The Outlooks for the remaining traditional IMs are Stable. The rationale for today's rating actions includes both peer-group and company-specific considerations with the latter outlined in company-specific rating action commentaries also published today and available on Fitch's website. Rating drivers shared by the peer group include (to varying degrees) well-established and increasingly diversified franchises leading to scale and in some cases a degree of pricing power, adequate asset performance in a still challenging operating environment, broadly stable profitability despite margin and flow pressure from competition, most notably from passive strategies, increasing regulatory costs, and relatively strong cash flow leverage metrics, which remain below the peer group's long-term average. INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DRIVE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION The underlying shift in investor preference toward passive investment management strategies continues to put significant competitive pressures on the active investment management industry, resulting in weaker client AUM flows (particularly in equities), fee compression and competition for distribution. Passive strategies garner significantly lower fees and delivered better results in recent years, as only about 17% of active equity strategies in the U.S. were able to outperform their commercial benchmarks over a 15-year horizon, according to the data by the Center for Research in Security Prices, University of Chicago. These pressures, together with increasing regulatory costs, have been drivers of increased merger and acquisition (M&A;) activity among mid-tier active IMs. The recently formed JHG and announced merger between AAM and Standard Life are two examples of this trend. The acquisition of Pioneer Investments, a UniCredit S.p.A. subsidiary, by AMU also demonstrates industry consolidation, although the primary motivation for the transaction was the capital-raising needs of the seller. The acquisition of Source UK Services Limited (Source), an independent ETF provider, by IVZ reflects the firm's effort to improve its strategic positioning in the passive management space. While these M&A; transactions help managers build scale, Fitch believes they also come with integration and execution risks, and are not likely to benefit client flows without strong relative investment performance. EVOLVING REGULATORY LANDSCAPE With new administrations taking office in the U.S. and France and the uncertain impact of Brexit in the U.K., there is a chance for diverging regulatory paths in the investment management industry, which creates uncertainty and compliance risks for the majority of global IMs. Historically, compared to their bank counterparts, traditional IMs have experienced less direct regulation. However, broader market regulation globally has led to increased disclosure/reporting requirements, scrutiny over pricing structures and requirements to adhere to clients' best-interest principles. The Dept. of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary (conflict of interest) rule in the U.S., which was originally scheduled to take effect on April 10, 2017, requires financial advisers to act in accordance with their clients' best interests. According to an announcement by the U.S. Secretary of Labor in May 2017, the requirement for partial compliance with the DOL rule is unlikely to be delayed beyond a June 9, 2017 implementation date, although there is a possibility for changes to be introduced. If the rule is implemented in its original form, Fitch believes it could further pressure fees on actively managed products and/or contribute to further growth of passive investment products, given the low-cost nature of the product, which tends to align with the DOL intention. That said, a portion of this impact has likely already been felt in the industry as most firms have made preparations to comply with the rule, given the uncertain implementation date. In Europe, some traditional IMs are subject to capital requirements under the EU's Capital Requirement Directive IV (CRD IV). In addition, regulators in the U.K. and the EU have expressed concerns about effective competition in the fund management industry, fund pricing structures and fee transparency. Under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II), IMs will be required to improve disclosures of costs and charges in pricing documents, including the payments funds make to IMs for research. As a result, some IMs decided to partially or fully absorb research payments through their own income statements. STRONG MARKETS UNDERPIN AUM GROWTH, CLIENT FLOWS CHALLENGED A recovery in the global equity markets that started in 3Q16 supported AUM growth at rated institutions. For UK IMs, the sharp devaluation of the British pound also led to an increase in reported AUM. However, valuations being at all-time highs and rising interest rates in the U.S. expose AUM balances to a potential market correction. Additionally, despite strong longer-term investment performance, client flows remain challenged by weaker short-term results and competitive pressures from passive allocation. Further evidence that the recent shift of investor capital into passively managed strategies is more secular than cyclical may have negative rating implications or limit the potential upside for some of the rated IMs, particularly for those more exposed to U.S. equities, where that trend is more prevalent. MARGINS STAND STRONG, SUPPORTED BY FLEXIBLE COST BASES Traditional IMs have continued to generate strong operating margins despite increasing compliance costs and fee pressure from investor allocation to passively managed products, due to their scale, focus on growing AUM in the higher-yielding retail channel, and fairly variable cost structures. Average EBITDA margins for investment grade-rated traditional IMs ranged from 25%-51% for the peer group. Many firms have launched cost savings measures to improve operating efficiency to better withstand the environmental headwinds. Entities involved in M&A; activity have the potential to realize cost-synergies and scale benefits, which should mitigate fee and flow pressure on margins. LIMITED USE OF LEVERAGE Debt usage has remained relatively modest for investment grade-rated traditional IMs and, in some instances, debt net of balance sheet cash is negative. Recent acquisitions have been funded by capital raises and existing cash reserves, with debt funding being moderate. Cash flow leverage levels, defined as gross debt to EBITDA, ranged between 0.3x and 1.3x for investment grade-rated entities, which was largely stable year-on-year. Performance turbulence may inflate cash leverage metrics, although Fitch does not expect modest leverage growth to impact ratings at this time. Positively, interest coverage metrics remains sound across the board, and the majority of sector borrowings are at fixed rates.

Crude stocks in the United States grew 3.3 million barrels to 513 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That confounded forecasters who had predicted a drop of 3.5 million barrels, especially a day after data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated an even bigger fall. Gasoline inventories also unexpectedly rose, imports increased, and exports dropped, the EIA data showed.  “These figures spell a setback to the joint effort by OPEC and some non-OPEC countries to curb their output,  said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.  However, without persistent drawdowns in U.S. oil stockpiles, the process could be painfully slow.” U.S. crude futures settled down 5 percent, or $2.47 a barrel, at $45.72 a barrel, the lowest settlement for U.S. crude since May 4. U.S. benchmark futures CLc1 have slid more than 11 percent in 10 days of trading.  Brent crude prices LCOc1 fell $2.06, or 4 percent to settle at $48.06 a barrel. Official settlement prices were delayed due to a technical issue, according to a Nymex spokesperson. A worker at an oil field owned by Bashneft, Bashkortostan, Russia, January 28, 2015.Sergei Karpukhin/File PhotoGasoline futures 1RBc1 tumbled 4 percent to $1.4921 a gallon, lowest since May 10, as rising inventories fed worries about weak demand. Overall gasoline demand is down 0.7 percent for the past four weeks from a year ago, the EIA said.  Flagging gasoline demand continues to bedevil the market. With gasoline currently the seasonal leader of the complex, its weakness is dragging everything down,  said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Some in the market remained concerned about the move by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, an OPEC member that had agreed to cut about 30,000 barrels a day as part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to reduce output. Some analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some were concerned about rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement. OPEC and other producers including Russia have pledged to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) lifted force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil, bringing all the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months.

I think we've taken a big step backwards,  the Republican governor told reporters. Brownback quickly vetoed the bill passed by the legislature on Monday, saying the $1.2 billion it would raise over the next two fiscal years marked the biggest tax increase in Kansas history. Both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature overrode Brownback's veto late on Tuesday. The measure essentially rolls back income tax rate cuts the state enacted in 2012 that led to budget shortfalls. The higher rates are expected to raise $591 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $633 million in fiscal 2019, according to a legislative analysis of the bill. Kansas' structural budget pressures led S&P; Global Ratings to revise the outlook on the state's AA-minus credit rating to negative from stable earlier this year. David Hitchcock, a S&P; analyst, said on Wednesday the credit rating agency would take a look at the tax hike in the context of Kansas' final budget and its response to a court ruling on school funding. Lawmakers this week also passed a plan to comply with a March 2 Kansas Supreme Court ruling that found the school funding system falls short of a constitutional requirement for adequacy. The ruling set a June 30 deadline for the enactment of a constitutional funding method.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Stable. Azimut's senior unsecured bonds have also been affirmed at 'BBB'. These rating actions were undertaken as part of Fitch's global peer review of traditional investment managers. For more information on the peer review, refer to the commentary  Fitch Completes Traditional Investment Manager Global Peer Review  dated 7 June 2017. Azimut is a Milan-listed investment manager established in 1989. At end-1Q17, it had assets under management (AuM) and custody (AuC) of EUR46.5 billion. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT Azimut's ratings reflect a well-established domestic franchise and overall solid financial profile. The ratings also reflect Azimut's moderate size compared with peers and a concentrated distribution model, which relies significantly on financial advisers (FAs; around 1,636 at end-1Q17) selling Azimut products to high-net worth individuals, predominately in Italy but increasingly also abroad (20% of AUM at end-1Q17). Azimut competes with other investment managers but also with private banks given its business model. Its business model of primarily distributing in-house products results in solid financial metrics, including strong asset performance and consistently adequate profitability (even if variable fees are excluded). Net asset flows are largely driven by client acquisition of existing FAs and the acquisition of additional FAs. AuM margins are strong relative to peers', also due to its business model, which captures both product fees and distribution fees. Azimut's gross debt/EBITDA of around 1.0x at end-1Q17 (pro forma for a convertible bond repurchase of EUR200 million in May 2017) was sound, but is likely to be volatile due to performance fees. Excluding performance fees, pro forma cash flow leverage was higher at around 1.9x, but Azimut has proven capable of generating reasonable performance fees in all but extremely adverse market conditions. Capital and liquidity are largely fungible across the group since Azimut is no longer subject to consolidated supervision concerning regulatory capital after having transformed all its financial institutions (SIM) into asset management companies (SGRs) and because the number and size of its regulated entities is small. This supports higher double leverage than at more tightly regulated groups. Our assessment of Azimut's company profile has a high influence on the IDRs. Azimut's franchise is well-respected in Italy and has allowed the company to record consistent growth in recent years. However, its franchise relies to a large extent on the performance of its FAs. Consequently, product under-performance or a reputational or operational loss would have a more meaningful negative impact on Azimut's creditworthiness than more diversified or larger investment manager peers. Positively, Azimut's FAs are typically also shareholders, which helps align the company's and the FAs' strategic goals. Azimut operates in around 15 countries but the bulk of its revenues are sourced from Italy (BBB/Stable). We do not believe that Azimut is as exposed to Italy's operating environment as domestic banks are. Azimut's direct credit exposure to Italian counterparties is short-term and in our view, its customer base (high-net-worth individuals largely in the north of Italy) would be little affected by a further deterioration of Italy's fiscal or macroeconomic performance. However, Azimut's ability to issue or refinance debt will likely be linked to broader market perceptions of Italian sovereign and country risk. We deem the company's risk controls to be adequate. However, Azimut relies to a large degree on outsourcing contracts, which are more challenging to manage than internal processes. In addition, its growth plans outside Italy (including expansion in emerging markets with potentially weaker corporate governance) exposes Azimut to additional operational and reputational risks. The senior notes are rated in line with Azimut's Long-Term IDR as Fitch views the probability of default on the notes as the same as the probability of default of Azimut. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT Rating upside is currently limited given Azimut's modest size, concentrated business model and, to a lesser extent, Italy's challenging operating environment. In the medium- to longer- term, a combination of improving scale and revenue diversification by distribution channel or geography could be rating-positive assuming Azimut's financial metrics, notably leverage, remain at their current levels or improve. Reputational damage to Azimut's franchise that would impair the ability to retain existing or attract new FAs, on whom Azimut relies to generate fee revenue (and attract new AuM) would be rating-negative. A weakening of its negotiating position with its FAs that would result in higher distribution costs could also be rating-negative. A sizeable operational loss, for instance, as a result of internal or external fraud or non-compliance with regulatory requirements or anti-money laundering provisions would be negative for Azimut's ratings. A downgrade of Italy's sovereign rating could affect Azimut's ratings or Outlook if the negative sovereign rating action is driven by deterioration in Italy's macroeconomic environment. Higher cash flow leverage, either as a result of additional debt or declining EBITDA (notably if the decline is due to lower AuM and not primarily due to lower performance fees) would be rating-negative. Sharply higher double leverage as a result of higher-than-expected capital returns could also put pressure on Azimut's ratings. The rating of the senior unsecured notes is primarily sensitive to changes in Azimut's Long-Term IDR.

The White House's Office of Management and Budget website posted a notice by the Labor Department saying it plans to solicit information from the public and other interested parties about the rule. Such a step marks the very early part of a formal rulemaking process. However, it does not guarantee a new rule will ultimately be crafted.  We need that information. We need that data in order to decide how to proceed,  Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said on Wednesday, when lawmakers inquired about the rule during a routine congressional hearing on the Labor Department's budget. The fiduciary rule has been the subject of fierce debate and contention since it was proposed during the Obama administration. It is championed by consumer advocates and retirement non-profit groups, but has been staunchly opposed by the financial services sector, which argues it will make retirement advice too costly and harm lower-income retirees in particular. Wall Street and other wealth managers have sought to kill it or scale it back, including by filing lawsuits against the department that have so far proven unsuccessful. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ordered the department to study the rule and see if it should be scrapped or rewritten. The department temporarily halted implementation. However, portions of the rule are now slated to go into effect on June 9 without further delays. Acosta said at the hearing on Wednesday that multiple attorneys examined the rule and could not find a legal basis for postponing its June 9 implementation.  He added that he is aware of some of the concerns about the rule, but the federal law governing rulemaking procedures requires the department to follow a proper process and weigh those concerns to see if changes are merited.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Stable. These rating actions were undertaken as part of Fitch's global peer review of traditional investment managers. For more information on the peer review, see 'Fitch Completes Traditional Investment Manager Global Peer Review' dated 7 June 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS The IDRs of Schroders primarily reflect its well-established and diversified international investment management franchise, strong leverage and profitability metrics, resilient and stable profitability, sound investment performance and a robust risk management framework. The ratings also take into account the sensitivity of Schroders' profitability to sudden market volatility due to an above-average exposure to equity products, incremental credit and liquidity risks in the wealth management business and fairly high operating leverage due to a staff-intensive business model. Schroders' franchise, centred on the institution's well-established UK, European and Asian equities businesses and regionally diversified institutional and intermediary distribution channels, is a rating strength. At end-2016, equity assets under management (AuM, up 18% yoy) accounted for 39% of Schroders' GBP386 billion AuM with solid growth in fixed income (up 36% yoy; 20% of AuM), multi-asset (up 23%; 24%), wealth management (up 25%; 13%) and other AuM (4%; including real estate), improving AuM diversification during the year. Globally, Schroders' franchise is less strong in the important US market (Americas AuM accounted for 15% at end-2016) although steps have been taken in 2016 and 1H17 to increase the US presence, notably by entering into a strategic relationship with Hartford Funds. Its wealth management franchise was strengthened in 1H17 through the acquisition of the wealth management business of C. Hoare & Co., adding GBP2.5 billion in AuM. Schroders' investment performance compares well with peers' and has generally outperformed benchmark returns. In 2016 and 2015, 74% and 72% of products respectively, outperformed their relevant benchmarks over three years compared with management's target of 60%. Net new money inflows remained positive in 2016 (GBP1.1 billion compared with GBP13 billion in 2015) with net outflows in intermediary channel equities being offset by robust net inflows elsewhere. Schroders' AuM base is granular with limited reliance on individual funds or investors. Schroders' revenue base is of good quality (performance fees are negligible) and profitability metrics compare well with peers'. Costs are well-managed and cost efficiency metrics are adequate and within management targets (compensation/net revenue ratio of 44% in 2016 compared with a target range of 45% to 49%). Fitch-defined operating profit improved in 2016 to GBP541 million (from GBP533 million in 2015) as a result of higher average AuM and cost control. Operating profit in 2016 was significantly affected by the depreciation of sterling where the positive effect on operating revenue outweighed the negative effect on the cost base. Management fee margins declined to 48 bps (2015: 51 bps) and Schroders is expanding its higher-margin businesses to counteract the industry-wide margin pressure, for example, by building up a private assets business (where it acquired Adveq, a Swiss-based private equity business; closing expected in 2H17). At end-2016, Schroders did not have any outstanding debt and as a result, all relevant leverage and funding metrics compare favourably with peers'. Due to its wealth management activities (accounting for 10% of pre-tax profit before exceptional items in 2016) and its bank subsidiaries, Schroders is regulated by the UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and has to comply with higher regulatory capital requirements than most peers. Schroders' regulatory capital base (GBP2,265 million at end-2016) consists entirely of core Tier 1 capital, resulting in a solid common equity Tier 1 ratio of 34.5% at end-2016). We assess Schroders' risk management framework as strong. Its risk governance framework is well-established. Its seed capital exposure, while increasing (by about 42% yoy), remains moderate (GBP325 million at end-December 2016). Its remaining investment capital (GBP1,059 million at end-2016) mainly comprises investment grade bonds. Client loans in its wealth management business are almost exclusively secured, mostly by liquid assets and insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, by European real estate. A Long-Term IDR of 'A+' can correspond to two possible Short-Term IDRs. In Schroders' case, Fitch has assigned a 'F1' Short-Term IDR, based primarily on the strength of the company's liquidity profile, which is viewed as consistent with, but not stronger than, the company's overall credit risk profile. The Stable Outlook on Schroders' Long-Term IDR reflects our expectation that the institution will be able to report adequate profitability in most market conditions while maintaining strong leverage, liquidity and capitalisation. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS Ratings in the 'AA' category are typically difficult for investment managers to achieve given the sensitivity of investment managers' profitability to falling asset values as well as the declining benefits of asset class diversification in times of severe market stress (when asset classes tend to be more correlated). This currently limits upside to Schroders' IDRs. Nevertheless, a strengthening of Schroders' US franchise leading to improved diversification as well as general AuM growth improving operating efficiency could over time be rating-positive. Downward pressure on Schroders' ratings is limited but could result from a materially higher balance sheet risk appetite, material and sustained net outflows, for instance, as a result of asset under-performance, an adverse operational or reputational event, or a substantial and sustained increase in balance sheet or cash flow leverage.

The Outlook on Amundi's Long-Term IDR is Stable. These rating actions were undertaken as part of Fitch's global peer review of traditional investment managers. For more information on the peer review, refer to the commentary  Fitch Completes Traditional Investment Managers Global Peer Review  dated 7 June 2017. Amundi is the parent company of Amundi group, one of Europe's largest asset management companies established in 2010. It has a leading franchise in French and European fixed income products and sound franchises in other asset classes. In December 2016, Amundi announced that it has signed a binding agreement with UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit, BBB/Stable) to acquire Pioneer Investments (Pioneer), UniCredit's investment management subsidiary (see 'Fitch Affirms Amundi at 'A+'/Stable on Pioneer Announcement', published 15 December 2016). Amundi is financing the EUR3,545 million transaction by using around EUR1.5 billion of excess cash, with a EUR1.4 billion capital increase and by issuing around EUR645 million in senior and subordinated debt, both completed in 2Q17. Following the capital increase, the shareholding of Credit Agricole (CA, A+/Stable), Amundi's parent, dropped to around 70% from around 75%. Amundi expects the transaction, which still requires regulatory and anti-trust approvals, to close by end-1H17 with operational integration completed by end-2018. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs Amundi's IDRs are based on Fitch's standalone assessment of the company. The ratings reflect Amundi's leading domestic and growing international franchise, which is supported by continued access to strong distribution networks, and adequate net asset flows supporting average assets under management (AuM). The ratings also reflect Amundi's strong revenue generation, sound risk management, acceptable asset performance, low adjusted balance sheet leverage and Fitch's view that the Pioneer acquisition is on balance neutral to Amundi's IDRs. However, the ratings also take into account the sensitivity of Amundi's earnings and AuM base to market volatility, reliance on the distribution networks of CA and previous minority shareholder Societe Generale (SocGen, A/Stable/a) and above-average reliance on fixed income products. The ratings also reflect that the Pioneer acquisition will lead to heightened execution and integration risks in the short- to medium-term. Amundi's franchise is supported by extensive distribution agreements with CA and SocGen mainly in France (access to both retail and insurance distribution networks) and - once the Pioneer acquisition closes - with UniCredit in Italy, Germany and Austria. Adjusting for the Pioneer acquisition, at end-2016, retail AuM accounted for EUR468 billion, institutional AuM (excluding insurance AuM) for EUR448 billion and CA and SocGen insurance AuM for EUR391 billion. While France (42% of end-2016 pro forma AuM) remains Amundi's key market, its position in the rest of Europe and, to a lesser extent, the US (6% of AuM) has benefitted from above-peer average net money inflows and will be considerably improved by the Pioneer acquisition. The acquisition will also increase Amundi's share of multi-asset AuM to around 18% from currently around 12% as well as the share of higher-margin retail AuM (to 36% from 28%; including insurance AuM). In 2016, net inflows were strong at EUR62 billion and diversified by asset and geography. Overall asset performance was acceptable in 2016 with satisfactory one- and three-year performances in many fixed income and consultant  buy ratings  on around four-fifths of Amundi's rated strategies. Seed money exposure declined significantly in 2016 and is diversified by asset class and individual fund. Fitch views Amundi's risk control framework, which is centralised and integrated into CA's risk function, as sound. Earnings generation and profitability remained sound in 2016 and 1Q17, with higher average AuM and sound cost control supporting the operating margin (48% in 2016) of Amundi, which is at the upper end of its peer group. Despite some AuM margin pressure diversification and scale should help Amundi to continue reporting broadly stable profitability. The Pioneer acquisition will in the short-term negatively affect Amundi's profitability due to significant integration costs (around EUR190 million to be booked in 2017 and 2018 according to management) but profitability should recover once estimated cost and revenue synergies, deemed as realistic by Fitch, start to feed through. Amundi's capitalisation and leverage metrics compare well with peers'. Amundi's gross cash flow leverage (gross debt/EBITDA; 3.8x at end-2016) is materially higher than peers'. However, gross debt exclusively relates to Amundi's structured products issuance (where proceeds are on-lent to CA with matching terms) and interbank liabilities (where Amundi has a net positive interbank position). Consequently, Amundi's gross debt does not give rise to refinancing risk and its net debt/EBITDA ratio (which is negative) compares well with peers'. As part of the Pioneer transaction, Amundi has issued EUR645 million in senior unsecured and Tier 2 debt to its parent, CA. Balance sheet leverage, calculated as tangible equity-to-tangible assets, was better than sector average at 32% at end-2016. On closing of the Pioneer transaction, according to management, Amundi's regulatory CET1 ratio will be above 10% (around 38% at end-2016), before recovering in subsequent years. Amundi's Short-Term IDR of 'F1' reflects the company's sound standalone liquidity but also the Short-Term IDR of CA, which acts as the provider of Amundi's back-stop liquidity. Market and liquidity risks are moderate. However, Amundi's guaranteed products and structured products issuance activities mean that sound liquidity management is crucial for the overall risk profile. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that Amundi will continue to report sound profitability while maintaining acceptable gross and net balance sheet leverage. SUPPORT RATING Amundi's Support Rating of '1' reflects our view that support from CA for Amundi is extremely likely, if ever required. As the manager of CA's insurance assets as well as an important provider of asset management products for CA's retail networks, we view Amundi as a core subsidiary for CA, which fits well into CA's asset-gathering strategy. In addition, compared with the more balance sheet-heavy banking activities that CA pursues, Amundi's business model only requires limited amounts of regulatory capital and liquidity, resulting in superior risk-adjusted returns. This also means that required resources to support Amundi, if ever needed, would be limited compared with CA's overall size. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS In the short-term, material integration risks relating to the Pioneer acquisition and Amundi's reduced regulatory CET1 ratio limit upside to Amundi's ratings. In the medium- to longer-term, a successful integration of Pioneer in conjunction with further franchise improvements outside Amundi's already dominant European fixed income franchise could be credit-positive. Further, material improvements to its regulatory capitalisation, while maintaining or improving its leverage could also be credit-positive. A material postponement in integrating Pioneer leading to a delay in realising estimated synergies, integration costs significantly exceeding current estimates or higher-than-expected revenue attrition or key staff departures relating to the Pioneer acquisition could put pressure on Amundi's ratings. Since Amundi's IDRs are based on Fitch's stand-alone assessment of the company, an upgrade of CA would not lead to an upgrade of Amundi's Long-Term IDR. Similarly, a downgrade of CA's ratings would not automatically trigger a downgrade of Amundi's ratings but would nonetheless put pressure on Amundi's Long-Term IDR given the close integration between the two entities in terms of risk and liquidity management as well as Amundi's reliance on CA's distribution network. SUPPORT RATING The Support Rating is sensitive to a change in the assumptions around the propensity or ability of CA to provide timely support for Amundi. This may arise, for instance, if the importance of savings products in CA's overall strategy diminishes, if CA reduces its stake in Amundi materially or if CA's Long-Term IDR is downgraded by two or more notches, which is currently viewed as unlikely by Fitch.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that settlement payments must be directed to victims impacted by the defendants' actions and then to the federal government. The change could impact banks and other corporations, and marks the latest action by the Republican Trump administration to end policies from the previous Democratic Obama administration. Such agreements were a feature of several U.S. settlements with banks following the 2008 financial crisis. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aimed to hold banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. From 2013 to 2016, the department reached $46 billion in settlements with U.S. banks that in part directed funds to approved housing aid and other related groups. In Obama's final weeks in office, the department sued Barclays PLC over similar claims.  In recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes required or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement,  Sessions said a statement.  We are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct.  The change could impact banks still under federal investigation over mortgage issues such as Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Wells Fargo & Co, UBS Group AG and HSBC. Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached. Sessions, in a one-page memo dated Monday, told the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys they could not make any agreements in civil or criminal cases  that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.  Sessions’ new policy  is ill-advised and ignores the tens of thousands of families who were helped by housing service providers across the country in the wake of the financial crisis,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman was co-chair of a working group that investigated misconduct in the pooling and sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Sessions cited three exceptions to the new policy: payments or loans that directly aim to address harm such as to the environment or official corruption; legal or other professional services from the case; and restitution, forfeiture and other payments required by law. While the policy affects future deals, it would have impacted cases like the Environmental Protection Agency's diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen AG that required the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero-emission vehicle efforts over 10 years. Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former EPA civil enforcement director, said the new ban could prevent a similar settlement after the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV last month over excess diesel emissions. The memo could ensure  violators won’t be required to support development of low emission vehicles to compensate for illegal pollution from the dirty engines they designed,  he said. The change could still affect a proposed $12 million Justice Department settlement with Harley-Davidson Inc that was announced in August but not finalized that includes $3 million to reduce air pollution through a project to replace conventional woodstoves.

In talks with the (ruling) HDZ party we will require to run three ministries,  said Predrag Stromar, a senior official of the Croatian People's Party (HNS), after a party council meeting comprising more than 100 members overturned the previous decision to shun the coalition. The change of heart may lead to a split in the party but could help the conservative HDZ to continue ruling without a second snap election in less than a year. On Tuesday, HNS leader Ivan Vrdoljak resigned after the party's presidency rejected his proposal to enter the HDZ-led government headed by Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. In April, Plenkovic fired four ministers from the previous junior coalition partner, the center-right Most ( Bridge ) party, as Most supported the opposition in a no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Zdravko Maric, which he survived by one vote. The HNS has nine members of parliament and it is likely that some of them will not vote for the new majority. Plenkovic, who is also the HDZ leader, must get support from several other deputies, some of them independent, and representatives of national minorities to clinch a new parliamentary backing. Plenkovic must propose soon four new ministers to parliament to replace those from Most and reshuffle his cabinet to accommodate ministers from the HNS. A vote on those appointments will be the ultimate test of whether he has secured enough parliamentary backing for his cabinet to stay on. A new early election, after the one held last September also following a split between the HDZ and the Most, would harm the pace of economic reforms needed to improve the investment climate and meager long-term growth prospects in one of the European Union's weakest economies.

The common currency was down 0.14 percent at $1.1259 after hitting a low of $1.1205 on reports suggesting the ECB Bank would lower its inflation targets.

Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said U.S. President Donald Trump asked him to drop a probe of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of an investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, according to testimony from Comey posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website.                   Gold trading near lows of the session as Comey's written remarks confirm he told the president more than once that he was not personally under investigation and contain no hints of what could be obviously considered obstruction,  said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York.      The Q&A; will be a circus and can't rule out something juicy but so far those hoping for a smoking gun may have instead found a child's water pistol.       Bullion also came under some pressure after the dollar index       , which tracks the greenback against six major rivals,  rose about 0.1 percent.            A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially subduing demand.            Spot gold        was down 0.6 percent at $1,285.17 an ounce by 3:34 p.m. EDT (1934 GMT). On Tuesday, it gained 1.1 percent to its highest since November last year at $1,295.97. U.S. gold futures         slipped to settle at $1,293.2.     Dealers said comments late in the session from the head of U.S. Missile Defense Agency saying North Korea ballistic missile advances in the past six months have caused him  great concern  triggered modest buying in gold.                   As such, I expect the price of gold will continue to head higher, as a two-step forward, one-step back improvement in the price. I believe the next level of resistance is the $1,295 range,  said Walter Pehowich, executive vice president of investment services at Dillon Gage Metals.      If we can trade through that level, I expect an obvious speed bump at the $1,300 dollar level.       In Britain, markets are worried the ruling Conservative party might not get a majority in Thursday's elections. Prime Minister Theresa May wants to increase her majority to strengthen Britain's hand in exit talks with the European Union.     Traders are also looking ahead to a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve next week.      We do expect gold to hit some turbulence as we approach the June Fed rate hike, but things could open up for the precious metal post-meeting if the central bank's language remains  dovish,  said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.     Among other precious metals, platinum        fell 1.2 percent to $944.90 an ounce and palladium        slid 2.3 percent to $833.90 after earlier touching $859.80 an ounce, its highest since September 2014.     Platinum is used mainly to make autocatalysts for diesel-fueled cars, while palladium is mainly used for autocatalysts in gasoline-fueled cars.      (Palladium has) a much broader exposure to global car markets. According to data from the United States, Europe and Japan, the recent slowdown in sales continued also in May,  Julius Baer analysts said in a note.      We stick to our negative view (on palladium) and short-position, expecting prices to realign with the weaker demand backdrop over the coming months.      Silver        was down 0.5 percent at $17.57 an ounce.

The common currency was down 0.14 percent at $1.1259 after hitting a low of $1.1205 on reports suggesting the ECB Bank would lower its inflation targets. Bloomberg, citing unnamed euro zone officials, said the central bank was preparing to lower its annual inflation forecast for the next three years to 1.5 percent, from 1.7 percent, 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.  The new estimate, subject to approval at the two-day meeting of the Governing Council, would signal a softer line than many in currency and bond markets have been expecting. The ECB declined to comment.  That would suggest that it would be very difficult for the rate hawks on the governing council to force through an early departure from the very accommodative policy that the ECB is pursuing right now,  said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The euro pared losses after a Reuters report cited sources as saying that the ECB is likely to nudge up its forecasts for economic growth in the euro zone even as it trims its inflation estimates. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.06 percent at 96.698.  Currency markets are watching the UK election, the ECB meeting tomorrow and then casting eyes forward to the Federal Reserve meeting next week,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana. Traders also remained watchful ahead of Thursday's U.S. Senate testimony of James Comey, the former Federal Bureau of Investigation sacked by President Donald Trump in May. Comey accused Trump on Wednesday of trying to get him to water down the FBI probe into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to testimony posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website.  I think it was viewed as somewhat less impactful than was anticipated or feared, but ultimately that is yet to take place and clearly the capital market reactions to that will be based on the actual events that transpire,  said Northey. Sterling rose 0.41 percent against the dollar to $1.296, with investors increasingly taking the view that Prime Minister Theresa May's party will win a majority in the election on Thursday.

I think we've taken a big step backwards,  the Republican governor told reporters. Brownback quickly vetoed the bill passed by the legislature on Monday, saying the $1.2 billion it would raise over the next two fiscal years marked the biggest tax increase in Kansas history. Both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature overrode Brownback's veto late on Tuesday. The measure essentially rolls back income tax rate cuts the state enacted in 2012 that led to budget shortfalls. The higher rates are expected to raise $591 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $633 million in fiscal 2019, according to a legislative analysis of the bill. Kansas' structural budget pressures led S&P; Global Ratings to revise the outlook on the state's AA-minus credit rating to negative from stable earlier this year. David Hitchcock, a S&P; analyst, said on Wednesday the credit rating agency would take a look at the tax hike in the context of Kansas' final budget and its response to a court ruling on school funding. Lawmakers this week also passed a plan to comply with a March 2 Kansas Supreme Court ruling that found the school funding system falls short of a constitutional requirement for adequacy. The ruling set a June 30 deadline for the enactment of a constitutional funding method.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/kansas-taxation-idUSL1N1J41RL"},

(Reuters) - A Florida woman who believed the 2012 massacre at a Connecticut elementary school was a hoax was sentenced on Wednesday to five months in federal prison after pleading guilty to threatening the father of one of the 20 children killed. Lucy Richards, 57, admitted in a plea agreement to writing on the website of the father of one of the youngest Sandy Hook Elementary School victims:  LOOK BEHIND YOU IT IS DEATH  in January 2016. Leonard Pozner was not identified in court records but confirmed in an interview with Reuters that he was the target of the threats, which he believes occurred because of his public opposition to those who deny the killings happened. A 20-year-old man armed with an assault rifle gunned down 20 first-graders and six educators at the school in Newton, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012, in the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Conspiracy theorists have charged that the event was a hoax, a  false flag  staged by political activists who wanted to crack down on gun ownership in the United States. Connecticut, New York and Maryland passed laws limiting sales of assault rifles and high-capacity magazines following the massacre, but federal laws were unchanged. Twenty-seven wooden angel figures are seen placed in a wooded area beside a road near the Sandy Hook Elementary School for the victims of a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut December 16, 2012.Mike Segar I'm satisfied with the sentencing because for me it's about raising awareness to this growing problem of alternative facts and people who are easily influenced by those facts, and then, take it upon themselves to think that they are the part of some army of good,  Pozner said. Pozner said his family including his wife and two daughters, now 12 and 10, moved to South Florida at the end of the school year in which his son, Noah, was killed at the age of 6. The younger of his daughters was Noah's twin sister. Richards, who lives near Tampa, pleaded guilty in Fort Lauderdale to one count of transmitting threats via interstate commerce, according to federal court documents. Her attorney, federal public defender Robert Berube of Fort Lauderdale, did not return phone calls for comment. Pozner said he still received threats  constantly  online. He founded a website that seeks to counter people who say the shootings never took place. The Sandy Hook gunman, Adam Lanza, began his rampage by killing his mother in their home and ended it by turning his weapon on himself as he heard police sirens approaching.

Ward, 60, was ordered to return to court on June 23 for sentencing on the burglary count, which carries a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines. A first jury weighing the charges against Ward deadlocked on both counts in February. Prosecutors were expected to decide in the coming weeks whether to put him on trial a third time on the sabotage charge. Prosecutors did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Ward has not disputed that he shut down a valve on Kinder Morgan Inc's Trans Mountain Pipeline near Burlington, Washington, but maintains that his actions are necessary in the face of the government's failure to address global warming. Groups have also protested the nearly completed Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipeline. He was arrested in October when he and other activists in four states cut padlocks and chains and entered remote flow stations to turn off valves to try to stop crude from moving through lines that carry as much as 15 percent of daily U.S. oil consumption. Officials, pipeline companies and experts said the protesters could have caused environmental damage themselves by shutting down the lines.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that settlement payments must be directed to victims impacted by the defendants' actions and then to the federal government.  The change could impact banks and other corporations, and marks the latest action by the Republican Trump administration to end policies from the previous Democratic Obama administration. Such agreements were a feature of several U.S. settlements with banks following the 2008 financial crisis. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aimed to hold banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. From 2013 to 2016, the department reached $46 billion in settlements with U.S. banks that in part directed funds to approved housing aid and other related groups. In Obama's final weeks in office, the department sued Barclays PLC (BARC.L) over similar claims.  In recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes required or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement,  Sessions said a statement.  We are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct.  The change could impact banks still under federal investigation over mortgage issues such as Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S), Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.L), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) and HSBC (HSBA.L). Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached.     Sessions, in a one-page memo dated Monday, told the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys they could not make any agreements in civil or criminal cases  that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.  Sessions’ new policy  is ill-advised and ignores the tens of thousands of families who were helped by housing service providers across the country in the wake of the financial crisis,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman was co-chair of a working group that investigated misconduct in the pooling and sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Sessions cited three exceptions to the new policy: payments or loans that directly aim to address harm such as to the environment or official corruption; legal or other professional services from the case; and restitution, forfeiture and other payments required by law. While the policy affects future deals, it would have impacted cases like the Environmental Protection Agency's diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) that required the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero-emission vehicle efforts over 10 years. Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former EPA civil enforcement director, said the new ban could prevent a similar settlement after the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) last month over excess diesel emissions. The memo could ensure  violators won’t be required to support development of low emission vehicles to compensate for illegal pollution from the dirty engines they designed,  he said. The change could still affect a proposed $12 million Justice Department settlement with Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) that was announced in August but not finalized that includes $3 million to reduce air pollution through a project to replace conventional woodstoves.

The White House's Office of Management and Budget website posted a notice by the Labor Department saying it plans to solicit information from the public and other interested parties about the rule. Such a step marks the very early part of a formal rulemaking process. However, it does not guarantee a new rule will ultimately be crafted.  We need that information. We need that data in order to decide how to proceed,  Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said on Wednesday, when lawmakers inquired about the rule during a routine congressional hearing on the Labor Department's budget. The fiduciary rule has been the subject of fierce debate and contention since it was proposed during the Obama administration. It is championed by consumer advocates and retirement non-profit groups, but has been staunchly opposed by the financial services sector, which argues it will make retirement advice too costly and harm lower-income retirees in particular. Wall Street and other wealth managers have sought to kill it or scale it back, including by filing lawsuits against the department that have so far proven unsuccessful. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ordered the department to study the rule and see if it should be scrapped or rewritten. The department temporarily halted implementation. However, portions of the rule are now slated to go into effect on June 9 without further delays. Acosta said at the hearing on Wednesday that multiple attorneys examined the rule and could not find a legal basis for postponing its June 9 implementation.  He added that he is aware of some of the concerns about the rule, but the federal law governing rulemaking procedures requires the department to follow a proper process and weigh those concerns to see if changes are merited.  We need the data to substantiate those concerns because the decisions have to be based on the record, or else those decisions become prejudgment,  he said. Reporting by Robert Iafolla and Sarah N.

Trump,Hillary Clinton,Is Trump,James Comey,Loretta Lynch,Michael Flynn,Mike Pence,Robert Mueller,ROD ROSENSTEIN,Sergei Kislyak,Vladimir Putin,USA,TRUMP/RUSSIA,QandA,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. President Donald Trump's abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comey's dismissal. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find? The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a  clear preference  for Trump to win the White House. Putin's associates hacked information, paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said. The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. probes are there into Russia's election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow's role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russia's role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  I will tell you this, Russia: if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,  Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clinton's use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted. Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf. The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration.  As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,  Trump said, although he added:  It could have been others also.  Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed.  The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?  he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump wrote on Twitter:  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.  Did the FBI probe continue after Comey's dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey's departure. FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey's firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Trump on June 6 tapped former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on  Restoring Confidence in the FBI  that recommended Comey's dismissal. Rosenstein's memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton's use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein's view was that Comey's decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called  Showboat  to air as Comey testifies. The ad claims Comey was  consumed with election meddling  at the expense of fighting terrorism. Was Comey's firing related to the FBI's Russia probe? Whether Comey believes his firing was linked to the FBI's Russia probe will likely be a main focus when he testifies on Thursday. Trump asked Comey to end the agency's investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear  the cloud  hanging over his presidency, according to Comey's prepared testimony. Comey found it  very concerning  that Trump would ask him to drop the agency's probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a  duty to correct  if that changed, according to the testimony.  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump told Comey at a January 27 dinner, according to the testimony. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him  mildly nauseous  that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening, and then re-closing, the Clinton email probe days before the election. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation? In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey confirmed in his written testimony that he told Trump that he was not personally under investigation.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-qa-idUSL1N1J41R9"},

I think we've taken a big step backwards,  the Republican governor told reporters. Brownback quickly vetoed the bill passed by the legislature on Monday, saying the $1.2 billion it would raise over the next two fiscal years marked the biggest tax increase in Kansas history. Both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature overrode Brownback's veto late on Tuesday. The measure essentially rolls back income tax rate cuts the state enacted in 2012 that led to budget shortfalls. The higher rates are expected to raise $591 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $633 million in fiscal 2019, according to a legislative analysis of the bill. Kansas' structural budget pressures led S&P; Global Ratings to revise the outlook on the state's AA-minus credit rating to negative from stable earlier this year. David Hitchcock, a S&P; analyst, said on Wednesday the credit rating agency would take a look at the tax hike in the context of Kansas' final budget and its response to a court ruling on school funding. Lawmakers this week also passed a plan to comply with a March 2 Kansas Supreme Court ruling that found the school funding system falls short of a constitutional requirement for adequacy. The ruling set a June 30 deadline for the enactment of a constitutional funding method.

The raid comes six months President Muhammadu Buhari said Boko Haram had  technically  been defeated by a military campaign that had pushed many jihadists deep into the remote Sambisa forest, near the border with Cameroon. Aid workers and Reuters witnesses reported explosions and heavy gunfire for at least 45 minutes in the southeastern and southwestern outskirts of the city. Thousands of civilians fled the fighting, according to Reuters witnesses. Nigeria's military said it had contained the attack.  The situation in Maiduguri is under control,  it said in a statement, urging the city's inhabitants not to panic. Maiduguri in Borno state has been the epicenter of the eight-year fight against Boko Haram but has been relatively free of violence since the beginning of 2016, barring sporadic suicide bombs on its outskirts. Fighter jets roared overhead as soldiers and police sped toward the scene, the Reuters witnesses said. Three children were hit by bullets, one witness said. More than 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram's campaign to establish a mediaeval caliphate in the Lake Chad basin.

Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said most members of his party supported the Iran bill, but that they would only agree to let it go ahead because they expected it would be amended to include  a strong package  of new sanctions on Russia as well. Many lawmakers have been clamoring for new sanctions on Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for Syria's government in that country's six-year-long civil war. Schumer said he was negotiating with the Senate's Republican leaders on the Russia sanctions.

The law, enshrined in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is due to expire on December 31 unless Congress votes to reauthorize it, but is considered vital by U.S. intelligence agencies. Privacy advocates have criticized the law though for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to millions of Americans without a search warrant. The push to make the law permanent may lead to a contentious debate over renewal of Section 702 in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties are deeply divided over whether to adopt transparency and oversight reforms.  We cannot allow adversaries abroad to cloak themselves in the legal protections we extend to Americans,  White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert wrote in an editorial published in the New York Times newspaper on Wednesday. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking on behalf of other intelligence agency leaders, also told the Senate Intelligence Committee panel on Wednesday that the statute should be made permanent, saying it was necessary to keep the United States safe from national security threats. NSA Director Rogers added that the law had been vital to preventing terrorism in allied countries as well. Fourteen Republican senators, including every Republican member of the Senate intelligence panel, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would make part of Section 702 permanent. The statute, which grants the National Security Agency a considerable freedom in the collection of foreigners' digital communications, normally comes with a  sunset  clause, meaning that roughly every five years lawmakers need to reconsider its impact on privacy and civil liberties. 'Spy on Americans' Intelligence Director Coats said it was not feasible for the NSA to provide an estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are ensnared incidentally under Section 702. Coats and other officials had previously told Congress they would attempt to share an estimate publicly before the statute expires. A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats  went back on a pledge.  Privacy advocates criticized the push to make Section 702 permanent, arguing that regular reviews of the law were necessary to conduct appropriate oversight and prevent potential abuses.  After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant,  said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism. Last week, Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet Inc's Google sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans' communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target. Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-intelligence-idUSL1N1J41O9"},

A judge ruled that the hearing for Brandon Bostian will be rescheduled for September 12th at the request of defense attorney Fortunato Perri. Perri asked for the delay because his law partner, Brian McMonigle, was busy with a high-profile sexual assault case against comedian Bill Cosby that is taking place in a Philadelphia suburb. Local prosecutors had originally declined to bring charges against Bostian, saying last month that they did not have enough evidence to charge him with criminal intent and closing the case.

The WHO said in a disease outbreak statement that any country noticing an unusual increase in cases among men who have sex with other men should report it to the WHO. It said the rise in cases was  of particular concern from a public health perspective because of the current limited availability of hepatitis A vaccine worldwide,  and most of the affected countries had routinely recommended vaccination for gay men. The disease is rarely fatal but some patients may develop severe symptoms lasting several months. The virus is mainly spread by ingesting food or water contaminated by the feces of an infected person, but for gay men the main risk is sexual transmission, particularly oral-anal sexual contact. The WHO said up to 2 million international guests were expected to attend the LGBT World Pride Festival in Madrid between 23 June and 2 July, with  moderate to high  risk of person-to-person sexual transmission of hepatitis A.  In Spain, Hepatitis A cases reported in 2017 are almost eight times higher than the average number of cases reported during the same period between the years 2012 and 2016. Most cases are men with ages between 15 to 45 years old, and MSM (men who have sex with men) are the most affected group,  it said. People attending the Madrid festival should seek advice from healthcare providers on hepatitis A vaccination before travelling, and should take preventive measures while in Madrid to reduce the risk of infection, it said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/health-hepatitis-idUSL1N1J41MW"},

Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields hit session highs after the prepared text of Comey's testimony was posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website. The remarks will be delivered on Thursday before the Senate panel. Comey accused Trump on Wednesday of trying to get him to water down the bureau's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump asked Comey to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into whether Moscow meddled in the election. Trump fired Comey on May 9 in a shock move that heightened scrutiny of the matter. While Comey's statement did not reveal new damning details in the market's view, analysts expected fireworks at Thursday's question and answer portion of the former FBI chief's testimony.  The market was pricing in a much worse news flow from the Comey testimony than what we saw,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist, at TD Securities in New Y9ork.  But it's one risk out of the way, and now the market is looking at the ECB meeting and the UK election,  he added. The European Central Bank is widely expected to keep its policy unchanged at its meeting on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying program, and pledge to keep interest rates low. But sources told Reuters last week the ECB will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement. Britain's elections are also on the market's radar, as they could determine whether the country has a smooth or hard exit from the European Union. A majority victory for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May would ensure a smooth transition out of the EU, analysts said. Opinion polls have shown May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government.

We could have used that strategy, but we didn't because we thought it was presumptuous to tell the (International Olympic Committee) what to do and how to think. We're better partners than that,  he said.  LA's primary focus is not on itself but rather on the Olympic movement and the world, he said.   That may be a surprising statement for an American bid; but, it shouldn't be because America's support for the Games has never wavered - ever,  he said.  LA is competing against Paris to host the 2024 Olympics. Some think the City of Lights is due after its bids for 1992, 2008 and 2012 were all rejected.

Briton Murray dropped serve twice in the opening set as the gremlins that have dogged his season briefly returned, but he was generally in charge after that against the eighth seed. Nishikori, who beat Murray in the quarter-finals of last year's U.S. Open, could not sustain his early form and although he courageously forced a third-set tiebreak he lost that 7-0. Murray, runner-up last year to Novak Djokovic, recovered an early break of serve in the fourth set and reeled off the last six games to set up a repeat of last year's semi-final when he produced a dazzling display to beat Stan Wawrinka. The 30-year-old Murray arrived at Roland Garros with genuine concerns over his form after a mediocre claycourt swing, but with coach Ivan Lendl watching over his shoulder he has rediscovered the winning mentality just in time. He might need another level, however, against Swiss former champion Wawrinka, who annihilated Marin Cilic 6-3 6-3 6-1.  I came in playing garbage,  Murray said.  You know, I'm the odd one out in the semis, but hopefully I can keep it up.  I didn't feel like I played great tennis today. But it's a huge step in the right direction for me.

Serving at 1-1, deuce in the second set Murray was bizarrely given a time violation warning by umpire Carlos Ramos after he had let an errant ball toss land -- prompting an exchange of views between the pair. Slideshow (6 Images)Coincidence or not, after that incident Murray was far more aggressive and began to take over.  I was frustrated about it, but I don't know how much impact that had on the match,  Murray said.  It's not like I played a great point the next point.  But I broke the following game. Kei played a poor game to break. I didn't do anything special, but that was a critical period of the match, because he started way better than me.  From then on I started to do a bit better.  Murray quickly leveled the match but after twice breaking in the third set, at 2-2 and 5-5, he handed the advantage straight back and needed a tiebreak to forge ahead.

Comey wrote that U.S. President Donald Trump pressured him into watering down the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into whether Russia meddled in the November vote. However, the details of Comey's testimony, expected to be delivered Thursday to a Senate Committee, had been previously reported, and appeared to be priced into the stock market. Investors were concerned that any additional revelation could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of lower taxes and lax regulations. Bets that Trump can implement his agenda are partly behind a rally that has taken stock indexes to record highs.  They were hoping that there wasn’t going to be anything in there that was more inflammatory,  said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions.  The testimony wasn’t as disastrous as it could have been,  he said of the prepared remarks, adding that the market was relieved no damaging details emerged and his testimony  more than likely isn’t going to blow up into some big fiasco, another thing that the president has to deal with.  [For Comey's full statement, see: bit.ly/JCJune8] Costa cautioned that the market's reaction to Comey's remarks was not a particularly big move up and volume is light. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.93 points, or 0.19 percent, to 21,176.16, the S&P; 500 gained 3.55 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,432.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.52 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,292.58. Wall Street was weighed by a near 2 percent drop in the S&P; 500's energy sector. All but two of the 34 components of the sector fell as U.S. crude futures tumbled more than 4 percent due to an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories. Brent crude fell nearly 4 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Signet Jewelers, which rose 4.3 percent, while the largest decliner was Newfield Exploration, down 6.8 percent. Investors are also keeping an eye on Britain's general election and the European Central Bank's policy meeting, both on Thursday. Opinion polls have shown Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government. The election comes as Britain maps its exit from the European Union following a referendum on the subject last year. The ECB is expected to reiterate its plan to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy at least until the end of the year. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The vote will decide whether May or her Labour Party rival Jeremy Corbyn takes control of Britain's exit from the European Union - a two-year negotiation which will plot a new course for the $2.6 trillion economy. The prime minister called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, to win more time to deal with the impact of the divorce and to strengthen her grip on the Conservative Party. While she is still expected to win, with a lead of between one percentage point and 12 points in polls released over recent days, financial markets are now digesting a bigger range of outcomes than they previously had considered. Landslide May Victory Sterling rallied in April when May called the vote as investors bet her then-large poll lead would translate into a big majority, reducing uncertainty over whether she would have the mandate required to negotiate on Britain's behalf and then drive the deal through parliament. The snap election pushes back the date of the next planned national election from 2020 - just after Britain is due to have quit the EU - to 2022, giving May more time to put the exit deal in place and potentially reducing political risk over how the deal is implemented. Some also take the view that a big majority would allow her to make compromises with Brussels, in contrast to a hardline approach to date that has prioritized issues like immigration and trade over access to Europe's lucrative single market. That all helped push sterling to an eight-month high of $1.3048 on May 18, since when it has weakened. U.S. bank Citi said a majority of more than 100 seats would lower the risk of a chaotic EU exit, but also reduce the chance that Britain could remain a member of the EU single market.  Ultimately, with a big majority for the Conservatives confirming a 'hard-but-smooth' Brexit base case, we think that abating uncertainty risks could see GBP/USD head towards 1.34 in the near term,  Citi strategists said in a note last month. May Wins With Enhanced Majority The Conservatives' lead fell sharply after May announced plans to make elderly voters pay more toward their old-age care, while Corbyn has gained ground thanks to popular policies such as renationalization and higher taxes for the rich. Whilst still broadly predicting May will improve on the 12-seat victory her predecessor David Cameron won in 2015, the narrowing polls suggest a majority that might fall well short of a 100-seat or more landslide. Bank analysts say that would not undermine the central scenarios which have helped the pound in the past month but might struggle to drive it much higher.  We think our base case (a 70-seat Conservative majority) will result in sterling rallying back to the $1.30-1.3150 range,  analysts from Canada's Bank of Montreal said in a note to clients.   Foremost, this would be the result of market relief that the most bearish result (a Labour victory) didn’t come to pass.  May Wins but No Overall Gains: 12-Seat Majority or Less If May does not handsomely beat the 12-seat majority  Cameron won in 2015, her electoral gamble will have failed, her ability to drive Brexit reform through parliament will be diminished and she will go into talks later this month looking weaker.  A betting shop worker carries a board displaying odds for scenarios in the general election outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London, Britain, June 7, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneThe converse view is that with less room for maneuver domestically, she will be able to reject compromises proposed by Brussels and drive a harder bargain, knowing that EU negotiators will not want May to execute her threat of leaving without a deal. For investors the over-riding factor is likely to be greater uncertainty about whether there will be a deal on Brexit and what it will look like.  Citi said anything less than a 40-seat majority could increase political risks and uncertainty for the Brexit process, pushing sterling lower.  May’s potential dependence on minorities such as hard Brexiteers or hard Remainers would raise the risk of 'chaotic Brexit', but also the chance of a much softer Brexit than she currently aims for,  analysts from the U.S. bank said. The near- to medium-term reaction would likely be a fall in sterling to $1.20, but with the potential for it to rise as high as $1.50 if the political situation evolved in a way that forced May to soften her demands on Brexit, they added. Hung Parliament: No Clear Winner Slideshow (2 Images)If neither main party wins a clear majority, markets will have to deal with considerable uncertainty over who will form the next government and what compromises the eventual prime minister will have to make to get the support of other parties. In 2010, when the Liberal Democrats held the balance of power, markets reacted to the uncertainty by selling sterling. This time round the choice is likely to be even less clear, with the Liberal Democrats greatly reduced in number and the pro-EU Scottish National Party likely to have more influence. The Conservatives' positioning on Brexit and, to a lesser extent other domestic issues like austerity, makes it unlikely that it could find a willing coalition partner, making a Labour-led government the most likely outcome from a hung parliament. JP Morgan said that despite the uncertainty, that outcome could generate a rise for sterling.   A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite a negative for sterling,  analyst Paul Meggyesi said in a note distributed to media on Tuesday and sent to clients at the end of last week.  But in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-center parties ... might actually be GBP positive.  Corbyn Victory A clear win for Corbyn, whose less than two-year-old leadership has been marked by poor ratings, divisions among his party and a failed coup attempt, would force many investors to redraw their assumptions on both Brexit and the fiscal outlook. History shows that sterling tends to weaken on big moves towards Labour in the polls and analysts and London-based traders say they would be braced for an immediate dive in the pound if Corbyn won. Longer term, however, analysts from a number of banks highlight the potential for both more borrowing to fund economic stimulus and the increased likelihood that Corbyn will negotiate a closer trading relationship with the EU than May would have done.  At first GBP may suffer as a result from the UK shifting to the left-leaning side of politics and investors’ expectations of larger deficit financing,  analysts from Japan's Nomura said in a note.  But because of the higher real yields we would expect and hopes of a soft Brexit - or indeed no Brexit at all - this should eventually provide support to the currency.

Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6.SA), known as Eletrobras, and Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA (CMIG4.SA), known as Cemig, plan to divest generation and transmission assets, including their stakes in some of Brazil's largest hydroelectric dams - Santo Antônio and Belo Monte. Large Chinese strategic investors will probably be the winning bidders for the dams, because the size of the projects fit their strategies better and they would be willing to pay more, said Tiago Figueiró, who is part of the team involved in electricity industry issues at São Paulo-based law firm Veirano Advogados.  It would be pretty hard to attract an American or European investor for a project of that size,  he said. Chinese power conglomerates have gradually become the dominant force in Brazil's electricity industry, where high debt, a harsh recession and less stringent takeover barriers than in other major markets have stoked a wave of acquisitions. Eletrobras and Cemig are planning the divestitures in order to cut debt and cushion themselves from the impact of the harshest recession on record in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy.  Since the start of 2015, Chinese companies have been the buyers in most announced electricity mergers in Brazil, according to Thomson Reuters deals intelligence data.  Brazil has been the No. 1 M&A; global destination for China's State Grid Corp [STGRD.UL], the world's largest utility, since 2010, accounting for 43 percent of the $37 billion it spent on acquisitions during that period, Thomson Reuters data showed.

José Oliva, a lawyer at São Paulo-based Pinheiro Neto Advogados, said the Eletrobras and Cemig asset sale plans are unlikely to be much affected by ongoing political turmoil in Brazil, as power sector acquisitions are perceived as a long-term investment. Cemig, which is controlled by the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, has included wind farms and small power dams in a divestiture plan worth 6.5 billion reais ($1.83 billion).  Eletrobras - Brazil's largest power holding company - is selling stakes in more than 100 projects, from which it could fetch around 5 billion reais.

Alphabet's Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. The document in question is a due diligence report on Levandowski's startup prepared by Uber during its acquisition talks with the firm in 2016. Waymo has been seeking a copy of the report as part of its preparation for trial, but Uber has refused to turn it over, citing attorney-client privilege. The dispute was reviewed by a magistrate judge, who issued a ruling under seal earlier this week, meaning the outcome was known only to Uber and Waymo. A U.S. federal judge, who is overseeing the case, made reference to the ruling in court on Wednesday, making it clear the magistrate judge had sided with Waymo.  Are you appealing the ruling against you on the due diligence report?  U.S. District Judge William Alsup asked Uber's lawyers in court in San Francisco on Wednesday. Uber attorney Karen Dunn told Alsup the company will likely decide its next steps by tomorrow. If Uber does not prevail on appeal, the due diligence report would be turned over to Waymo lawyers. It is unclear whether the entire report, or portions of it, would ultimately become public. At a court hearing last month, Alsup said the report was a potential  treasure trove  that would shed light on what Uber executives knew of Levandowski's actions. Levandowski is not a defendant in the case, but his actions, and what Uber executives knew about them, are at the center of Waymo's lawsuit. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets but has fired Levandowski. A trial is scheduled for October.

From its San Francisco base, Canvas started offering variable-term leases with flexible payment options to Bay area customers in early May, with plans to eventually roll out the service to other cities.  Canvas's roots date back to an earlier startup called Breeze.  Our mission is to identify, test and launch financial products that meet the changing needs of consumers,  said Ned Ryan, co-founder of Breeze and chief executive officer of Canvas, in an interview. The focus on consumers, including those who might not qualify for conventional auto leases or don't want to make long-term financial commitments, is a pivot from Breeze's original mission, which was to provide short-term vehicle leases to ride-sharing drivers who worked mainly for Uber and Lyft. When both ride-sharing firms began offering lease plans of their own, including short-term financing deals through General Motors Co's (GM.N) Maven subsidiary, the potential market for Breeze thinned markedly and the company ceased operations in July 2016. Seeing a related opportunity and a broader audience, Ford Credit acquired the assets of Breeze, along with many of its executives and employees, in November 2016 and rebranded the company as Canvas. Ford Credit recognized  the need for financial services and technology to facilitate our future vision of mobile,  said David McClelland, executive vice president of marketing and sales. The Breeze acquisition gave Ford Credit access to a web-based platform and month-to-month vehicle  subscriptions  that bundle maintenance, insurance and roadside assistance, aimed at younger, non-traditional drivers. Because Canvas buys used Ford vehicles coming off lease, it also gives the automaker a new source of revenue and another way to manage used-car values, which have plummeted in recent months. Unlike Breeze, Canvas does not compete head-to-head with Maven, which offers ride-sharing drivers short-term leases on new Chevrolet Bolt EV electric vehicles and used GM vehicles, through such programs as Maven Gig and Lyft Express Drive.  Canvas is aiming at consumers who want  a simpler, more flexible alternative to car ownership,  said Ryan.  We're addressing the void in the consumer space between daily rentals and long-term (financial) commitments.   The pitch, Ryan added, could not be more simple:  You just add the gas.

The vote was 92-7 on a procedural motion to end debate on the Iran sanctions bill, clearing the way for a vote later on passage of the legislation. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said most members of his party supported the Iran bill, but that they would only agree to let it go ahead because they expected it would be amended to include  a strong package  of new sanctions on Russia as well. Many lawmakers have been clamoring for new sanctions on Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for Syria's government in that country's six-year-long civil war. Schumer said he was negotiating with the Senate's Republican leaders on the Russia sanctions. Some senators had urged that Wednesday's procedural vote be delayed, arguing that the timing was inappropriate because of the attacks in Iran.  The country has just suffered from two significant terrorist attacks after electing a moderate government with 57 percent of the vote — we need to give Iran the opportunity to recover and set a new course,  Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement. A senior Senate aide said the Iran sanctions measure could come up for a vote as soon as next week. The legislation would impose new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile development, arms transfers, support for Islamist militant groups and human rights violations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed it 18-3 last month. To become law, the measure would also have to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane left the coastal town of Myeik at 1:06 p.m (0636 GMT), heading north to Myanmar's largest city of Yangon on a regular weekly military flight that stops at several coastal towns along the way, officials said. The plane lost contact 29 minutes after take-off while flying at 18,000 feet (5,485 meters) over the sea, about 43 miles (70 km) west of the town of Dawei, the military said.  We don't know what exactly happened to this plane after the loss of contact,  said Kyaw Kyaw Htey, a civil aviation official at Myeik airport. Civil aviation authorities initially said there were 105 people onboard. The military later said those on board included 106 soldiers and their family members and 14 crew. The maximum capacity of the aircraft was 200 people, said a military officer. It is monsoon season in Myanmar, but Kyaw Kyaw Htey said the weather had been  normal  with good visibility when the plane took off. The military launched a search soon after the plane went missing, mobilizing six navy ships and three military planes, said the army in a news release. The search continued as darkness fell.  Some 300-400 people, including firefighters, medics, emergency and welfare officials, gathered on the shore near the town of Launglon, close to the area where the navy search was concentrated, said Naing Myo Thwin, the chairman of the local funeral association, from the scene.  We haven't seen any trace of the plane yet,  Naing Myo Thwin told Reuters by telephone. He doubles as a member of the local hospital's emergency team. Aung Win, a local police officer also speaking from the scene by telephone, confirmed that there were a large number of people gathered on the beach. He said because they had not found any trace of the plane they were moving to other areas along the shore. The aircraft was bought in March 2016 and had a total of 809 flying hours. It was carrying 2.4 tons of supplies, the military said. Aircraft incidents, both civilian and military, are not uncommon in the Southeast Asian country.  A military helicopter crashed in June last year in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel on board.  Five military personnel were killed last February after an air force aircraft crashed in the country’s capital Naypyitaw, according to media reports.

Trump,Randy Johnson,USA,LABOR/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday said it was rescinding the Obama administration's standard for determining when companies are  joint employers  of contract and franchise workers, in the agency's first major shift in labor policy under President Donald Trump. The department in a statement said it had withdrawn a 2016 interpretation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that expanded the circumstances under which a business could be held liable for wage-law violations by staffing agencies, contractors, and franchisees. The move restores a previous standard under which companies are joint employers only when they have a role in hiring, firing, and setting wages. The Obama administration said a worker's level of  economic dependence  on a company should also be considered. The expanded definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would draw companies into lawsuits when they were not responsible for setting working conditions. Also on Wednesday, the department withdrew 2015 guidance that said that under the same law, many workers are improperly treated as independent contractors when they are actually employees, which would make them eligible for minimum wage, overtime, and other legal protections. Guidance issued by federal agencies is not legally binding, but serves as a blueprint for how agencies will enforce federal laws. A shift in enforcement priorities at the Department of Labor had been widely expected since President Donald Trump, a Republican and wealthy businessman from New York, took office. Business groups have said the department's guidance on employment and worker classification was misguided and affected nearly every U.S. industry, and they praised the agency's changes on Wednesday. “Diligent employers work hard to be compliant with the FLSA and these (department) interpretations were merely enforcement traps waiting to spring,  Randy Johnson, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Several business groups said they would continue to push Congress to pass more business-friendly laws on joint employment and worker classification. The department's move does not affect a separate expansion of the definition of joint employment by the National Labor Relations Board, which is currently under review by a federal appeals court. The NLRB's standard is more effective than the labor department's because it is legally binding and requires joint employers to bargain with workers' unions.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-labor-idUSL1N1J41MF"},

From its San Francisco base, Canvas started offering variable-term leases with flexible payment options to Bay area customers in early May, with plans to eventually roll out the service to other cities.  Canvas's roots date back to an earlier startup called Breeze.  Our mission is to identify, test and launch financial products that meet the changing needs of consumers,  said Ned Ryan, co-founder of Breeze and chief executive officer of Canvas, in an interview. The focus on consumers, including those who might not qualify for conventional auto leases or don't want to make long-term financial commitments, is a pivot from Breeze's original mission, which was to provide short-term vehicle leases to ride-sharing drivers who worked mainly for Uber and Lyft. When both ride-sharing firms began offering lease plans of their own, including short-term financing deals through General Motors Co's (GM.N) Maven subsidiary, the potential market for Breeze thinned markedly and the company ceased operations in July 2016. Seeing a related opportunity and a broader audience, Ford Credit acquired the assets of Breeze, along with many of its executives and employees, in November 2016 and rebranded the company as Canvas. Ford Credit recognized  the need for financial services and technology to facilitate our future vision of mobile,  said David McClelland, executive vice president of marketing and sales. The Breeze acquisition gave Ford Credit access to a web-based platform and month-to-month vehicle  subscriptions  that bundle maintenance, insurance and roadside assistance, aimed at younger, non-traditional drivers. Because Canvas buys used Ford vehicles coming off lease, it also gives the automaker a new source of revenue and another way to manage used-car values, which have plummeted in recent months. Unlike Breeze, Canvas does not compete head-to-head with Maven, which offers ride-sharing drivers short-term leases on new Chevrolet Bolt EV electric vehicles and used GM vehicles, through such programs as Maven Gig and Lyft Express Drive.  Canvas is aiming at consumers who want  a simpler, more flexible alternative to car ownership,  said Ryan.  We're addressing the void in the consumer space between daily rentals and long-term (financial) commitments.   The pitch, Ryan added, could not be more simple:  You just add the gas.

Apple Inc customers will soon have more choices as the company looks to reduce long wait times for iPhone repairs at its retail stores. By the end of 2017, Apple will to put its proprietary machines for mending cracked iPhone glass in about 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries, company executives told Reuters.  Among the first recipients is Minneapolis-based Best Buy, which has long sold and serviced Apple products. The electronics retailer already has one of the screen-repair machines at a Miami-area store and one coming soon to an outlet in Sunnyvale, California.  Fixing cracked screens may seem like small potatoes, but it's a multi-billion-dollar global business. The move is also a major shift for Apple. The company had previously restricted use of its so-called Horizon Machine to its nearly 500 retail stores and mail-in repair centers; and it has guarded its design closely.  The change also comes as eight U.S. states have launched  right to repair  bills aimed at prying open the tightly controlled repair networks of Apple and other high-tech manufacturers. Apple said legislative pressure was not a factor in its decision to share its technology. It allowed Reuters to view and photograph the machines in action at a lab near its Cupertino, California headquarters. Until now, Apple had never formally acknowledged the Horizon Machine's existence. The initial rollout aims to put machines in 200, or about 4 percent, of Apple's 4,800 authorized service providers worldwide over the next few months. The company plans to double that figure by the end of the year.  We've been on a quest to expand our reach,  said Brian Naumann, senior director of service operations at Apple. He said repair wait times have grown at some of the company's busiest retail stores. Pilot testing started a year ago. In addition to Miami, a few machines already are operating at third-party repair centers in the Bay Area, London, Shanghai and Singapore. Shops in some countries where Apple has no retail presence will also be early recipients, including locations in Colombia, Norway and South Korea. Apple would not say how much its partners are paying for the equipment. To be sure, any mall repair kiosk can replace a cracked iPhone screen. Apple says its customers can get their devices fixed at non-authorized shops without voiding their warranties as long as the technician caused no damage. But the Horizon Machine is needed to remedy the trickiest mishaps, such as when the fingerprint sensor attached to the back of the glass gets damaged when a phone is dropped. For security, only Apple's fix-it machine can tell the iPhone's processor, its silicon brain, to recognize a replacement sensor. Without it, the iPhone won't unlock with the touch of a finger. Banking apps that require a fingerprint won't work either, including the Apple Pay digital wallet.  Right to Repair  Gaining Steam Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones worldwide, many to customers who don't live near an Apple Store or an authorized third-party repair center. For fixes, many have turned to mom-and-pop shops and independent technicians that now dominate the trade. Research firm IBISWorld estimates the global cell phone repair business generates about $4 billion in revenue per year. Many of these entrepreneurs do good work. Some don't. All use copycat parts because Apple, like other major manufacturers, doesn't supply original parts or repair manuals to anyone but authorized service partners. Big companies defend this arrangement as the only way they can guarantee high-quality repair work and keep hackers away from the proprietary software that makes their products tick. Consumer advocates, however, say their aim is to wring outsized profits from repairs. Independent technicians often charge less than the cost of a factory fix.  A broken Apple iPhone repaired by a third party service provider is seen at Apple's display repair laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, U.S., May 19, 2017.Stephen LamEnter right-to-repair bills. New York, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas and Wyoming have introduced legislation looking to aid small shops and do-it-yourself tinkerers. These proposed measures would require manufacturers to supply repair manuals, diagnostic tools and authentic replacement parts at fair prices to independent technicians and the general public.  Apple, heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc and medical device maker Medtronic Plc have lobbied against New York's bill. In Nebraska, Apple sent its state and local lobbying chief Steve Kester to visit the Republican lawmaker sponsoring that state's measure.  Apple is telling me this is a bad thing because you're going to have a mecca for hackers in Nebraska,  State Sen. Lydia Brasch said of Kester's February visit.  Apple hasn't commented on the bills, but a trade group it belongs to contends the Nebraska measure would force the company to divulge how it secures sensitive data on the iPhone.  Think about how much of our personal lives are in this device,  said Mike Lanigan, head engineer for Apple's service efforts. Slideshow (20 Images)Inside the Lab Apple got into the screen-fixing business just three years ago with the introduction of the iPhone 5. Up until then, customers whose phones were out of warranty paid a  repair  fee, but Apple simply replaced the entire phone. Lanigan said customers have been requesting repair service since shortly after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, but the company waited until it could perfect the process.  We view the service aspect of this as all part of the overall Apple experience,  Lanigan said. Apple doesn't break out repair revenue in its financial statements. Analysts estimate it at $1 billion to $2 billion annually for all products.  As Apple's screen mending has matured, its prices have dropped to $129 to $149, depending on screen size, from $229. That's competitive with many independent shops for newer iPhones. Still, some technicians charge as little as $60 to fix older models.  Apple says its process aims to make the display look like it just came out of the box. To demonstrate, the company allowed Reuters to observe the Horizon Machine at a repair lab in Sunnyvale, California.  In the cavernous, brightly lit lab painted in Apple's signature sparkling white, two lab technicians clad in T-shirts, shorts and tennis shoes scurried between rows of long white metal tables stuffed with test equipment. Dozens of Horizon Machines lined the tables. The contraptions, gray metal boxes the size of a microwave with a swing-out windowed door, vary slightly in shape depending on the model of iPhone they repair. Apple would not say where the machines were made or by whom. In a smaller training room, a technician laid out the tools Apple uses to fix iPhone screens: special screwdrivers for the iPhone's five- and three-lobed screws, a custom suction-cup for loosening the screen without tearing the delicate ribbon cables behind it, and a press to squeeze iPhone 7s to ensure waterproofing. Once the new screen is mounted, the iPhone goes into the Horizon Machine, which allows Apple's software to communicate with the fresh hardware. Over the course of 10 to 12 minutes, the machine talks to the phone's operating system to pair the fingerprint sensor to the phone's brain. While that unfolds, a mechanical finger jabs the screen in multiple places to test the touch-sensitive surface. The machine also fine tunes the display and software to match the precise colors and calibration of the original.  We design for a customer experience that exceeds anything our competitors try to do,  said Naumann, Apple's service chief.  We endeavor to make it right at the same standard as when the customer bought the product.

San Francisco-based Uber charges lower fares than rival ride hailing apps. In Britain, its competitors' fares include 20 percent value added tax (VAT) on booking fees, but Uber's fares do not. Uber is able to avoid VAT by exploiting a loophole in how the tax is collected for business-to-business sales across EU borders, which arises because it treats its 40,000 UK drivers as separate businesses, each too small to register for VAT. It confirmed to Reuters that it does not pay value added tax on the fees it charges British drivers. By contrast, two of its main UK rivals, Gett and mytaxi, both said they do pay VAT on their fees. They declined to comment on Uber's practice. The loophole applies in other European countries too, but is particularly important for Uber in Britain which accounts for a third of its European business. Other EU countries have put tighter rules in place to close or narrow the loophole. Paying VAT on Uber's fees would cost the company about 1,000 pounds a year on average for each of its UK drivers, based on information Uber has given about the size of its British business, which is growing rapidly under its expansion plans. Uber told Reuters it respected the tax rules in all the countries where it operated. Asked whether avoiding paying value added tax gave the company an unfair advantage over its rivals, a spokesman said:  The same rules apply to any international service provider with customers in the UK.  Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the UK tax authority, declined to comment on Uber, citing confidentiality rules. A spokesman said:  Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we make sure they do.  Three European tax experts consulted by Reuters said Uber's practice probably complies with the way Britain has decided to implement EU rules. But Margaret Hodge, a member of Britain's Labour Party who has long led parliamentary investigations into corporate tax avoidance, criticized Uber’s practice of not paying VAT on its fees, when told of it by Reuters.  It is yet another example of how large companies find loopholes and use the law for a purpose for which it was never intended,  she said.  There is a failure to pay tax that should be due. That reduces the money available for public services and is unfair on Uber’s competitors.  The same loophole is used by other companies such as Google and Facebook to avoid VAT on certain transactions involving small businesses, but the benefit is more important for Uber, since the fees it charges drivers are its main source of income. Even as Uber has become a transportation powerhouse around the world, opponents, including established taxi operators, have mounted legal and public relations attacks on the Silicon Valley company, saying it owes its success to bending the rules. Several high level executives have left Uber in recent months, and its CEO was forced to apologize after being filmed haranguing one of its drivers. It has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate its corporate culture, including accusations of sexual harassment. In Europe, the lead advocate to the European Court of Justice concluded in May that Uber is a transportation service, not an information platform, and therefore open to far greater regulation. In the United States it also faces a Justice Department criminal investigation into software used to prevent law enforcement officials from hailing Uber cars, to shield the company from regulators. Despite those troubles, Uber has been growing rapidly, rolling out its service in new cities month by month. Reverse Charge FILE PHOTO -  A man arrives at the Uber offices in Queens, New York, U.S. on February 2, 2017.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoUber avoids having to charge British value added tax on its booking fees by treating each driver as an individual business and then billing drivers across EU borders from its Dutch subsidiary, using an EU VAT provision called the  reverse charge . The rule lets businesses sell goods or services to other businesses across EU borders without paying VAT. There is usually no loss of tax revenue, because the importing business collects VAT from its own customers. But since Uber drivers mostly generate less than the 85,000 pounds a year sales threshold to register for VAT in Britain, they don't have to collect it. Gett and mytaxi both bill their drivers from companies within Britain. As the reverse charge does not apply to domestic sales, that means that unlike Uber they must charge drivers VAT. Uber is not the only big American firm to use EU reverse charge rules to reduce the VAT tab when billing small business clients across EU borders. Google and Facebook use the same approach when selling from their Irish regional headquarters.  That means British plumbers or guesthouse owners who are not registered for VAT can buy advertisements from Google or Facebook without being charged the tax, even though they would pay it when placing an advertisement in a local newspaper.  It is a system failure because the rules are not harmonized in respect of dealing with small businesses,  said Pascal Schrijver, a partner with Deloitte in Amsterdam. Google (GOOGL.O) said it followed all tax rules. Facebook (FB.O) declined comment. The EU's reverse charge regime was intended to cut paperwork required to distribute VAT revenue among EU countries by placing the responsibility for collecting it on the importing country. It was not intended to allow companies to escape VAT altogether, said Laurent Lattmann, a VAT partner with advisory Taxand in Zurich.  A supplier should not use the reverse charge if they are selling to a customer without a VAT registration,  Lattmann said. Other EU countries often have lower sales thresholds to register for VAT, and several have systems in place to ensure that buyers that are not VAT-registered pay the missing tax when they import goods or services VAT-free across EU borders. Germany has imposed a requirement on non-VAT registered businesses to complete a special form and pay the tax when they import reverse-charged goods or services, said Barbara Fleckenstein-Weiland, tax lawyer with Flick Gocke Schaumburg in Frankfurt. Erwin Boumans, Brussels-based tax partner at accountants BDO said Belgium had a similar system.  The cultural attitude of tax authorities is very different from country to country. The UK has historically taken a light touch approach,  said Nicholas Hallam, Chief Executive of UK VAT advisory Accordance.  Treading Water  Uber is privately-held and does not publish accounts, but says it has more than 40,000 drivers in Britain who each bring in an average of around 560 pounds a week in gross fares. It normally charges fees of 20-25 percent of the fare. That suggests the company is collecting more than 200 million pounds a year in fees on more than 1 billion in UK fares, and saving at least 40 million by not paying VAT. Uber declined to comment when presented with those calculations. If Uber were forced to pay VAT on its fees and tried to pass the extra cost on to drivers, many would quit, said Jason Shepherd, a London Uber driver who moved with his wife and kids into his in-laws' house to make ends meet.  Most Uber drivers are just treading water,  he said.  If Uber put up its fees I would immediately consider other options and I'm sure most other drivers would too.  James Farrar, an Uber driver trying to organize fellow drivers into a union, said typical drivers earn only around 6 pounds an hour after car rental, insurance and other costs.  Even with surge fares, it’s less than the minimum wage  of 7.50 an hour, he said. Uber says drivers who rent their cars earn more than 8 pounds an hour on average.

EU regulators arranged for Spain's biggest bank, Santander (SAN.MC), to take over Banco Popular, but only after wiping out the investments of the troubled lender's shareholders and junior creditors -- a move welcomed by financial markets which saw it as a possible template for other EU banking crises. Italy is struggling to resolve a crisis inside two regional banks, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which are in an even weaker position in terms of capital than Banco Popular, according to the EU official who declined to identified. Unlike Banco Popular, however, the official said the two Veneto banks lack a willing buyer like Santander. Without a buyer, the banks, which face a combined capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros ($7.2 billion), run the risk that regulators would wind them down and impose losses on senior creditors and large depositors -- which Banco Popular avoided. The Italian government is opposed to such a solution and will explore every alternative option, the official said. Financial markets, too, could react badly if senior creditors were to be hit in Italy. The two Veneto banks declined to comment.  Italy is home to the euro zone's fourth-largest banking industry, which holds a third of the bloc's total bad debts. However, both regulators and Rome have so far shown less willingness to take swift, decisive action there. Apart from the Veneto banks, which have been in crisis for two and a half years, Italy has also been propping up its fourth-largest lender, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). The EU last week gave a preliminary green light to a state bailout of the world's oldest lender after months of negotiations.   Stronger Hand The EU official said the  relatively successful  resolution of Banco Popular could in principle strengthen the case for winding down the two Veneto banks.  The resolution did not trigger negative reactions in the market because of the intervention of a solid bank,  the official added, noting that losses had been limited to ordinary shareholders and junior bondholders.  In Italy it is difficult to find buyers and the two (Veneto) banks are in worse solvency conditions. Popular went bust because of liquidity problems, not solvency.  A second source familiar with the two Veneto banks' situation said Italy cannot take much longer to resolve their worsening crisis.  The longer you wait, the smaller the chances of success,  the source said.    Spain has delivered a colossal lesson - a solution in a few days, within ECB rules and with a united banking sector stepping in.   The banks have already been bailed out last year by a special banking-rescue fund orchestrated by Rome and financed by dozens of private investors, including Italy's healthier banks. They have requested state aid like Monte dei Paschi, but negotiations have been trickier with Brussels, which has demanded an injection of additional private capital before any taxpayer money can be used. The two lenders have collectively lost 7.5 billion euros in direct funding in 2016 and are still bleeding deposits but continue to operate thanks to government-guaranteed liquidity. The EU has agreed that Rome can step in to provide capital as well, but it first requires that private investors stump another 1 billion euros. No bank has shown a willingness to invest more money in the two Veneto banks. Heavyweights Intesa SanPaolo (ISP.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) are the only two Italian lenders with a size that would allow them to take on a Veneto bank. However, Intesa has pointedly ruled out investing any more money in the two lenders and has always said it does not want to grow its domestic market share any further. UniCredit, meanwhile, has just completed a 13 billion euro share issue to clean up its balance sheet. writing by Silvia Aloisi, editing by Mark Bendeich and Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-popular-italy-idUSKBN18Y2OZ"},

The decision to intervene adds legal firepower to a whistleblower case brought by Los Angeles wheelchair user Mei Ling, and signals the government's belief it has a greater chance of success than typical of False Claims Act lawsuits. It also follows Los Angeles' agreement last August to settle litigation by several advocacy groups by spending at least $200 million over a decade to provide 4,000 affordable apartments for people with disabilities. A year earlier, the second most populous U.S. city committed to spending $1.3 billion over 30 years to fix broken sidewalks that critics called nightmares for wheelchair users. A spokesman for Democratic City Attorney Mike Feuer, Rob Wilcox, in a statement said Los Angeles would  vigorously fight  the lawsuit, which threatens to  divert tens of millions more from L.A. taxpayers to the federal treasury - without housing a single person. This abuse of power cannot stand.  The lawsuit accused Los Angeles of falsely certifying its compliance with the Fair Housing Act and other laws protecting the disabled, such as by setting aside 7 percent of multifamily units for people with impaired mobility, sight or hearing. Such compliance was a condition for the city of 4 million to receive U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funds. But the lawsuit said none of the HUD-funded multifamily housing in Los Angeles supported by CRA/LA, a city agency once called the Community Redevelopment Agency, had enough accessible units.  Denying people with disabilities equal access to public housing deprives one of the most disadvantaged groups in society of fair housing opportunities,  said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler of the Justice Department's civil division. The CRA/LA did not respond to requests for comment. Ling's lawyer, Scott Moore, said his client once spent three years in a homeless shelter because she could not find accessible housing, and even now cannot use her bathtub normally.  This is monumental for my client,  Moore said in an interview.  If cities think they can take the money, and only then try to make amends, then the False Claims Act has no meaning.  False Claims Act lawsuits let private whistleblowers sue on the government's behalf, and share in recoveries. The nonprofit Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley also sued on Ling's behalf.

The law, enshrined in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is due to expire on December 31 unless Congress votes to reauthorize it, but is considered vital by U.S. intelligence agencies. Privacy advocates have criticized the law though for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to millions of Americans without a search warrant. The push to make the law permanent may lead to a contentious debate over renewal of Section 702 in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties are deeply divided over whether to adopt transparency and oversight reforms.  We cannot allow adversaries abroad to cloak themselves in the legal protections we extend to Americans,  White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert wrote in an editorial  published in the New York Times newspaper on Wednesday. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking on behalf of other intelligence agency leaders, also told the Senate Intelligence Committee panel on Wednesday that the statute should be made permanent, saying it was necessary to keep the United States safe from national security threats.  NSA Director Rogers added that the law had been vital to preventing terrorism in allied countries as well. Fourteen Republican senators, including every Republican member of the Senate intelligence panel, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would make part of Section 702 permanent. The statute, which grants the National Security Agency a considerable freedom in the collection of foreigners' digital communications, normally comes with a  sunset  clause, meaning that roughly every five years lawmakers need to reconsider its impact on privacy and civil liberties. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats (2nd-R) testifies as he appears alongside acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe (L), Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (2nd-L) and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers (R) at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in Washington, U.S., June 7, 2017.Kevin Lamarque'Spy on Americans' Intelligence Director Coats said it was not feasible for the NSA to provide an estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are ensnared incidentally under Section 702.  Coats and other officials had previously told Congress they would attempt to share an estimate publicly before the statute expires. A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats  went back on a pledge.  Slideshow (5 Images)Privacy advocates criticized the push to make Section 702 permanent, arguing that regular reviews of the law were necessary to conduct appropriate oversight and prevent potential abuses.  After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant,  said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism. Last week, Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans' communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target.  Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.

A smoothly-executed rescue of Spain's Banco Popular lifted bank stocks in Europe, while oil prices suffered a steep slide after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in crude and gasoline inventories. U.S. light crude was last down 4.7 percent to $45.94 per barrel, with Brent 3.75 percent lower at $48.24. Struggling Banco Popular was absorbed by Spain's biggest bank Santander for a nominal 1 euro, the first use of a regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the 2008 financial crisis. The success of the process pushed shares in many major banks higher, supporting a recovery for Madrid's stock market that lost steam later in the day. European banking shares closed up 0.87 percent.  The market has taken Banco Popular as positive news because essentially this is not a bankruptcy but a sort of rescue, even if its subordinated bondholders have been sharply hit,  said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan. The bank rescue does, however, underline the risks to growth, banking and government debt burdens that are likely to delay a major switch in language and policy direction by the ECB at its meeting on Thursday. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.08 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.04 percent. The euro turned shaky after reports suggested the ECB would lower its inflation targets. It was last down 0.15 percent to $1.126.  Maybe tomorrow's ECB meeting sees nothing but platitudes and disappoints a market that is getting ahead of itself,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes.  But (for us) that would be a huge euro buying opportunity, because ECB normalisation is coming. And when it does, the euro simply won't be able to sustain undervalued levels for long.  The ECB meeting is one of three events that ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said had been dubbed 'Triple Threat Thursday,' an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride. Also on Thursday will be a surprisingly closely-fought British election and U.S. Senate testimony from Comey, the former FBI chief fired by President Donald Trump. In a written statement posted on the web on Wednesday, Comey said Trump asked him to back off from a probe into former national security advisor Michael Flynn and told Comey,  I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.32 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,177.55, the S&P; 500 gained 3.35 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,432.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.78 points, or 0.24 percent, to 6,289.84.  I don’t see anything in it that will lead to an imminent impeachment. We are not learning anything new. The market doesn’t see it as any worse than what we know right now. There is nothing criminal,  said Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle in Minneapolis. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony could take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhaul the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year. Treasury 30-year, 10-year and 2-year benchmark yields hit session highs after the release of Comey's written testimony.

Alphabet's Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after.  The document in question is a due diligence report on Levandowski's startup prepared by Uber during its acquisition talks with the firm in 2016.  Waymo has been seeking a copy of the report as part of its preparation for trial, but Uber has refused to turn it over, citing attorney-client privilege. The dispute was reviewed by a magistrate judge, who issued a ruling under seal earlier this week, meaning the outcome was known only to Uber and Waymo.  A U.S. federal judge, who is overseeing the case, made reference to the ruling in court on Wednesday, making it clear the magistrate judge had sided with Waymo.   Are you appealing the ruling against you on the due diligence report?  U.S. District Judge William Alsup asked Uber's lawyers in court in San Francisco on Wednesday.  Uber attorney Karen Dunn told Alsup the company will likely decide its next steps by tomorrow.  If Uber does not prevail on appeal, the due diligence report would be turned over to Waymo lawyers. It is unclear whether the entire report, or portions of it, would ultimately become public. At a court hearing last month, Alsup said the report was a potential  treasure trove  that would shed light on what Uber executives knew of Levandowski's actions. Levandowski is not a defendant in the case, but his actions, and what Uber executives knew about them, are at the center of Waymo's lawsuit. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets but has fired Levandowski. A trial is scheduled for October. Spokespeople for Uber and Waymo declined to comment.

Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said Boeing would leapfrog reported plans by Airbus (AIR.N) to update its hot-selling A321neo, as Boeing eyes a gap between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane.  We have looked at the mild and we have looked at the wild and I can tell you we know that if you are going to address that market, you need a new airplane,  Tinseth told Reuters after a two-day meeting of airline leaders in Mexico. Industry sources have said the mid-market development is pivotal for Boeing since it will spawn the industrial jigsaw, systems and cockpits likely to be used for the next plane after that, a three-aircraft replacement of Boeing's 737 cash cow. Getting the  production system  right now would partially allow Boeing to develop the next jet, which is expected to revolve around a model carrying 180 passengers, as an industrial spin-off of the mid-market one, albeit with major differences. This would result in significant cost savings and avoid  repeating a patchwork of different production architectures. Two further derivatives could extend that post-737 jet family to 160-210 seats, based on current market forecasts. Boeing has not yet talked about its plans beyond the mid-market plane, which is expected to enter service by 2025.  Boeing officials declined comment on the long-term options or specific details of the mid-market project, which one leasing company has dubbed  797 . Goodbye Steam Engine  For the mid-market jet, industry sources have said Boeing is settling on a family of two wide-body aircraft. These would effectively combine a twin-aisle cabin sitting on top of the reduced belly space of a single-aisle jet. The aim is to reduce wind resistance or drag and therefore operating costs.  However, it involves a risky gamble that airlines will not need to carry much paid cargo on the routes for which the airplane is designed, delegates at the airlines meeting in Cancun said. The two mid-market models, designed to carry about 220-260 passengers over 3,500 to 5,000 nautical miles (6,400-9,260 km), will also have a wing resembling the distinctive stiletto design of the 787 Dreamliner but with significant internal differences. Seen from the front, the outline of traditional metal airplane fuselages is usually closer to a true circle.  That allows pressurised air inside the cabin to push out uniformly in all directions, easing loads and removing the need for heavy strengthening materials.  That well-tested concept is as old as the steam engine. Carbon composites allow manufacturers to make complex pieces in one shape and are well suited to the more elliptical design that Boeing has in mind for the new mid-market fuselage. However, composites are more expensive to produce. Reuters reported last month that the new aircraft could be  built using cheaper and faster new production techniques without costly pressurised ovens, or autoclaves. That technology was used to weave the carbon wings of Russia's new MS-21 jet, which first flew last month. Airbus this week played down a project called A321neo-plus-plus in response to the Boeing mid-market jet, first reported by Reuters, and said it was always reviewing options.

S&P; cut its long-term rating of Qatar by one notch to AA- from AA and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning there was a significant chance of a further downgrade. The rating agency said Qatar's economy would suffer from the decision on Monday of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha. They accused it of supporting terrorism, a charge that Qatar denies.  We expect that economic growth will slow, not just through reduced regional trade, but as corporate profitability is damaged because regional demand is cut off, investment is hampered, and investment confidence wanes,  S&P; said. Another major rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, assesses Qatar at Aa3, which is equal to S&P;'s new rating. Fitch Ratings puts Qatar at AA. The U.S. dollar was bid as high as 3.6526 riyals in the spot market on Wednesday, its highest level since July 2005, according to Thomson Reuters data. The riyal is pegged at 3.64 to the dollar by the central bank, which only allows small fluctuations around this level. In the offshore forwards market, which banks use to hedge against the risk of future moves in the spot rate, the riyal dropped as far as a 550-point premium against the dollar, its lowest level since December 2015, when tumbling oil and gas prices were raising doubts about the future of Gulf economies. A Saudi man shows Saudi riyal banknotes at a money exchange shop, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, January 20, 2016.Faisal Al Nasser/File PhotoThe low in the forwards market only implied the riyal would depreciate about 1.5 percent in the next 12 months. But it showed there were expectations of substantial outflows of money from Qatar in coming months. Qatar's stock index has tumbled 9.7 percent over the past three days, with high trading volumes suggesting some Gulf and international investors were bailing out of the market and sending their money home. Before this week's crisis, Gulf and international investors held only about 9 percent of Qatar's stock market, which had a capitalization of about $150 billion, bourse data showed. Even if all that foreign money flowed out, which is unlikely, it would probably not be enough to exert overwhelming pressure on the riyal to depreciate. Qatar remains one of the wealthiest countries per capita in the world, with an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund, and its liquefied natural gas exports are raking in a trade surplus of about $2.7 billion every month. These exports are expected to continue despite the sanctions. A Qatari central bank official told Reuters on Tuesday that the country had huge foreign reserves that it could use to support its currency if needed. Nevertheless, as S&P; noted, Qatar's banking system has in recent years become more dependent on loans and deposits from Gulf and international banks, and it could face a major outflow if that money is withdrawn because of diplomatic tensions. The foreign liabilities of Qatari banks ballooned to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015, central bank data shows.

Newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, portrayed by rivals as weak on security during the presidential campaign, ordered the task force to be set up last month to steer France's multiple security agencies from his Elysee Palace offices.  The performance of France's intelligence services has come under close scrutiny since the November 2015 attacks on Paris, when militant gunmen and suicide bombers struck entertainment venues across the capital, killing 130 people. In total, more than 230 people have been killed in a wave of attacks in France either claimed by or inspired by Islamic State over the past two-and-a-half years. In Tuesday's attack, a 40-year-old Algerian student armed with a hammer and kitchen knives shouted  this is for Syria  as he struck at and wounded a policeman, before being shot by police officers.  A source close to the investigation named the assailant as Algerian-born Farid Ikken, a PhD student of communications registered since 2014 at a university in the eastern city of Metz. The source said that a video in which Ikken pledged allegiance to Islamic State had been found in his flat in Cergy-Pontoise, northwest of Paris, during a police raid on Tuesday evening, after the attack. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner said the assailant had not previously  shown any signs of radicalization .

But he said he  fell off his chair  when he saw the news of his implication in an attack.  When I knew him he was pro-West and very much a supporter of democratic values. There was never any outward sign of excessive adherence to Islam,  Arnaud Mercier, Ikken's thesis tutor, told BFM TV.  The only thing I knew he denied himself was alcohol but not drinking alcohol does not make you an Islamist.  Mercier said he last saw Ikken in June 2016, and was surprised when his student failed to reply to his message in November saying they needed to arrange a meeting.   Government spokesman Castaner said that Iken was being held in custody in hospital and that his words  this is for Syria  meant his attack was being treated as a terrorist incident.  Macron on Wednesday appointed Pierre de Bousquet de Florian to head the new intelligence task force known as the National Centre for Counter Terrorism. It will be under the direct authority of the president. The new task force chief once headed France's DST internal  intelligence service, which was disbanded under former president Nicolas Sarkozy. It will include some 20 people representing the various security services and operate 24 hours, seven days a week.  This has been created to ensure that the intelligence services truly cooperate,  said a French presidency official. Macron also named career diplomat Bernard Emie, who served as ambassador to Britain, Turkey, Libya and Jordan, as head of the DGSE external intelligence service.

The law, enshrined in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is due to expire on December 31 unless Congress votes to reauthorize it, but is considered vital by U.S. intelligence agencies. Privacy advocates have criticized the law though for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to millions of Americans without a search warrant. The push to make the law permanent may lead to a contentious debate over renewal of Section 702 in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties are deeply divided over whether to adopt transparency and oversight reforms.  We cannot allow adversaries abroad to cloak themselves in the legal protections we extend to Americans,  White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert wrote in an editorial  published in the New York Times newspaper on Wednesday. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking on behalf of other intelligence agency leaders, also told the Senate Intelligence Committee panel on Wednesday that the statute should be made permanent, saying it was necessary to keep the United States safe from national security threats.  NSA Director Rogers added that the law had been vital to preventing terrorism in allied countries as well. Fourteen Republican senators, including every Republican member of the Senate intelligence panel, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would make part of Section 702 permanent. The statute, which grants the National Security Agency a considerable freedom in the collection of foreigners' digital communications, normally comes with a  sunset  clause, meaning that roughly every five years lawmakers need to reconsider its impact on privacy and civil liberties. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats (2nd-R) testifies as he appears alongside acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe (L), Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (2nd-L) and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers (R) at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in Washington, U.S., June 7, 2017.Kevin Lamarque'Spy on Americans' Intelligence Director Coats said it was not feasible for the NSA to provide an estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are ensnared incidentally under Section 702.  Coats and other officials had previously told Congress they would attempt to share an estimate publicly before the statute expires. A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats  went back on a pledge.  Slideshow (5 Images)Privacy advocates criticized the push to make Section 702 permanent, arguing that regular reviews of the law were necessary to conduct appropriate oversight and prevent potential abuses.  After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant,  said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism. Last week, Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans' communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target.  Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.

Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said Boeing would leapfrog reported plans by Airbus (AIR.N) to update its hot-selling A321neo, as Boeing eyes a gap between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane.  We have looked at the mild and we have looked at the wild and I can tell you we know that if you are going to address that market, you need a new airplane,  Tinseth told Reuters after a two-day meeting of airline leaders in Mexico. Industry sources have said the mid-market development is pivotal for Boeing since it will spawn the industrial jigsaw, systems and cockpits likely to be used for the next plane after that, a three-aircraft replacement of Boeing's 737 cash cow. Getting the  production system  right now would partially allow Boeing to develop the next jet, which is expected to revolve around a model carrying 180 passengers, as an industrial spin-off of the mid-market one, albeit with major differences. This would result in significant cost savings and avoid  repeating a patchwork of different production architectures. Two further derivatives could extend that post-737 jet family to 160-210 seats, based on current market forecasts. Boeing has not yet talked about its plans beyond the mid-market plane, which is expected to enter service by 2025.  Boeing officials declined comment on the long-term options or specific details of the mid-market project, which one leasing company has dubbed  797 . Goodbye Steam Engine  For the mid-market jet, industry sources have said Boeing is settling on a family of two wide-body aircraft. These would effectively combine a twin-aisle cabin sitting on top of the reduced belly space of a single-aisle jet. The aim is to reduce wind resistance or drag and therefore operating costs.  However, it involves a risky gamble that airlines will not need to carry much paid cargo on the routes for which the airplane is designed, delegates at the airlines meeting in Cancun said. The two mid-market models, designed to carry about 220-260 passengers over 3,500 to 5,000 nautical miles (6,400-9,260 km), will also have a wing resembling the distinctive stiletto design of the 787 Dreamliner but with significant internal differences. Seen from the front, the outline of traditional metal airplane fuselages is usually closer to a true circle.  That allows pressurised air inside the cabin to push out uniformly in all directions, easing loads and removing the need for heavy strengthening materials.  That well-tested concept is as old as the steam engine. Carbon composites allow manufacturers to make complex pieces in one shape and are well suited to the more elliptical design that Boeing has in mind for the new mid-market fuselage. However, composites are more expensive to produce. Reuters reported last month that the new aircraft could be  built using cheaper and faster new production techniques without costly pressurised ovens, or autoclaves. That technology was used to weave the carbon wings of Russia's new MS-21 jet, which first flew last month. Airbus this week played down a project called A321neo-plus-plus in response to the Boeing mid-market jet, first reported by Reuters, and said it was always reviewing options.

Zaghba was identified as a possible militant threat after he was stopped at Bologna airport in 2016 as tried to reach Syria. He was not charged, but local police monitored him carefully and tipped off Britain when he subsequently moved to London.  Our conscience is clear,  Franco Gabrielli, the head of the national police, told reporters while visiting the southern island of Lampedusa.  British authorities have said Zaghba had not been a subject of interest for them or the domestic intelligence agency MI5. Gabrielli said some police forces had been deluged with tip-offs about potential radicals, making it possible for some to slip beneath the radar.  It is very easy to speak with hindsight,  he said.  The issue of flagging (threats) is extremely complex and strictly tied to the amount of information that any one country is called on to process, which in some cases is an enormous amount.  That is why I am not going to criticize the behavior of others.  Zaghba's Italian mother, Valeria Khadija Collina, told reporters that she had informed police her son was missing after Saturday's attack. She said she thought he might have gone into hiding because she was aware he knew one of the slain attackers.  I was afraid. I thought, what is going to happen?

Revenue in Navistar's truck business, its biggest, fell 5.5 percent to $1.40 billion in the second quarter ended April 30. The results come in the backdrop of improving heavy truck orders. The orders had been declining as trucking companies adjusted their fleets amid lackluster retail sales and industrial output in the United States. Orders for Class 8 highway trucks in the United States, the 18-wheelers that haul freight across the country, soared 77 percent in April versus the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary data from industry forecaster FTR.

Exterior of Navistar office is seen in Lisle, Illinois, October 4, 2012.Jim YoungThe Lisle, Illinois-based company, which was once a leading maker of truck engines, is in the process of turning itself around after making a disastrous bet on a costly and unsuccessful proprietary smog-reduction system that did not meet regulatory standards. The company, which also makes school buses and dump trucks, has changed management, cut costs and redesigned its products, in a move to return to profitability.  Guidance calls for improved EBITDA in 2017 and a significantly stronger second half to the fiscal year on sequential improvements in the company's core markets,  Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said. Navistar said the $60 million charge was a result of a change in its sales strategy for its used MaxxForce 13 trucks to focus more on export sales. Net inventory on April 30 was $1.46 billion compared with $1.55 billion at the end of April last year. Net loss attributable to the company was $80 million, or 86 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $4 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.

Waymo has been seeking a copy of the report as part of its preparation for trial, but Uber has refused to turn it over, citing attorney-client privilege. The dispute was reviewed by a magistrate judge, who issued a ruling under seal earlier this week, meaning the outcome was known only to Uber and Waymo.  A U.S. federal judge, who is overseeing the case, made reference to the ruling in court on Wednesday, making it clear the magistrate judge had sided with Waymo.   Are you appealing the ruling against you on the due diligence report?  U.S. District Judge William Alsup asked Uber's lawyers in court in San Francisco on Wednesday.  Uber attorney Karen Dunn told Alsup the company will likely decide its next steps by tomorrow.  If Uber does not prevail on appeal, the due diligence report would be turned over to Waymo lawyers. It is unclear whether the entire report, or portions of it, would ultimately become public. At a court hearing last month, Alsup said the report was a potential  treasure trove  that would shed light on what Uber executives knew of Levandowski's actions. Levandowski is not a defendant in the case, but his actions, and what Uber executives knew about them, are at the center of Waymo's lawsuit. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets but has fired Levandowski. A trial is scheduled for October. Spokespeople for Uber and Waymo declined to comment.

In a bid to better manage the arena, which attracts more than 6 million visitors a year, the culture ministry declared in    January it would become the centerpiece of a new archaeological site, managed separately from the city's other attractions. But city hall, run by the 5-Star Movement, attacked the idea of spinning off the capital's open air museum, bristled at proposed changes to handling revenue, and appealed to the regional administrative court to block it. After the court upheld 5-Star's complaint on Wednesday, Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi tweeted,  The citizens have won ... Government attempt defeated. Rome still belongs to everyone.  Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, a member of the governing Democratic Party, said he would oppose the ruling. It was the second in two weeks to shoot down parts of a sweeping reform he began in 2014 to modernize and make more money out of Italy's vast cultural heritage.  The plan for the Colosseum and nearby Roman Forum included hiring a new director through an international search similar to one through which 20 other directors were hired last year, but which the court partly overruled last month. Franceschini says his changes to Italy's network of 400 state museums, some of which are also on its list of 51 UNESCO World Heritage sites, have borne fruit, with ticket revenue rising 12 percent last year to 172 million euros ($193 million). However, one of 5-Star's objections to the Colosseum plan was that it only guaranteed local authorities 30 percent of the park's roughly 35 million euros in net annual ticket sales, compared with 80 percent under the previous management. Franceschini furiously rebutted that, saying the new structure would still mean Rome kept all revenue apart from a 20 percent cut taken from all big sites to help fund smaller ones.  Despite rising revenue, Italy still earns less from its cultural wealth than European peers like France - whose Louvre museum alone rakes in 100 million euros a year - a situation long blamed on inefficiency and poor management.

The decision to intervene adds legal firepower to a whistleblower case brought by Los Angeles wheelchair user Mei Ling, and signals the government's belief that it has a greater chance of success than typical of False Claims Act lawsuits. It also follows Los Angeles' agreement last August to settle a lawsuit by several advocacy groups by spending at least $200 million over a decade to provide 4,000 affordable apartments for people with disabilities. A year earlier, the second most populous U.S. city committed to spend $1.3 billion over 30 years to fix broken sidewalks that critics called nightmares for wheelchair users. A spokesman for Democratic City Attorney Mike Feuer, Rob Wilcox, said in a statement that Los Angeles would  vigorously fight  the government's case, which threatens to  divert tens of millions more from L.A. taxpayers to the federal treasury - without housing a single person. This abuse of power cannot stand.  Los Angeles was accused of falsely certifying its compliance with federal laws protecting the disabled, including setting aside 7 percent of federally funded multifamily units for people with impaired mobility, sight or hearing. Such compliance, including with the federal Fair Housing Act, was a condition for the city of 4 million to receive funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the lawsuit said none of the HUD-funded multifamily housing in Los Angeles supported by CRA/LA, a city agency once called the Community Redevelopment Agency, had enough accessible units. It also said neither Los Angeles nor CRA/LA monitored whether  sub-recipients  of HUD funds complied with the laws.  Denying people with disabilities equal access to public housing deprives one of the most disadvantaged groups in society of fair housing opportunities,  said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler of the Justice Department's civil division. The CRA/LA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Scott Moore, an Omaha, Nebraska, lawyer representing Ling, and the nonprofit Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley, which also sued on Ling's behalf, did not immediately respond to similar requests. False Claims Act lawsuits let private whistleblowers sue on the government's behalf and share in recoveries. Ling's complaint has yet to be made public.

Bush,Jeffrey Wall,Mark Foster,Richard Painter,Thomas Morgan,Trump,US,OTC,ETHICS,Analyses,United States","sector":"Subjects","content":"(This post has been updated to add context.) (Quote in 8th paragraph may be objectionable to some readers.)  Ethics rules prohibit lawyers from presenting arguments in briefs and in court that they do not believe to be true. So how will President Trump’s defiant tweetstorm on Monday morning, disdaining the “watered down, politically correct” travel ban he signed after his original executive order was deemed unconstitutional, constrain Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall and his DOJ team as they attempt to reinstate the travel ban at the U.S. Supreme Court?  Ethics experts I consulted on Tuesday offered a wide range of opinions on that question, though they agreed the Justice Department will have to be careful not to take positions contradicted by Trump’s tweets. At best, the experts said, the solicitor general’s office can no longer argue that the president himself wanted the executive order only to pause immigration from six Muslim-majority countries temporarily so the U.S. can study its vetting procedures.  At worst, the Justice Department could be subject to an ethics inquiry about whether its lawyers knowingly misrepresented facts in their Supreme Court filings. I left a message at the SG’s office, asking about ethical concerns in light of the president’s tweets, but didn’t get a response.  The Justice Department’s June 1 petition for Supreme Court review of the en banc opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, holding the travel ban to violate the First Amendment, emphasizes the Trump administration’s core argument that the 4th Circuit erred in considering the president’s motives. According to the petition, Congress and the Supreme Court have agreed that the executive branch has extremely broad discretion to set immigration policies to assure national security.  The petition repeatedly refers to the “temporary” suspension of immigration from the affected countries, including in two of the three questions the filing presents. The words “travel ban” do not appear in the filing, and the only time the Justice Department uses the phrase “Muslim ban” is to say the executive order was not one.  The president’s tweets Monday – which affirmed his belief that “what we need” is “a TRAVEL BAN” – do not ethically constrain the Justice Department from continuing to argue for executive branch discretion to set immigration policy. But they do mean the solicitor general’s office can’t argue the president wanted only a temporary suspension of immigration to study vetting procedures. “You cannot say the president intends this to be a temporary ban if what he says implies that it will apply ad infinitum,” said Mark Foster of Zuckerman Spaeder.  Foster said the Justice Department can still make “artful” arguments that the Supreme Court should focus on the executive branch’s authority to do what the order actually sets out to accomplish without attempting to justify the president’s tweets. Thomas Morgan, an ethics professor at George Washington, also said in an email that the Justice Department’s ethical responsibility “is to argue the authority of any president to do what this one did, not to get bogged down in the content of the current president's Twitter posts.”  Both Foster and Morgan said, however, that Trump’s tweets will make those arguments more challenging for Justice lawyers. “Can they say it’s only a temporary ban if the president says that’s bullshit?” Foster said. “I think they’re in a tough spot. He’s put them in a tough spot.”  Or worse, according to former George W. Bush ethics counsel Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor and ardent Trump critic. Painter told me that if the acting SG and his colleagues knew or should have known the temporary immigration suspension was a pretext for President Trump to ban immigration from the affected countries, they may have committed ethical violations.  “There’s a prima facie case that their briefing was factually inaccurate,” Painter said, pointing to the petition’s emphasis on the temporary suspension of immigration from the affected countries. The president’s tweets, Painter said, make it clear that Trump wants a longer-lasting ban. So the key question, according to him, is whether Justice Department lawyers knew when they submitted the petition for Supreme Court review that the temporary suspension could be a pretext for more sweeping action.  “There’s significant evidence these lawyers were not honest,” Painter said. “The Supreme Court should make an inquiry.” He conceded that he doesn’t know if the justices have ever conducted such an ethics investigation but said that at the very least the court ought to ask the Justice Department what it knew about the president’s intentions at the time of its filing and whether DOJ presented the facts accurately.  In a follow-up interview, Painter could not point to specific evidence of dishonesty but said that in his experience, Justice Department lawyers assure themselves of the views of the White House before representing those views at the Supreme Court. He said that DOJ lawyers could not be faulted if President Trump’s tweets Monday represent a new White House position but said the president’s outburst suggests his views are long held.  Painter drew an analogy to a 2016 rebuke to the Obama Justice Department by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of Brownsville, Texas who sanctioned DOJ lawyers for allegedly misrepresenting the impact of its policy to defer deportation of certain undocumented immigrants. “All lawyers are expected to describe facts accurately to the court but I believe this obligation is higher when a Justice Department lawyer is explaining what the administration is doing,” Painter said.  Supreme Court litigator Andrew Pincus of Mayer Brown said Painter's theory is  entirely speculative.  Pincus, who was a lawyer in the Clinton administration and has represented amici in challenges to both Trump travel bans, said the Justice Department lawyers who filed the Trump administration's petition for Supreme Court review not only have impeccable records of public service but  almost certainly  did not interact with Trump himself.   These lawyers...had no reason to suspect, much less to know, any reason that the second order, signed by the president, should not be taken at face value,  Pincus said in a response to Painter's comments.  Given the history of last five months, it seems highly likely that the president’s tweets came as a surprise to these lawyers, along with the rest of the country.

Ministers from major economies signed the new tax pact at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, which said more countries were likely to join in the coming weeks. The new agreement will replace more than 1,100 bilateral tax treaties, or about a third of the treaties signed by countries over the last century to avoid double taxation. In the age of globalization, multinational countries have increasingly sent cross-border transactions through third countries to take advantage of their low taxes in what has come to be called treaty shopping. The new treaty sets minimum standards to avoid abuses and defines a company's taxable presence in a country, while also lays out plans for settling double taxation disputes between governments.  It's going to kill treaty shopping,  OECD tax policy director Pascal Saint-Amans told journalists. Under the new pact, countries have to state which provisions they sign up to and which they do not. In the coming weeks, governments will have to match their positions with others'.  This is something that companies are going to need to pay close attention to because the decisions countries make when they sign up to the MLI (multilateral instrument) will have very significant tax consequences,  said Jesse Eggert, principal in the international tax group of KPMG's Washington National Tax practice. Signatories include most major economies and countries known as treaty shopping hubs - such as the Netherlands, Belgium, the Seychelles and Singapore.  Mauritius, which is often used to route transactions with India because of its low tax, has also signalled that it will sign in the coming months, Saint-Amans said. One notable absence is the United States. Saint-Amans said that was not a concern because its bilateral treaties were already of high quality. The new pact is part of a broader OECD-led drive to prevent companies from taking advantages of differences between tax systems to cut their tax bills without outright breaking the law. The OECD estimates that governments are missing out on tax revenues worth as much as $250 billion annually, or 10 percent of global corporate tax revenue, as a result of what it calls base erosion and profit shifting. Countries that sign the new treaty now have to ratify it, which means that it will probably not start to affect companies directly until next year.

Pincus, a Democrat, is a onetime Clinton administration lawyer who has represented amicus clients challenging both the first and second Trump travel bans. I thank Pincus for his comments. -AF I was surprised and disappointed by Richard Painter’s entirely speculative assertions that “There´s significant evidence these lawyers were not honest” and “There´s a prima facie case that their briefing was factually inaccurate.” What is that significant evidence?

Jeff Wall has been a friend and colleague in the Supreme Court bar for years. He’s a terrifically talented lawyer and a very honorable person.  Ed Kneedler, a Deputy Solicitor General, is a national treasure. He’s worked in the SG’s office for 38 years and argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court. He knows more about the law, and works harder to defend the interests of the United States, than anyone I know. There is no more respected lawyer in the Supreme Court bar or honorable public servant in Washington.  Then there are three the Civil Division career lawyers who signed the cert petition – Doug Letter, Tom Byron and Sharon Swingle. I worked with Doug when I was a summer intern in DOJ’s Civil Division/Appellate Section in 1980 and on many matters since then; he’s been handling the government’s toughest appellate cases for more than 35 years. Tom and Sharon were associates at my law firm before they went into the government. Again: honorable diligent lawyers and public servants.  Why would these fine lawyers do anything that might possibly mislead the Supreme Court, and risk their sterling reputations?  I’d put everything I own on these lawyers acting ethically and honorably rather than on Richard Painter’s raw speculation.  There are a lot of very troubling things happening in Washington today. But unless we want the country to collapse completely, we need honorable people willing to serve.

The anxiety may have many causes, including actual brain damage or the experience of living in an anxious family environment after the injury, said Albicini, a researcher at Monash University School of Psychological Sciences in Melbourne, Australia.  Albicini’s team reports in the Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation that children with moderately severe brain injuries and females in general were at the greatest risk for long-term psychological effects compared with boys and children who had milder brain injuries. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs when an outside force, usually a blow to the head, causes some kind of brain dysfunction, such as loss of consciousness, amnesia or damage to brain tissue that’s visible on a scan. But more research is needed to fully understand the long-term psychological effects faced by people who experience TBIs during childhood, the researchers write. To explore the question they recruited young adults who had been treated at a New Zealand hospital for a traumatic brain injury five or more years earlier, when they were younger than 18 years old. For comparison, the researchers also recruited a similar group of young adults who were treated for childhood orthopedic injuries like broken arms or legs but had no history of brain injury.  Among the participants with childhood brain injury, 65 had mild injuries involving loss of consciousness for less than 20 minutes, little or no amnesia, a hospital stay of less than 48 hours and normal brain scans. Another 61 participants had moderate to severe brain injuries involving longer hospital stays, more severe or longer lasting symptoms and skull fractures or other physical evidence of brain injury that could be seen on a scan.   The average age at injury for those with mild TBI and those with orthopedic injuries was around 10-11 years old, while the participants with more severe TBIs were younger, around 7 years old on average, when they were injured. For most in the study group, it had been at least 10 years since their injury and for some, 15 or more years had passed.  Each person met with a psychologist for diagnostic interviews to screen for various psychological disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, phobias and depression. This revealed that compared to people with no brain injuries, those with any type of TBI were five times more likely to have an anxiety disorder.  People with past brain injuries were also about four times more likely to suffer from panic attacks, specific phobias and depression. Those with moderate-severe brain injuries had the highest overall rates of anxiety disorders and were most likely to suffer from multiple anxiety disorders at once.  However, women were four times more likely than men to have an anxiety disorder, regardless of whether they had a brain injury, the authors note.  “These results emphasize the need to monitor children and adolescents for the development of anxiety disorders after they have a TBI,” said Dr. Jeffrey Max, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn’t involved in the study. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the research did not look at the patients’ anxiety before their injury, making it difficult to determine if the anxiety was a complication of the injury, Max said.  “If TBI really causes an increased risk for anxiety disorder then research on this topic could help us understand the brain mechanisms and psychological mechanisms behind the development of anxiety disorders,” Max said. “While in most cases people recover 100 percent from brain injury, a select few may go on to experience anxiety, depression, or other ongoing psychological effects,  Albicini said. “More work needs to be done to help identify the risk factors for those people, and then how we can help them, to lessen the burden of brain injury,”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2qOpoep Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, online May 17, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-anxiety-brain-injury-idUSKBN18Y2S5"},

Aviation sector leaders gathered in Cancun, Mexico said they are concerned that President Donald Trump may reinstate some political and economic restrictions between the two Cold War-era foes.  The Trump administration is reviewing the Obama administration's moves to ease restrictions on travel and investment in Cuba. Trump has criticized the agreements by Obama to thaw relations with the Cuban government. Airlines, facing uncertainty about a U.S. policy that could make moot millions in recent investments, are loath to criticize the Trump administration's unpredictability, but the industry is unified in saying the thaw should continue.   Restricting the network of aviation and access to Cuba would be bad news for aviation. Generally we welcome the extension of access to any country by plane,  IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters ahead of the June 4-6 conference. The initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some of the early entrants have pulled out, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines.  Larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities to focus on service to the capital, Havana.  American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue have all requested increased frequency on various Havana routes. Those requests are in limbo pending the administration's review. U.S. cruise operators and airlines stand to lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel to Cuba, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a report last week. When the application process first opened in 2016, an arrangement between the two governments allowed for 20 daily flights to Havana. Cuba reported 4 million arrivals last year, of which 285,000 were Americans. Another 300,000 Cuban Americans visited but are not considered tourists.    'Americans Are Good Tippers' Eased travel restrictions have already dramatically reshaped Cuba's tourism scene, including the Nacional Hotel, which overlooks the Gulf of Mexico and entry to Havana Bay. Tourists now flood the back veranda of the iconic mammoth structure, paying triple the prices and spilling out of the previously half-empty space. Cruise ships, once a rarity in the Bay, now dot the shoreline, and Americans are no longer an unusual sight among visitors.  Meleny, a state tour guide, who asked her last name not be used, says she worries about Trump every night.   We will see what he does, but it would be a shame if he drops a bomb on all this. This job isn't great, but the Americans are good tippers and that is how I feed my kids and buy them shoes,  she said. American visitors to Cuba could increase as much as sevenfold by 2025, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. Given tourism infrastructure is already creaking, that means there are business opportunities aplenty but U.S companies must learn to navigate a centrally-planned economy. The United States still officially prohibits its citizens from visiting Cuba as tourists. However, travel between the two countries is easier now than it has been in more than half a century thanks to exceptions to that ban, which allow travelers to claim they are visiting family or engaging in business, cultural, religious or educational activities.     In a tweet shortly after his November election win, Trump threatened to  terminate  the relationship unless the Cuban government agreed to a number of political concessions. The administration could announce its review's findings as early as this month. Business industry leaders, particularly in the airline and travel industry, have been fearful of a repeal of Obama-era policies, appealing to Trump's pledge to keep  America First  by allowing continued business with the Caribbean island. Airlines have praised the opening of the travel market, under which general tourism is still restricted but a number of visa options exist for those seeking to visit the island.  The Caribbean is so core to JetBlue that we see Cuba as very important to us, longer term,  JetBlue, which has twice requested and been denied a Boston to Havana route, CEO Robin Hayes told Reuters.  Cuba continues to present many opportunities in the near- and long-term, said Peter Cerda, IATA regional VP for the Americas.   IATA has been working closely with the authorities in Cuba to launch a (billing and settlement plan), which will help with the selling of tickets to Cuban citizens … within the timeframe of 2017.

But the former mayor of a village in western France will  back Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire, a long-time conservative, in Sunday's parliamentary election. Across France, many other voters are also expected to switch parties in an election likely to reshape the political landscape after centrist Emmanuel Macron won the presidency last month.  Le Maire, standing as candidate for Macron's new party rather than the conservative The Republicans party he has represented for 10 years, is a high-profile test case. He is one of three conservatives serving in the new government of Macron - who was a minister in a Socialist government until he quit last year to launch his presidential bid.  I will vote for Mr Le Maire because he is working with Emmanuel Macron and I think that's a good thing,  said Bibes.  We need to change politics and I think he will do that.             Voters are choosing 577 members of parliament and a second round will take place on June 18. At a rally for Le Maire in a packed hall in the village of Angerville-la-Campagne, part of his Normandy constituency, conservative and centrist voters rubbed shoulders with left-wingers and voters with no party affiliation.  I've had my doubts,  said Jean-Pascal Levee, a right-winger who voted for failed conservative candidate Francois Fillon for the presidency in April.  But today it's very clear: we have to give the government a chance so that they can work for France.      An IFOP poll on May 28 forecast that Le Maire would attract 48 percent of the vote in the first round of the parliamentary election on June 11, just two points shy of the score required for a first-round victory.  That chimes with wider surveys that see Macron's Republic On the Move (LREM) party securing a solid majority in the lower house of parliament, overturning the Socialist majority in place since 2012. FILE PHOTO: French President Emmanuel Macron receives a gift on a trawler as he visits the harbour of Lorient, France, June 1, 2017.Stephane Mahe/File PhotoAmbiguity In other telling examples of shifting affiliations, Alain Juppe, a popular former conservative prime minister, gave his support to a former aide who is an LREM candidate in the wider Paris region, while Prime Minister Edouard Philippe backed Thierry Solere, a candidate for The Republicans. Philippe himself, like Le Maire, comes from The Republicans (LR) party, and there are LR candidates who openly say they will back Macron's reforms. FILE PHOTO: French President-elect Emmanuel Macron celebrates on the stage at his victory rally near the Louvre in Paris, France May 7, 2017.Christian Hartmann/File PhotoThat spells trouble for LR, which polls second but far behind Macron's party, and is very much divided on how its attitude towards the new president should be.   Our activists don't know which way to turn anymore because of an unprecedented ambiguity,  said Coumba Dioukhane, the candidate running for LR against Le Maire in the Normandy constituency.  Le Maire, who will have to give up his ministerial portfolio if he loses this election, is accused of betrayal by many in his former party. He told the rally that Philippe, budget minister Gerald Darmanin and himself  chose their country over their party.  Not all voters buy that. In the working class district of La Madeleine, 41-year old entrepreneur Isa Gorgulu said he would give his vote to Le Maire because he thought there was hope for change with Macron, though he accused him of playing politics by joining the new president.  They are thinking about their own interest, their own future,  he said.

The drug, upadacitinib, is a once-daily pill belonging to a class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors, which block inflammation-causing enzymes called Janus kinases. Pfizer Inc's Xeljanz is the only U.S.-approved JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis – a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks tissues in the joints, affecting more than 23 million people. AbbVie's success comes almost two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected baricitinib, a rival JAK inhibitor developed by Eli Lilly and Co and Incyte Corp. If approved, upadacitinib could help AbbVie lower its reliance on its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira – the world's top selling medicine that will soon face competition from biosimilars in the United States. AbbVie's shares were up 1.4 percent at $68.81 on Wednesday afternoon. They earlier hit a session high of $69.32, their highest since August 2015. In AbbVie's 12-week study on upadacitinib, two doses of the drug were tested against a placebo on patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie said 64 percent of patients given a 15-milligram dose and 66 percent of patients given a 30-mg dose experienced a 20 percent reduction in symptoms, measured using a commonly used rheumatoid arthritis scale. The company said only 36 percent of patients given a placebo experienced a comparable drop in symptoms, meaning upadacitinib cleared the trial – the first of six testing the drug on patients with various cases of rheumatoid arthritis. As data from the other trials comes in, upadacitinib might prove to be more effective than Lilly and Incyte's baricitinib, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said. Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with older drugs such as methotrexate, Pfizer's JAK inhibitor Xeljanz as well as injected biologics such as Amgen Inc's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira. Humira generated more than $16 billion in sales last year, but competition is looming. AbbVie is trying to block the launch of an FDA-approved biosimilar, made by Amgen, arguing that its patents on Humira offered protection until at least 2022. AbbVie is also evaluating upadacitinib for several other autoimmune conditions, including psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Holford estimated peak sales of $3.5 billion for the drug across all diseases. Pfizer's Xeljanz generated sales of $927 million last year.

That important caveat depends primarily on whether Athens can agree a debt deal with the euro zone and International Monetary Fund next week that is good enough to convince the ECB, which meets on Thursday, to come on board. It remains enough of an uncertainty that officials involved in the talks are reluctant to call the outcome. But bankers have been quietly sounding out investors for what would be Greece's first return to markets since 2014. The response has convinced Athens, which still has a public debt ratio of 180 percent of gross domestic product and an economy which is barely growing, to go ahead if the conditions are right.  A return to the markets with a five-year bond should be with yields below 5 percent,  said a Greek government official who requested anonymity. Greece's five-year yield is currently around 5.9 percent, according to Reuters data. Bond market investors estimate that could drop by between 0.75 of a percentage point and 1.5 percentage points if the ECB does start buying Greek debt. Greece's borrowing costs have fallen in the wake of previous deals with its international lenders, as shown in this graphic reut.rs/2s3I2mF. Investors also point to how the yield gap between 10-year Portuguese and German bonds shrank by 1.4 percentage points as the ECB prepared to launch its asset purchase programme, which provided a guaranteed buyer for Portugal's debt.  We still think you are about 75 basis points away from a point where you can start to have that dialogue about Greece returning to the market,  said BlueBay Asset Management's Mark Dowding, whose firm owns Greek debt.  But I think that (the ECB signalling it would buy Greek bonds) could certainly be a catalyst that would push yields into that zone.  While the ECB would be important as a backstop for investors who fear things might sour again in Greece, the actual amount of Greek bonds it could buy at the moment are relatively small. Greek sources suggest it would be 2-3 billion euros this year. That is roughly 10 percent of the 28 billion  tradable  Greek government bond market, according to Societe Generale, although the bank thinks the ECB may struggle to buy anything for a while. The euro zone's central bank cannot buy more than a third of the bonds issued by any country, and it still holds more than 10 billion euros worth of Greek paper it bought in 2010-2011, during the early phase of the bloc's debt crisis. Fudge? Borrowing longer-term at 5 percent would not be sustainable for Greece, which currently pays about 1 percent on its European Stability Mechanism loans and around 3.5 percent on lending from the International Monetary Fund. But tapping markets at all would be a sign of progress. Borrowing cost at that level would also roughly match the 4.95 percent Athens paid in 2014 when it made one of the fastest-ever returns to debt markets following a default. The plans could still be delayed, however. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure told Reuters last month it wanted to see  a clear description of the debt measures and how much they would contribute to the sustainability of Greek debt . ECB chief Mario Draghi will be asked exactly what that means at a news conference on Thursday, before euro zone finance ministers and the IMF head to next week's Eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg with a long list of potential debt relief measures. They will include delaying loan repayments anywhere from zero to 25 years and making them cheaper. The catch is that Germany and others want to wait until August 2018 to deliver them, to motivate Athens to stay on track with its programme of economic reforms. If Athens is willing to accept such a plan, it would leave the ECB with a decision to make. The debt measures are unlikely to be as straightforward as it would like, but if euro zone ministers and the IMF have both given the deal their blessing, refusing to buy Greek assets could leave it open to accusations of discrimination.  The fudge needs to be good enough that it gives the cover for the ECB to start buying Greek bonds again,  said BlueBay's Dowding.

Three Islamist assailants, including Italian-Moroccan national Youssef Zaghba, killed eight people in central London on Saturday before they themselves were shot dead. Zaghba was identified as a possible militant threat after he was stopped at Bologna airport in 2016 as tried to reach Syria. He was not charged, but local police monitored him carefully and tipped off Britain when he subsequently moved to London.  Our conscience is clear,  Franco Gabrielli, the head of the national police, told reporters while visiting the southern island of Lampedusa.  British authorities have said Zaghba had not been a subject of interest for them or the domestic intelligence agency MI5. Gabrielli said some police forces had been deluged with tip-offs about potential radicals, making it possible for some to slip beneath the radar.  It is very easy to speak with hindsight,  he said.  The issue of flagging (threats) is extremely complex and strictly tied to the amount of information that any one country is called on to process, which in some cases is an enormous amount.  That is why I am not going to criticize the behavior of others.  Zaghba's Italian mother, Valeria Khadija Collina, told reporters that she had informed police her son was missing after Saturday's attack. She said she thought he might have gone into hiding because she was aware he knew one of the slain attackers.  I was afraid. I thought, what is going to happen? Is he going to hide for the rest of his life?  she said, adding that she was horrified when she realized he had taken part in the assault and felt the anguish of the victim's families.      I understand deep down, inside my heart, the pain of these people,  she said, speaking at her home near the northern city of Bologna. She promised to work in future to dissuade other young Muslims from going down the road of radicalization.  I will try, from this moment on, to do all I can to make sure these things are not repeated.

The number of households that have taken a home equity line of credit (HELOC) on top of their mortgage has soared nearly 40 percent since 2011, the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada said in a report that stoked concerns about consumer debt linked to Canada's slowing housing market.  At a time when consumers are carrying record amounts of debt, the persistence of HELOC debt may add stress to the financial well-being of Canadian households,  the agency's commissioner, Lucie Tedesco, said in a statement.  HELOCs may lead Canadians to use their homes as ATMs, making it easier for them to borrow more than they can afford,  she added. Outstanding HELOC balances reached C$211 billion ($156.2 billion)in 2016, according to the report. There are about three million HELOC accounts in Canada, with an average outstanding balance of C$70,000. Canada's debt-to-income ratio has risen to record levels in recent quarters to levels surpassing those seen in the United States prior to the 2008-09 housing crash, and policymakers have repeatedly warned that households are vulnerable to an unforeseen event or economic shock. The report by the consumer agency showed some 40 percent of consumers do not make regular payments toward their HELOC principal, and most consumer do not repay their HELOC in full until they sell their home. It said banks and other lenders are increasingly offering readvanceable mortgages, which combine term mortgages with HELOCs and other credit products, to customers. The complexity and risks of such products are often not well understood by indebted consumers, the agency said.  Banks reported to FCAC that a readvanceable mortgage is now the default option offered to credit-worthy mortgage customers with down payments of at least 20 percent,  the report noted. Canada's long housing boom and double-digit price gains in cities like Toronto and Vancouver have led to fears of a housing bubble. But the country's big banks and federal policymakers have often said Canada does not have much of a subprime mortgage market or the kind of innovative credit products that came back to haunt borrowers in the U.S. housing crash.

I am pleased to announce that the date for the independence referendum has been set for Monday, Sept. 25, 2017,  Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said on Twitter. Barzani's assistant Hemin Hawrami tweeted that voting would take place in the disputed region of Kirkuk and three other areas also claimed by the central government; Makhmour in the north, Sinjar in the northwest and Khanaqin in the east. The president of Iraq's ruling Shi'ite coalition told Reuters in April it would oppose a Kurdish referendum. Ammar al-Hakim especially warned the Kurds against any move to annex oil-rich Kirkuk. The referendum date was set after a meeting of Kurdish political parties chaired by Barzani, who heads the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).  Hawrami said the question put to voters would be  do you want an independent Kurdistan?  A senior Kurdish official, Hoshiyar Zebari, told Reuters in April the expected  yes  vote would strengthen the Kurds' hand in talks on self-determination with Baghdad and would not mean automatically declaring independence.  The Kurds are playing a major role in the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State (IS), the ultra-hardline Sunni Islamist group that overran about a third of Iraq three years ago and also controls parts of Syria. IS fighters have been squeezed into a small area of Mosul, their de-facto capital in Iraq, as a push to retake the city closes in.

The idea of Iraqi Kurdish independence has been historically opposed by Iraq and neighboring Iran, Turkey and Syria, as they fear separatism spreading to their own Kurdish populations. Kurdish officials will visiting Baghdad and neighboring states to discuss the referendum plan, Erbil-based TV Rudaw said, adding that elections for the Kurdish regional parliament are planned for Nov. 6. Iraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. The Kurds have their own armed force, the Peshmerga, which in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs. Hardline Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and other disputed areas. The Sinjar region is populated by Yazidis, the followers of an ancient religion who speak a Kurdish language and the group most persecuted by Islamic State. Makhmour is south of the Kurdish capital Erbil and Khanaqin is near the border with Iran. Kirkuk's Kurdish-led provincial council earlier this year rejected a resolution by the Iraqi parliament in Baghdad to lower Kurdish flags which since March have been flown alongside Iraqi flags on public buildings in the region. Masrour Barzani, head of the Kurdish government's Security Council and son of President Barzani, said in June last year Iraq should be divided into separate Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish entities to prevent further sectarian bloodshed.

In the 6.00 a.m. call, he denied Qatar's emir made comments reported by the state-run news agency criticizing hostility to Iran, sympathizing with three Islamist groups, accusing Saudi Arabia of adopting an extremist ideology that fosters terrorism and suggesting Donald Trump may not last long as U.S. president. The adviser repeated a statement released hours earlier which said the news agency had been hacked, seeming unaware that Reuters had already reported the denial. The unusual timing of the call and the adviser's haste to get the message across pointed to Qatar's deep concern about the impact the remarks attributed to the emir could have. As anger mounted in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar's foreign minister tried to limit the fallout. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference that Qatar, host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East, wanted to maintain brotherly ties with its powerful neighbors in a region critical to world energy supplies. To outside observers, it was unclear whether the Qatar News Agency had indeed been hacked or whether an editor had published remarks which the emir later regretted saying.  But to Qatar's neighbors the question was irrelevant: the comments reflected the broad lines of Qatar's independent-minded foreign policy, which critics say has destabilized the region through its alliance with Islamist armed groups and cordial ties with Iran.     Officials in the Gulf say the comments marked a turning point, prompting Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to cut relations with Qatar in the biggest diplomatic shock in the region for years. Trouble Evident For Riyadh, trouble was also evident elsewhere.  Some Qatari-funded anti-Saudi websites had begun reporting on what they said were calls for protests against the kingdom's rulers, stirring memories of the Arab Spring revolutions that toppled the leaders of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.  They (Qataris) hired (financed) influential Saudi preachers, religious figures, journalists and academics to incite against Saudi Arabia,  one Gulf source told Reuters.  The Saudis had had it with Qatar. The Qataris keep channels open with Iran in various capitals and they campaign against the Egyptian state.  The Saudis had reached a  dead end  with Qatar and decided for the first time in 20 years to take action to damage its neighbor's interests, the source added.  Qatar denies inciting unrest in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere.     Another factor that pushed the four Sunni states over the line, according to Gulf officials, was last month's visit to Saudi Arabia by Trump, who has reversed the policies of  predecessor Barack Obama, thrown his weight behind the kingdom and its allies and expressed misgivings about Iran.     No sooner had Trump left Riyadh than the United States'  partners in the region moved against Qatar and its young emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, another American ally.     A series of flashpoints across the region in the days following Trump's visit heightened tensions that had been building for months and removed any hope among Qatar's neighbors of peeling it away from Iran and the Islamist groups it has engaged with for years.     Those tensions spilled into the public arena less than 48 hours after the Qatari emir took part in the Riyadh summit  attended by Trump which was meant to showcase U.S. support for solidarity of Sunni Muslim nations.     The alleged hacking incident came days after Qatar complained it was the target of  an orchestrated barrage  of criticism by unknown parties, in the run-up to Trump's visit.

Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS     After the Tamim speech, things went up an extra notch,  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The catalog is so wide... It is an accumulation,  Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs told Reuters.  It could have happened in March, it could have happened in December. But it was bound to happen. It was something that was ready to explode.  Gargash confirmed there were several major irritants that sped up the process. These included the comments attributed to the emir, UAE accusations that Qatar has undermined the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and Qatar's handling of a hostage crisis involving 24 members of the ruling elite in which it paid ransom money to  Islamist groups in Iraq an Syria. An annual phone call to mark the start of the holy Islamic month of Ramadan between Tamim and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on May 27 aggravated the situation further. Iran's Shi'ite-led government and Saudi Arabia's Sunni rulers compete for influence in the region and Jean-Marc Rickli, a Geneva-based risk analyst, called that a  diplomatic mistake (which) Saudi Arabia and the UAE jumped on .  Kuwait's emir offered to mediate but when Tamim attended an iftar (fast-breaking) Ramadan meal with him on May 30, Tamim left early, apparently unwilling to discuss the row, a Kuwaiti newspaper editor regularly briefed by officials told Reuters.      Rolling Meetings FILE PHOTO: (Front R-L) Jordan's King Abdullah II, Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, U.S. President Donald Trump, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani pose for a photo during Arab-Islamic-American Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 21, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoThe decision to cut ties with Qatar took shape in a rolling series of meetings over several weeks, said a Gulf Arab source.     But a second source said an important moment came last Saturday when Saudi King Salman and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, met for iftar in Jeddah. It is likely that Egypt came on board two days later, during a visit to Cairo by the Saudi foreign minister.     At dawn on Monday, those governments and Bahrain made a series of rapid fire announcements, revealing the move's careful orchestration and pre-planning.     A Western diplomat in Doha said the move was  clearly tied  to Trump's visit, suggesting it had emboldened Saudi Arabia and the UAE to act.      The opportunity presented itself with the Trump visit and Trump's presidency in general,  a former U.S. ambassador to Doha told Reuters, suggesting the move had been in the works for two or three months.      This is well choreographed. Everything came together at the same time.  U.S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia’s decision to sever ties with Qatar, current and former U.S. officials told Reuters. A senior administration official said Washington had no indication at the Riyadh summit that the move was about to happen but on Tuesday morning Trump directly waded into the dispute by praising the Arab powers’ decisions against Qatar. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have mainly portrayed the move as a step to combat what they call Qatar's funding for terrorists.   We want a black-and-white approach to terrorist financing,  said Gargash from the UAE Foreign Ministry.  We know the ABCs of dealing with terrorism. One of these ABCs is: You never feed the crocodiles.  Trump's tweets suggested he agreed with that view:  During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!  the president wrote. The Pentagon, however, mindful of the U.S. military base in Qatar, renewed its praise for Doha after Trump’s intervention -- showing again how U.S. officials are walking a tightrope as Trump’s tweets raise questions about existing policy and the scripted talking points used to explain it. Reports that Qatari officials paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Iran-backed groups in an April deal to free 26 of its citizens kidnapped in Iraq last year has also been an irritant in relations between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar denies trying to pay ransom money to secure the release of the hostages, although foreign minister al-Thani said it sent money  to support the authorities in the release of Qatari abductees .

America wants to build,  Trump said.  There is no limit to what we can achieve. All it takes is a bold and daring vision and the will to make it happen.      Speaking in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump reviewed a proposal announced earlier this year to leverage $200 billion in his budget proposal into a $1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system, strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges, roads and waterways. Trump said he would not allow the United States to become a “museum of former glory.” He spoke about backing large transformative projects but did not give specifics. “We will construct incredible new monuments to American grit that inspire wonder for generations and generations,” he said. Trump pointed to a government program that allows the private sector to tap into low-cost government loans called the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act as a way to leverage federal funds with state, local, and private sector funding. U.S. President Donald Trump smiles as he arrives for rally along side the Ohio River at the Rivertown Marina in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S. June 7, 2017.John Sommers IITransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that administration plans to unveil a detailed legislative proposal by the end of September. Democrats want $1 trillion in new federal spending and proposed a plan that includes $200 billion in roads and bridges,$20 billion in expanding broadband Internet access, $110 billion for water systems and $75 billion for schools. Slideshow (4 Images)Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said the Trump budget unveiled in May cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several departments, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. The Ohio visit was the second leg of a week-long White House focus on infrastructure. On Monday the president proposed spinning off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration. The proposal to privatize air traffic control has run into skepticism and opposition from Democratic senators and some Republicans.      The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy that Trump made last year during his presidential campaign.     Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russia's alleged meddling in the election. That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month, testifies before a Senate panel.

However, DHT struck a tankers-for-shares deal with BW Group in March, making the latter DHT's biggest shareholder with a stake of over 30 percent. Frontline then sought to stop the BW deal proceeding in the U.S. courts but the New York County Supreme Court said on April 19 it had no jurisdiction over DHT, which is incorporated in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. DHT said its deal with BW Group was aimed at strengthening its market positions, not to block Frontline's proposal.

When there's a flood, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, response organizations need accurate information quickly about where people are in order to save lives,  founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Facebook.   When traditional communication channels like phone lines are down, it can take too much time to figure out where people need help.  The maps will reflect the movements and location of people before, during and after disasters to help aid agencies work out where they should deliver food, water and medical supplies. Zuckerberg said the new maps would help build  safe communities, and we will keep doing more initiatives like this . The company worked with the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the World Food Programme, among others, to identify what data would be most useful. They would all have immediate access to the new maps, with other agencies to follow. Facebook said it would provide three types of maps: - Location density maps will show people's location before, during and after a disaster. - Movement maps will illustrate flight between neighborhoods or cities over several hours. - Safety check maps will show when users let their family and friends know they are out of harm's way.

The Chicago Board of Education approved the debt sale last month as a way to avoid ending the current school year early and to help make a $721 million pension payment due to its teachers' retirement system at the end of this month. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nation's third-largest public school system. JPMorgan, which CPS selected as the winning bidder for the notes, has lent the school system more than $1 billion through tax anticipation notes deals over the last few years. While the district pledged future property tax collections for those deals, the new borrowing is secured by about $467 million of CPS' delayed grant funding from the state of Illinois, which is struggling through a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget. The district's already shaky finances took a major hit with  Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's December veto of legislation that would have funneled $215 million in state funds to CPS to help it make the fiscal 2017 pension payment.

The Chicago Board of Education approved the debt sale last month as a way to avoid ending the current school year early and to help make a $721 million pension payment due to its teachers' retirement system at the end of this month. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nation's third-largest public school system. JPMorgan, which CPS selected as the winning bidder for the notes, has lent the school system more than $1 billion through tax anticipation notes deals over the last few years. While the district pledged future property tax collections for those deals, the new borrowing is secured by about $467 million of CPS' delayed grant funding from the state of Illinois, which is struggling through a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget. The district's already shaky finances took a major hit with  Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's December veto of legislation that would have funneled $215 million in state funds to CPS to help it make the fiscal 2017 pension payment.

I am pleased to announce that the date for the independence referendum has been set for Monday, Sept. 25, 2017,  Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said on Twitter. Barzani's assistant Hemin Hawrami tweeted that voting would take place in the disputed region of Kirkuk and three other areas also claimed by the central government; Makhmour in the north, Sinjar in the northwest and Khanaqin in the east. The president of Iraq's ruling Shi'ite coalition told Reuters in April it would oppose a Kurdish referendum. Ammar al-Hakim especially warned the Kurds against any move to annex oil-rich Kirkuk. The referendum date was set after a meeting of Kurdish political parties chaired by Barzani, who heads the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).  Hawrami said the question put to voters would be  do you want an independent Kurdistan?  A senior Kurdish official, Hoshiyar Zebari, told Reuters in April the expected  yes  vote would strengthen the Kurds' hand in talks on self-determination with Baghdad and would not mean automatically declaring independence.  The Kurds are playing a major role in the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State (IS), the ultra-hardline Sunni Islamist group that overran about a third of Iraq three years ago and also controls parts of Syria. IS fighters have been squeezed into a small area of Mosul, their de-facto capital in Iraq, as a push to retake the city closes in.

The center around Baghdad is mixed. The idea of Iraqi Kurdish independence has been historically opposed by Iraq and neighboring Iran, Turkey and Syria, as they fear separatism spreading to their own Kurdish populations. Kurdish officials will visiting Baghdad and neighboring states to discuss the referendum plan, Erbil-based TV Rudaw said, adding that elections for the Kurdish regional parliament are planned for Nov. 6. Iraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. The Kurds have their own armed force, the Peshmerga, which in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs. Hardline Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and other disputed areas. The Sinjar region is populated by Yazidis, the followers of an ancient religion who speak a Kurdish language and the group most persecuted by Islamic State. Makhmour is south of the Kurdish capital Erbil and Khanaqin is near the border with Iran. Kirkuk's Kurdish-led provincial council earlier this year rejected a resolution by the Iraqi parliament in Baghdad to lower Kurdish flags which since March have been flown alongside Iraqi flags on public buildings in the region. Masrour Barzani, head of the Kurdish government's Security Council and son of President Barzani, said in June last year Iraq should be divided into separate Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish entities to prevent further sectarian bloodshed.

In a bid to better manage the arena, which attracts more than 6 million visitors a year, the culture ministry declared in    January it would become the centerpiece of a new archaeological site, managed separately from the city's other attractions. But city hall, run by the 5-Star Movement, attacked the idea of spinning off the capital's open air museum, bristled at proposed changes to handling revenue, and appealed to the regional administrative court to block it. After the court upheld 5-Star's complaint on Wednesday, Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi tweeted,  The citizens have won ... Government attempt defeated. Rome still belongs to everyone.  Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, a member of the governing Democratic Party, said he would oppose the ruling. It was the second in two weeks to shoot down parts of a sweeping reform he began in 2014 to modernize and make more money out of Italy's vast cultural heritage.  The plan for the Colosseum and nearby Roman Forum included hiring a new director through an international search similar to one through which 20 other directors were hired last year, but which the court partly overruled last month. Franceschini says his changes to Italy's network of 400 state museums, some of which are also on its list of 51 UNESCO World Heritage sites, have borne fruit, with ticket revenue rising 12 percent last year to 172 million euros ($193 million). However, one of 5-Star's objections to the Colosseum plan was that it only guaranteed local authorities 30 percent of the park's roughly 35 million euros in net annual ticket sales, compared with 80 percent under the previous management. Franceschini furiously rebutted that, saying the new structure would still mean Rome kept all revenue apart from a 20 percent cut taken from all big sites to help fund smaller ones.  Despite rising revenue, Italy still earns less from its cultural wealth than European peers like France - whose Louvre museum alone rakes in 100 million euros a year - a situation long blamed on inefficiency and poor management.

It would, at first glance, seem that way.  In the red (-leather seat) corner sits the London Metal Exchange (LME), the 140-year-old incumbent, still dominant in terms of global price-setting but recently showing signs of wobbly frailty.  In the blue (-sky technology) corner awaits the challenger, NFEx Markets, a new digital platform designed by London's Autilla, a self-described  fintech  company riding the disruptive blockchain wave. The first round of the bout is scheduled for the start of next year, when NFEx is due to launch its  new market for the trading of nonferrous metals .  There is needle in this looming confrontation.  The challenger's advisory team includes Martin Abbott, former chief executive of the LME, Mark Bradley, a former head of market surveillance at the LME, Nigel Owens, a former IT manager at the LME and Jim Coupland, serial director and committee member of the LME over three decades.  It promises to be an entertaining and intriguing clash of the old LME guard using new weapons against the new LME guard defending old positions. Except that things may be a bit more complex than advertised on the fight bill.  While there can be little doubt that NFEx is a direct consequence of the LME's strategic flailing since its acquisition in 2012 by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), this battle will be fought not for what the LME has but for what it has lost.  The Fruits of Discontent NFEx's press release on Monday pulled off the tricky feat of not once mentioning the LME, other than in the biographies of most of its advisory team.  It will, though, have  contracts and trade dates (that) match established physical industry practise .  For which read something very similar, if not identical, to the LME's own previously unique trading system, incorporating daily, weekly and monthly prompts revolving around a continually rolling three-month anchor price.  Indeed, it is discontent about the way the new LME, under pressure from HKEx (0388.HK) to recoup some of the 1.388 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) purchase price, has tried to adapt this system that spawned NFEx in the first place.  Fee hikes, particularly on short-dated spreads, alienated both core brokers and industrial users.  Attempts to compensate for the resulting slide in volumes by attracting more financial players, including the high-frequency  flash boys , just annoyed everyone more.  Around this time last year a group of brokers commissioned Abbott to conduct a feasibility study on a new LME.  At the time, it looked like a way of pressuring the LME's executive into reversing its fee hikes. And it was partly successful insofar as the exchange did indeed partly reverse them.  That half-win loosened the original broker alliance but the project took on a life of its own, dropping on the mat of Autilla, which was already active in trying to disrupt the precious part of the London metals establishment.  Graphic on LME volumes, by major contract:  tmsnrt.rs/2s3E8Ky A Fight for the Shadows Traders and clerks work at the London Metal Exchange (LME) in London, July 22, 2011. A string of warehouses in Detroit, most of them operated by Goldman, has stockpiled more than a million tonnes of the industrial metal aluminium, about a quarter of global reported inventories. The LME certifies and regulates the Detroit sheds as part of a global network of more than 640 warehouses. Picture taken July 22, 2011.  To match Special Report LME-WAREHOUSINGPaul Hackett/Files (BRITAIN - Tags: BUSINESS) - RTR2PD9PNFEx's target, initially at least, will be to attract the business that the LME has lost to the over-the-counter (OTC) market.  Which is, presumably, why it can without blushing claim its new platform  will not replace or disturb current trading models but will be complementary to them . You can't replace what has already gone.  LME volumes have been falling consistently since the start of 2015, when the new management first raised trading fees. Only one of the core contracts, nickel, has seen volumes rise over both a one- and two-year timeframe.  Worst hit have been volumes on those short-dated spreads, particularly the shortest of all,  tom-next , a daily position roll much beloved by financiers of physical metals stocks.  Despite media attention on the supposed battle for market-share between the LME and CME, all the evidence suggests that the disappearing volumes have gone into the OTC shadows rather than to another exchange.  The LME's all-encompassing  Discussion Paper on Market Structure  gives a taste of what it might be contemplating in terms of trying to get this volume back.  It would, for example,  consider further reducing the fees on short-dated carries  with an offsetting rise on other types of trade.  Rebalancing fees between member and client contracts might also address the current cost incentive for brokers to place clients in an OTC structure.  There's more, much more. Fifty-seven pages in fact. NFEx, for its part, is giving little away as to its solution for bringing the shadow volumes back.  Cost will be an obvious selling point but in an age of electronic trading, where activity on even an active contract such as LME three-month copper is fractured into a million single-lot parts, how to generate liquidity without going down the same path?  As a new player, unencumbered by legacy technology or mindset, Autilla has what must seem from the LME's perspective an enviably blank canvas.  More Fish in a Much Bigger Ocean? If it can come up with an answer, the rewards might be much greater than the crumbs that have slid off the LME's table over the last three years.  One core theme permeating the world of industrial metals exchange trading has been the shifting balance between the share of trading originating from industrial and financial players.  One of the revelations from the LME's consultations on its warehousing reform program was the depth of discontent among industrial giants such as Alcoa and Rusal about the financialization of what they felt to be  their market .  This undercurrent has been running a lot longer than the last few years and is part of a broader trend of investment participation in the commodities complex.  However, there is a case to be made that the LME's relatively high-cost structure, overlaid with a steady tightening of credit credentials for participation, has served to disenfranchise all but the largest industrial users.  Many smaller players, whether scrap merchants, wire manufacturers or die-casters, stopped actively participating on the LME many years before the fee hikes of 2012.  They may still have LME prices hard-wired into their physical contracts but how many actually hedge their exposure on the exchange any more is a moot point.  There is a yawning gap in the exchange-traded metal market space. If NFEx can find a way of filling it, the new guard and the old guard of the LME could yet find themselves unlikely allies rather than competitors.

Aviation sector leaders gathered in Cancun, Mexico said they are concerned that President Donald Trump may reinstate some political and economic restrictions between the two Cold War-era foes.  The Trump administration is reviewing the Obama administration's moves to ease restrictions on travel and investment in Cuba. Trump has criticized the agreements by Obama to thaw relations with the Cuban government. Airlines, facing uncertainty about a U.S. policy that could make moot millions in recent investments, are loath to criticize the Trump administration's unpredictability, but the industry is unified in saying the thaw should continue.   Restricting the network of aviation and access to Cuba would be bad news for aviation. Generally we welcome the extension of access to any country by plane,  IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters ahead of the June 4-6 conference. The initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some of the early entrants have pulled out, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines.  Larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities to focus on service to the capital, Havana.  American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue have all requested increased frequency on various Havana routes. Those requests are in limbo pending the administration's review. U.S. cruise operators and airlines stand to lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel to Cuba, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a report last week. When the application process first opened in 2016, an arrangement between the two governments allowed for 20 daily flights to Havana. Cuba reported 4 million arrivals last year, of which 285,000 were Americans. Another 300,000 Cuban Americans visited but are not considered tourists.    'Americans Are Good Tippers' Eased travel restrictions have already dramatically reshaped Cuba's tourism scene, including the Nacional Hotel, which overlooks the Gulf of Mexico and entry to Havana Bay. Tourists now flood the back veranda of the iconic mammoth structure, paying triple the prices and spilling out of the previously half-empty space. Cruise ships, once a rarity in the Bay, now dot the shoreline, and Americans are no longer an unusual sight among visitors.  Meleny, a state tour guide, who asked her last name not be used, says she worries about Trump every night.   We will see what he does, but it would be a shame if he drops a bomb on all this. This job isn't great, but the Americans are good tippers and that is how I feed my kids and buy them shoes,  she said. American visitors to Cuba could increase as much as sevenfold by 2025, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. Given tourism infrastructure is already creaking, that means there are business opportunities aplenty but U.S companies must learn to navigate a centrally-planned economy. The United States still officially prohibits its citizens from visiting Cuba as tourists. However, travel between the two countries is easier now than it has been in more than half a century thanks to exceptions to that ban, which allow travelers to claim they are visiting family or engaging in business, cultural, religious or educational activities.     In a tweet shortly after his November election win, Trump threatened to  terminate  the relationship unless the Cuban government agreed to a number of political concessions. The administration could announce its review's findings as early as this month. Business industry leaders, particularly in the airline and travel industry, have been fearful of a repeal of Obama-era policies, appealing to Trump's pledge to keep  America First  by allowing continued business with the Caribbean island. Airlines have praised the opening of the travel market, under which general tourism is still restricted but a number of visa options exist for those seeking to visit the island.  The Caribbean is so core to JetBlue that we see Cuba as very important to us, longer term,  JetBlue, which has twice requested and been denied a Boston to Havana route, CEO Robin Hayes told Reuters.  Cuba continues to present many opportunities in the near- and long-term, said Peter Cerda, IATA regional VP for the Americas.

The world number three played safely throughout the match in windy conditions to beat Caroline Garcia 7-6(3) 6-4 and end the French presence in the main draw on Wednesday. Garcia joins Kristina Mladenovic, beaten by Swiss Timea Bacsinszky in her quarter-final on Tuesday, on the exit route at Roland Garros, where the French bubble has burst in a couple of days. On a packed Court Philippe Chatrier, 28th seed Garcia fought all the way, but Pliskova, the 2016 U.S. Open finalist, was simply doing everything a little bit better.  So far still before this tournament I was struggling on clay with almost everything. Didn't have my weapons on my side  and the movement was terrible,  Pliskova, who next faces former French Open runner-up Simona Halep, told a news conference.  ...I don't think it's better, but somehow I'm just winning.  Her improvement in the claycourt major bears similarities with the career of Russia's Maria Sharapova, a self-described 'cow on ice' on the red dirt who still managed to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup twice. Pliskova is taking baby steps.  Today I can finally say I felt a little bit better on the court compared to the last matches,  she said.  Yeah, the serve was good, which is also important.

Now the 25-year-old is one win away from becoming world number one next week.  Coming into this tournament, there were a few people who told me, You have to be in the final to be No. 1. I was like, there is no chance I make the final here,  she said with a smile. Slideshow (4 Images)But Pliskova is almost there. She had never made it past the second round here and, after sometimes struggling in previous rounds, she perfectly handled Garcia, who was looking to become the first Frenchwoman in the last four since Marion Bartoli in 2011. Despite the swirling winds sweeping the court, Pliskova made only 13 unforced errors -- one every two games -- while Garcia hit 31. The local favorite held serve in the second set until the 10th game, when Pliskova scooped a lob that handed her a match point which she converted confidently with a forehand winner.  Next up is Romanian third seed Halep, a French Open finalist in 2014 who gave herself a second chance after saving a match point in her quarter-final win over Elina Svitolina.  I'm playing against somebody who I would say is one of the best girls on clay,  said Pliskova, who has lost four of her five encounters with Halep -- none on clay, though.

A handful of vegetables litter the floor below. Dinner is far from ready. The last meal that 15-year-old Murugesan ate was some rice and leftover lentils. More than eight hours later, and there is still no freshly cooked food in sight.  There is rice and my younger sister will make some rasam (tamarind based soup),  she said from the cramped kitchen of her two-room home in Manjanaickenpatti village in Tamil Nadu. Back from a 10-hour shift at a spinning mill, she says she is  not very hungry anyway, just very tired . Murugesan is one of up to 400,000 workers employed by some 1,600 mills in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, a major hub in India's $40 billion garment and textile industry. Like most adolescent girls employed by the industry, she is overworked, underweight, anemic and hungry at work, according to doctors who have been running health camps in the region.  More than 50 percent of the girls are hungry through the day, skipping meals or barely eating in their rush to get to work,  said Dr Bobby Joseph, head of the community health department at the Bengaluru-based St John's Medical College. In studying health in the garment sector, Joseph has mapped girls in Coimbatore, Dindigul, Tirupur and Erode districts. Nearly 45 percent are underweight, the study found, with most of the girls rarely eating fruit or veg. An Egg a Month The findings echo those of non-profit Serene Secular Social Service Society, which ran a health camp in Dindigul district that showed most of its young workers were also malnourished.  The meals they eat don't have sufficient calories,  said S James Victor, whose Society works on labour rights.  We found that 65 percent of them have broiler chicken or an egg once a month and only 11.2 percent have greens in a month. What they eat is not enough for the work they do.  Murugesan's favorite vegetable is a variety of broad beans topped with grated coconut. But she can't remember the last time she ate it.  We don't eat vegetables like that, we just add a few pieces to the lentils and then eat it with rice and pickle,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. A large portion of her roughly 5,500 rupees ($85) monthly salary goes on pain-relieving balms and medicines, not food, she added. Murugesan gets up at the crack of dawn, gulps a cup of tea and boards the factory bus at 6 a.m. for her 8 a.m. shift. Her first meal of the day is at the spinning mill at about 10 a.m. It is an unpalatable meal but she forces herself to eat a few mouthfuls to see her through the day, she said.  Often the rice in undercooked, sometimes there is too little salt, sometimes more,  she said. Since the management deducts a monthly canteen services fee of up to 750 rupees ($12), she brings no food from home. Some friends bring a small, steel lunch box, packed with rice and leftovers. But they still pay for the canteen, too.  Even if the food was good, we just get 30 minutes, in which we have to queue up to use the restroom and also finish our food. Every minute that we are late, we are fined.  A survey by non-profit Community Awareness Research Education Trust shows workers get less than 10 minutes to eat.  Most girls use the toilets during this break and it takes them a minimum 10 minutes,  said S.M. Prithviraj of the trust.  Another 10 minutes are spent in queuing up for plates, food, getting a glass of water and finding a place to sit. That gives each girl just about 10 minutes to eat her food, clear her plate and get back to the machine.   So most eat a little, gulp water and head back to work. Murugesan is back home by 7 p.m. Then she washes clothes, has a bath and eats a bit of dinner before sleeping.  I am very, very tired and it often feels like my body is like a machine,  she said.  All I can think of at the end of the day is to sleep. I eat a little because my mother insists.   Basic Welfare The industry, which produces yarn, fabric and garments for high-end brands, mostly employs young village women from poor, illiterate and low-caste communities.  They work up to 12 hours a day and say they routinely face intimidation, sexual remarks and harassment. Joseph's study identifies a  lack of concern  by management.  Because labour is cheap and available, they don't think it is necessary to invest more than the basic on their health needs,  he said. Workers don't have a say in the food served, said Victor, adding that traditional health boosters like palm jaggery and banana had been discontinued by most mills to cut costs. P.V. Chandran, vice president of the Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association, said it was unfair to paint the entire industry with the same brush, with many initiatives underway.  The women spend only eight hours in our mills, where we try and give them good food. The rest of the onus also lies with the family,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  For girls living in mill hostels, there is a constant endeavor to improve facilities. But sometimes it is the girls who say they don't want vegetables in the menu and demand spicy curries instead.  Velankani Muttiah, 18, admits to liking tangy gravies -  but not everyday . As she watches her mother kindle a fire to make rice for the night, she says all her co-workers complain of ill health.  We work in a trance,  she said.  And we all spend way too much on visiting doctors and buying medicines. We know fruits and vegetables are good for us, but we simply cannot afford it.

So many people just assume that men are better investors. And they would be wrong. According to new data from financial services giant Fidelity Investments, women are actually superior investors. In sifting through more than 8 million investment accounts, Fidelity discovered that women not only save more than men, 0.4 percent, their investments earn more annually, also 0.4 percent.  It is a double whammy,  says Alexandra Taussig, Fidelity's senior vice president for women investors.  The myth that men are better investors is just that - a myth.  Those differences may seem slight at first. But extrapolated over a lifetime of saving and investing, the disparity at retirement age is anything but minor. For a 22-year-old starting out with a salary of $50,000 a year, a woman investor will outpace her male counterpart by more than $250,000. Even more revealing about general attitudes is Fidelity's companion  Women and Money  survey, which asked participants which gender was better at investing its money. The outcome: Barely 9 percent of people said women. What is it, exactly, that makes women better investors? One factor, Fidelity said, is that men are 35 percent more likely to make trades, which means that trading fees eat away at their portfolios more than they do women's. Women also save more in the first place - almost a full percentage point annually - in workplace 401(k)s and individual vehicles such as IRAs and brokerage accounts, Fidelity found. Another advantage: Women assume less risk, such as not loading up entirely on equities. They also invest more in vehicles like target-date funds, whose automatic allocations make for smarter diversification, Fidelity said. The resulting gender outperformance gibes with a study by academics Terrance Odean (University of California, Berkeley) and Brad Barber (University of California, Davis), who also found that women outperform men, by roughly 1 percent a year. If you want to invest like a wonder woman, that means shifting to a long-term focus, saving more up front and giving up on trying to time the market with brilliant trades.  Men regard their stock picks as a sport that comes with bragging rights, and that is what gets them into trouble,  said George Gagliardi, a financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Some came home heavy hearted, hungry and broke.  For others, home was better than making it to Italy after all, given the grueling desert crossing, brutal beatings and deaths of fellow migrants they had encountered en route.  Coming home feels better than getting to Italy,  said 30-year-old Mohammed Gueye, swigging from a bottle of water while filling in forms with aid workers and state officials ahead of the migrants' return to their homes and families this week.  It was hell in prison, everyone broke down eventually. I cried and gave up hope,  Gueye told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the capital of Dakar, as he recalled watching his peers die of hunger and illness during nine months in detention.  Gueye was one of more than 160 migrants, mainly young men in their twenties, who arrived in Dakar late on Tuesday, wearing hoodies and woolly hats, looking unkempt, tired and dazed. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Senegalese government helped to release the returnees from detention centers in northern Libya - run by criminal gangs or Libyan troops - where some migrants were held for up to a year. At least 20,000 migrants are detained in Libya, the main gateway for those headed to Europe by sea. Rising numbers are traded - in what they call slave markets - for forced labor and sexual exploitation, according to the IOM.   Yet driven by poverty and a lack of work, a rising number of Senegalese are risking their lives to reach Europe via Libya. More than 10,000 Senegalese migrants arrived in Italy by boat last year, up from 6,000 in 2015, IOM data shows.   The voyage from Libya across the Mediterranean to Italy - most cross the sea on flimsy boats run by people smugglers - has become the main route to Europe for migrants from Africa after a European Union clampdown last year on sea crossings from Turkey. Help at Hand Many of the migrants gathered in the airport hangar in Dakar spoke not only of the hardships endured in Libya, but also of the hellish 1,200 km (750 miles) voyage through the Sahara. At least 40 West Africans died in the desert last week after their truck broke down in arid northern Niger, the Red Cross said. More migrants may die in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean, according to migration tracking group 4mi.  The Sahara, it's another reality,  said Thierno Mendy, 37.  There were 30 of us crammed into a jeep with little to eat and drink for a week ... I saw dead bodies along the way,  he added. More than 500 Senegalese migrants have returned home so far this year from Libya or Europe through the IOM's voluntary repatriation scheme. About 1,800 people were flown home in 2016.  The IOM gives the migrants cash for their journey home within Senegal, and has a community re-integration program to invest in projects such as sustainable agriculture and poultry farming which support whole communities, not just the returnees.   Given the sums of money invested in the journey (as much as $3,000), and our strategy to benefit the wider community, we don't see such a scheme as a push factor for migration,  said Jo-Lind Roberts-Sene, IOM Head of Office for Senegal. While the migrants were visibly relieved to be back in Senegal, many were ashamed to go home empty-handed, having wasted the family savings, while others feared they would be unable to prevent peers from following in their footsteps.  You can't tell someone not to go to Europe, it is their personal decision,  said Gueye, recalling how his friends who made it to Italy would phone him to boast about their new lives.  Aspiring migrants are poorly informed of what lies ahead.

It is time to rebuild our country, to bring back our jobs, to restore our dreams, and yes, to put America first,  Trump said, according to excerpts released by the White House.  We are going to restore America's industrial might, creating the jobs and tax base to put new infrastructure all over this country.  Speaking in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump reviewed a proposal announced earlier this year to leverage $200 billion in his budget proposal into a $1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system, strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges, roads and waterways. Trump is pointing to a government program that allows the private sector to tap into low-cost government loans called the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act as a way to leverage federal funds with state, local, and private sector funding. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that administration plans to unveil a detailed legislative proposal by the end of September. The Ohio visit was the second leg of a week-long White House focus on infrastructure. On Monday the president proposed spinning off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration. The proposal to privatize air traffic control has run into skepticism and opposition from Democratic senators and some Republicans. The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy that Trump made last year during his presidential campaign. Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russia's alleged meddling in the election. That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month, testifies before a Senate panel. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign. He has struggled to keep the spotlight on plans that could give him a political boost.

Like rival Tesla's energy storage business, the Renault-Nissan move underscores its desire to cultivate a second-hand battery market while encouraging the development of energy infrastructure that works for electric cars. The Renault-Nissan alliance plant, which has yet to be built, would be big enough to power 120,000 homes, or supplant the role of a gas- or coal-fired power station in meeting peak electricity demand on the grid, the sources said.  Rather than generating power, a storage plant charges up in times of excess supply and sells electricity back to the grid when needed. Proponents say such plants can play a key role in smoothing out unpredictable wind and solar power generation. Renault-Nissan is working in partnership with energy storage specialist The Mobility House on the mega battery which would be assembled from new or used electric car batteries, one of the sources said.  We're working with The Mobility House on several programs including a major energy storage project that is currently still in the study phase,  Renault spokeswoman Celine Farissier said, declining to give further details.  Makers of electric cars stand to benefit from the creation of a market for used lithium-ion batteries that can no longer power vehicles to drive far enough. Higher second-hand battery values could help bring down the cost of electric cars and mega batteries are one avenue for recycling the power cells. Nissan, 44 percent-owned by French alliance partner Renault, has already built a back-up power storage system for the Amsterdam Arena, which is home to soccer club Ajax, in a first partnership with the German start-up.  Marcus Fendt, its managing director, said the Munich-based company was working on a 100 MW plant with partners he declined to identify, citing confidentiality agreements. He said the studies were aimed at determining where to build the plant. Locations and end markets under consideration for the Renault-Nissan plant include Germany, which is suitable because of its high energy prices and its shift from nuclear to renewable energy, as well as the Netherlands, sources said.

California's Public Utilities commission selected a 100 MW battery storage system to replace a natural-gas power plant providing electricity for Southern California Edison (SCE_pe.A) in the Los Angeles area. Logo is seen on a ribbon at a dealing centre Renault store in Minsk, Belarus June 9, 2016.Vasily FedosenkoLarge batteries can help stabilize the primary reserve electricity market, which is responsible for ensuring the grid has at least 50 Hertz. Carmakers can also earn money competing with conventional power stations to guarantee the provision of electricity during periods of high demand or volatility.   We forecast the combined market for electric passenger vehicles, electric buses and battery storage to increase eight-fold to over $200 billion by 2020, a five-year compound annual growth rate of more than 50 percent,  Berenberg analysts said.  With about 4 million electric cars expected to be on the roads by 2020, vehicle manufacturers looking at ways to recycle batteries, including Tesla, which already sells everything from solar panels to batteries and electric cars. Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and China's BYD Co Ltd are also exploring so-called second-life storage projects with batteries. That includes partnerships such as the recent collaboration between BMW and Vattenfall [VATN.UL], in which the luxury automaker will deliver up to 1,000 lithium-ion batteries to the Swedish utility for storage projects this year.  What will end up happening is that BMW and Daimler will ... become utilities themselves,  said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital LLP, a corporate advisor in the energy, power infrastructure and technology sectors.  They use Vattenfall now because they need to learn but I think the amount of batteries coming back will be so big that I think they'll end up engaging directly with the end customer themselves. And they've got the brand name to do that.

The firm raised the funds from Gulf-based investors and hopes success at home will allow it to eventually expand to Europe and the Middle East, chief executive Junaid Wahedna said in an interview. Wahed joins a number of wealth management firms building robo-advisers, a market initially developed by startups such as Wealthfront and Betterment, to tap affluent but not necessarily very wealthy customers. The scene is now crowded, with large firms including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Vanguard joining the fray. But Wahed hopes to claim a slice of the market by catering to Muslims seeking religiously permissible investments, which are either scarce or costly in most Western markets.  Through our research we found that they either keep their savings in cash or in real estate, there is literally no diversification. The Muslim demographic ends up losing out.  Wahed has 21 full-time staff and its plans include developing a range of exchange-traded funds. It now has registered users across 48 U.S. states, Wahedna said.  Around 10 percent of our clients are coming from existing robo-advisers, but 90 percent are not. Many are first-time investors or come from old-school advisory products.  Its initial focus will be the United States with scope for trials in Britain and the United Arab Emirates to follow, Wahedna added. Islamic investment products use filters to adhere to religious guidelines such as bans on tobacco, alcohol and gambling, in much the same way as socially responsible funds. Target Market Muslims represent a geographically-diverse but affluent population in the United States which means means they can be difficult to reach via traditional branch networks but appeal to robo-advisers, said Wahedna. The company estimates there are around four million Muslims across the U.S., with two-thirds earning more than $50,000 a year and a quarter earning more than $100,000 a year. Until now, however, their choices for sharia-compliant investments have been limited, especially compared to markets such as Malaysia and Saudi Arabia where Islamic wealth management is commonplace. Another element is cost, since robo-advisers typically use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost financial products. In the case of Wahed, its annual management fee ranges from 0.29 percent to 0.99 percent. This is comparable to other robo-advisers but lower than the fees charged by most Islamic mutual funds.

FDI, which largely comprises cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) and investment in start-up projects abroad, slipped by 2 percent in 2016, much less than the 13 percent fall suggested by preliminary figures in February. FDI is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of the growth of corporate supply chains and future trade ties. This year it is expected to grow thanks to higher economic growth expectations, a resumption of trade growth, and increasing corporate profits, the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said.  Policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks could hamper the recovery, and tax policy changes could significantly affect cross-border investment,  UNCTAD said in a report. The outlook was cautiously optimistic for most regions, except for Latin America and the Caribbean, because of their uncertain macroeconomic and policy outlook, it said.  The United States remained the top FDI recipient in 2016, with inflows increasing 12 percent to $391 billion, followed by Britain, which was pushed up into second position by several mega-deals and welcomed $254 billion of FDI in total. China was in third position but slipped 1 percent from 2016 to $134 billion. FDI flows have repeatedly undershot forecasts because of the stuttering recovery after the global financial crisis.

Scientists determined that skulls, limb bones and teeth representing at least five individuals were about 300,000 years old, a blockbuster discovery in the field of anthropology. The antiquity of the fossils was startling - a  big wow,  as one of the researchers called it. But their discovery in North Africa, not East or even sub-Saharan Africa, also defied expectations. And the skulls, with faces and teeth matching people today but with archaic and elongated braincases, showed our brain needed more time to evolve its current form.  This material represents the very root of our species,  said paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, who helped lead the research published in the journal Nature. Before the discovery at the site called Jebel Irhoud, located between Marrakech and Morocco's Atlantic coast, the oldest Homo sapiens fossils were known from an Ethiopian site called Omo Kibish, dated to 195,000 years ago.  The message we would like to convey is that our species is much older than we thought and that it did not emerge in an Adamic way in a small 'Garden of Eden' somewhere in East Africa. It is a pan-African process and more complex scenario than what has been envisioned so far,  Hublin said. The Moroccan fossils, found in what was a cave setting, represented three adults, one adolescent and one child roughly age 8, thought to have lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Dr. Jean-Jacques Hublin points out the new finds at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters June 7, 2017. He is pointing to the crushed human skull (Irhoud 10) whose orbits are visible just beyond his finger tip    Shannon McPherron, MPI EVA Leipzig/Handout via REUTERSThese were found alongside bones of animals including gazelles and zebras that they hunted, stone tools perhaps used as spearheads and knives, and evidence of extensive fire use. An analysis of stone flints heated up in the ancient fires let the scientists calculate the age of the adjacent human fossils, Max Planck Institute archaeologist Shannon McPherron said. There is broad agreement among scientists that Homo sapiens originated in Africa. These findings suggest a complex evolutionary history probably involving the entire continent, with Homo sapiens by 300,000 years ago dispersed all over Africa. Slideshow (2 Images)Morocco was an unexpected place for such old fossils considering the location of other early human remains. Based on the shape and age of the Moroccan fossils, the researchers concluded that a mysterious, previously discovered 260,000-year-old partial cranium from Florisbad, South Africa also represented Homo sapiens. The Jebel Irhoud people had large braincases that lacked the globular shape of those today. Max Planck Institute paleoanthropologist Philipp Gunz said the findings indicate the shape of the face was established early in the history of Homo sapiens, but brain shape, and perhaps brain function, evolved later. But given their modern-looking face and teeth, Hublin said, these people may have blended in today if they simply wore a hat. Homo sapiens is now the only human species, but 300,000 years ago it would have shared the planet with several now-extinct cousins in Eurasia - Neanderthals in the west and Denisovans in the east - and others in Africa. Hublin did not hazard a guess as to how long ago the very first members of our species appeared, but said it could not have been more than 650,000 years ago, when the evolutionary lineage that led to Homo sapiens split from the one that led to the Neanderthals.

I am extremely concerned about the dramatic escalation of the situation and the consequences for the entire region,  Gabriel told Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview on Wednesday before a meeting with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister. Gabriel told reporters after the meeting with Adel al-Jubeir he was surprised by the intensity of the tensions erupting in the Gulf region, and urged all sides to work to end the crisis.  Such a Trumpification of relations with one another is particularly dangerous in a region that is already rife with crises,  he told the newspaper, in an apparent reference to what critics say is the increasingly divisive rhetoric seen since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump last year.  Qatar is apparently to be more or less completely isolated and existentially targeted,  he said, adding:  A further escalation serves no one. The Middle East is a political and military powder keg.  Jubeir told reporters the Gulf states could resolve a row with Qatar among themselves without outside help.  We believe this issue can be dealt with among the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council,  he told a news conference with Gabriel. German officials said he expressed optimism that the crisis could be resolved quickly. Jubeir said he had not been officially informed of any U.S. investigation into the alleged hacking of Qatar's news agency, a development which is part of the dispute. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed their ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism and Iran, opening the worst rift in years among some of the most powerful states in the Arab world. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations. The three Gulf states announced the closure of transport ties with Qatar and gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their countries. Qatar was also expelled from a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. Jubeir told Reuters after a separate event that he did not expect the decision to harm the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, even though Qatar is home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, since strikes against the group were continuing from other air bases. Gabriel told reporters that Jubeir agreed it was critical to avoid further escalations. But he also said no members of the coalition fighting Islamic State should allow any government or private financing of militant groups, citing past reports about funding coming from Saudi-based foundations as well as Qatar. At an event hosted by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung think tank, Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was committed to cracking down on terrorist funding. He conceded there was no  perfect record,  adding,  We don't know what we don't know.  He said Qatar had failed to make good commitments made three years ago to curb funding for militant groups, and Riyadh had finally decided to try to spur its neighbour into action. He said the decision to cut off ties was  made very painfully,  but he hoped it would lead to needed changes.  We're not interested in doing harm to Qatar or the Qatari people,  he said.

Supply chain management and design has transferred to brand owner and franchisor Inter IKEA Group. Hopes are that with IKEA Group focusing fully on retail, it will be better placed to defend its market-leading position and maintain growth as competition and consumer expectations evolve.  There is a rapid change in the market where much of what we have learned and what we know of is changing radically,  Loof said, adding that he expects IKEA to keep its leading position.  We have one great advantage and that is that we design, produce and distribute our own unique range.

The global economy is set to grow 3.5 percent this year before nudging up to 3.6 percent in 2018, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, updating its forecasts in its latest Economic Outlook. That estimate for 2017 was not only a slight improvement from its last estimate in March for 3.3 percent growth, but it would also be the best performance since 2011. Yet despite this brighter outlook, growth would nonetheless fall disappointingly short of rates seen before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said.  Everything is relative. What I would not like us to do is celebrate the fact that we're moving from very bad to mediocre,  Gurria told Reuters in an interview.   It doesn't mean that we have to get used to it or live with it. We have to continue to strive to do better,  he added. While recovering trade and investment flows were supporting the improving economic outlook, Gurria said barriers in the form of protectionism and regulations needed to be lifted to ensure stronger growth. The improvement would also not be enough to satisfy people's expectations for better standards of living and reduce growing income inequality, he said. The OECD saw an improved global outlook even though it downgraded its estimates for the United States, despite a weaker dollar boosting exports and tax cuts supporting household spending and business investment.  FILE PHOTO: Construction cranes are seen in downtown Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 22, 2017.Lucy NicholsonThe OECD forecast U.S. growth of 2.1 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, down from estimates in March of 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. OECD chief economist Catherine Mann attributed the downgraded outlook to delays in the Trump administration pushing ahead with planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  The weaker U.S. outlook was offset by slightly improved perspectives for the euro zone, Japan and China.

Lifted by improving international trade in Asia and fiscal stimulus, Japanese growth was seen at 1.4 percent this year before slowing to 1.0 percent next year, both slightly raised from the OECD's March estimates of 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. The OECD also marginally nudged up its estimates for growth in China to 6.6 percent this year and 6.4 percent in 2018, boosted by stimulus spending. That in turn was supporting strong imports and helping to fuel a revival in Asian trade. As a result, global trade volumes were seen growing 4.6 percent this year, nearly double the rate seen in 2016. Among the risks to the OECD's outlook, it warned that the growing divergence between monetary policy rates among the major central banks raised the chances for financial market volatility. The OECD also saw a potential for  swift snap-back  in U.S. long-term interest rates when the Federal Reserve decides to reduce the size of its balance sheet, especially if it comes at a time of rising policy rates.

In the 6.00 a.m. call, he denied Qatar's emir made comments reported by the state-run news agency criticizing hostility to Iran, sympathizing with three Islamist groups, accusing Saudi Arabia of adopting an extremist ideology that fosters terrorism and suggesting Donald Trump may not last long as U.S. president. The adviser repeated a statement released hours earlier which said the news agency had been hacked, seeming unaware that Reuters had already reported the denial. The unusual timing of the call and the adviser's haste to get the message across pointed to Qatar's deep concern about the impact the remarks attributed to the emir could have. As anger mounted in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar's foreign minister tried to limit the fallout. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference that Qatar, host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East, wanted to maintain brotherly ties with its powerful neighbors in a region critical to world energy supplies. To outside observers, it was unclear whether the Qatar News Agency had indeed been hacked or whether an editor had published remarks which the emir later regretted saying.  But to Qatar's neighbors the question was irrelevant: the comments reflected the broad lines of Qatar's independent-minded foreign policy, which critics say has destabilized the region through its alliance with Islamist armed groups and cordial ties with Iran.     Officials in the Gulf say the comments marked a turning point, prompting Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to cut relations with Qatar in the biggest diplomatic shock in the region for years. Trouble Evident For Riyadh, trouble was also evident elsewhere.  Some Qatari-funded anti-Saudi websites had begun reporting on what they said were calls for protests against the kingdom's rulers, stirring memories of the Arab Spring revolutions that toppled the leaders of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.  They (Qataris) hired (financed) influential Saudi preachers, religious figures, journalists and academics to incite against Saudi Arabia,  one Gulf source told Reuters.  The Saudis had had it with Qatar. The Qataris keep channels open with Iran in various capitals and they campaign against the Egyptian state.  The Saudis had reached a  dead end  with Qatar and decided for the first time in 20 years to take action to damage its neighbor's interests, the source added.  Qatar denies inciting unrest in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere.     Another factor that pushed the four Sunni states over the line, according to Gulf officials, was last month's visit to Saudi Arabia by Trump, who has reversed the policies of  predecessor Barack Obama, thrown his weight behind the kingdom and its allies and expressed misgivings about Iran.     No sooner had Trump left Riyadh than the United States'  partners in the region moved against Qatar and its young emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, another American ally.     A series of flashpoints across the region in the days following Trump's visit heightened tensions that had been building for months and removed any hope among Qatar's neighbors of peeling it away from Iran and the Islamist groups it has engaged with for years.     Those tensions spilled into the public arena less than 48 hours after the Qatari emir took part in the Riyadh summit  attended by Trump which was meant to showcase U.S. support for solidarity of Sunni Muslim nations.     The alleged hacking incident came days after Qatar complained it was the target of  an orchestrated barrage  of criticism by unknown parties, in the run-up to Trump's visit.

Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS     After the Tamim speech, things went up an extra notch,  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The catalog is so wide... It is an accumulation,  Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs told Reuters.  It could have happened in March, it could have happened in December. But it was bound to happen. It was something that was ready to explode.  Gargash confirmed there were several major irritants that sped up the process. These included the comments attributed to the emir, UAE accusations that Qatar has undermined the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and Qatar's handling of a hostage crisis involving 24 members of the ruling elite in which it paid ransom money to  Islamist groups in Iraq an Syria. An annual phone call to mark the start of the holy Islamic month of Ramadan between Tamim and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on May 27 aggravated the situation further. Iran's Shi'ite-led government and Saudi Arabia's Sunni rulers compete for influence in the region and Jean-Marc Rickli, a Geneva-based risk analyst, called that a  diplomatic mistake (which) Saudi Arabia and the UAE jumped on .  Kuwait's emir offered to mediate but when Tamim attended an iftar (fast-breaking) Ramadan meal with him on May 30, Tamim left early, apparently unwilling to discuss the row, a Kuwaiti newspaper editor regularly briefed by officials told Reuters.      Rolling Meetings FILE PHOTO: (Front R-L) Jordan's King Abdullah II, Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, U.S. President Donald Trump, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani pose for a photo during Arab-Islamic-American Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 21, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoThe decision to cut ties with Qatar took shape in a rolling series of meetings over several weeks, said a Gulf Arab source.     But a second source said an important moment came last Saturday when Saudi King Salman and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, met for iftar in Jeddah. It is likely that Egypt came on board two days later, during a visit to Cairo by the Saudi foreign minister.     At dawn on Monday, those governments and Bahrain made a series of rapid fire announcements, revealing the move's careful orchestration and pre-planning.     A Western diplomat in Doha said the move was  clearly tied  to Trump's visit, suggesting it had emboldened Saudi Arabia and the UAE to act.      The opportunity presented itself with the Trump visit and Trump's presidency in general,  a former U.S. ambassador to Doha told Reuters, suggesting the move had been in the works for two or three months.      This is well choreographed. Everything came together at the same time.  U.S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia’s decision to sever ties with Qatar, current and former U.S. officials told Reuters. A senior administration official said Washington had no indication at the Riyadh summit that the move was about to happen but on Tuesday morning Trump directly waded into the dispute by praising the Arab powers’ decisions against Qatar. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have mainly portrayed the move as a step to combat what they call Qatar's funding for terrorists.   We want a black-and-white approach to terrorist financing,  said Gargash from the UAE Foreign Ministry.  We know the ABCs of dealing with terrorism. One of these ABCs is: You never feed the crocodiles.  Trump's tweets suggested he agreed with that view:  During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!  the president wrote. The Pentagon, however, mindful of the U.S. military base in Qatar, renewed its praise for Doha after Trump’s intervention -- showing again how U.S. officials are walking a tightrope as Trump’s tweets raise questions about existing policy and the scripted talking points used to explain it. Reports that Qatari officials paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Iran-backed groups in an April deal to free 26 of its citizens kidnapped in Iraq last year has also been an irritant in relations between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar denies trying to pay ransom money to secure the release of the hostages, although foreign minister al-Thani said it sent money  to support the authorities in the release of Qatari abductees .

Wade. The Delaware state House voted 22 to 16 on Tuesday to approve the measure, which had already passed in the state Senate. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats.    He will sign the bill,  Jonathan Starkey, a spokesman for Democratic Governor John Carney Jr., said on Wednesday. As early as the end of this week, Carney could sign the bill that supporters said codifies at the state level provisions of the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that protects a woman's right to abortion, legislative sources said.   Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nation's top court who would overturn Roe v. Wade and let states decide whether to legalize abortion.  By taking this step Delaware will be the first state since the election to protect abortion rights,  said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst with the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive policy. Abortion opponents had lobbied against the legislation and said they planned to take their fight to the governor's office.  We will exert the same pressure upon Governor Carney, a Catholic, to uphold the sanctity of life for those innocent unborn children whose lives depend upon his vetoing this radical bill,  said Delaware Right to Life spokeswoman Moira Sheridan. A bill to support abortion rights was approved by the Illinois legislature in May but the state's Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has vowed to veto it. In January, New York's Assembly adopted legislation similar to Delaware's, but it has stalled in the Senate.

Doing surgery on a torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) soon after the injury may be linked to worse problems five years later, especially if an individual also has a lot of pain and swelling or has injured other parts of the knee at the same time, lead study author Dr. Stephanie Filbay of the University of Oxford in the UK said by email.  It can lead to a longer recovery and worse prognosis, she told Reuters Health. Filbay and her colleagues analyzed data from a trial comparing outcomes for 18-to-35 year olds who, within a month of an acute ACL injury, were randomly assigned to surgery plus exercise or exercise therapy alone with the option to have surgery later.  Sixty-two participants had surgery plus exercise therapy and 59 had exercise therapy first. Half of the exercise-first group went on to have surgery: 23 of them about two years after the injury and seven in the three years after that, according to the report in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Exercise therapy alone led to fewer knee symptoms compared with early surgery plus exercise therapy, at least in the short term. Those who had early ACL surgery and also had an injured meniscus (cartilage pad in the knee joint) were less able to participate in sports post-surgery, and those who also had an injured ankle had a worse quality of life after surgery.  On the other hand, those who had exercise therapy alone and went on to have surgery on a different part of the knee had worse pain five years later than those who didn’t have non-ACL surgery. Taken together, the authors say, the findings suggest that young, active individuals with an acute ACL injury who also have an injured meniscus, and those who have more severe knee pain and functional problems early on may benefit most from starting with exercise therapy first, before considering ACL reconstruction. However, decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, they advise. Dr. Michael Alaia, an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, said this study was small and “larger studies will be necessary to truly understand which patients may benefit from an extended trial of non-operative management of their ACL tears.   While the authors found that some active young people might benefit from an exercise-first approach, Alaia suggests the approach might benefit patients who are less physically active, have other medical conditions or don’t engage in sports requiring pivoting.  “Limiting the number of ‘giving way’ episodes could reduce the chance of further damage to other important structures inside the knee,” he told Reuters Health in an email. Alaia noted that many of his New York City patients who had no insurance coverage until after implementation of the Affordable Care Act had ACL tears years earlier - as active teenagers or young adults - but could not obtain treatment. “Unfortunately, a great number of these patients went on to develop significant cartilage or meniscus damage at an early age,” he said. “This highlights the dilemma we have as surgeons - to try and figure out which patients will demonstrate continued instability and who will not,” he said, “and treat them appropriately before they go on to develop irreversible changes.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2s4i4zp British Journal of Sports Medicine, online May 17, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-aclrupture-surgery-idUSKBN18Y2K4"},

Like rival Tesla's energy storage business, the Renault-Nissan move underscores its desire to cultivate a second-hand battery market while encouraging the development of energy infrastructure that works for electric cars. The Renault-Nissan alliance plant, which has yet to be built, would be big enough to power 120,000 homes, or supplant the role of a gas- or coal-fired power station in meeting peak electricity demand on the grid, the sources said.  Rather than generating power, a storage plant charges up in times of excess supply and sells electricity back to the grid when needed. Proponents say such plants can play a key role in smoothing out unpredictable wind and solar power generation. Renault-Nissan is working in partnership with energy storage specialist The Mobility House on the mega battery which would be assembled from new or used electric car batteries, one of the sources said.  We're working with The Mobility House on several programs including a major energy storage project that is currently still in the study phase,  Renault spokeswoman Celine Farissier said, declining to give further details.  Makers of electric cars stand to benefit from the creation of a market for used lithium-ion batteries that can no longer power vehicles to drive far enough. Higher second-hand battery values could help bring down the cost of electric cars and mega batteries are one avenue for recycling the power cells. Nissan, 44 percent-owned by French alliance partner Renault, has already built a back-up power storage system for the Amsterdam Arena, which is home to soccer club Ajax, in a first partnership with the German start-up.  Marcus Fendt, its managing director, said the Munich-based company was working on a 100 MW plant with partners he declined to identify, citing confidentiality agreements. He said the studies were aimed at determining where to build the plant. Locations and end markets under consideration for the Renault-Nissan plant include Germany, which is suitable because of its high energy prices and its shift from nuclear to renewable energy, as well as the Netherlands, sources said.

California's Public Utilities commission selected a 100 MW battery storage system to replace a natural-gas power plant providing electricity for Southern California Edison (SCE_pe.A) in the Los Angeles area. Logo is seen on a ribbon at a dealing centre Renault store in Minsk, Belarus June 9, 2016.Vasily FedosenkoLarge batteries can help stabilize the primary reserve electricity market, which is responsible for ensuring the grid has at least 50 Hertz. Carmakers can also earn money competing with conventional power stations to guarantee the provision of electricity during periods of high demand or volatility.   We forecast the combined market for electric passenger vehicles, electric buses and battery storage to increase eight-fold to over $200 billion by 2020, a five-year compound annual growth rate of more than 50 percent,  Berenberg analysts said.  With about 4 million electric cars expected to be on the roads by 2020, vehicle manufacturers looking at ways to recycle batteries, including Tesla, which already sells everything from solar panels to batteries and electric cars. Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and China's BYD Co Ltd are also exploring so-called second-life storage projects with batteries. That includes partnerships such as the recent collaboration between BMW and Vattenfall [VATN.UL], in which the luxury automaker will deliver up to 1,000 lithium-ion batteries to the Swedish utility for storage projects this year.  What will end up happening is that BMW and Daimler will ... become utilities themselves,  said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital LLP, a corporate advisor in the energy, power infrastructure and technology sectors.  They use Vattenfall now because they need to learn but I think the amount of batteries coming back will be so big that I think they'll end up engaging directly with the end customer themselves. And they've got the brand name to do that.

Slideshow (13 Images)They were watched by descendants of some of the tens of thousands of men who fought in the week-long battle against German troops dug in on high ground near Ypres. The battle is significant for Ireland as it saw the mainly Catholic 16th (Irish) Division and the 36th (Ulster) Division, raised in the mainly Protestant north of the island, fight alongside each other, just a year after the failed Easter Rising in Dublin against British rule. Irish officials said Wednesday's ceremonies were a chance to  reflect on the journey of reconciliation in the century since and to highlight the positive relationship that exists on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and the United Kingdom . Messines Ridge, generally seen as a victory for British-led forces and a prelude to the bigger Battle of Passchendaele in the same area through the summer and autumn of 1917, is also a focus of World War One remembrance in Australia and New Zealand. Maori troops of the New Zealand Defence Force performed a traditional song at the start of early morning commemorations at another cemetery attended by Governor-General Patsy Reddy. Australia also held a centenary service on the battlefield.

Oil prices fell more than 4 percent due to an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories and took a toll on the energy sector, which dropped 2.1 percent. Exxon's 0.7 percent fall and Chevron's 1.3 percent fall were among the biggest drags on the S&P; 500 and the Dow. Investors are also keeping a watch on Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel on Thursday. Opinion polls have shown British Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government. The election could determine whether the country has a smooth or hard exit from the European Union.  If the Conservative party extends its majority, markets will be pretty calm, but anything less than that is going to have people worried about how we approach the Brexit negotiation,  said Luke Hickmore, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump might shed more light on a probe by the FBI into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. Any damaging revelation in Comey's testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's pro-business fiscal agenda.  I think the Comey news led to an initial surprise but the rebound was equally swift,  said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co.  I'm not sure that unless Comey says something completely shocking or he suggests something that there's no way the House can't consider obstruction of justice ... aside from that I don't see his testimony as market moving.  The ECB will also hold its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to reiterate its plan to extend the money-printing scheme at least until the end of the year. At 12:53 p.m. (1653 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.5 points, or 0.06 percent, at 21,122.73 and the S&P; 500 was down 3.46 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,425.87. The Nasdaq Composite was down 5.79 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,269.27. Seven of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the financial index's 0.78 percent rise leading the advancers.

The funds brought in $14 billion in cash during the week ended May 31, with the result driven by strong demand for equity exchange-traded funds, according to the trade group. Stock mutual funds posted $1.5 billion in outflows, while their ETF counterparts gathered $15.5 billion, according to the ICI. Mutual funds are heavily used by retail investors, while ETFs draw a diverse set of clients, including fast-trading hedge funds. The rebound for stock funds comes after cash seeped out of domestic equity funds for four straight weeks even as markets have trended higher since the U.S. presidential election last year.  Resilience is much less related to the Trump presidency than people think,  said Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio management at RiverFront Investment Group LLC in Richmond, Virginia, which invests using ETFs.  It has mostly to do with the most synchronized global growth impulse we've seen since the credit crisis, and positive earnings coming through in areas like Eurozone, Japan and even the U.S.  The S&P; 500 index .SPX has returned nearly 10 percent this year. Yet markets are grappling with a tension between flaccid U.S. economic data and strengthening corporate earnings. S&P; 500 earnings rose 15.6 percent last quarter from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, while U.S. job growth showed signs of slowing in May. Stock and bond markets have been reading the economic situation differently. While U.S. equities have repeatedly set record highs, government debt markets forecast slower-than expected growth, pricing in just three U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes through 2019. The Fed itself projects raising rates far more, and markets see a hike after their next policy meeting next Wednesday as a foregone conclusion. The strong flows for equity ETFs may not be sustained. The largest U.S.-based domestic stock ETF, SPDR S&P; 500 ETF (SPY.P), posted $4.1 billion in outflows on Monday, after the latest ICI measurement period closed, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit. U.S.-based bond funds pulled in $5.1 billion during the most recent week, ICI said. The debt funds have not recorded a week of withdrawals this year. Commodity funds recorded $458 million in withdrawals for the week, the most since early March.

Our air traffic organization must be more nimble,  U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told the Senate Commerce Committee.  A bulky federal government procurement apparatus does not move fast enough to keep pace with new technologies and new demands.  President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled the plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the aegis of a nonprofit entity. Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said on Wednesday that small airports in his state oppose the plan. He said that after air traffic privatization in the United Kingdom airline passenger fees rose 30 percent.  This is a tough sell,  Wicker said. Senator Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said he remains  skeptical  of the idea of removing Congress from air traffic control oversight and handing it to a 13-member board. The administration says it would not charge the private entity for the government's air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, opposes the proposal.  Why give away billions of dollars in government assets to an entity that will be governed in large part by the airlines?  he asked. Nelson argued  a fundamental breakup of the FAA cannot advance when there are such strong divisions among aviation stakeholders and in Congress. It just won't happen.      Chao denied that the major airlines would control the board and said they would have just two seats on the board. She also pledged to address rural concerns. One big issue is whether general aviation could face higher costs and access to airspace if a private board takes over. Executives from United Airlines (UAL.N), Hawaiian Airlines Inc [HAII.UL], American Airlines Inc (AAL.O) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), all represented by the Airlines for America lobbying group, praised the Trump plan on Monday. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.

Trump,Hillary Clinton,Mark Warner,Matt Blaze,Robert Mueller,Vladimir Putin,US,USA,TRUMP,RUSSIA,LEAKS,Computer Crime / Hacking / Cybercrime,Russia,Picture available,Government / Politics,Major News,Europe,Science,Presidential Elections,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Russian hacking of the 2016 U.S. election included sophisticated targeting of state officials responsible for voter rolls and voting procedures, according to a top secret U.S. intelligence document that was leaked and published this week, revealing another potential method of attempted interference in the vote. The month-old National Security Agency document outlined activities including impersonating an election software vendor to send trick emails to more than 100 state election officials. Analysts at the NSA believed the hackers were working for the Russian military's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, according to the document. The document's publication on Monday by The Intercept, a news outlet that focuses on security issues, received particular attention because an intelligence contractor, Reality Leigh Winner, was charged the same day with leaking it. U.S. intelligence agencies have previously said the Kremlin tried to influence the election outcome in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump through leaks during the campaign of hacked emails from Democratic Party officials, aimed at discrediting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The new revelations suggest that U.S. investigators are also still probing a more direct attempt to attack the election itself, and a federal official confirmed that is the case. However, there is no evidence that hackers were able to manipulate votes, or the vote tally. The document says at least one employee of the software vendor had an account compromised but does not cover whether any of the elections officials were also successfully compromised. If they did compromise the officials, hackers could have planted malicious software, then captured proof of the infection to suggest that there had been fraud on Clinton's behalf, had she won the Nov. 8 election, experts said. “If your goal is to disrupt an election, you don’t need to pick the winner or actually tamper with tally result,  said Matt Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer science professor who has written on the security of voting machines. Simply casting doubt on the legitimacy of the results could achieve the goals of a government-sponsored hacking campaign, he said.  U.S. intelligence officials had previously stated that Russian intelligence had won access to  multiple  election officials but had said that compromised machines were not involved with vote tallies. But they had not said how sophisticated and extensive the effort was or how it worked. Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly denied Russian government involvement in election hacking, though he said last week that  patriotic  Russians could have been involved. Trump has denied any collusion. Spear-Phishing on Elections Officials The newly leaked NSA report said the hackers used so-called  spear-phishing  techniques on election officials, trying to convince targets to click on links in emails that seemed to come from legitimate correspondents. The report describes just one phishing campaign, which hit state officials a week before the election, but does not give any locations or say if it was successful. Although there may have been many others, security experts said one coming so late in the game would be more likely to be about sowing chaos than  trying to alter vote counts.  The report did not say what the hackers were trying to accomplish, and any investigation of the computers of people who were targeted would be the jurisdiction of the FBI. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday, as did the office of the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Attacking Voter Rolls The  bait  used in the spear-phishing campaign involved software for managing voter registration rolls. The hackers might have been considering deleting some records and forcing officials to turn legitimate voters away, said elections technology security expert Alex Halderman, of the University of Michigan. There were no wide reports of mass rejections of voters, so perhaps that plan was abandoned or proved too hard to execute, he said. It is also possible that the idea was to get onto the machines of officials who oversaw both registration and voting software. Elections are run by counties in the United States.  “Depending on the county’s configuration and security practices and what is separated from what, they could have access to potentially every aspect, from lists of registered voters, to voting  machines, to firmware on those machines, to the ballots that are presented, to the software that controls the final tally,” Blaze said. “This is the holy grail of what an attacker would want to compromise.”  Members of Congress said they hoped to learn more about the hacking attempts. “It’s important that the American people understand that the Russian attempts to break into a number of our state voting processes - we talked about this in the fall - was broad-based,” Democrat Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee, told reporters.  It’s my hope in the coming days that we can get more information out about that.” Reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Additonal reporting by Dustin Volz, Jim Finkle and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Frances Kerry","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-leaks-idUSKBN18Y2IF"},

We've had situations like this before and haven't been able to build momentum. So, we'll hope to carry it on to the rest of the series and into the upcoming games. Hopefully this can kind of get us over the hump and we can really build on this.  LF Alex Gordon hit his first home run in the third inning since Sept. 25. He ended a streak of 192 at-bats without a home run.  Gordy's looking much better,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  Last night, a couple of long fly outs and a double down the line and finally got the monkey off his bat.  DH Mike Moustakas matched a career high with four hits. It is the fifth time he has accomplished that. He recorded his second walk-off home run.

He struck out 11 batters and walked none, and was upset over an odd call in the first inning that gave the White Sox a home run on a ball that dropped into center field short of the warning track. INF Michael Martinez was designated for assignment by the Rays after the game. He hit .167 in 30 at-bats as an injury replacement over the past month. Martinez had zero RBIs after being acquired from the Indians. 2B Brad Miller had the odd distinction of being intentionally walked twice after entering the game as a pinch-hitter.

Over 616 major league games, Tejada has hit .252 with 104, doubles, 10 homers and 253 RBIs. C Welington Castillo (groin) took batting practice prior to the series opener against the Pirates on Tuesday. He could avoid a rehab assignment because of a challenging road schedule with the Orioles minor league affiliates.  We may just do a (simulated) game with him, have him catch BP with some hitters,  manager Buck Showalter said. If there are no setbacks, Castillo could be activated from the disabled list Saturday and join the club for its series against the Yankees. Castillo was placed on the 10-day DL on May 31 after suffering a testicular injury the previous night on a deflected ball. He has been one of the Orioles' most productive hitters, batting .317 with four home runs and 17 RBIs. INF Ryan Flaherty (right shoulder inflammation) will see a specialist Friday in hopes of being cleared to begin throwing.

Flaherty is batting .233 with three RBIs in 13 games and is a valuable utility infielder.

He allowed four runs on eight hits with four strikeouts and a walk on 113 pitches.  I think that's a theme for me, really, this whole season is giving up way too many two-strike hits,  Gausman said.  I threw some great pitches to get to that point, but obviously, they also did a really good job with some fastballs up and just kind of didn't hit them hard, but just kind of hit them where guys weren't.

Travis underwent offseason surgery on his right knee, but he was hitting .259 with 18 doubles, five home runs and 24 RBIs this season in 50 games. Travis missed the first 47 games last season after offseason left shoulder surgery. He had two lengthy stays on the DL for shoulder injuries in 2015. Neither Travis nor Blue Jays manager John Gibbons can pinpoint when Travis was injured this time. His knee locked up on him during the Blue Jays' flight Sunday night to Oakland. Gibbons said he doesn't know how long Travis will be sidelined.  I've never seen anything like it,  Gibbons said of Travis' injuries.  You know, one guy, ever since he arrived. He's such a good player. He had a big part in the month of May keeping us afloat. He's proved he can hit. He's a pretty good little defender too. I know he's frustrated.

At Albuquerque, Tapia is hitting .356 with 15 doubles, four triples, one homer, 23 RBI and 29 runs scored in 34 games. RHP Antonio Senzatela gave up three runs on six hits in 6 1/3 innings and won his National League-leading eighth game. He became the third pitcher in Rockies history to hit a three-run double, joining Willie Blair in 1993 and Jorge De La Rosa (2010). The double came in the second and gave the Rockies a 3-0 lead. It was the first career extra-base hit for Senzatela, who had two RBIs in his first 21 career at-bats. INF/OF Alexi Amarista was placed on the paternity list and will rejoin the Rockies on Friday at Chicago for the second game of a four-gamer series with the Cubs.

RHP Chad Bettis (cancer) rejoined the Rockies and hopes to be able to pitch for them by the All-Star break. Manager Bud Black said he was hoping Bettis would be able to return  maybe sometime in July.  Bettis was diagnosed with testicular cancer in November and underwent surgery then. He went to spring training, thinking he was healthy enough to prepare for the season, but learned in March that cancer had been detected and he would have to undergo chemotherapy.  The strength is there,  said Bettis, who threw on flat ground from about 60-75 feet.  It's much more the stamina. Going through the chemo, I realize what it can do to your lungs. I've got to get that back. I found myself a little bit short of breath today at the very end of throwing. But then again, with cardio, I'd bike about 5 miles and that first day, I was winded, I was gassed down in Arizona. I waited a day, did it again and my body adjusted and felt a lot better.

He had thrown two bullpen sessions without a walking boot but faced hitters for the first time and did fielding drills for the first time since he suffered the foot injury in his third start of the season April 13.  I'm just trying to get my pitches back -- fastballs in, fastballs away and raise (the ball) when I want to and throw some breaking balls,  Gray said.  That's really what I wanted to see today on the mound, but I did ramp it up to game speed. It was a little shaky at first, but the more and more I felt my delivery, the easier it got. It all came together pretty well.  Gray said that fielding balls, throwing to the bases and covering first base was a good test and went well.  This is the first time I've moved laterally and side-to-side working on things, and not feeling pain at all is a good sign.  When Gray is ready to begin a rehab assignment, he will have to build his arm strength to be able to throw 80-90 pitches, a process that is likely to take three rehab starts. RHP Adam Ottavino (right shoulder inflammation) will throw a bullpen session Wednesday, his first since going on the 10-day disabled list May 30, and is eligible to be reinstated Friday at Chicago.  I'm throwing a bullpen tomorrow,  he said.  We'll see how that goes. I should be back in a couple days, if all goes well. I feel good, just a couple days (off) is all I needed.  Manager Bud Black said,  He's doing great. Arm feels as good as it's felt since spring training, so he's in a really good spot.

Parra pulled up as he neared the base and was tagged out. Manager Bud Black said,  We'll see how it sets up in the next couple days. These things are tough to read off the bat sometimes.

RHP Chad Green struck out five in 3 1/3 perfect innings in relief of RHP Masahiro Tanaka. He threw 45 pitches, three shy of his season high.

LHP Aroldis Chapman (left rotator cuff inflammation) said Tuesday he will head to Tampa, Fla., for a simulated game at the Yankees' minor league facility. If the simulated game goes well, Chapman will appear in a rehab game with Double-A Trenton.

In voting totals released Tuesday, Judge has 1,251,543 votes, putting him ahead of Mike Trout by 96,187 votes. While Judge downplayed it, manager Joe Girardi was thrilled for the rookie.  I think people are recognizing what he's doing,  Girardi said.  I think people have kind of went 'wow I want to see this kid, I want to see this kid play in the All-Star game' because a lot of people don't get a chance to see him play every day and I think his personality has resonated with the fans around the country with the way he plays the game.  On Tuesday, Judge extended his hitting streak to a career-high nine games and reached in his first three plate appearances before striking out against RHPs Joe Kelly and Craig Kimbrel in his final two at-bats. Judge is batting .382 in his last nine games and .328 overall. RHP Masahiro Tanaka's struggles continued Tuesday when he allowed three home runs among five hits and five runs in five innings. Since his three-hitter in Boston on April 27, he is 2-5 with an 8.50 ERA and during a five-start losing streak, his ERA is 10.50 Tanaka has allowed 14 of his 17 homers since April 27 and Tuesday marked the eighth time in his career he allowed at least three homers. Tanaka's latest sub-par outing occurred a day after Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez tweeted:  I think is time to panic about Tanaka. His stuff is not there, that eastern division is really tough; I don't see him getting any better.  Most of the postgame questions to Joe Girardi were about Tanaka and when asked if the issues might be physical, the manager reiterated they weren't by saying:  There's nothing that leads us to believe he's hurt. There's no signs.  CF Jacoby Ellsbury (concussion like symptoms) remains shut down, though manager Joe Girardi said he is feeling better. Ellsbury was injured crashing into the wall while tracking down a fly ball by Kansas City SS Alcides Escobar on May 24 and has been on the DL since. Girardi also said Ellsbury had an MRI on his neck Monday and it showed no structural damage.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-playerwatch-idUSMTZED676SLQJS"},

Pinder, who started in right field, threw out Blue Jays CF Kevin Pillar with one out in the fifth inning when Pillar tried to stretch a single into a double. Pinder quickly got to Pillar's line drive down the line, spun and threw a one-hop strike to SS Adam Rosales.  Chad Pinder, I thought that was the turning point in the game,  A's RHP Jesse Hahn said.  I was hoping Pillar  was going to run to second because I thought he had a really good shot at him.  Pinder usually plays shortstop or second base, but the A's are short-handed in the outfield because of injuries to RF Matt Joyce (strained quad) and Khris Davis (strained calf), who started at designated hitter Tuesday. 1B/OF Matt Olson was optioned to Triple-A Nashville on Tuesday. The A's had recalled Olson on Saturday. He walked with the bases loaded as a pinch hitter against Washington on Sunday in his only plate appearance during his second stint with Oakland this season.

Hahn (2-4) ended his career-high-tying three-game losing streak and won for the first time since April 19 against Texas. He allowed one unearned run on seven hits over six innings with two strikeouts and one walk. He left his previous start on May 23 against Miami in the third inning with a strained right triceps that led to a significant drop in velocity. But after 10 days on the DL and one rehab start, Hahn's low-to-mid 90s velocity was back, and he got back on track.  Really, really good,  A's catcher Stephen Vogt said of Hahn's performance.  He came out right away locating. Good movement on the sinker today, and his curveball was as good as I think it's been all year tonight. There were some good sliders too and he got some ground balls on the changeup as well. All four pitches working really well for the first time. I was thankful he's back and healthy and feeling good. That's the No. 1 thing.  RF Matt Joyce missed Tuesday night's game against Toronto with a strained left quad. Joyce, a left-handed hitter, won't be in the lineup Wednesday when the A's face Blue Jays lefty Francisco Liriano, and A's manager Bob Melvin said he didn't know whether Joyce would be available off the bench. The A's have an off day Thursday before beginning a road trip at Tampa Bay on Friday. LHP Sean Doolittle (strained left shoulder) will make his third rehab appearance Wednesday, this one for Triple-A Nashville after two games with Class A Stockton. If all goes well, A's manager Bob Melvin said Tuesday, Doolittle will be activated during the A's upcoming road trip, which begins Friday against Tampa Bay.

Ukrainian Svitolina saved four set points at 5-6 in the second and then had a match point in the tiebreak which Halep saved with a brave forehand that kissed the sideline and followed that with an improvised backhand winner.

But Svitolina, bidding to become Ukraine's first female grand slam semi-finalist after a stellar year in which she has won four titles, charged into a 5-1 lead in the second set. Again Halep showed her mettle to stay alive but it still seemed in vain until she leveled at 5-5 and then went 40-0 up on Svitolina's serve before the Ukrainian rallied to take the set into a tiebreak.

Researchers compared menopause symptoms for women at a healthy weight to women who were either overweight or obese and found that three symptoms got progressively worse as women’s size increased: hot flashes and night sweats, muscle and joint problems and bladder issues.  “Intensity of hot flashes increased progressively with body mass index (BMI) and obesity had a great impact on daily activities such as involuntary interruption of work tasks and decrease of overall performance,” said lead study author Dr. Lucia Costa-Paiva of the State University of Campinas in Sao Paulo. “There was also a lower level of leisure time activities in these women,” Costa-Paiva said by email. “Thus it adds strong evidence to encourage women on losing weight.” Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, which typically happens between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterwards, women can experience symptoms ranging from vaginal dryness to mood swings, joint pain and insomnia. Recent research has found that 57 percent of women between ages 40 and 64 worldwide experience hot flashes, 60 percent report sexual dysfunction, 62 percent have joint and muscle pain and 50 percent have sleep problems, the study authors note in the journal Menopause. Doctors have long believed that obesity might protect against hot flashes because fat tissue boosts the body’s supply of estrogen, a hormone that can help blunt the severity of these symptoms, Costa-Paiva said. But the current study builds on more recent research that points in the opposite direction, suggesting that obesity might make hot flashes worse because fat works as an insulator trapping heat in the body, she said. To assess the relationship between obesity and menopause symptom severity, Costa-Paiva and colleagues examined survey data from 749 Brazilian women aged 45 to 60 years old. Women scored symptoms from zero for no issues to four points for very severe problems.  Participants were about 53 years old on average and had typically gone through menopause when they were around 47 years old. While most of them, 68 percent, were postmenopausal, about 16 percent had not started going through menopause yet and another 16 percent were midway through the process.  The study included 288 women with a BMI below 25, which researchers classified as a normal or healthy weight, 255 overweight women with a BMI of at least 25 and less than 30, and 206 obese women with a BMI of 30 or more.  It wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how obesity impacts the frequency or severity of menopause symptoms. Another limitation of the survey is that it relied on women to accurately recall and report on previous experiences with symptoms, the authors note. “To date, the evidence that weight loss will reduce symptoms is lacking as no such clinical trial has been done,” said Dr. Susan Davis, a women’s health researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “But we encourage weight loss at midlife in overweight women to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and breast cancer,” Davis said by email.  Research linking obesity to worse menopause symptoms started emerging more than a decade ago, noted Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, a reproductive health researcher at Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “The theory is that heat is generated centrally, and heavy women have more insulation, so that the heat can not be dissipated as well and they get hotter,” Minkin said by email.  Losing weight can help with hot flashes as well as with muscle and joint pain associated with menopause that may be exacerbated by the extra pounds, Minkin added.

It is monsoon season in Myanmar, but Kyaw Kyaw Htey said the weather had been  normal  with good visibility when the plane took off. The military launched a search soon after the plane went missing, mobilizing six navy ships and three military planes, said the army in a news release. The search continued as darkness fell.  Some 300-400 people, including firefighters, medics, emergency and welfare officials, gathered on the shore near the town of Launglon, close to the area where the navy search was concentrated, said Naing Myo Thwin, the chairman of the local funeral association, from the scene.  We haven't seen any trace of the plane yet,  Naing Myo Thwin told Reuters by telephone. He doubles as a member of the local hospital's emergency team. Aung Win, a local police officer also speaking from the scene by telephone, confirmed that there were a large number of people gathered on the beach. He said because they had not found any trace of the plane they were moving to other areas along the shore. The aircraft was bought in March 2016 and had a total of 809 flying hours. It was carrying 2.4 tons of supplies, the military said. Aircraft incidents, both civilian and military, are not uncommon in the Southeast Asian country.  A military helicopter crashed in June last year in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel on board.  Five military personnel were killed last February after an air force aircraft crashed in the country’s capital Naypyitaw, according to media reports. Two people were killed and 11 injured after a small plane crashed in central Myanmar in 2012.

Islamic State said it was responsible, the first time the hardline Sunni Muslim militant group has claimed attacks in the tightly controlled Shi'ite Muslim country. But other Sunni militant groups in Iran have long carried out periodic attacks on military and civilian targets, aiming to highlight what they say is discrimination against Iran's Arab minority and Sunni ethnic groups. Iran has stepped up its crackdown against members of such networks in recent years, with mass arrests and death sentences. The Arab minorities who mainly live in Iran's oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan province, and Sunni Baluchis in poor Sistan-Baluchestan in the country's southeast, say they are deprived of decent living standards and some civil rights. The main Sunni Iranian separatist groups increasingly see themselves as part of a larger struggle between Shi'ite Iran and the Sunni-ruled Arab states across the Gulf, which back opposing sides in the Syrian civil war, Iraq and Yemen. Tehran claims Saudi Arabia is funding most of these groups, a charge Riyadh denies. Below is the list of main Sunni militant groups in Iran: Jaish Al-Adl Jaish al-Adl (or the Army of Justice) is a Sunni militant group that has carried out several attacks on Iranian security forces mainly in Sistan-Baluchestan.  Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility in April for attacks that killed 10 Iranian border guards near Pakistan.  Iran says the group has safe havens in Pakistan and has warned it will hit their bases there if Islamabad does not confront them. Jundullah Jundullah (or Soldiers of God), a Sunni separatist group, has claimed responsibility for bombings in the last decade that have killed scores of Iranians, including senior commanders of the Revolutionary Guards. The group, which also has bases in Pakistan, is believed to be significantly weakened after its leader Abdolmalek Rigi was captured and executed by Iran in 2010. Jundullah also targets Pakistan's minority Shi'ite community and pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. Ansar Al-Furqan Ansar al-Furqan (or Partisans of the Criterion) is a Baluchestan-based Sunni jihadi group that has threatened to carry out suicide attacks on Iranian economic and military centers in revenge for the government executing Sunni prisoners. The group was formed when Sunni Baloch insurgent group Harakat Ansar Iran (Movement of the Partisans of Iran), active in Sistan-Baluchestan since 2012, merged with another local Sunni group, Hizbul-Furqan, in 2013. The move aimed to strengthen their fight against Tehran's authorities. Movement for Liberation of Ahwaz The Mohiuddin al Nasser Martyrs Brigade, the armed wing of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Iran. The group killed two members of the Revolutionary Guards in January in Khuzestan province. The group has also claimed it has blown up several oil pipelines in Khuzestan in recent years.  Ahvazi Arabs are a minority in mainly ethnic Persian Iran, and some see themselves as under Persian occupation and want independence or autonomy.

Data released on Tuesday by the U.S. Travel Association (USTA), in partnership with Oxford Economics, showed stronger-than-expected April demand despite the initial messy rollout of President Donald Trump's order in January barring travel to the United States from several Muslim majority countries. That order has been stayed by a number of federal courts, and is now awaiting a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  April is the first month when data on international travel would reliably reflect the impact of the controversy over Trump's order, the U.S. Travel Association said.  There have been many claims that the administration's actions on travel have tarnished America's brand abroad, but we're seeing hard economic evidence of the U.S. travel sector's remarkable resilience,  USTA Chief Executive Officer Roger Dow said in a statement. However, the full report cautioned that international travel to the United States in April grew at  a slower pace than the six-month moving average  and may have been helped by holiday travel.  Looking ahead, a variety of factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, a fragile global economy and a turbulent political environment are expected to negatively impact international inbound travel.  A plane passes the air traffic control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., June 5, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe group projected total U.S. travel volume is expected to grow by an average of 1.8 percent year-over-year through October of 2017, despite a forecast decline in international travel.      Travel Worries While the airline industry is on track for an eighth successive year of profitability, travel industry executives gathered for a conference in Cancun, Mexico this week expressed concern that potential U.S. restrictions on travel would undercut their business.  Any barrier to borders, we consider as a threat,  International Air Transport Association director general Alexandre de Juniac told reporters ahead of the meeting. IATA represents some 275 airlines from across the globe. De Juniac has also expressed concern about a Trump administration order barring large electronic devices, including laptop computers, from the passenger cabins of planes headed to the United States from certain Middle Eastern countries.

The Freedom Caucus supports  the House staying in session through the August recess to continue working to accomplish the priorities of the American people,  according to a brief statement the group issued late Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, dismissed the idea of skipping the summer break. She said Republicans intend to stick to their agenda. Republicans control both the House and Senate, but Congress has failed to pass major legislation yet this year.

The government's moves to make an example of Silicon Valley have met with widespread criticism from rival politicians and security experts for their lack of workable policy proposals. Her comments in the wake of this weekend's London attacks drew attention to her own record of cutting police budgets and failing to crack down on home-grown jihadists in a campaign that polls nonetheless show she is likely to win. There is mounting evidence that jihadists responsible for recent attacks in London and Manchester have relied largely on low-tech techniques rather than social media propaganda and encrypted communications tools that May has singled out. What Does the Government Want to Do?  The Conservative government has sought to enlist public opinion to force internet companies to work more closely with the government rather than proposing new legislation or policies to assert greater control over the web. In recent months, the government has lambasted the big Silicon Valley companies - Google, Facebook and Twitter - for not quickly enough taking down extremist propaganda used to recruit  lone wolf  attackers.  The companies should accept their responsibility in relation to what is being put across their platforms,  May said in a campaign speech in central England on Tuesday.   Because quite frankly we see hateful ideology being spewed across their platforms by the extremists that can lead to terrorism and we don't want to see a safe space online for the terrorists to be planning their attacks.  Social Media Response After resisting more forceful action for years, the internet firms say they are now making heavy investments and employ thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content on their platforms, while acknowledging they continue to struggle to identify replacement accounts that quickly reappear. There is evidence their efforts are working. Extremist monitoring group Site Intelligence Group said a pro-Islamic State tech group claimed to have generated 11,000 social media accounts for IS supporters in May, down from 15,000 in April, marking a continuing decline over the past year. Google said it now manages to review 98 percent of complaints about videos on its YouTube service within 24 hours and has a  zero tolerance  policy toward extremist content.  We want to make sure that terrorists do not have a voice and cannot spread extremist material on our services,  Google spokesman Peter Barron said. Twitter said that in the second half of 2016, it suspended 376,890 accounts for promoting what it labels as terrorism. Three-quarters of these violations were detected automatically, while most of the rest were from complaints by Twitter users. In that time frame, Twitter said it received 681 requests from UK law enforcement for user data tied to 1,017 accounts.   Terrorist content has no place on Twitter,  Nick Pickles, the company's UK head of public policy, said in a statement. Facebook declined to comment.  Regarding the internet, much has changed since 2014. Big social media platforms have cracked down on jihadist accounts,  Kings College extremism expert Peter Neumann said in response to May's Internet crackdown speech.  Encryption Widely used messaging services such as WhatsApp and Telegram secure private messages with end-to-end encryption, which means that messages can only be seen by the sender and the recipient. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has called for a ban on encrypted messaging services, saying that there should be  no place for terrorists to hide . Her assertions have been met with criticism for seeking to roll back privacy protections for consumers that are key for secure online banking or shopping, and because such moves have been shown over the years to encourage extremists to switch to new tools available in darker corners of the internet.  Technology experts complain that weakening encryption by creating backdoors for government will inevitably open up online messaging services to bad actors, leaving the phones, computers and other devices the world relies on far more vulnerable. Security expert Neumann emphasized how few people are radicalized exclusively online and that the London attackers appeared to be part of a well-known jihadist network under hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who operated freely in Britain until 2015.   Blaming social media platforms is politically convenient but intellectually lazy,  Neumann said in a widely quoted tweet.

Gross domestic product growth will be between 1.8 percent and 2 percent this year, said Richard Francis, the agency's director of sovereign debt, below a previous Fitch estimate of 2.3 percent.  The debt in terms of GDP is much higher than for the average of debt ratings, it is close to 50 percent, versus a 40 percent for the median (of countries) with BBB,  Francis told journalists at an economic conference in Bogota.  You can say it's necessary to have a larger adjustment next year to maintain the stability of debt in terms of GDP,  Francis said.  We want to see a fall in debt in terms of GDP, not just that it stabilizes, more efforts are needed.  The country's economy grew 2 percent last year, while first quarter 2017 figures came in at 1.1 percent, below central bank estimates. GDP is an indicator that measures the health of an economy. In March, Fitch raised its rating of the Andean country to stable from negative. The central bank predicts the economy will grow 1.8 percent in 2017, below the government target of 2.5 percent. Bank board member Jose Antonio Ocampo told Reuters last week he sees expansion at an even-lower 1.5 percent. Francis predicted inflation will finish within or  very close  to the central bank's target range of 2 percent to 4 percent. Twelve-month consumer prices were 4.37 percent in May. A tax reform passed last year will help Colombia meet this year's fiscal deficit target of 3.6 percent of GDP, Francis added.

Thiem faces fourth seed Rafa Nadal next with the Spaniard is in ominous form, having dropped just 22 games during his charge into the last four.

Novak Djokovic effectively waved the white flag, bowing out of the French Open with a whimper on Wednesday. The 30-year-old Serb, who has prevailed in some of the sport's epic battles on the way to 12 major titles, was barely recognizable as he capitulated in a 7-6(5) 6-3 6-0 defeat by Austrian Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals. After squandering two set points in the opener on a blustery Court Suzanne Lenglen, Djokovic's renowned fighting spirit ebbed away quickly and he surrendered the third set in 20 minutes. The result was all the more remarkable as in five previous matches with the 23-year-old he had lost one set and last month thrashed him 6-1 6-0 in Rome -- a result that suggested Djokovic had found his mojo, missing since he won the French a year ago. Sixth seed Thiem, who to be fair played superbly in the first set but must have thought he was facing a Djokovic impersonator thereafter, is yet to drop a set at this year's tournament but his next task is a daunting one.  It doesn't get any easier,  Thiem, beaten by Djokovic in last year's semi-final, said on court when asked to comment on the prospect of facing favorite Rafa Nadal in the semis. Related CoverageTitle-chasing Thiem gears up for tough Nadal testDjokovic searching for answers as slide continuesSerbian fans turn on Djokovic after Thiem debacleWhile Thiem's part in Djokovic's downfall should not be overlooked, it was the Serbian world number two's astonishing collapse that was the talk of Roland Garros. Double French Open champion Jim Courier, commentating on the match, said the Serb had shown 'no fight'. Listless Djokovic That was certainly true after the first set as Djokovic, whose new coach Andre Agassi had already flown home, appeared lost and listless, misfiring a succession of lame backhands. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 7, 2017   Austria's Dominic Thiem celebrates after winning his quarter final match against Serbia's Novak Djokovic   Reuters / Pascal Rossignol Obviously nothing was going my way and everything his way. Just pretty bad set,  said Djokovic, who split with his long-term coaching crew last month and announced shortly before the French he would be working with eight-times major winner Agassi.  It was decided I think in the first set today. I tried. I lost that crucial break in the beginning of the second, and he started serving better, backing it up with the first shot. He deserved to win. He was definitely the better player.  It was Djokovic's first defeat before the semi-finals in Paris since 2010 when he was also beaten by an Austrian, Juergen Melzer in the quarter-finals. Slideshow (6 Images)The danger signs were already there in the early stages when Thiem broke the Djokovic serve in the third game. However, Djokovic responded to break back twice in a row, only to drop his own serve at 4-2 with a forehand error. Djokovic piled on the pressure when Thiem served at 4-5 and he had his man in trouble at 15-40. Thiem saved the first set point with a volley, then forced a backhand error on the second. The tiebreak was nip and tuck with a succession of points against the serve but Thiem took it when Djokovic shovelled a tight-looking backhand into the net. Djokovic dropped serve at the start of the second set and the expected backlash never materialized as Thiem marched toward the last four with unexpected ease. Djokovic raised his fist to the crowd after winning a point early in the third but it was a hollow gesture. He did save one match point but was already walking toward the net to shake hands when Thiem sent a backhand fizzing past him a few seconds later. Thiem, who has 22 wins in claycourt matches this year and reached finals in Barcelona and Madrid where he lost to Nadal,  is the second Austrian man to reach multiple grand slam semi-finals after former French Open champion Thomas Muster.

In written testimony released the day before he appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said Trump told him at a meeting in the White House in February:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.  The testimony puts more pressure on Trump, a Republican, whose presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that Moscow helped him win last year's election. Some legal experts said Comey’s testimony could strengthen any impeachment case built on obstruction of justice, but U.S. markets shrugged off the news from the testimony for lack of any major disclosures. To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation. While a sitting president is very unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Comey said he had told Trump on three occasions he was not being investigated, confirming an earlier account from the president. Trump, who spent part of Wednesday in Ohio talking about the need to fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure, ignored reporters’ shouted questions about Comey. On returning to the Oval Office, Trump went into a meeting with top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. Later, his outside counsel released a statement saying Trump felt  completely and totally vindicated  by Comey's account.  The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,  Marc Kasowitz, Trump's attorney, said in a statement. 'Awkward Silence' Related CoverageFactbox: Former FBI Director Comey testimony on conversations with TrumpQ&A: What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 electionText: Ex-FBI Director Comey's prepared testimony to Senate panelSeveral congressional committees, as well as the FBI and a special counsel, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November's election in Trump's favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion. Trump abruptly fired Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe, on May 9. Comey painted a vivid picture for senators of awkward encounters with Trump in seven pages of testimony. Comey described a private dinner in the Green Room of the White House on Jan. 26, where Trump asked him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director, telling him:  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.   I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence,  Comey said in his testimony, explaining he became concerned that Trump was trying to create  some sort of patronage relationship.  On Feb. 14, after an Oval Office briefing on counterterrorism, Trump asked Comey to stay behind, dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who lingered, and waving off Priebus, who peeked through the door. FILE PHOTO -  FBI Director James Comey waits to testify to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on  Russia's intelligence activities  on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 10, 2017.Joshua Roberts/File Photo When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn,'  Comey said in his testimony. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States. The FBI has been investigating Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey quoted Trump as telling him:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  On March 30, Trump phoned Comey and asked what  we could do to lift the cloud  of the FBI's Russia investigation.  He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia,  said Comey, who had briefed Trump on  salacious material  that had arisen in a counter-intelligence investigation. Slideshow (11 Images)Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Trump, said in a statement that the uncorroborated dossier of compromising material that Russian operatives allegedly collected on Trump has been  debunked.    Comey’s statement released today needs to be carefully scrutinized as his testimony claims the president was concerned about the dossier,  said Cohen. Cohen, along with Flynn, has been subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a Russia probe. Legal Fallout? Some legal experts said Comey’s written statement could be used to show that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. “It shows the president was doing everything he could to shut down the Flynn investigation,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of criminal law at Savannah Law School.  Bruce Green, a professor of law at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult, however, to show that Trump intended to obstruct justice. Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn's character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function effectively as president, Green said. Democrats jumped on the testimony, expressing concern that Trump had inappropriately meddled with the probe.  It's certainly very possible that this is evidence, in combination with other actions by the president, that could amount to obstruction. It's certainly an effort to interfere in the investigation,  the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, told CNN. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about Trump's request for loyalty from Comey, said it was  very, very critical  that FBI directors remain  independent.  But Republican Senator Richard Burr, who heads the Senate intelligence panel, said he did not take issue with Trump's request.  I don't think it's wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody in an administration,  Burr said.

Khaled Ali, 45, has not formally announced if he will oppose the general-turned-president in 2018 but has indicated he intends to. He is waiting to find out if he will go to prison. The human rights and labor lawyer went on trial last week on public indecency charges that carry up to two years in prison. If convicted, even with a fine, he will be barred from running.  If we had fair elections, anyone could defeat Sisi,  Ali said in a Reuters interview. Worsening economic conditions, deteriorating security and a crackdown on political freedoms all mean Sisi is losing popularity, he said. Sisi came to power in 2014, a year after he led the military in ousting elected but unpopular Islamist President Mohamed Mursi. He is expected to run again in 2018. Ali says he's prepared to address the country's issues but thinks it is unlikely security forces will allow his potential candidacy a fair shot.

Ali gained prominence in January when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests. He sees the case as having swayed the opinion of many once stalwart Sisi supporters, who oppose ceding sovereign territory.

With 14 races remaining on the calendar it is far from do-or-die for Hamilton but the pressure is mounting on the Briton and Mercedes with arch rival Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari threatening to widen the gap at the top of the championship standings. Only Michael Schumacher (seven victories) has won the Canadian Grand Prix more times and Hamilton intends to close the gap further in Montreal as the race marks its 50th anniversary. Hamilton needs to do so, at the scene of his first ever Formula One victory a decade ago, to reel in Vettel after the German led a Ferrari one-two in Monaco and powered 25 points clear.  Montreal has been a great hunting ground for me in the past and I plan for it to continue,  the triple world champion told reporters. With five wins and five poles from previous visits to Quebec, Hamilton would normally be the favorite, but champions Mercedes are no longer the dominant team.  The Ferrari seems to work everywhere. The next 14 races are going to be very, very difficult,  he said after struggling to seventh place in Monaco.  They have had arguably the strongest car all year. They look like our car which just worked everywhere last year.  The race will also mark the return of twice world champion Fernando Alonso to the Formula One grid after the Spaniard skipped the Monaco Grand Prix last month to chase IndyCar glory at Indianapolis 500. Alonso turned in an impressive performance at the famed Brickyard, qualifying fifth fastest and running at the front but late in the race suffered a familiar fate with his Honda power unit giving up. Little has changed at struggling McLaren during Alonso's brief sabbatical with the team still hampered by an uncompetitive Honda engine. There is plenty of reason to party around the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve this week with the city celebrating its 375th anniversary, Canada its 150th birthday and the Canadian Grand Prix its 50th.  Williams driver Lance Stroll will be hoping to contribute to the party atmosphere. For the first time since the days of 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve, the Canadian Grand Prix will have some true home interest with teenager Stroll on the starting grid for Williams. While home fans would love nothing more than to celebrate a maiden win, the 18-year-old Stroll arrives with more modest goals and is still seeking his first championship point in what has been a challenging debut season.

Exxon has said that it will reconsider its opposition to the request, not that it would begin discussions or initiate new studies. The shareholder proposal, filed by 54 groups including financial, religious and corporate governance activists, won the support on Wednesday of 62 percent of Exxon holders.   I anticipate we'll be having a meeting this summer,  said Tracey Rembert, assistant director of Catholic Responsible Investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services, one of the 54 co-filers.  The White House's decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change has no bearing on the proposal.  We expect the scenario assessment will start to be done quickly at Exxon,  Rembert said. The investors behind the proposal routinely met in past years with Exxon between December and February to discuss annual meeting proposals, she said. Earlier discussions because of the majority vote are in order. Rembert said the group will ask for Exxon to conduct scenario planning exercises that would look at risks from disruptive technology, climate or government policies.  What are the black swan events that can take place beyond low oil prices, aggressive policies or shifting consumer preferences?  she said.  The reconsideration at Exxon comes as Devon Energy and Hess Corp owners on Wednesday will weigh climate-impact resolutions.  Ballot initiatives press for greater studies of the risk that government carbon-reduction efforts in the future make oil and gas reserves uneconomic to tap, leading to investment losses. Study proposals this year received at least 40 percent approval at Duke Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Southern Co, according to a tally by Ceres, a non-profit group that tracks environmental records of public companies.  When investors make a very strong statement at a company the size of Exxon Mobil, other competitors in their industry take notice and may reconsider or rethink their investor dialogue on these issues,  said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. The Exxon shareholder vote will have minor influence because most of the ballots likely were already cast, said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group seeking a carbon-risk study at Hess. Last year, its proposal was backed by about 23 percent of Hess holders.   Hess's vice president of investor relations, Jay Wilson, said the company talks regularly with large shareholders but declined to comment on any discussions since the Exxon vote. Devon didn't respond to requests for comment. Directors at both oil companies oppose the studies.

Suicide bombers and gunmen attacked the parliament building and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini in the Iranian capital. . Islamic State claimed responsibility and released a video purporting to show gunmen inside the parliament. Speaking in Berlin, Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said there was no evidence to implicate Saudi Arabia in the attacks in Tehran, which is Riyadh's arch regional rival.  We condemn terrorist attacks anywhere they occur and we condemn the killing of the innocent anywhere it occurs,  Jubeir told an event hosted by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, the think- tank of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. He said Riyadh had no knowledge of who was responsible for the attacks, and denied that Saudi groups were behind it.  We don’t know this. We haven’t seen the evidence,  he said, repeating Riyadh's longstanding view that Iran is the primary sponsor of terrorism around the world. Jubeir said Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries would be willing to reestablish normal ties with Iran if it changed its behaviour and stopped supporting militants and fighters in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere across the region. On Monday Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights, accusing Doha of funding militant groups and backing Iran in the region. Jubeir said on Wednesday there was no specific trigger for the decision to cut ties with Qatar, but said there was a long list of grievances. He declined to confirm a list of 10 demands published by Al Jazeera, which included shutting down the Doha-based news channel, but added that Qatar knew what it needed to do to restore normal relations.

The theoretical economic and market shocks 49 banks will face will not be published until next year, but the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a draft  methodology  on its 2018 health check for public consultation on Wednesday. The  stress test  will probably be the last conducted from the London base of the EBA, which must move to an EU state due to Britain's departure from the bloc. As in the 2016 test, there will be no pass or fail mark for each bank when the results are published in mid-2018. The test, based on end-2017 balance sheets, will look at shocks from bad loans, market turbulence, and the impact of fines for misconduct. Additionally, in January 2018 banks in Europe will have to comply with a new accounting rule, known as IFRS 9, which forces them to provision for souring loans much sooner than at present. The new book-keeping rule is expected to force banks to hold more capital, though regulators have decided to give lenders time to find this extra capital in practice. EBA, which has repeatedly warned that dealing with bad loans must be a top priority for banks, said banks will have to reflect the impact of the new rule at the start of the test and throughout its theoretical three-year duration. And lenders will not be able to factor in any uplift to capital from a sale due to happen during the test period.  Any divestments, capital measures or other transactions that were not completed before 31 December 2017, even if they were agreed upon before this date, should not be taken into account in the projections,  EBA said. The European Central Bank, which supervises 35 of the banks being tested, was forced to justify allowing Deutsche Bank to include proceeds from a sale of a stake in a Chinese lender in its 2016 stress test result. The sale did not actually go ahead during the test, even though it boosted Deutsche Bank's capital buffer in the result.

The newspaper said the regulator had provided EDF with elements of a preliminary report that indicate the equipment meets the safety conditions for the reactor to start normally. EDF's shares closed up 2.2 percent at 9.518 euros. The company declined to comment on the report. An ASN spokeswoman said the investigation was continuing and that the ASN had not taken a decision. She said a provisional ruling would be issued this summer, followed by a final decision in September. Non-approval would have meant billions of euros in extra costs for EDF and jeopardised its planned takeover of nuclear engineering group Areva's reactor business. ASN has been examining weak spots in the reactor's lid and base since the discovery in 2015 of an anomaly in carbon concentrations in the steel used. Excess carbon can make the steel brittle and more prone to fracturing when exposed to shocks or quick temperature changes. The ASN had warned these flaws could potentially be serious. A source familiar with the ASN's investigation said the probe would probably show that the weak spots did not represent a major risk of cracking or explosion as they are not in the areas that are under the heaviest stress.  I think the conclusion (of the ASN's report) will be positive, although it may also contain a demand for more intense surveillance,  the source said, adding that the ASN might require more tests during the reactor's routine major inspections each decade. Le Figaro said that the ASN might require additional controls in the reactor's first years of operation. Several sources familiar with the situation said the ASN had not yet finalised its technical report on the Flamanville reactor, which is due at the end of June. Once ready, the report will be reviewed by EDF, reactor maker Areva and a group of independent experts who will then issue a non-binding recommendation. Based on this, the ASN is expected to publish a provisional ruling, which will be available for public consultation for at least a month. Because of the summer break, that process is expected to last until September. The ASN is then likely to take a few more weeks to review the outcome of the consultation before it issues a final ruling in September or early October, experts say.

Hatch, whose panel oversees tax policy in the Senate, told a Washington tax policy forum he could also accept a tax reform plan that expands the federal deficit, despite opposition from deficit hawks. Trump and other Republicans have promised the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the Reagan era. But the White House says a detailed proposal is not expected until September, allowing little time in 2017 for Congress to act on such a major piece of legislation. The White House wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, while Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed 20 percent. But Hatch said he is not committed to any rate targets, because discussions have yet to focus on specific policy changes, including the elimination of tax breaks, needed to help pay for rate reductions.  Until we perform the surgery and start eliminating preferences and credits in order to bring down rates ... we cannot speak definitively on the rate targets,  the Utah Republican said.  All of that is going to take some time,  he added, a day after joining Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and Republican congressional leaders for a weekly tax reform meeting on Capitol Hill. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are trying to forge agreement on a tax reform package that can clear the House and Senate this year. The main challenge is the 100-member Senate, where Republicans cannot afford to lose more than two votes from their 52-seat majority. A top issue for debate is whether tax reform should avoid expanding the deficit by including policy changes that pay for tax cuts.  I don't see a problem with a tax reform proposal that loses revenue in the short term, if we can show that it will help put our economy on a better growth path,  Hatch said.  However, we do have some budget hawks in our conference who will have a difficult time supporting a package that adds to the deficit, and we'll have to take that into account, because once again we can't afford to lose too many votes.

Exxon has said that it will reconsider its opposition to the request, not that it would begin discussions or initiate new studies. The shareholder proposal, filed by 54 groups including financial, religious and corporate governance activists, won the support on Wednesday of 62 percent of Exxon holders.   I anticipate we'll be having a meeting this summer,  said Tracey Rembert, assistant director of Catholic Responsible Investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services, one of the 54 co-filers.  The White House's decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change has no bearing on the proposal.  We expect the scenario assessment will start to be done quickly at Exxon,  Rembert said. The investors behind the proposal routinely met in past years with Exxon between December and February to discuss annual meeting proposals, she said. Earlier discussions because of the majority vote are in order. Rembert said the group will ask for Exxon to conduct scenario planning exercises that would look at risks from disruptive technology, climate or government policies.  What are the black swan events that can take place beyond low oil prices, aggressive policies or shifting consumer preferences?  she said.  The reconsideration at Exxon comes as Devon Energy and Hess Corp owners on Wednesday will weigh climate-impact resolutions.  Ballot initiatives press for greater studies of the risk that government carbon-reduction efforts in the future make oil and gas reserves uneconomic to tap, leading to investment losses. Study proposals this year received at least 40 percent approval at Duke Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Southern Co, according to a tally by Ceres, a non-profit group that tracks environmental records of public companies.  When investors make a very strong statement at a company the size of Exxon Mobil, other competitors in their industry take notice and may reconsider or rethink their investor dialogue on these issues,  said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. The Exxon shareholder vote will have minor influence because most of the ballots likely were already cast, said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group seeking a carbon-risk study at Hess. Last year, its proposal was backed by about 23 percent of Hess holders.   Hess's vice president of investor relations, Jay Wilson, said the company talks regularly with large shareholders but declined to comment on any discussions since the Exxon vote. Devon didn't respond to requests for comment. Directors at both oil companies oppose the studies.

After police named two of the attackers and revealed that one was previously known to security agencies, Prime Minister Theresa May faced further questions about her record overseeing cuts to police numbers when she was interior minister. The latest opinion poll, by Survation for ITV, had the Conservatives' lead over Labour narrowing to just one point from six points in the same poll a week earlier.  However, the consensus among pollsters remains that May's party, who have been in government since 2010, will win a majority. In Britain's third Islamist attack in as many months, three men rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge on Saturday evening before running into the bustling Borough Market area, where they slit throats and stabbed people. The rampage followed a suicide bombing that killed 22 adults and children at a pop concert in Manchester two weeks ago, and an attack in March when five people died after a car was driven into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge. One of the London Bridge attackers was 27-year-old Khuram Butt, a British citizen born in Pakistan. He was known to police and the domestic spy agency MI5 but, with resources scarce, had not been deemed enough of a threat to warrant close monitoring, police said. Butt had appeared in a television documentary called  The Jihadis Next Door , broadcast last year by Britain's Channel 4, one of a group of men who unfurled an Islamic State flag in a park. All three attackers were shot dead at the scene by officers within eight minutes of police receiving the first emergency call. The Canadian Christine Archibald, a French national and a Briton were among the dead, while other French people, a Spaniard, Australians and a New Zealander were among the 48 who were injured in what May called  an attack on the free world . Related CoverageFactbox: UK opinion polls - countdown to Thursday's electionThe family of 32-year-old Briton James McMullan said they believed he, too, had lost his life. Minute's Silence A nationwide minute of silence was held at 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) to honor all the victims. Before the recent attacks, Brexit and domestic issues such as the state of the health service and the cost of care for the elderly had dominated the election campaign. When May called the election in April, her Conservatives led in opinion polls by 20 points or more. People near the scene of the recent attack observe a minute's silence in tribute to the victims of the attack at London Bridge and Borough Market, in central London, Britain June 6, 2017.Toby MelvilleBut an announcement - made before the Manchester and London Bridge attacks - that they planned to make some of the elderly pay more for their care saw that lead start to shrink, to between one and 12 points now. Security has become the number one issue and both main parties issued statements on Tuesday portraying their own positions on policing and intelligence as the most robust. During a round of media interviews, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson faced a barrage of questions about whether there had been security failures and about past police cuts. He sought to deflect the pressure onto Labour, accusing them of weakness. Asked about repeated criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan's response to the attack by U.S. President Donald Trump, Johnson said he did not think there was any reason to cancel Trump's planned state visit to Britain. As interior minister from 2010 to 2016, May oversaw a drop of 20,000 in the number of police officers in England and Wales, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said should never have happened and warranted her resignation. Slideshow (21 Images)The MI5 domestic intelligence service has seen its budget increased and has plans to expand its numbers to 5,000 officers from 4,000 over the next five years, MI5 chief Andrew Parker said last year. Corbyn himself has faced repeated questioning over his own past views and actions on security matters.  He has been criticized for voting against counter-terrorism legislation and expressing reservations about police responding to attacks with  shoot-to-kill  tactics. Since the attack, he has said he fully supported the actions of the police. Corbyn has also faced fierce criticism for past sympathies with the Palestinian group Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, a guerrilla group that waged a violent struggle to take Northern Ireland out of the UK.  Almost Euphoric  While the political debate raged, the investigation into Saturday's attack continued, with police searching an address in Ilford, east London, in the early hours of Tuesday. Police had arrested 12 people on Sunday in Barking, also in the east of the city, but said late on Monday all had been released without charge.  The second attacker who has been named was 30-year-old Rachid Redouane, who also went by the alias Rachid Elkhdar and claimed to be Moroccan or Libyan, police said. He and Butt both lived in Barking. One of Butt's neighbors, Ikenna Chigbo, told Reuters he had chatted with Butt - known locally as  Abz  - just hours before the attack on Saturday and said he appeared  almost euphoric .  He was very sociable, seemed like an ordinary family man. He would always bring his kid out into the lobby,  said Chigbo. Police said they had to prioritize resources on suspects who were believed to be preparing an attack or providing active support for one. Butt did not fall into that category when they last investigated him.

The lows were tested and seem to have held. A bit of short covering may be coming in as prices did not break to the downside,  said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed up 0.1 percent at $5,621 a tonne. The metal used in power and construction has fallen nearly 2 percent from a high of $5,720 on June 1. COPPER TECHNICALS: Fund investors were buying copper off the lows and technical resistance was around $5,675-$5,690, brokers Marex Specton said in a note.  We still espouse selling rallies,  it said. COPPER STOCKS: Prices supported by a fall in stockpiles at LME-registered warehouses by 5,350 tonnes to 294,225 tonnes, down from a recent high of 340,350 tonnes in mid-May. MCUSTX-TOTAL COPPER SPREAD: The discount of LME cash copper to the three-month contract CMCU0-3 rose to $30.75 a tonne from $14 two weeks ago, indicating tighter supply. CHILE OUTPUT: Heavy rains forced mines in northern Chile to suspend key operations. GERMAN FACTORIES: German industrial orders dropped far more than expected in April as factories lacked new contracts for big ticket items. {nL8N1J40QB] OIL: Crude prices slid more than 3 percent after an unexpected increase in U.S. inventories. Lower oil prices tend to pressure metals because they deter investors from buying into commodity basket funds and allow smelters to produce at lower prices. LME TIN: Three-month tin closed down 1.9 percent at $19,310, after earlier touching $19,260, a low since March 13. Data showing an increase in exports from Indonesia on Tuesday fuelled fears of ample supply and pushed the metal down 2.4 percent on the highest volumes in more than a year. Tin has declined for four days. LME ALUMINIUM: Aluminium closed up 0.2 percent at $1,906 a tonne, mostly shrugging off disruption in exports from a plant in Qatar part-owned by Norway's Norsk Hydro . ALUMINIUM TECHNICALS: The metal briefly fell below its 100-day moving average on Tuesday but has since held just above that level.  This has stopped the aggressive selling, so you have seen buyers come through,  a trader said. OTHER METALS: Nickel ended down 0.6 percent at $8,810 a tonne. Zinc finished 0.6 percent lower at $2,447 and lead closed down 0.5 percent at $2,063.

Adam Glapinski told a news conference that the central bank was not concerned about the zloty's recent strong gains after its rate-setting panel kept the key rate at 1.50 percent for the 27th consecutive month.  There is no need to send signals to markets that the horizon of interest rates hikes is nearing. Personally I would be surprised if we raised rates in 2018,  he said. Analysts polled by Reuters have postponed over the last two months the expected beginning of monetary tightening in Poland, partly due to Glapinski's persistently dovish rhetoric and a stabilisation in inflation. In April, analysts expected the next hike to take place in the first quarter of 2018, but now see it coming in the third quarter of next year. The central bank said on Wednesday that it expects inflation to remain moderate in the coming quarters.  The risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited,  the bank said. Polish consumer prices ended more than two years of declines in November last year, and annual inflation hit 2.2 percent in February. Inflation then stabilised at 2 percent in March, April and slowed to 1.9 percent in May. The central bank's last interest rate move was a half-percentage-point cut in March 2015. Speaking about the zloty, Glapinski said the bank was not concerned about its recent strengthening, adding the gains translated into tighter monetary conditions.  We are carefully watching,  Glapinski said.  One can see that the zloty has strongly appreciated recently ...., but this does not raise any particular concern on our side.  The Polish currency has gained about 7 percent versus the euro since early December.

We start our show with a protest dedicated to the 'evaporation' of our colleague - an Azeri journalist - from the center of Tbilisi and his 'reappearance' in a Baku prison,  Georgie Gabunia, host of the political talk show  Archevani  (Choice) on popular opposition channel Rustavi-2, told viewers.  How was such a 'teleportation' possible without any kind of registration at the border?  The on-air protest prompted Georgia's deputy interior minister, Shalva Khutsishvili, to walk out of an interview he was giving by video link.  Looks like you are leading this (interview) in a wrong direction. I am leaving,  he said. One of Mukhtarli's lawyers told Reuters the journalist's arrest was politically motivated - a method of punishing him for publishing articles critical of the Azeri government. Lawyers for the journalist alleged that he had been subject to violence during his abduction and that his captors stuffed 10,000 euros ($11,250) into his pockets before he was taken across the border. Azeri authorities accuse Mukhtarli of smuggling, illegal border crossing and violence against police authority.

In the 6.00 a.m. call, he denied Qatar's emir made comments reported by the state-run news agency criticising hostility to Iran, sympathising with three Islamist groups, accusing Saudi Arabia of adopting an extremist ideology that fosters terrorism and suggesting Donald Trump may not last long as U.S. president. The adviser repeated a statement released hours earlier which said the news agency had been hacked, seeming unaware that Reuters had already reported the denial. The unusual timing of the call and the adviser's haste to get the message across pointed to Qatar's deep concern about the impact the remarks attributed to the emir could have. As anger mounted in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar's foreign minister tried to limit the fallout. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference that Qatar, host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East, wanted to maintain brotherly ties with its powerful neighbours in a region critical to world energy supplies. To outside observers, it was unclear whether the Qatar News Agency had indeed been hacked or whether an editor had published remarks which the emir later regretted saying. But to Qatar's neighbours the question was irrelevant: the comments reflected the broad lines of Qatar's independent-minded foreign policy, which critics say has destabilised the region through its alliance with Islamist armed groups and cordial ties with Iran. Officials in the Gulf say the comments marked a turning point, prompting Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to cut relations with Qatar in the biggest diplomatic shock in the region for years. Trouble Evident For Riyadh, trouble was also evident elsewhere. Some Qatari-funded anti-Saudi websites had begun reporting on what they said were calls for protests against the kingdom's rulers, stirring memories of the Arab Spring revolutions that toppled the leaders of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.  They (Qataris) hired (financed) influential Saudi preachers, religious figures, journalists and academics to incite against Saudi Arabia,  one Gulf source told Reuters.  The Saudis had had it with Qatar. The Qataris keep channels open with Iran in various capitals and they campaign against the Egyptian state.  The Saudis had reached a  dead end  with Qatar and decided for the first time in 20 years to take action to damage its neighbour's interests, the source added. Qatar denies inciting unrest in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. Another factor that pushed the four Sunni states over the line, according to Gulf officials, was last month's visit to Saudi Arabia by Trump, who has reversed the policies of predecessor Barack Obama, thrown his weight behind the kingdom and its allies and expressed misgivings about Iran. No sooner had Trump left Riyadh than the United States' partners in the region moved against Qatar and its young emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, another American ally. A series of flashpoints across the region in the days following Trump's visit heightened tensions that had been building for months and removed any hope among Qatar's neighbours of peeling it away from Iran and the Islamist groups it has engaged with for years. Those tensions spilled into the public arena less than 48 hours after the Qatari emir took part in the Riyadh summit attended by Trump which was meant to showcase U.S. support for solidarity of Sunni Muslim nations. The alleged hacking incident came days after Qatar complained it was the target of  an orchestrated barrage  of criticism by unknown parties, in the run-up to Trump's visit.  After the Tamim speech, things went up an extra notch,  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The catalogue is so wide... It is an accumulation,  Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs told Reuters.  It could have happened in March, it could have happened in December. But it was bound to happen. It was something that was ready to explode.  Gargash confirmed there were several major irritants that sped up the process. These included the comments attributed to the emir, UAE accusations that Qatar has undermined the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and Qatar's handling of a hostage crisis involving 24 members of the ruling elite in which it paid ransom money to  Islamist groups in Iraq an Syria. An annual phone call to mark the start of the holy Islamic month of Ramadan between Tamim and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on May 27 aggravated the situation further. Iran's Shi'ite-led government and Saudi Arabia's Sunni rulers compete for influence in the region and Jean-Marc Rickli, a Geneva-based risk analyst, called that a  diplomatic mistake (which) Saudi Arabia and the UAE jumped on . Kuwait's emir offered to mediate but when Tamim attended an iftar (fast-breaking) Ramadan meal with him on May 30, Tamim left early, apparently unwilling to discuss the row, a Kuwaiti newspaper editor regularly briefed by officials told Reuters. Rolling Meetings The decision to cut ties with Qatar took shape in a rolling series of meetings over several weeks, said a Gulf Arab source. But a second source said an important moment came last Saturday when Saudi King Salman and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, met for iftar in Jeddah. It is likely that Egypt came on board two days later, during a visit to Cairo by the Saudi foreign minister. At dawn on Monday, those governments and Bahrain made a series of rapid fire announcements, revealing the move's careful orchestration and pre-planning. A Western diplomat in Doha said the move was  clearly tied  to Trump's visit, suggesting it had emboldened Saudi Arabia and the UAE to act.  The opportunity presented itself with the Trump visit and Trump's presidency in general,  a former U.S. ambassador to Doha told Reuters, suggesting the move had been in the works for two or three months.  This is well choreographed. Everything came together at the same time.  U.S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia’s decision to sever ties with Qatar, current and former U.S. officials told Reuters. A senior administration official said Washington had no indication at the Riyadh summit that the move was about to happen but on Tuesday morning Trump directly waded into the dispute by praising the Arab powers’ decisions against Qatar. The Pentagon, mindful of the U.S. military base in Qatar, renewed its praise for Doha after Trump’s intervention -- showing again how U.S. officials are walking a tightrope as Trump’s tweets raise questions about existing policy and the scripted talking points used to explain it. Reports that Qatari officials paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Iran-backed groups in an April deal to free 26 of its citizens kidnapped in Iraq last year has also been an irritant in relations between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar denies trying to pay ransom money to secure the release of the hostages, although foreign minister al-Thani said it sent money  to support the authorities in the release of Qatari abductees .

Prosecutors accused Lucy Richards, 57, of saying she would kill a parent of a Sandy Hook Elementary School victim, telling the parent,  you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon.  Richards, of the Tampa area, pleaded guilty in Fort Lauderdale to one count of transmitting threats via interstate commerce in January 2016, according to a statement from the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The parent, who was not named, lives in South Florida, the statement said.  Richards’ belief that the school shooting was a hoax and never happened motivated her to make the threats,  prosecutors said. Her prison time will be followed by five months of home confinement and three years of supervision, prosecutors said.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.  REUTERS TOP 75 The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.  MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 75   Compare Institutions | Methodology Powering Innovation in Asia – 2017 KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.  Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST's Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense's DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.  The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.  South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.  Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016.Kim Hong-JiOverall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)  Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.  And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.  Slideshow (3 Images)To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution's ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.  This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).  The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.  Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world's most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it's important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it's still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The threat marks an escalation of tensions between the United States and the Syrian government and its backers over control of Syria's southeastern frontier with Iraq, where Washington has been training Syrian rebels at a base inside Syrian territory as part of its campaign against Islamic State. The area is seen as crucial to Assad's Iranian allies and could open an overland supply route from Tehran to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon - the  Shi'ite crescent  of Iranian influence that is a major concern to U.S.-allies in the region. Tensions have been growing in southeastern Syria over the last several weeks. The United States launched air strikes on Tuesday against what it said were pro-government forces who it said posed a threat to U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in the area, the second such air strike in three weeks.     The statement from the pro-Assad alliance was issued in the name of the  commander of the operations room of the forces allied to Syria , and was circulated by a military news unit run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah, one of Assad's military allies. The statement did not spell out whether Russia, Assad's most powerful ally, was a signatory. Speaking in Baghdad, a U.S. envoy said the United States was counting on regular contacts with Moscow to help avoid a conflict with pro-Damascus forces in the southeastern region known as the Badia. Separate remarks by Syria's foreign ministry, carried by state TV, warned of the  dangers of escalation  and demanded the U.S. coalition stop strikes on Syrian soil. Related CoverageSyria warns U.S. coalition over 'escalation', tells it to stop strikes - state TVHezbollah says footage shows Iranian drone tracking U.S. drone over SyriaThe statement from the  allies of Syria  said attacks on U.S. forces could be carried out with  different missile and military systems, in the light of the deployment of American forces in the region .      America knows well that the blood of the sons of Syria, the Syrian Arab Army, and its allies is not cheap, and the capacity to strike their positions in Syria, and their surroundings, is available when circumstances will it,  the statement said. It added that the silence of  the allies of Syria  thus far was  an exercise in self-restraint  to allow for  other solutions .  This will not last if America goes further, and crosses the red lines,  it said. In an apparent message to show the capabilities of Damascus backer Iran, Hezbollah aired what it said was footage taken undetected by an Iranian drone of a U.S. drone flying over southeastern Syria. 'Hostile Forces' The U.S. military, which has sought to stay out of Syria's civil war and focus its firepower on Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, has repeatedly warned pro-Assad forces to stay away from a so-called  de-confliction  zone around their garrison near the southern Syrian town of al-Tanf. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the international coalition against Islamic State, said the air strike on Tuesday was meant to defend American forces.  We really do depend upon the Russians through our de-confliction military channels ... to help work these things out, and so we hope obviously that will not happen again,  he said. The U.S.-led coalition said that ahead of Tuesday's air strike there had been communications with Russia over allowing pro-government forces into the de-confliction zone to evacuate personnel wounded in an attack by an insurgent group. In comments to Reuters, the coalition said it had agreed to the request and four unarmed trucks were observed evacuating the wounded personnel from the area, where Islamic State has previously mounted attacks.  Later, at a separate location in the de-confliction zone, the coalition observed a large Syrian pro-regime force enter the de-confliction zone,  the coalition added.  These forces were clearly hostile and comprised a tank, artillery, anti-aircraft weapons, armed technical vehicles and more than 60 soldiers, which were posing a threat to coalition and partner forces based at the al-Tanf garrison,  it said.   The coalition issued several warnings prior to conducting the strike on two artillery pieces, an anti-aircraft weapon and a tank.  Tensions in southern Syria have flared as the intensity of the Syrian war has died down in areas of western Syria covered by an agreement brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran to ease the fighting.

So many people just assume that men are better investors. And they would be wrong. According to new data from financial services giant Fidelity Investments, women are actually superior investors. In sifting through more than 8 million investment accounts, Fidelity discovered that women not only save more than men, 0.4 percent, their investments earn more annually, also 0.4 percent.  It is a double whammy,  says Alexandra Taussig, Fidelity's senior vice president for women investors.  The myth that men are better investors is just that - a myth.  Those differences may seem slight at first. But extrapolated over a lifetime of saving and investing, the disparity at retirement age is anything but minor. For a 22-year-old starting out with a salary of $50,000 a year, a woman investor will outpace her male counterpart by more than $250,000. Even more revealing about general attitudes is Fidelity's companion  Women and Money  survey, which asked participants which gender was better at investing its money. The outcome: Barely 9 percent of people said women. What is it, exactly, that makes women better investors? One factor, Fidelity said, is that men are 35 percent more likely to make trades, which means that trading fees eat away at their portfolios more than they do women's. Women also save more in the first place - almost a full percentage point annually - in workplace 401(k)s and individual vehicles such as IRAs and brokerage accounts, Fidelity found. Another advantage: Women assume less risk, such as not loading up entirely on equities. They also invest more in vehicles like target-date funds, whose automatic allocations make for smarter diversification, Fidelity said. The resulting gender outperformance gibes with a study by academics Terrance Odean (University of California, Berkeley) and Brad Barber (University of California, Davis), who also found that women outperform men, by roughly 1 percent a year. If you want to invest like a wonder woman, that means shifting to a long-term focus, saving more up front and giving up on trying to time the market with brilliant trades.  Men regard their stock picks as a sport that comes with bragging rights, and that is what gets them into trouble,  said George Gagliardi, a financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Hatch, whose panel oversees tax policy in the Senate, told a Washington tax policy forum he could also accept a tax reform plan that expands the federal deficit, despite opposition from deficit hawks. Trump and other Republicans have promised the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the Reagan era. But the White House says a detailed proposal is not expected until September, allowing little time in 2017 for Congress to act on such a major piece of legislation. The White House wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, while Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed 20 percent. But Hatch said he is not committed to any rate targets, because discussions have yet to focus on specific policy changes, including the elimination of tax breaks, needed to help pay for rate reductions.  Until we perform the surgery and start eliminating preferences and credits in order to bring down rates ... we cannot speak definitively on the rate targets,  the Utah Republican said.  All of that is going to take some time,  he added, a day after joining Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and Republican congressional leaders for a weekly tax reform meeting on Capitol Hill.  The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are trying to forge agreement on a tax reform package that can clear the House and Senate this year. The main challenge is the 100-member Senate, where Republicans cannot afford to lose more than two votes from their 52-seat majority. A top issue for debate is whether tax reform should avoid expanding the deficit by including policy changes that pay for tax cuts.  I don't see a problem with a tax reform proposal that loses revenue in the short term, if we can show that it will help put our economy on a better growth path,  Hatch said.     However, we do have some budget hawks in our conference who will have a difficult time supporting a package that adds to the deficit, and we'll have to take that into account, because once again we can't afford to lose too many votes.

But rather than getting a shocked response, Wang simply shrugged his shoulders, Li told Reuters.  He told me he looks after garbage collection, water pipes, that sort of thing. Same-sex marriage isn't up to him,  said Li, who works for the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.   That's the problem in China. Who is in charge of this stuff?  After decades of Communist prudery about sex of all kinds, during recent years of economic reform and growth, gay Chinese have sprung forward to reclaim the country's long history of relative tolerance toward homosexuality. With no clear, bureaucratic way forward to legalize same-sex marriage, unlike in Taiwan which approved the step last month, and deeply conservative attitudes among the older generation toward sex, gay Chinese are pushing against old social norms and legal uncertainty to assert their rights.  Until 2001, China listed homosexuality as a mental disorder, but it is not illegal to be gay.  Many big cities have thriving gay scenes, although gay men and women still face family pressure to marry and have children, fulfilling the Confucian tradition of honoring ancestors by ensuring the family line. While Taiwan's decision paving the way for same-sex couples to marry was largely ignored by the mainstream Chinese media, it got big play on social media, with many supportive comments. Next week, China's cosmopolitan business capital Shanghai will host its ninth gay pride event, four days of films, talks and parties, though without a parade that accompanies such events in other cities around the world. Evie Wu, Shanghai Pride's director, told Reuters that about 6,000 people were expected to attend. For the 10th anniversary next year, organizers hope to hold Pride events in other cities, including Beijing.  People have told us that attending Pride has led to them accepting themselves, that they have a community and that they are not alone. That's inspired us to continue,  Wu said. 'Family First' It is hard to gauge the degree of popular acceptance of homosexuality in the world's most populous nation. Sexologist Li, who has backed parliamentary proposals to legalize gay marriage that went nowhere, said a survey she had conducted in 2007 showed many people simply had no view about homosexuality.  Since ancient times there's been no particular feeling that homosexuality is wrong, unlike in Christianity or what the Bible says,  she said. But Chinese society had always placed huge importance on the family line, and that is what has driven opposition to homosexuality, Li said.  It's always family first, happiness second.  Li's old friend Wang is now in the Communist Party's elite ruling inner core, and heads the powerful anti-corruption watchdog, which did not respond to requests for comment about her conversation with him when he was Beijing's mayor. While the government often turns a blind eye to gay events, the Communist Party has intensified a crackdown on civil society since President Xi Jinping took office four years ago. Last month, police in the city of Xian briefly detained nine gay activists, saying the city did not welcome gay people, after they tried to organize a conference. Unbowed, the same group is organizing an event in Chengdu this month, encouraged by support on social media. One of the organizers, who asked to be identified only as Matthew, said he was nervous the Chengdu event could draw official attention.  I've held events in Chengdu before, and I've never had any official notification I either can or cannot do this,  he told Reuters.  Even with the Xian event, before it all went down we didn't get any sort of message.  Still, on the weekend before Taiwan's marriage decision, gay activists held a packed fund-raising event at a Beijing bar complete with lip-synching drag queens that went off without a hitch. The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which technically has oversight over civil issues like marriage, declined to comment on questions from Reuters about the possibility of same-sex marriage or whether there was an institutionalized problem with homophobia in China. Activists say the government vacillates on its attitudes toward homosexuality, pointing out that gay clubs and bars are often left alone while gay dramas are banned on television. Overtly hostile opinions do surface publicly from time to time. Zeng Weizhu, a philosopher at China's Shanxi Agricultural University, wrote an open letter to the people of Taiwan last month on the Confucian Net website denouncing the marriage decision as a  disaster  perpetrated by youth  ignorant of worldly affairs .  Parents of Taiwan, come to the mainland! Your children and grandchildren will multiply, your life will be extended and your latter years won't be lonely,  Zeng wrote. The comments section underneath his letter largely scorned his view as absurd and offensive.  Dying of laughter. Support gays and oppose discrimination,  wrote one person, using the handle  When Love Comes To Call . Zeng declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

A sharp drop in energy shares and weakness among big international companies, whose profits benefit from a weak local currency, drove the FTSE 100 down 0.6 percent, as sterling hit a two week high. Polls have suggested that support for Prime Minister Theresa May's party was slipping, raising the possibility of a smaller majority or a hung parliament. But investors still saw a Conservative majority as the most likely outcome and although volatility has ticked up over the past week, it remains near historic lows and far from its levels in the run-up to the Brexit vote in June last year. Mid-caps outperformed blue-chip stocks, up 0.2 percent after three sessions in the red. The more domestically-exposed stocks have been under more pressure of late due to the perception of heightened British political risk.  I think mid-caps will do better on the back of a Conservative win,  said Colin McLean, manager of the UK growth fund at SVM Asset Management, adding they may suffer from a win by Labour whose policies could increase labour costs.  The bigger picture is that international stocks have been doing less well ... quite a lot of what drove markets last year has gone into reverse over the last six months and investors are looking again at some of the beneficiaries of lower growth and deflation,  he added.  That probably drives investors a little bit more than the election.  The energy sector took most points off the FTSE as oil prices fell sharply following data showing that U.S. stocks of crude oil and gasoline surprisingly rose last week. Shares in WPP were a top FTSE faller, down 2.6 percent, after the world's largest advertising group released a poor trading update. Financials stocks were the biggest boost to the index, helped higher by relief after the rescue of Spain's Banco Popular by Banco Santander. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds both rose more than 1 percent. Astrazeneca fell 1 percent, after selling the rights for its migraine drug Zomig to Grunenthal for up to $302 million. Shire also dropped 3 percent. House prices in May came in 3.3 percent higher than a year ago, slightly ahead of the forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, giving a boost to housebuilders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. Money managers were treading carefully ahead of the next big potential macro shock, mindful of the unexpected outcomes of the Brexit vote and U.S. election.  This is a dangerous game to play - as polls and bookmakers alike can often be wrong. Even with the result known, market direction is difficult to predict,  said Asbjorn Trolle Hansen, manager of the Nordea GBP diversified return fund. Packaging group RPC's profits more than doubled, yet it fell 7.2 percent, as some brokers raised concerns over its acquisition-heavy strategy.  The group has tried to address these concerns with increased disclosure in these results but has clearly failed to satisfy the market,  said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

The gap between Italy's 10-year bond yields and similarly rated Spain's widened as investors focused on Italy's lack of progress in stabilising its troubled banks, the political risk for Rome of snap elections and the possible winding down of monetary stimulus by the European Central Bank. The European Commission on Wednesday approved a sale of Spain's Banco Popular to keep it from falling into insolvency[. But in Italy, state aid is the only option being considered for two ailing Veneto-based banks .  In Spain, the banking issues are viewed as localised, whereas in Italy they still have to resolve the problem,  said David Owen, chief European financial economist at Jefferies.  And then if you get early Italian elections and ECB tapering, you can see a scenario where spreads widen out even further.  The Italian 10-year yield spread over Germany, the benchmark for the region, widened to 203 basis points, the biggest gap since April 21. The Italy-Spain bond yield spread, at 74 bps, was just 1 basis point off its March peak, when the gap was at its widest since the euro zone debt crisis in February 2012. The southern European neighbours are often compared in the bond market and the difference in their government bond yields used as a measure of risk in the bloc. With Italy's debt agency holding a sale of 30-year bonds, benchmark 10-year debt yields rose 4 basis points on the day - underperforming euro zone peers.  The Italian long-end spreads are being hit by the 30-year deal, but overall it's more the focus on politics that is making the bonds weaker,  said ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder. Italy's Constitutional Affairs Committee on Monday signed off on a new electoral law after the main parties reached an agreement that may lead to a national election this autumn . In addition, the ECB meets on Thursday and is widely expected to rule out the introduction of further stimulus . Italy is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's current ultra-loose policy. Most other euro zone bond yields were a touch higher, having briefly dipped after Bloomberg reported the ECB was preparing to cut its inflation forecasts at this week's policy meeting . German Bund yields dipped to a six-week low of 0.25 percent but was trading flat in late trade.

In taking a game-based and playful approach to learning, we created an intervention that was not only effective, but also one in which the children were engaged and wanted (to) continue doing,  he said in a statement.  The researchers worked with 147 Syrian refugee children living in the southern Turkish town of Urfa, on the border with Syria, where language barriers stop most children from going to school and half of them suffer mental health problems. The children took part in daily, two-hour sessions over four weeks and researchers measured their satisfaction with various games, as well as the games' educational and psychological impact.     While Minecraft, in which players roam a virtual world with very few limitations, helped children feel more positive, other games improved their Turkish language skills and taught them the basics of coding. The research, published on Tuesday, was funded by the Turkey-based Bahcesehir Ugur Education Foundation.

The senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by its subsidiary Tereos Finance Groupe 1 were also affirmed at 'BB'. The rating affirmation reflects Tereos's strong business profile, which remains offset by a volatile financial profile. We expect the company's credit metrics to improve in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (FY17), particularly leverage and funds from operations (FFO) fixed-charge cover, after three years of weakening as sugar prices dropped. However, the new EU sugar regime from September 2017, combined with the inherent volatility of sugar prices, makes the sustainability of this improvement trend uncertain at this stage. The company enjoys a strong market position, supported by well-invested assets, access to the produce of member-farmers operating in some of the higher-yielding sugar beet regions in Europe and growing diversification of geography and raw materials. The cooperative ownership profile of Tereos also contributes to its conservative financial policies as reflected in the rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Business Profile: The IDR is underpinned by Tereos's strong business profile for the 'BB' category, both in operational scope and position in commodity markets with potential for long-term growth. Geographic and product diversification, with an important portion of sales and profits being generated outside the company's historic French sugar beet operations, as well as efforts to increase operating efficiency, also support Tereos's business risk profile. Profit Rebound: Tereos strongly boosted revenue and profit in the nine months ending December 2016 (9M17) thanks to a combination of sugar and ethanol price recovery and benefits from cost efficiency programmes. We expect FY17 results to confirm the trend, and profits to further grow in FY18 albeit more moderately. Any drop in European sugar prices is likely to be more-than-compensated from higher sugar beet volumes and greater efficiency. We also expect the starch and sweeteners business to contribute more to profit, due to an improved product mix, larger capacity and better efficiency. We therefore consider the FY16 results as the company's lowest EBITDA point in the current cycle. Exposure to European Sugar Price Adjustment: European prices recovered in FY17 due to lower production, which led to a rapid drop in stock-to-use ratios. However, they are likely to decrease again as they converge with lower international prices, along with the removal of the quota regime in September 2017. Similar to other European sugar processors, Tereos's European sugar beet business suffered a sharp contraction in profitability in the last few years. Its EBITDA dropped in FY16 to EUR146 million (less than a third of its FY13 level), following a steep decline in EU quota sugar prices largely linked to the intervention of the European Commission in 2013. Higher European Sugar Volume Upside: We expect the group to benefit from a post-2017 deregulated European sweeteners market due to strong market share and competitiveness. The EU sugar reform will lift constraints on production and exports from Europe. Tereos has contracted with member-farmers in France to increase production of sugar beet so that increased volumes can more than compensate for lower selling prices. We therefore project that EBITDA from Tereos's European sugar beet operations will keep growing in FY18. Improvement of Credit Metrics: We project RMI-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) gross leverage should return below 4.5x in FY17 after having peaked at 6.1x in FY16. Similarly, we expect RMI-adjusted FFO fixed-charge cover to have reached its low point (3.0x) in FY16 and to recover to around 3.5x from FY17. Such improvement in financial metrics should be supported by higher FFO and RMI value. These levels are comfortable for the ratings. We expect free cash flow to remain mildly negative over FY17-FY18 due to working capital absorption in FY17 and FY18. In addition, we project capex to remain high at an average EUR400 million annually. Adequate Financial Flexibility: Tereos's weak credit metrics are partially mitigated by adequate financial flexibility. The latter is supported by strict financial discipline in shareholder distributions and M&A; spending, adequate liquidity management and healthy RMI-adjusted FFO fixed-charge cover throughout the commodity down-cycle. In the low sugar price environment, cooperative owners have shown their support to Tereos by accepting a sharp reduction in  price complements , which we consider akin to dividend distributions. While there has been a modest increase in distributions in FY17, we assume these will remain low so long as the profitability of Tereos's European sugar business remains low. Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: Tereos France's (TF) and Tereos's influential control as well as their legal and strategic ties with TI are very strong. These compensate for limited, albeit growing, operational, financial integration and ownership - and make parent and its subsidiary intrinsically linked. We also expect a degree of convergence in the financial profiles of both TI and its French holding. Average Recovery Prospects: Due to the strong linkages between TSF, Tereos and TI, the rating on the senior unsecured notes is derived from the consolidated group's IDR of 'BB'. The senior unsecured notes are rated at the same level as the group's IDR. Usually, for issuers rated in the 'BB' category, prior-ranking debt constituting 2x-2.5x EBITDA indicates a high likelihood of subordination and lower recoveries for unsecured debt. We believe that the level of senior secured (or other form of prior-ranking) debt leverage at TSF is unlikely to rise higher than 2.0x over the next three years as we expect a recovery in EBITDA from the sugar beet business. Furthermore, we believe TSF (or Tereos) is unlikely to increase its debt to support other group entities. Revolving Credit: In addition, existing committed debt ranking ahead of the senior unsecured notes relates to TSF's EUR450 million revolving credit facility (RCF), which exclusively funds working capital needs throughout the year. Based on the company's historical intra-year working capital needs, average intra-year outstanding RCF amounts are unlikely to rise beyond 2.0x TSF's EBITDA. DERIVATION SUMMARY Tereos's IDR of 'BB' is positioned in between the credit quality of larger and significantly more diversified commodity trader and processor Bunge Limited (BBB/Stable) and the 'B' category rated Kernel Holding S.A. (B+/Stable) and Biosev S.A. (B+/Negative), whose ratings discount a heavy concentration on one country where they originate the commodities they process and sell. Tereos enjoys a moderate degree of geographic diversification with material sourced mainly in western Europe and Brazil but also in The Indian Ocean and Asia as well as combining production of beet sugar, cane sugar, sweeteners, ethanol and starches. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to grow in FY17 at a pace (low teens) aligned with 9M17 performance; further strong growth (mid-to-high single digit) in FY18, resulting from higher volumes more than compensating the lower prices that will result from the EU sugar reform from the second half of FY18 and adverse FX effects in Brazil; broadly stable revenues from FY19; - Consolidated EBITDA margin recovering to around 12.5% in FY17 (10% in FY16; 14.8% in FY14) and 13% in FY18 as a result of better prices, product mix and/or benefits from efficiency programme; constant at 13.0% over FY18-FY20; - Working capital absorption over FY17 and FY18 as a result of price (FY17) and volume growth (FY18); - Capex remains around EUR400 million annually on average until FY19 as company continues to invest in higher efficiency and increases capacity; - Buyout of Petrobras's stake in Guarani and of Tereos Internacional minorities for close to EUR210 million in FY17; EUR40 million per annum bolt-on M&A; thereafter RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Strengthening of profitability (excluding price fluctuations), as measured by RMI-adjusted EBITDAR/gross profit, reflecting reasonable capacity utilisation rates in the sugar beet business and overall increased efficiency. -At least neutral FCF while maintaining strict financial discipline. -FFO gross leverage (RMI-adjusted) consistently below 3.5x at Tereos group level. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Inability to sustainably maintain cost savings derived from efficiency programmes or excessive idle capacity in different market segments, leading to RMI-adjusted EBITDAR/gross profit remaining weak. -Inability to return consolidated FFO to approximately USD500 million (FY16: USD300 million and to improve profitability and cash flow generation. -Reduced financial flexibility as reflected in FFO fixed-charge cover (RMI-adjusted) falling below 3.0x. - FFO gross leverage (RMI-adjusted) above 4.5x at Tereos group level on a sustained level. LIQUIDITY Adequate liquidity: Tereos's internal liquidity score, defined as unrestricted cash plus RMI plus accounts receivables divided by total current liabilities, improved to 1.1x in FY16 from 0.7x in FY14 as management successfully lengthened the group's average debt maturity profile. This is consistent with levels for a 'BB' rating. Liquidity is further supported by comfortable access to diversified sources of external funding, demonstrated by the successful issue of seven-year bonds in June and October 2016 and the full refinancing of its sweeteners business in Europe in December 2016 with a EUR200 million revolving credit facility.

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Leases: Fitch adjusted the debt by adding a multiple of 6x of yearly operating lease expense related to long-term assets (EUR38 million for FY16). The multiple of 6x reflects operating lease expenses related to the group's Brazilian operations. - Readily marketable inventories (RMI): Fitch calculates Tereos's financial ratios by excluding the debt and the interest costs used to finance those RMIs for which the agency has reasonable assurance from management that they are protected against price risk. In FY16 Fitch judged EUR334 million of Tereos's inventories as readily marketable, based on EUR595 million of inventories of finished products. Therefore Fitch adjusted the group's debt and gross cash interest down by EUR334 million and EUR29 million, respectively. - Factoring: Fitch views the group's factoring programme as an alternative to secured debt, and therefore adjusts Tereos's FY16 total debt by the amount of receivables sold and derecognised at end-FY16 (EUR128 million). Fitch has also decreased the group's working capital inflow (included in Fitch's FCF calculation) by the year-on-year increase in outstanding factoring funding at closing, i.e. EUR31.5 million. Cash flow from financing (excluded from Fitch's FCF calculation) has been increased by the same amount. Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com.

Central European assets were generally rangebound ahead of key global events on Thursday.      The big events will be the British elections, the testimony of (former FBI Director James) Comey (about last year's U.S. elections), and the ECB's meeting,  one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.     The Polish bank kept its main interest rate unchanged at a record low 1.5 percent, as expected.     Analysts in a Reuters poll put the likely date of a rate hike in the third quarter of 2018, after projecting the second quarter a month ago.     But the bank's governor Adam Glapinski reiterated that he personally expected that rates would not be raised until the end of 2018. He also said the bank was not concerned about the zloty's recent gains.     The zloty, after an initial rebound from two-week lows set on Tuesday, eased 0.1 percent against the euro, hovering at the 4.2 psychological line.     It is still near the nine-month high of 4.1619 it hit last month. Glapinski said consumer confidence was the highest in Poland for 30 years, while inflation had stabilised and might even fall slightly.     Elsewhere in the region, the forint eased 0.1 percent, after disappointing Hungarian and Czech industrial output figures.      Output fell in April by 3 percent in annual terms in Hungary, although analysts had predicted a rise. A 2.5 percent Czech decline was more than forecast.        Analysts said the output fall was at least partly caused by fewer working days due to the Easter holidays.     The leu eased 0.1 percent to 4.5735, trading near last month's four-year highs.     Romania kept its first-quarter GDP growth estimate unchanged at a robust 5.7 percent. Finance Minister Viorel Stefan said on Tuesday Romania would scale back public sector wage hikes next year to ensure it meets budget targets.     Markets remain cautious as the government still plans wage hikes and tax cuts that may boost the the budget deficit.

The 11 major banks covered in the review account for 85% of domestic banking assets.  Our outlook for the sector in 2017 is negative, as banks grapple with macro risks and government intervention to reduce loan rates  says Mahin Dissanayake, Country Director for Kenyan banks. Kenya is rated 'B+' with a Negative Outlook and the banks' operating environment is sensitive to slowing public spending, adverse weather conditions, rising inflation, political risk and external factors.   We see no easing of these risks for the banks in the near term.  To make matters worse, In September 2016, Kenya introduced a cap on lending rates at 400bps above the prevailing central bank rate (CBR - currently at 10%). It also set a floor on deposit rates at 70% of the CBR.  The aim was to bring down the cost of credit for the private sector and increase financial inclusion. However, this move has been hugely negative for the banking sector which by 1Q17 saw a significant hit on profitability. The cap on lending rates also led to a further slowdown in credit as banks have been reluctant to lend and have tightened underwriting standards due to their inability to price risk.  While the large banks and some medium size banks are less affected, we believe the small banks struggle due to their niche, high risk/high return business models being challenged. In our view this raises systemic risk at a time when the sector has come under increased scrutiny following three banks being put in receivership by the central bank. Sector asset quality, has been weakening since 2015 due to the banks' sensitivity to concentration risk by both industry and borrower, with the average sector NPL ratio reaching 10% at end-2016 (up from 6.3% at end-2015). We expect the reduction in bank supply of credit, particularly to SMEs, to exacerbate the problem as some borrowers are unable to refinance. The floor on deposit rates has increased the cost of funding, but the impact on operating profitability was not as severe as the cap on lending rates. Banks, where possible, have shifted deposits into non-interest bearing deposits. We believe the small banks are most affected as they are more reliant on high interest deposits for their funding due to the lack of franchise. The small banks have already been affected by liquidity pressure due to a 'flight to quality' and the deposit rate cap will exacerbate the problem, in our view. In Fitch's view the banks in this review are adequately capitalised, with capital ratios comfortably above the regulatory minimum. High capital ratios are prudent as the operating environment can be volatile and challenging. Capital ratios have been supported by solid earnings but this is reducing due to the cap on lending rates. Access to capital is good, particularly by emerging market standards, with Kenya having developed financial markets. While bank risks are rising, regulation and supervision are improving. The central bank was quick to intervene with the three problem banks and prevented wider sector instability. Fitch's report, is available on www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link above.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

It beat off tough competition from Europe - where an Italian woman did not scream loud enough to prove her rape - and an Asian ruling that restricted birth control to Philippine women. The Gender Justice Uncovered Awards recognize court decisions that affect the rights of women and girls around the world, in both good and bad ways.  The Kenyan judge in the most egregious case ruled that if only the age of victims was taken into account,  young girls would freely engage in sex and then opt to report to the police whenever they disagree with their boyfriends.   According to court documents summing up the April 2016 judgment, age is immaterial if a girl acts beyond her years.  Where the child behaves like an adult and willingly sneaks into men's houses for purposes of having sex, the court ought to treat such a child as a grown up who knows what she is doing.  The awards cover all aspects of gender equality, including those related to sexual and reproductive rights, violence, and discrimination. Cases under consideration came from as far afield as Uruguay and Chad, with all continents represented.  In every country, political systems, traditions, and religious beliefs inform the decisions of judges, who have the power to affect women and girls' rights, for better or for worse,  Blakeley Decktor - a lawyer at women's rights organization Women's Link, which gives out the awards - told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   The public has sent a clear message that they will not tolerate courts all over the world discriminating against women and girls and failing to protect their rights,  she said. A Spanish court which ruled that the law should treat men and women differently - citing domestic violence, pension and divorce cases - was praised as the best decision. Many of the rulings, which were nominated by members of the public, related to sexual assault cases. In March, a survey of laws in 73 countries found rapists could avoid punishment if they married their victim in at least nine jurisdictions, including Bahrain, Iraq, Philippines, Tajikistan and Tunisia.

A large area of southern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba has received less than 40 percent of normal precipitation during the 30-day period leading up to June 5, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Much of east-central Alberta and west-central Saskatchewan has the opposite problem, having collected more than double the usual amounts of precipitation. The southern Prairies need 0.5 to 1.5 inches (13-38 mm) of rain soon -  a $1-million-dollar  shower to accelerate growth, said Dave Reimann, grain market analyst at Cargill Ltd [CARGIL.UL]. Spring wheat and canola in Saskatchewan, the biggest provincial producer of those crops, are seven to 10 days behind their normal development, despite being planted on time this spring, said Shannon Friesen, cropping management specialist for the provincial government. High winds have compounded the problem, drying up what little moisture Saskatchewan and Manitoba have received. Some crops have yet to poke through the soil and may not emerge at all without a significant rain in the next week, Friesen said, adding:  Some of those crops could be done.  Minneapolis spring wheat futures 1MWEc1 have gained about 12 percent since mid-May on concerns about hot, dry weather in the northern U.S. Plains, which border the southern Canadian Prairies. Environment Canada, a government agency, is forecasting hot, dry weather for most of the next week across the southern Prairies, although some dry parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan may get periodic showers. Canada is a major wheat exporter and the biggest global grower of canola, used to make vegetable oil. Elsewhere, farmers who are planting later than normal may decide to sow additional acres of short-season crops, such as barley and oats, said FarmLink Marketing Solutions senior market analyst Neil Townsend.  Other farmers in Alberta's wet Peace River region may expand canola plantings at the expense of spring wheat, which takes longer to grow, said Neil Arbuckle, national sales lead at the Canadian unit of seed and chemical dealer Monsanto Co (MON.N).  Although canola is costlier, even with a wheat price rally, canola could provide a higher return given the excellent yields farmers have been experiencing recently,  Arbuckle said.

Oil prices dipped on renewed concerns about the efficacy of OPEC-led production cuts and a Mideast political rift, then extended losses after EIA data showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude fell 4.21 percent to $46.16 per barrel and Brent was last at $48.37, down 3.49 percent on the day. In Spain, the absorption of Popular by the country's biggest bank Santander for a nominal 1 euro was the first use of a regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, and made barely a ripple in Europe's stock and debt markets. The success of the process pushed shares in many major banks higher, supporting a recovery for Madrid's stock market and fending off this week's broadly weaker mood. European banking shares rose 1.38 percent.  The market has taken Banco Popular as positive news because essentially this is not a bankruptcy but a sort of rescue, even if its subordinated bondholders have been sharply hit,  said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan. The bank rescue does, however, underline the risks to growth, banking and government debt burdens that are likely to delay a major switch in language and policy direction by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.13 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04 percent. The euro turned shaky after reports suggested the ECB would lower its inflation targets. It was last down 0.23 percent to $1.125.  Maybe tomorrow's ECB meeting sees nothing but platitudes and disappoints a market that is getting ahead of itself,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes.  But (for us) that would be a huge euro buying opportunity, because ECB normalisation is coming. And when it does, the euro simply won't be able to sustain undervalued levels for long.  The ECB meeting is one of three events that ING currency strategist Viraj Patel said had been dubbed 'Triple Threat Thursday,'... an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride.  Also on Thursday will be a surprisingly closely-fought British election and U.S. Senate testimony from James Comey, the former FBI chief fired by President Donald Trump. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony are likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhaul the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year. On Wall Street, shares opened slightly higher, turned negative and then rose again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.41 points, or 0.09 percent, to 21,154.64, the S&P; 500 gained 2.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,431.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.12 points, or 0.34 percent, to 6,296.17.  It's the calm before the storm. We have a quiet week in terms of economic data and there's a general global unease at the moment,  said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The impact of Comey's statement really depends on what he says, and anyway these hearings are long and dragged out. The UK elections could have an impact if there is a hung parliament and the various polls are adding a level of uncertainty.

The U.N.'s 13,000-strong mission in CAR is seeking to contain violence in a multi-year conflict driven by ethnic and religious grievances and vying over vast diamond resources. More than 100 peacekeepers from Congo's 630-strong battalion were sent back last year in relation to a series of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) allegations, some of the dozens of such accusations against the U.N. mission since 2014. In the memo, dated May 12 this year and sent to a military official in the U.N. headquarters responsible for liaising with troop contributing countries, Lieutenant General Balla Keita said that the situation had deteriorated.  Congo should commit itself to improving without delay the standard of its unit. If not, (a) decision should be made to repatriate and replace the Congolese battalion,  it said. The memo was released by Code Blue, a campaign led by a non-governmental organization seeking greater accountability for peacekeepers. Keita, who could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment on Wednesday, did not give details of the violations in the memo but said he had sent six complaint letters to the battalion commander so far this year. Herve Verhoosel, spokesman for the MINUSCA mission, said that the memo followed an internal assessment of the contingent in March whose findings had been shared with Congo. A spokesman for Congo's defense ministry was not available for comment.  A U.N. database of SEA allegations showed three reported incidents involving troops from Congo Republic in Central African Republic so far this year. Nine were reported in 2016.  The battalion, based in the western Central African Republic town of Berberati, has in the past been involved in trafficking fuel and Keita noted in the May memo that only a few of its 114 vehicles were serviceable.  U.N. peacekeeping is committed to the highest standards of performance and conduct. We will spare no action in order to meet this goal,  MINUSCA's spokesman Verhoosel told Reuters.

Three months after infusion, the overall response rate (ORR)among 51 adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was 45 percent, Novartis said, with 37 percent complete responses (CR), or no sign of disease. Novartis aims for $1 billion in annual sales for CTL019, a drug made by taking T cells from a patient, reprogramming them in the lab to fight cancer, and re-infusing them. The field is crowded, with Kite and Juno also hunting for approval for drugs whose per-patient costs could top $500,000.  When you look across the three competitors' data sets, they're all in a similar range of responses,  Novartis drug development chief Vas Narasimhan said in an interview.  What's critical is to see the data sets fully mature... and look at the overall safety profile.  Narasimhan said no deaths were linked to CTL019, though three patients died from disease progression within 30 days of infusion. Seven suffered severe neurological events. While so-called  CAR-T therapies  from Novartis, Kite and Juno are now last resorts for patients who have failed other treatments, more doctors are growing convinced they have promise. Globally, there are some 183 CAR-T trials underway. In March, Novartis filed CTL019 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fast-track approval in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in young patients. The FDA has scheduled a July 12 public meeting for that. Novartis could file for FDA approval in DLBCL, the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults, around October, with European filings planned about the same time. Rival Kite Pharma's experimental drug axi-cel is also under expedited U.S. review against advanced NHL, with additional trials underway in leukaemia patients. Kite has said 41 percent of NHL patients responded to axi-cel treatment at the six-month cutoff, with 36 percent in complete response. Though Juno Therapeutics has suffered significant setbacks -- patient deaths forced it to abandon its lead CAR-T molecule this year -- the company released fresh data last week on another drug, JCAR017, against NHL. Novartis is studying why some patients respond to CTL019 while others' cancers avoid detection.  Additional trials are planned, including with newer CAR-Ts combined with other drugs.  There's just a lot of science that's yet to be understood,  Narasimhan said.  I hope we have better answers next year ... for what's going on in the non-responders.

The three political activists - Felix Agbor Balla, Fontem Aforteka'a Neba and Mancho Bibixy - pleaded not guilty in February to charges including complicity in hostility against the homeland, secession, civil war, and campaigning for federalism.  They are being held under anti-terrorism laws enacted as part of the battle against Islamist Boko Haram militants in the north.  The defense request to allow the accused to be freed on bail has no basis,  Judge Abega Mbezoa said at the hearing. Rights groups have raised concerns about increasing repression under the 35-year-old rule of President Biya. Last month security forces prevented a news conference by Amnesty International that had been called to demand the release of three young men jailed in 2015 for sharing a joke. At the end of World War One, the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors. At independence in 1960, English-speaking voters opted to join Cameroon rather than neighboring Nigeria, but they have since complained of being marginalized.

A large area of southern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba has received less than 40 percent of normal precipitation during the 30-day period leading up to June 5, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Much of east-central Alberta and west-central Saskatchewan has the opposite problem, having collected more than double the usual amounts of precipitation. The southern Prairies need 0.5 to 1.5 inches (13-38 mm) of rain soon -  a $1-million-dollar  shower to accelerate growth, said Dave Reimann, grain market analyst at Cargill Ltd [CARGIL.UL]. Spring wheat and canola in Saskatchewan, the biggest provincial producer of those crops, are seven to 10 days behind their normal development, despite being planted on time this spring, said Shannon Friesen, cropping management specialist for the provincial government. High winds have compounded the problem, drying up what little moisture Saskatchewan and Manitoba have received. Some crops have yet to poke through the soil and may not emerge at all without a significant rain in the next week, Friesen said, adding:  Some of those crops could be done.  Minneapolis spring wheat futures 1MWEc1 have gained about 12 percent since mid-May on concerns about hot, dry weather in the northern U.S. Plains, which border the southern Canadian Prairies. Environment Canada, a government agency, is forecasting hot, dry weather for most of the next week across the southern Prairies, although some dry parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan may get periodic showers. Canada is a major wheat exporter and the biggest global grower of canola, used to make vegetable oil. Elsewhere, farmers who are planting later than normal may decide to sow additional acres of short-season crops, such as barley and oats, said FarmLink Marketing Solutions senior market analyst Neil Townsend.  Other farmers in Alberta's wet Peace River region may expand canola plantings at the expense of spring wheat, which takes longer to grow, said Neil Arbuckle, national sales lead at the Canadian unit of seed and chemical dealer Monsanto Co (MON.N).  Although canola is costlier, even with a wheat price rally, canola could provide a higher return given the excellent yields farmers have been experiencing recently,  Arbuckle said. Statscan is scheduled to estimate Canadian plantings on June 29.

In the deepest split between Arab states for decades, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar on Monday and closed their airspace to commercial flights, saying it was funding militant groups. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations.     Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said isolating Qatar would not resolve any problems. Erdogan, who has long tried to play the role of a regional power broker, said Ankara would do everything in its power to help end the regional crisis. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is visiting the region to discuss the stand-off.     Lawmakers from Erdogan's ruling AK Party and the nationalist opposition MHP on Wednesday proposed bringing forward approval of a draft bill that will allow Turkish troops to be deployed to Turkey's military base in Qatar, party officials told Reuters. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Turkish parliament was also set to bring forward approval of a draft accord between the two countries on military training cooperation, the officials said. Both bills, which were drawn up before the spat erupted, are expected to be approved by the Ankara parliament on Wednesday.

Qatar recently purchased about 20,000 tonnes of Russian milling wheat which according to my calculations has just arrived in past days or will arrive in coming days,  one European grain trader said.  The president of Qatar's Chamber of Commerce was quoted on Wednesday by local media as saying Qatar had enough food stored in strategic reserves to last for a year.  There will be no shortage of food and other products as more than 95 percent of imports from Qatar arrive by air and sea,  Qatari Sheikh Khalifa bin Jassim al-Thani said. Turkey set up a military base in Qatar, its first such installation in the Middle East, as part of an agreement signed in 2014. In 2016, Ahmet Davutoglu, then Turkish prime minister, visited the base where 150 troops are stationed, the Turkish daily Hurriyet reported. In an interview with Reuters in late 2015, Ahmet Demirok, Turkey's ambassador to Qatar at the time, said 3,000 ground troops would eventually be deployed at the base, which was primarily to serve as a venue for joint training exercises. The text of the draft bill, which includes the agreement between Qatar and Turkey on the base, shows the cooperation will be primarily about the modernisation of Qatar's military institutions, as well as widening cooperation in training and joint war exercises.

In the final days of an election campaign that has been interrupted by terror attacks in London and Manchester, May has stepped up her rhetoric against Islamist extremism, pledging to ensure security services had the powers they needed.  What I’ve been clear about is if human rights law gets in the way of doing those things which I think are necessary as the threat evolves then we will change those rules,  she said on Wednesday, the eve of the election. Shetty told Reuters in an interview that civilized societies should protect human rights to enhance their security, and it was not a choice between one or the other.   It’s outrageous, it’s just outrageous, the idea that she's willing to tear up human rights principles,  he said.  Otherwise you’re creating a cycle of violence. You’re going to behave in the same way that these so-called terrorists behave. What exactly is the difference?  He said May's government was already undercutting British people's values with its plan to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and replace it with  shortcuts .  If you think you’re going to win this war by taking shortcuts, you’re sadly mistaken,  he said. His biggest concern was the likelihood that such shortcuts would be replicated in countries such as Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has cracked down on his opponents since overthrowing the elected president in mid-2013.   These people are running police states and they use the examples of the U.K. and U.S. and France to say you’re in no place to tell anybody about human rights any more.   A wide spectrum of countries, including the United States, Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines and India, had experienced a new  politics of divisiveness  in the past few years, where certain groups such as refugees or Muslims were scapegoated by manipulative politicians, leaving human rights  in freefall . Amnesty International, a non-governmental organization that has long campaigned against unelected, illegitimate dictators, is now faced with legitimately elected leaders attacking the media, civil society and the independent judiciary, Shetty said.  So we are in uncharted and dangerous territory where societal attitudes have been swayed to make being against human rights kind of kosher and cool, and human rights are projected as elite and liberal and not meant for the masses.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move on Monday, accusing it of backing Islamist militants and Iran. Qatar strongly denies supporting terrorism, and on Tuesday called for talks to settle the dispute. The dispute was also prompted in part by claims that Qatar was trying to undermine neighboring governments by giving financial support to opposition movements and using its flagship television channel Al Jazeera as a mouthpiece to attack them. But UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Reuters in an interview that addressing financing for terrorist groups was the prime motive.  This litany of subversive support, infringement, actions is huge but I would say the most serious is the extremists and terrorist angle,  he said.  I think this is the most serious of all the other catalogues of other infringements.  Gargash also said further moves against Qatar were possible and warned against allowing Shi'ite Muslim power Iran to exploit the unprecedented rift between the mainly Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states, some of which regard Tehran as a regional arch-rival. Qatar, a major player in the global gas industry and host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East, has crafted an independently-minded foreign policy, attracting criticism for engaging with groups from Hezbollah to Hamas. Global understanding of the small Gulf nation's alleged links to those organizations, as well as al Qaeda and Islamic State, is improving, Gargash said.  He cited comments by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump who took to Twitter on Tuesday to implicate Qatar and praise its isolation. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash is seen on a camera screen as he attends an interview with Reuters in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, June 7, 2017.Abdel Hadi Ramahi We want a black-and-white approach to terrorist financing,  said Gargash.  We know the ABCs of dealing with terrorism. One of these ABCs is: you never feed the crocodiles.  At a May summit in Riyadh attended by Trump, the United States and Gulf Arab countries signed an agreement to coordinate efforts against the financing of terrorist groups. Trump urged more than 50 Muslim leaders at the gathering to  drive out  terrorists from their lands, which Gulf officials say helped embolden the move against Qatar this week. Gargash said the UAE wanted to see action taken against individuals living openly in Qatar despite being classified as supporters of terrorism by the United States and United Nations.  He identified three men who are suspected of providing funds and other support to al Qaeda in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan, and who the U.S. Treasury Department says have financed terrorism. There was no immediate response for a request for comment on that demand from a Qatari official. Gargash said the scope of Qatar's sheltering of extremists has widened since 2014, when concern was largely focused on Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi, a senior Egyptian cleric viewed as the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood.  Gulf states view the Brotherhood, the world's oldest Islamist movement and long Egypt's main opposition group, as a dangerous political enemy.  Now the concern is more serious, much more acute than 2014,  he said.  It shows how the Qataris have expanded their support but it has become more visible.

The bank may however be pushed to act to save the economy by cutting lending rates sooner than planned to make money cheaper in a bid to boost consumer spending, analysts said. Data on Tuesday showed the economy contracted by 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017 after shrinking 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. At its policy meeting in May, Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago played down the prospects of cheaper borrowing costs, citing risks to inflation posed by currency volatility in light of domestic political uncertainty and credit ratings downgrades. Economists also said risks to inflation and the currency, posed by large capital and trade deficits, had faded.  For a whole host of reasons the prospect of a rate cut has definitely increased. The bank could very well prioritise growth, putting it higher than has been case where inflation has been front and centre,  said director ETM Analytics George Glynos.  These traditional drags on the rand are no longer there and as a result they will probably feel a lot more comfortable in reducing interest rates.  The country's trade balance swung to a 11.4 billion rand surplus in March and has remained in the black since then, while the current account narrowed to a six-year low in the first quarter.  Cutting next year would be too late and that will have driven the economy into a permanent recession,  said senior economist at Old Mutual Johann Els.  Cutting rates now would potentially boost confidence and the growth outlook and that would be positive for rating expectations because the agencies have said they're looking for growth possibilities that will aid fiscal sustainability.

Speaking to Reuters in his office at the Formula One team's headquarters, Brown indicated clearly that a parting of the ways was a real option under consideration by management. The American said engine upgrades promised for this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix were not ready and the Japanese manufacturer could not say when they might be. And while McLaren still wanted to win championships with Honda, there were serious concerns as to whether that was achievable.  Honda’s working very hard but they seem a bit lost,  said Brown, who replaced Ron Dennis at the helm late last year.  We were only told recently that we wouldn’t have the upgrade coming (for Montreal)...and we don’t have a definitive timeline, which is concerning because the pain is great and we can’t sit around forever.  We were eagerly awaiting this upgrade as were our drivers and it’s a big disappointment that it’s not coming. It’s not lack of effort, but they are struggling to get it to come together.  McLaren, the second oldest and most successful team in Formula One after Ferrari in terms of race wins, are the only ones yet to score a point this season. They have not won a race since 2012. The renewed partnership with Honda in 2015 was billed as a return to the glory days, when French great Alain Prost and the late Brazilian Ayrton Senna dominated the late 1980s and early 1990s. Instead it has brought failure and embarrassment to the former world champions, whose cars have failed to finish races -- and sometimes even start them -- due to engine failures. Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, a double world champion whose future is uncertain, said in March that  we have only one problem, and that is the power unit. There is no reliability and there is no power.  McLaren were ninth in 2015, sixth last year and this season could become their worst ever. Marching Orders  The executive committee have now given us our marching orders,  said Brown, who is also chairman of the fast-growing Motorsport Network media group.  We’re not going to go into another year like this, in hope.   I don’t want to get into what our options are. Our preference is to win the world championship with Honda. But at some point you need to make a decision as to whether that’s achievable. And we have serious concerns.  Missing upgrades, and upgrades not delivering to the level we were told they were going to, you can only take that so long. And we’re near our limit.  McLaren have sounded out former partners Mercedes about a possible supply of engines, according to unconfirmed media reports.  It will all come together,  said Brown, who said there were some big decisions to make in the next 90 days with the team needing to plan for the new car and give Alonso a reason to stay.  There’s lots of things that go into the decision and we’re entering that window now of 'which way do you go when you come to the fork in the road'. Brown said the decision to partner with Honda in what has so far been an exclusive deal was  100 percent right .  However, so far it hasn’t worked,  he added.  A year in Formula One is an eternity. Three years is a decade. And you just can’t go on forever.  Honda spokespeople were not immediately available for comment.  Brown said there were clear advantages in a 'works' partnership but pointed to Red Bull and 2009 champions Brawn GP as examples of 'customer' teams who won titles.  Do I think you can win with a customer engine? I think you can,  he said. Honda contribute more than $100 million a year to McLaren's budget, according to informed sources, and some have questioned whether the team can afford to lose such sums. Brown said the reality was that McLaren had lost some big, long-term sponsors and significant prize money in the last three years.  When you actually look at the impact of loss of FOM (Formula One payments) money and loss of sponsorship, it starts to diminish the commercial benefits of what Honda brings to the table,  he said.  And when you start to net it out, it doesn’t have quite the commercial benefit it might appear from the outside.

Sources have told Reuters the ECB is likely to nudge up its forecasts for economic growth in the euro zone but trim its estimates for inflation. The ECB is now forecasting inflation at 1.7 percent and growth at 1.8 percent this year. Its mandate is to keep inflation close to but below 2 percent, but inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in May. The sources said any change would be small, in some cases as little as 10 basis points, reflecting an adjustment rather than an overhaul of the March projections. The ECB declined to comment. The mixed outlook should strengthen the case for keeping the ECB's policy of bond purchases and sub-zero rates in place, despite growing calls from Germany for a gradual tightening.    We expect Thursday’s press statement to reiterate that an 'exceptional degree of monetary accommodation' is still needed,  said Luigi Speranza, an economist at BNP Paribas.        The euro zone's central bank is widely expected to leave its policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion-euro (£2 trillion) bond-buying program. But sources told Reuters last week the ECB will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement .   Policymakers may also discuss closing the door to further rate cuts, although any decision on that is far from certain, the sources said.  That would be consistent with changing their views on the growth outlook but would also not be regarded as overly hawkish,  said Peter Nagle, an economist at the Institute of International Finance.

Three months after infusion, the overall response rate (ORR)among 51 adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was 45 percent, Novartis said, with 37 percent complete responses (CR), or no sign of disease. Novartis aims for $1 billion in annual sales for CTL019, a drug made by taking T cells from a patient, reprogramming them in the lab to fight cancer, and re-infusing them. The field is crowded, with Kite and Juno also hunting for approval for drugs whose per-patient costs could top $500,000.  When you look across the three competitors' data sets, they're all in a similar range of responses,  Novartis drug development chief Vas Narasimhan said in an interview.  What's critical is to see the data sets fully mature... and look at the overall safety profile.  Narasimhan said no deaths were linked to CTL019, though three patients died from disease progression within 30 days of infusion. Seven suffered severe neurological events. While so-called  CAR-T therapies  from Novartis, Kite and Juno are now last resorts for patients who have failed other treatments, more doctors are growing convinced they have promise. Globally, there are some 183 CAR-T trials underway. In March, Novartis filed CTL019 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fast-track approval in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in young patients. The FDA has scheduled a July 12 public meeting for that. Novartis could file for FDA approval in DLBCL, the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults, around October, with European filings planned about the same time. Rival Kite Pharma's experimental drug axi-cel is also under expedited U.S. review against advanced NHL, with additional trials underway in leukaemia patients. Kite has said 41 percent of NHL patients responded to axi-cel treatment at the six-month cutoff, with 36 percent in complete response. Though Juno Therapeutics has suffered significant setbacks -- patient deaths forced it to abandon its lead CAR-T molecule this year -- the company released fresh data last week on another drug, JCAR017, against NHL. Novartis is studying why some patients respond to CTL019 while others' cancers avoid detection.  Additional trials are planned, including with newer CAR-Ts combined with other drugs.  There's just a lot of science that's yet to be understood,  Narasimhan said.  I hope we have better answers next year ... for what's going on in the non-responders.

Results from Britain's 650 constituencies are due throughout the night. Below are some key seats to look out for, in order of expected declaration time, as well as details on the exit poll which will give the first indication of the likely result. Reuters will provide full coverage of results on the night. cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?navid=72745 For an interactive graphic on the election: tmsnrt.rs/2pgjH8p Exit Poll When voting closes at 2100 GMT, an exit poll will be published simultaneously by BBC, ITV and Sky. It is conducted by pollsters GfK and Ipsos MORI, who will speak to thousands of voters at more than 140 polling stations around the county. In 2005 and 2010 the exit poll accurately forecast the number of seats won by the largest party. In 2015 it slightly underestimated the number of seats won by the victorious Conservatives, but got the order of the parties right. Houghton and Sunderland South, Result Expected 2200 Gmt Due to be the first result of the night. It was one of the first big Leave-voting areas to declare in last year's referendum on European Union membership, shocking markets by backing Brexit more strongly than expected. It is held by the opposition Labour Party, with a majority of nearly 13,000 votes, but will be closely watched for the fortunes of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP), which came second here in 2015 with more than 8,000 votes.  UKIP's poll share has collapsed since 2015, and this seat could give an indication of how far May's Conservatives are succeeding in mopping up former UKIP supporters. Nuneaton, Result Expected Midnight Gmt  Considered a national bellwether seat, Nuneaton could provide an early clue of the possible swing between May's Conservatives and Labour. The Conservatives increased their majority here in 2015, despite it being a Labour target, and it provided one of the first indications the Conservatives were on course for victory. Darlington, Result Expected 0030 Gmt This Conservative target seat, which voted in favor of leaving the EU, is held by Labour with a majority of 3,158.  A YouGov regional poll last month showed support for Conservatives had risen significantly in the northeast of England, and the Tees Valley region, in which Darlington sits, unexpectedly elected a Conservative mayor last month. A win for May's party here could mean she is on track for a landslide nationally, according to polling expert John Curtice. Northampton North, Result Expected 0100 Gmt This seat has elected a lawmaker from the winning party at every British national election since it was created in 1974. It is held by the Conservatives with a majority of 3,245.  UKIP, which won more than 6,000 votes here in 2015, are not fielding a candidate so it should be a comfortable win for the Conservatives if they are to increase their national majority.  Bury North, Result Expected 0200 Gmt This is a Conservative-held marginal seat, with a majority of just 378 voters. It has been a bellwether seat so if the Conservatives lose it, despite facing no UKIP candidate, it could be a sign they are at risk of losing their majority. Moray, Result Expected 0200 Gmt The seat of the pro-independence Scottish National Party's leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, who won it with a majority of just over 9,000 in 2015. At local elections in May the Conservatives won a greater vote share here than the SNP.  If the swing seen then is repeated, Robertson would lose his seat. Moray, which voted in favor of Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom in 2014, was the closest Brexit result in Scotland, with  Remain  just 122 votes ahead of  Leave . Wrexham, Result Expected 0200 Gmt This seat in Brexit-supporting Wales is held by Labour with a majority of 1,831 and has never been won by the Conservatives. UKIP, which won more than 5,000 votes here in 2015, is not fielding a candidate this time and Curtice points to it as one to watch for signs that May could substantially increase her majority nationally. Hastings and Rye, Result Expected 0200 Gmt This is the seat of interior minister Amber Rudd, who has played a prominent role in the election campaign and is tipped as a possible successor to Chancellor Philip Hammond. She has held it since 2010, and won a majority of 4,796 in 2015.  The Green Party, which won just under 2,000 votes there in 2015, has agreed not to field a candidate in a bid to help Labour try and unseat Rudd. Pollster YouGov's election model has predicted they could succeed in doing so.  Kingston and Surbiton, Result Expected 0200 Gmt This seat is being targeted by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, who lost it to the Conservatives in 2015.  The area voted strongly to remain in the EU at last year's referendum. Whether the Liberal Democrats are able to overturn the Conservatives' majority of 2,834 will be a key test of how far remain supporters are willing to back May's Brexit plan. Westmorland and Lonsdale, Result Expected 0300 Gmt The seat of Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. He won it with a majority of nearly 9,000 votes in 2015 but his party's expected surge in support due to its anti-Brexit stance has failed to materialize. Cumbria, where the seat sits, voted in favor of Brexit and the Conservatives are hoping to oust Farron. They are likely to be helped by the fact UKIP, which got just over 3,000 votes there in 2015, are not standing. Brighton Kemptown, Result Expected 0400 Gmt This marginal seat is held by the Conservative minister responsible for financial services, Simon Kirby, with a majority of just 690. It voted strongly in favor of remaining in the EU. It has been a bellwether at national elections since 1979 and the Green Party, who won more than 3,000 votes here in 2015, are not standing. Labour need to win seats like this if they are to have any chance of being the largest party nationally. Halifax, Result Expected 0430 Gmt This is one of Labour's most marginal seats, with a majority of just 428. It voted in favor of Brexit. May's Conservatives launched their election policy document here and need to win seats like this if she is to win a comfortable majority.

Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel are all on market's radar. The election could determine whether the country has a smooth or hard exit from the European Union. Opinion polls have shown British Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government.  If the Conservative party extends its majority, markets will be pretty calm, but anything less than that is going to have people worried about how we approach the Brexit negotiation,  said Luke Hickmore, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump might shed more light on a probe by the FBI into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. Any damaging revelation in Comey's testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's pro-business fiscal agenda.  I think the Comey news led to an initial surprise but the rebound was equally swift,  said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co.  I'm not sure that unless Comey says something completely shocking or he suggests something that there's no way the House can't consider obstruction of justice ... aside from that I don't see his testimony as market moving.  The ECB will also hold its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to reiterate its plan to extend the money-printing scheme at least until the end of the year. Sonders said any impact from Thursday's events is likely to be short term.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 17.17 points, or 0.27 percent, at 6,292.23. Five of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the energy index's 1.26 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil prices fell nearly 4 percent on renewed concerns about the efficacy of OPEC-led production cuts due to rising tensions within the export group over Qatar and growing U.S. output. Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down about 1 percent and were among the biggest drags on the S&P; and the Dow. However, Apple's 0.5 percent rise helped offset some of those losses.

The truck and engine maker's shares were down 1.5 percent at $29.47 on Wednesday. Revenue in Navistar's truck business, its biggest, fell 5.5 percent to $1.40 billion in the second quarter ended April 30. The results come in the backdrop of improving heavy truck orders. The orders had been declining as trucking companies adjusted their fleets amid lackluster retail sales and industrial output in the United States. Orders for Class 8 highway trucks in the United States, the 18-wheelers that haul freight across the country, soared 77 percent in April versus the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary data from industry forecaster FTR.

Navistar reaffirmed its revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) forecast for the year and said it expected a stronger second half as its turnaround efforts start to pay off. Exterior of Navistar office is seen in Lisle, Illinois, October 4, 2012.Jim YoungThe Lisle, Illinois-based company, which was once a leading maker of truck engines, is in the process of turning itself around after making a disastrous bet on a costly and unsuccessful proprietary smog-reduction system that did not meet regulatory standards. The company, which also makes school buses and dump trucks, has changed management, cut costs and redesigned its products, in a move to return to profitability.  Guidance calls for improved EBITDA in 2017 and a significantly stronger second half to the fiscal year on sequential improvements in the company's core markets,  Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said. Navistar said the $60 million charge was a result of a change in its sales strategy for its used MaxxForce 13 trucks to focus more on export sales. Net inventory on April 30 was $1.46 billion compared with $1.55 billion at the end of April last year. Net loss attributable to the company was $80 million, or 86 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $4 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sources have told Reuters the ECB is likely to nudge up its forecasts for economic growth in the euro zone but trim its estimates for inflation. The ECB is now forecasting inflation at 1.7 percent and growth at 1.8 percent this year. Its mandate is to keep inflation close to but below 2 percent, but inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in May. The sources said any change would be small, in some cases as little as 10 basis points, reflecting an adjustment rather than an overhaul of the March projections. The ECB declined to comment. The mixed outlook should strengthen the case for keeping the ECB's policy of bond purchases and sub-zero rates in place, despite growing calls from Germany for a gradual tightening.    We expect Thursday’s press statement to reiterate that an 'exceptional degree of monetary accommodation' is still needed,  said Luigi Speranza, an economist at BNP Paribas.        The euro zone's central bank is widely expected to leave its policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion-euro (£2 trillion) bond-buying program. But sources told Reuters last week the ECB will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement .   Policymakers may also discuss closing the door to further rate cuts, although any decision on that is far from certain, the sources said.  That would be consistent with changing their views on the growth outlook but would also not be regarded as overly hawkish,  said Peter Nagle, an economist at the Institute of International Finance.

Looking at what we want to achieve with the airline, Wilderness has been chosen by the cabinet as the preferred bidder,  Ebineng told a parliamentary committee.  We expect a deal to be completed in the next 9-12 months.  Air Botswana has been making losses, blamed on a large workforce and an aging fleet, which prompted the government to launch a turnaround plan that includes cutting costs and cancelling unprofitable routes. It has already stopped flights to Harare and Lusaka. Ebineng did not elaborate on what form the privatisation will take, but the government in its invitation for bids had said it was open to joint ventures, ownership, franchising and concessions. Wilderness runs luxury resorts in eight African countries and Wilderness Air operates 35 small aircrafts in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia, mainly for tourists.

Paris sees an opportunity in Britain's vote to leave the European Union, the regulatory implications of which place a question mark over London's place as Europe's financial centre. As well as cutting payroll charges, France must make labour rules more predictable because the cost of doing business is a major handicap, the senate's finance committee said in a report on Wednesday which it described as a  wake-up call .  The reforms aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of the Place de Paris remain at this stage insufficient and partly contradictory,  it said. France has made its tax regime for expatriates more favourable, and set up a fast-track licence application, while President Emmanuel Macron, himself an ex-banker,  promises an overhaul of the labour market, tax and pension systems. The finance committee said that an employee with a salary of 250,000 euros per year would cost a company in Germany 15,000 euros in payroll charges, versus 137,000 euros in France, 9,000 euros in the Netherlands and 27,000 euros in Ireland. This gap is partly explained by a specific payroll tax on the banking sector, which is exempt from value-added tax. The committee recommended tweaking what is a progressive payroll tax system so that it has a lower impact at the high-paid end of the banking jobs sector while also introducing exemptions for expatriates working in France. More than 20 banks and asset management firms are in advanced talks with regulators in France about shifting jobs there, former Bank of France chief Christian Noyer said in May. So far, only HSBC Holdings PLC has said it would move staff to Paris following Britain's EU exit, while Frankfurt has emerged as a frontrunner to attract financial firms.  For a cost of 2 bankers in Paris, an employer can hire a third one in Frankfurt,  the senate's report said. The election of Macron, a former investment banker with Rothschild & Co and a pro-business candidate, could boost Paris' chances, but much depends on the details of his reforms.  For us, Paris passed in one year from underdog behind Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam and Madrid, to top two with Frankfurt,  an executive at an international bank in Paris said.  One could imagine a special regime for banks, a tighter labour law for banks with a ceiling of the indemnities for dismissal in order to gain competitiveness without annoying too many people,  the banker added.

New York City and State pension funds and the California Teachers' Retirement System are urging shareholders to vote on June 22 against Coury and five other directors because of the board's oversight of Coury's high pay package and issues related to its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment business and its deal-making. The investors, who hold 4.3 million shares, said Mylan walked away from a deal with rival Teva International Industries Ltd in 2015, causing shares to lose value. Mylan met with ISS on Monday and discussed the role of Coury in growing the company, according to the letter, and defended his compensation, which was more than $97 million in 2016. Mylan also defended its dealings with Teva, saying it  never  received an offer from the Israeli drugmaker. Teva said in an open letter in April 2015 it would pay $82 per share in cash and stock, and Coury responded in a letter to Teva that the offer was too low and that the starting point for discussions was $100 per share. Teva walked away in July 2015 after reaching a $40 billion deal for Allergan Plc's generic unit. Mylan shares rose 0.5 percent to $38.74 on Wednesday. Mylan has been the subject of federal and state investigations and agreed last fall to pay $465 million to settle U.S. Justice Department allegations it overcharged the government for EpiPens, although the agreement has not been finalized.

Temer's proposal to loosen labor laws won approval from the Senate's economic affairs committee on Tuesday, clearing the way for a full-house vote and reducing expectations that a growing political crisis could jeopardize his reforms agenda.      The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.5 percent, driven higher by rising shares of banks such as Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA and Banco do Brasil SA.     Still, the Brazilian real inched up only 0.2 percent as the TSE, Brazil's top electoral court, argued whether Temer received illegal campaign funding in 2014, when he ran for vice president with his leftist predecessor, Dilma Rousseff.      Temer's opponents see a ruling as a way out of the political crisis set off by corruption allegations leveled against the center-right leader, but a decision could take weeks, if not months, and could be appealed by Temer.      Trading was muted in most Latin American markets ahead of key events scheduled for Thursday, when Britain will hold a national election, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's former director will testify to Congress and European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers meet to decide on policy.

Political noise has weighed on demand for risky assets in recent days, with MSCI's emerging stock benchmark slipping for a second day. Also contributing to caution were decisions by several Arab countries to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar vehemently denies the allegations.

Some 50,000 people have been arrested since the failed putsch in July and around 150,000 dismissed or suspended, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Authorities detained the soldiers in raids focused on the central Turkish province of Konya and 32 other provinces, the Hurriyet daily said. Separately, the state-run Anadolu Agency said detention orders had been issued for 128 people with ties to the publishing company Kaynak Holding, which was linked to the Gulen movement before authorities seized it. Hundreds of firms like Kaynak, many of them smaller provincial businesses, were seized by authorities in the post-coup crackdown and are now run by government-appointed administrators. Of the 128 people being sought, Anadolu said 39 people had been detained so far in an operation carried out in Istanbul and seven other provinces. There was no official comment on the detentions. Amnesty Chair Detained On Tuesday, authorities detained the local chair of Amnesty International, Taner Kilic, and 22 other lawyers in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir for suspected links to Gulen's network, the rights group said. Salil Shetty, head of Amnesty International, told Reuters in an interview that the organization was calling for the release of Taner and the 22 lawyers, and said they should be provided with the necessary legal support.  It's a very non-transparent operation the way in which they function,  he said, referring to Turkish authorities.  We don't see a direct connection with Amnesty International on this issue, it's a much broader problem.  Shetty said it was not clear what evidence Turkish authorities had against Taner that would link him to Gulen's network, but added Amnesty International was fighting the decision. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it. The scope of the purges, which have also seen more than 130 media outlets shut down and some 150 journalists jailed, has unnerved rights groups and Turkey's Western allies, who fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent and purge opponents. Turkish officials, however, say the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt which killed 240 people on July 15.

Crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels in the week ended June 2, compared with expectations for an decrease of 3.5 million barrels, the first such increase in 10 weeks.  It came as refineries edged off record processing levels reached the week earlier, though U.S. refiners are still producing at a very high rate. The data surprised analysts, and undercut the belief that inventories were finally showing steady progress toward drawing down to seasonal averages. U.S. crude futures fell sharply, dropping more than 4 percent to $46.12 a barrel as of 11:04 a.m. ET.   Crude, gasoline and distillates inventories are all at or above the top of their five-year ranges; supply remains plentiful,  said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky.  Gasoline stocks rose by 3.3 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 580,000 barrels gain. Gasoline blendstock futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell about 4 percent after the data was released.   Normally, gasoline stocks are supposed to decline at this time of the year due to strong demand,  said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, Germany. Refinery crude runs fell by 283,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed, to 17.2 million barrels per day, from the previous week's record 17.5 million bpd rate. Refinery utilization rates fell by 0.9 percentage points to 94.1 percent, which is still seasonally strong. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 1.4 million barrels, the EIA said. U.S. exports were also down sharply, though that figure tends to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis. Overall exports fell to 557,000 bpd from a record 1.3 million bpd the week previous. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 4.4 million barrels, versus expectations for a 281,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

Some 50,000 people have been arrested since the failed putsch in July and around 150,000 dismissed or suspended, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Authorities detained the soldiers in raids focused on the central Turkish province of Konya and 32 other provinces, the Hurriyet daily said. Separately, the state-run Anadolu Agency said detention orders had been issued for 128 people with ties to the publishing company Kaynak Holding, which was linked to the Gulen movement before authorities seized it. Hundreds of firms like Kaynak, many of them smaller provincial businesses, were seized by authorities in the post-coup crackdown and are now run by government-appointed administrators. Of the 128 people being sought, Anadolu said 39 people had been detained so far in an operation carried out in Istanbul and seven other provinces. There was no official comment on the detentions. Amnesty Chair Detained On Tuesday, authorities detained the local chair of Amnesty International, Taner Kilic, and 22 other lawyers in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir for suspected links to Gulen's network, the rights group said. Salil Shetty, head of Amnesty International, told Reuters in an interview that the organization was calling for the release of Taner and the 22 lawyers, and said they should be provided with the necessary legal support.  It's a very non-transparent operation the way in which they function,  he said, referring to Turkish authorities.  We don't see a direct connection with Amnesty International on this issue, it's a much broader problem.  Shetty said it was not clear what evidence Turkish authorities had against Taner that would link him to Gulen's network, but added Amnesty International was fighting the decision.

The euro was down 0.11 percent to $1.1263, after having fallen to a low of $1.1205, its lowest since Friday. Bloomberg, citing unnamed euro zone officials, said the central bank's staff forecasts for inflation for the next three years had been cut to 1.5 percent, from 1.7 percent, 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively in March. Those have still to be approved by the two-day meeting of the Governing Council, the report said, but, if true, would be a signal of a softer line than many in currency and bond markets have been expecting. The ECB declined to comment on the report.  That would suggest that it would be very difficult for the rate hawks on the governing council to force through an early departure from the very accommodative policy that the ECB is pursuing right now,  said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said. The common currency has strengthened against the dollar over the last few months, benefiting from broad greenback weakness but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018. The euro pared losses after a Reuters report cited sources as saying that the ECB is likely to nudge up its forecasts for economic growth in the euro zone even as it trims its inflation estimates. This mixed outlook should strengthen the case for keeping the ECB's aggressive stimulus policy of massive bond purchases and sub-zero rates in place. The dollar steadied after having hit a near seven-month low on Tuesday, largely because of nerves over the pace of U.S. growth and government policy that have cut U.S. Treasury yields to the lowest since November. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.02 percent at 96.614. Against the yen, the greenback was down 0.06 percent to 109.33 yen. Traders remained cautious before Thursday's election in Britain, which some worry may be far closer than some opinion polls indicate, and the U.S. Senate testimony of James Comey, the former FBI chief sacked by President Donald Trump in May. Sterling was up 0.39 percent to $1.2957, staying near seven-month highs as investors increasingly take the view that Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party will win a majority in parliament.

He was a noted collector along with his wife, Peggy, who pre-deceased him. In 2007, a Mark Rothko painting he bought in 1960 for less than $10,000 was auctioned for more than $72 million. Many other works in their world-class collection were handed down over generations. The collection comprises impressionist, post-impressionist and modern works of art, as well as American paintings, English and European furniture, Asian art, European ceramics and Chinese  porcelain, silver, and American decorative arts and furniture. Beneficiaries of the proceeds include Harvard University, the Museum of Modern Art, the Council on Foreign Relations, the   American Farmland Trust, the Maine Coast Heritage Trust and the  Mount Desert Land and Garden Preserve. For years Rockefeller served as chairman for Rockefeller University, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Americas Society/Council of the Americas and The Museum of Modern Art.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage requests for home purchases rose 10 percent to 261.9 in the week ended June 2. That was the highest since 263.6 in the week of May 2, 2010. The jump in purchase loan applications raised the prospects of a possible rebound in home sales, which have weakened the past couple of months due to tight inventories. Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.14 percent, the lowest since the week of Nov. 11, from 4.17 percent the prior week. Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK). Average rates on other types of 30-year loans the MBA tracks were 0.02 to 0.03 percentage point lower than the preceding week. Home borrowing costs have fallen in step with bond yields as recent data raised doubts whether inflation would climb to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal in the foreseeable future. The drop in mortgage rates also revived activity in mortgage refinancing. MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to refinance an existing home loan rose 3.4 percent last week to 1,368.7.

The Serb, who turned 30 last month, will drop outside the top two for the first time since march 2011 on Monday -- quite a contrast to a year ago when his domination of men's tennis was complete after winning the French Open for the first time. Since then he has bagged only two titles and in grand slam there has been a worrying decline. After losing to Stan Wawrinka in the U.S. Open final he suffered a second-round defeat at the Australian Open to 117th-ranked Denis Istomin. On Wednesday, with a 32nd grand slam semi-final looming, he fell apart against Thiem, losing 7-6(5) 6-3 6-0.  You know, it's obviously tough to get out of it and figure out the way how to move ahead,  Djokovic, who appeared to give up against Thiem in a 20-minute third set, told reporters.  At least I'm trying. You know, I'm trying to get better, trying to be on a high level again.  For me, it's a whole new situation that I'm facing, especially in the last seven, eight months, not winning any tournament, which hasn't happened in many years.  All the top players have been through it. So I guess you've got to go through it, learn your lessons and figure out the way. It's a big challenge, but I'm up for it.  Djokovic split with Boris Becker toward the end of last year as his number one ranking was about to disappear. Last month he then parted company with his long-term coaching team of Marian Vajda, fitness coach Gebhard Phil Gritsch and physio Miljan Amanovic, saying he needed to try and rediscover his spark. Shortly before setting out to try and defend the French Open he announced that he had got together with eight-time major champion Andre Agassi, although the American was only in Paris for a week and missed Djokovic's defeat by Thiem. Djokovic said he hoped his relationship with Agassi, who famously recovered from a slump to win several majors after his 30th birthday, would help him return to form.  Don't put Andre in the midst of this. This final set, of course, that's all me,  Djokovic said.  As I have mentioned before several times when you guys ask me about his influence and impact on my game, it's gonna take time.  It's not something that comes out in the first week. We have spent seven days together. We just got to know each other.  Obviously he didn't want to give me too much information when the tournament started. We will see where it takes us.  Djokovic's defeat, his first before the semis in Paris since 2010, was all the more shocking as he beat Austrian sixth seed Thiem 6-1 6-0 in Rome a few weeks ago. On a windy Court Suzanne Lenglen after Thiem saved two set points in the opener, his game became littered with errors.  I'm feeling like I'm missing consistency. I play a great match or two in a row, and then I play a completely opposite match. That's what happened today,  said Djokovic.  Just not feeling it.

That important caveat depends primarily on whether Athens can agree a good enough debt deal with the euro zone and International Monetary Fund next week, so the ECB, which meets on Thursday, is convinced to come on board. It remains enough of an uncertainty that officials involved in the talks are reluctant to call the outcome. Bankers though have been quietly sounding out investors for what would be Greece's first return to markets since 2014. The response has convinced Athens, which still has public debt ratio of 180 percent of GDP and an economy which is barely growing, to go ahead if the conditions are right.  A return to the markets with a five-year bond should be with yields below five percent,  said a Greek government official who requested anonymity. Greece's five-year yield is currently somewhere around 5.9 percent according to Reuters data. Bond market investors estimate though that that could drop somewhere between 0.75 of a percentage point to 1.5 percentage points if the ECB does start buying Greek debt. Its borrowing costs usually fall after debt deals anyway reut.rs/2s3I2mF. They also point to how Portugal's 10-year bond spread to Germany shrank 1.4 percentage points when the ECB was preparing to first launch its QE programme.  We still think you are about 75 basis points away from a point where you can start to have that dialogue about Greece returning to the market,  said BlueBay Asset Management's Mark Dowding, whose firm owns Greek debt.  But I think that (ECB signalling it will buy Greek bonds) could certainly be a catalyst that would push yields into that zone.  While the ECB would be important as a backstop for investors in case things soured again in Greece, the actual amount of Greek bonds it could buy at the moment are relatively small. Greek sources suggest it would be 2-3 billion euros this year. That is roughly 10 percent of the 28 billion  tradable  Greek government bond market according to Societe Generale, although the bank itself thinks the ECB may actually struggle to buy anything for a while. The central bank can't buy more than a third of the bonds issued by any country and it still holds more than 10 billion euros worth of Greek paper it bought back in 2010-2011, during the early phase of the euro crisis.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage requests for home purchases rose 10 percent to 261.9 in the week ended June 2. That was the highest since 263.6 in the week of May 2, 2010. The jump in purchase loan applications raised the prospects of a possible rebound in home sales, which have weakened the past couple of months due to tight inventories. Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.14 percent, the lowest since the week of Nov. 11, from 4.17 percent the prior week. Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK). Average rates on other types of 30-year loans the MBA tracks were 0.02 to 0.03 percentage point lower than the preceding week. Home borrowing costs have fallen in step with bond yields as recent data raised doubts whether inflation would climb to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal in the foreseeable future. The drop in mortgage rates also revived activity in mortgage refinancing. MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to refinance an existing home loan rose 3.4 percent last week to 1,368.7.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) had said it did not plan further measures after prices of some heart stents were cut in February by 75 percent, part of a government push to make life-saving drugs and devices more affordable. But a letter to the health ministry sent in March, which has not previously been made public, shows the regulator pushed to get four more devices on the  essential medicines  list that would allow the government to impose price caps if and when it was ready to do so. After the February move, Medtronic PLC and Abbott Laboratories tried to withdraw some of their stents - wire mesh structures used to treat blocked arteries - but their request was rejected. Boston Scientific Corp sought to have the price cap raised, but a government panel turned down their plea.   According to the March letter seen by Reuters, NPPA Chairman Bhupendra Singh said the essential medicines list - comprised of more than 350 items, most of them drugs - should include balloons, cardiac catheters, and covered as well as peripheral stents,  as soon as possible .  These devices are used in the treatment of heart ailments or to open blocked blood vessels elsewhere in the body. Singh's office did not respond to an email seeking comment on Tuesday.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has pushed to make healthcare more affordable in India by trying to curb prices on drugs used to treat critical ailments such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and diabetes.            Global industry group AdvaMed, which counts the world's leading medical-technology companies among its members, on Wednesday criticized price controls as limiting patients' access to the latest technology.  Instead of putting price curbs, the government must introduce scientific, alternative & really meaningful measures to provide affordable and quality healthcare,  the group's India office said in a statement to Reuters. In Singh's letter in March, he said that hospitals appeared to be compensating for the lower stent prices by charging more for other procedures and devices.  It has been found that after the price control of cardiac stents several hospitals have increased the various 'procedure charges' in order to compensate for their losses,  Singh said in the letter, without elaborating on how the discovery was made.  In some cases the cost of balloons and catheters have been charged at (a) much higher level than the cost of (the) stent itself,  he wrote. A health ministry official who asked not to be named confirmed the regulator had made the request but played down its significance on the grounds the list of essential medicines was unlikely to be reviewed in the next 1-2 years.   After the stent price move, Boston Scientific asked the government for the price cap on its high-end Synergy stents, which was set at $450, to be raised to around $1,160, down from its earlier cost of around $3,000 but still well above the $750 it costs to import the device. The medical industry has argued that price control measures would affect future investment plans in India. Boston Scientific, for example, uses India as a research base to develop products for emerging markets.  The Medical Technology Association of India said in a statement on Wednesday that  any desire to extend the ambit of price control  to other devices should be referred to India's Medical Technology Assessment Board, another government body. The domestic medical device market in India is expected to grow by 15 percent annually between 2014 and 2020 to $8.6 billion, according to a joint report by consultants Deloitte and Healthcare Federation of India, NATHEALTH.

The German carmaker has drawn over €11bn of combined orders for a dual-tranche €3.5bn hybrid. The deal marks a further step in VW's rehabilitation in the international capital markets and comes three months after it issued its first euro senior unsecured transaction since the scandal broke.  The price and size that VW has achieved today is remarkable,  a lead banker said.  We had some investors who are still nervous about the credit, but despite the risks, we had so many accounts placing orders. VW has been out of the market for so long until recently investors want to build back their positions.  The company is poised to issue a €1.5bn perpetual non-call 5.5-year bond at a yield of 2.75% and a €2bn perpetual non-call 10 year note at 3.875%. Initial price talk was 3% area and 4.125%-4.25% respectively. VW is the latest blue-chip corporate to take advantage of benign funding conditions, which negated any concerns that investors might have of further reprisals against the company from US authorities because of the scandal.  The market is in such good shape, and there's a feeling of borrowers wanting to accelerate some of their funding plans,  the lead said. The banker added that VW wanted to issue ahead of several event risks on Thursday, including the UK's general election, an ECB meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to Congress. Luring Funding Costs The company had signalled its intention to issue a hybrid this year - its first since March 2015 - in an investor call ahead of its March trade. The hybrid market has looked brighter in recent months after taking a knock last year due to fears of changing rating agency methodologies and soaring funding costs.  The market is in such good shape. Costs for the product has come right down so it's a great time for borrowers, while investors have had such little supply lately it's now in high demand,  the banker said. That enabled VW to issue at a minimal concession at final pricing, with bankers pegging it at 10bp, and investors around zero.  I'm disappointed. Yet again they've been greedy,  one investor said.  We pulled our order this morning on the lack of value, plus VW's senior paper issued in March has been quite volatile since pricing. Clearly VW paper is not in the same type of investor hands as before the crisis.  The final levels mean the bonds came about 210bp back of VW's senior paper, in line with other corporates' hybrid differentials. Like its senior euro transaction issued in March and its previous hybrids, the deal will also be issued using a standalone prospectus, which typically allows more flexibility given fears over further disclosures, bankers said.  This deal has 100k denominations, which tells you that they don't want to get retail investors involved in the risks,  one investor said. Prior to its crisis, Volkswagen was one of Europe's most frequent corporate senior and hybrid bond issuers. But after being locked out of the market for 18-months it is now ramping its funding back up. Volkswagen attracted €25bn of demand for its €8bn multi-tranche bond in March. It then sold a £850m dual-tranche transaction in April. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (B&D;), Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and MUFG are lead managers. The bonds are expected to be rated Baa2 by Moody's and BBB- by S&P.; The issuer is Volkswagen International Finance NV with Volkswagen AG acting as guarantor. The guarantor's senior ratings are A3/BBB+ (both negative outlook). (Reporting By Laura Benitez)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/vw-gets-back-into-gear-with-sought-after-idUSL8N1J43JN"},

In addition, several U.S. B-1B heavy bombers have arrived in Britain in support of two separate multinational exercises planned in the Baltic region and other parts of Europe this month to improve coordination among partner countries. The U.S. military plans were announced by Stuttgart-based U.S. European Command, which said this year's Saber Guardian exercise - held annually in the Black Sea region since 2013 - was  larger in both scale and scope  than previous exercises. The news could exacerbate tensions that are already running high between Moscow and Washington. Russia scrambled a fighter jet on Tuesday to intercept a nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 strategic bomber it said was flying over the Baltic Sea near its border, in an incident that had echoes of the Cold War.  Washington said the long-range bomber was operating in international airspace. European Command said the Saber Guardian exercise would include an array of live fire exercises, river crossings and a mass casualty exercise and was aimed at drilling  the ability to mass forces at any given time anywhere in Europe .  It is deterrence in action,  it said in a release.  The U.S. army said the larger exercise would be preceded by several smaller events - all aimed at shoring up the security and stability of the Black Sea region, where increased Russian submarine activity has sparked concerns. The Saber Guardian exercise rotates through Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, with a goal to increase the ability of European and U.S. military forces to operate together in the event of an armed conflict. It will be the largest of 18 separate Black Sea exercises planned this year, European Command said. The B-1B bombers were deployed from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota to a UK air base in Fairford to support two separate exercises planned this month, Saber Strike and BALTOPS, according to European Command.  It said an undisclosed number of B-1B bombers would join three B-52H bombers that were already in Europe for training. BALTOPS is a recurring multinational exercise that will involve 4,000 shipboard personnel, 50 ships and submarines and more than 50 aircraft.  Saber Strike, now in its seventh year, is aimed at improving cooperation among allies and partners while promoting regional stability and security, European Command said.

The center-left SPD, junior party in Merkel's current right-left coalition, hopes its pension plans will help put the issue of social justice at the heart of the election, though it has not weighed very heavily so far among voters. The SPD has lost the momentum it gained after first nominating former European Parliament chief Martin Schulz in January as its candidate for chancellor to run against Merkel. A poll on Wednesday showed the conservatives' lead over the SPD had widened to 15 points.    Schulz said his party wanted to preserve the level of pensions at 48 percent of an average salary until 2030. Pensions are projected to fall to 44.7 percent of wages by 2030 as the government tries to rein in costs as the population ages.     The party also aims to cap contributions, equally divided between workers and employers, at 21.8 percent of salary by 2030 from 18.7 percent.   We want to ensure dignity in old age,  Schulz told reporters, promising to keep the retirement age at 67. The extra cost for these commitments would be paid for by making some three million self-employed people pay contributions, increasing the contributions faster and lifting funding from tax to 15.3 billion euros in 2030 from 14.5 billion euros now.  However, the radical Left party attacked the plans for not going far enough.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.  REUTERS TOP 75 The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.  MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 75   Compare Institutions | Methodology Powering Innovation in Asia – 2017 KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.  Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST's Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense's DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.  The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.  South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.  Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016.Kim Hong-JiOverall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)  Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.  And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.  Slideshow (3 Images)To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution's ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.  This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).  The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.  Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world's most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it's important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it's still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems installed 365 turbines at Lake Turkana in the hot desert north of the east African country in March, completing construction in less than a year and two months ahead of schedule. The project, which will add 310 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, is located in one of Africa's windiest places. Costing 70 billion Kenyan shillings ($678 million), it is the country's largest single private investment and closely watched by investors looking for opportunities in African renewable energy. The wind farm had planned to begin producing power this month, but construction of the transmission line to the power grid, being built by state-run Kenya Transmission Company (KetraCo), has been delayed.  The challenge is now to get the wind farms connected to the grid and that is indeed a project which is not with us,  head of Vestas' Central European and sub-Saharan business Nils de Baar told Reuters at the Africa Energy Forum in Copenhagen.  The expectation is that it will happen in early 2018,  he said, adding that the project is Vestas' largest-ever in terms of the number of wind turbines being installed. The 428 km powerline from Loiyangalani in northern Kenya to Suswa in the centre of the country was due to be completed by October last year, but demands for compensation from landowners along the route and other issues have delayed it. KetraCo is targeting completion of the transmission line in August, an official with the company said Wednesday. An official at Kenya Power, owner and operator of the electricity transmission system, also stressed the company intends to honour its agreement and is working to identify a number of issues regarding compensation to the developer. The Lake Turkana consortium consists of KP&P; Africa, Aldwych International, Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation, Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Sandpiper and Vestas. Once completed, Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, will acquire Vestas' 12.5 percent stake in the project. Once in operation, the Turkana Lake wind farm is expected to provide 15 percent of Kenya's total electricity needs. The east African nation relies heavily on geothermal and hydro power for its electricity supply. The project had originally been due to start generating power in June 2011, but faced delays securing financing and construction did not start until 2014. Despite an abundance of funding, investments in renewable energy in Africa are only developing slowly due to problems with bureaucracy and infrastructure. Still, Vestas said Wednesday it hopes to announce new wind farm projects in Morocco and West Africa  very soon . Last year, it secured just one order on the continent, a 120 MW project in Morocco, and delivered a 181 MW project in South Africa.

Last week, Triunfo filed a lawsuit at the 5th Civil Court of Brasilia against transportation industry watchdog ANTT, claiming it breached terms of a licensing contract to build and operate a tranche of the BR-040 highway, the people said. According to the people, the agency must have automatically lengthened Triunfo's road concession after the government missed payments on the project. Both the company and government agencies discussed contractual terms of the BR-040 project, which includes construction of Brazil's longest highway tunnel in Rio de Janeiro state, for three years. In the lawsuit, Triunfo seeks a reimbursement of a minimum 262 million reais ($80 million) and court permission to stop work on the project until contractual terms are fine-tuned, the people said. The situation reflects mounting legal and operational risks facing infrastructure companies in Brazil, where the government has for decades proved to be an onerous and sometimes mercurial partner, the people said. One of them said delays and contractual problems in the BR-040 project are responsible for heavy cash burn at toll road unit Concer and, ultimately, a Triunfo default on an 800 million-real loan from state development bank BNDES last year. BNDES said last week that it had started foreclosure procedures on the loan. São Paulo-based Triunfo declined to comment. The media office of Brasilia-based ANTT did not have an immediate comment. The sources could not be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Over the past couple of months, Triunfo and creditors have discussed ways to allow the company to keep cash from potential asset sales while downsizing further, sources told Reuters on May 11. An accord would prevent BNDES and other Triunfo creditors from tapping proceeds from Triunfo's divestitures to get their loans repaid immediately. Without an agreement with creditors, Triunfo could see potential asset sales at jeopardy. Reuters reported on March 27 that MSC Mediterranean Shipping was likely to exercise a right of first refusal to buy Triunfo's stake in the PortoNave port terminal for an equivalent of 12 times expected operational earnings. Apart from PortoNave, Triunfo is looking to sell stakes in Brazil's Viracopos international airport and a hydropower dam. Triunfo borrowed heavily in recent years to participate on a massive infrastructure investment plan that collapsed as Brazil's worst recession ever eroded public finances. $1 = 3.2773 reais Editing by Daniel Flynn, Bernard Orr","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/tpi-triunfo-part-restructuring-lawsuit-idUSL1N1J31JG"},

The deposits lie around Cinovec, a village with a tradition of mining since the 14th century and situated near the border with Germany, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of Europe's bid to build electric cars and develop battery technology. The resource, a term used for a deposit whose extent has yet to be proven by exploration, could amount to 1.3 million tonnes, or about 3 percent of the global lithium stock, according to the Czech Geological Survey. That would rank the Czech Republic behind Chile, China, Argentina, Australia and other nations with bigger lithium reserves. But surging global demand and hungry European industry are sparking international interest in the Czech deposits. Australia's European Metals, which bought exploration rights around Cinovec in 2012 and wants to start mining by 2019, said the resource could yield 20,800 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate, the processed ore that is sold to customers. Global demand is expected to rise three-fold to 535,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2025 from 2015, due to the boom in electric cars and electricity storage that has added to demand from making mobile phone batteries, Deutsche Bank said.  European Metals has dug exploratory shafts and plans to spend $393 million to develop the site near Cinovec, a village surrounded by forests and meadows and showing scars of surface mining for lignite that once employed many people in the area. The region now has the Czech Republic's highest jobless rate.  The permitting process is going along as it should be, everything is happening in an orderly fashion,  European Metals Managing Director Keith Coughlan told Reuters. The company has signed a memorandum on supply of lithium ore to HE3DA, a Czech startup battery producer.  HE3DA can be one of the biggest consumers,  HE3DA chief executive and founder Jan Prochazka told Reuters. Local Support A worker of Geomet company shows ore samples containing lithium at the company's office in the town of Dubi, Czech Republic, May 2, 2017.  Picture taken May 2, 2017.David W CernyThere are also other potential clients nearby. Daimler, owner of Mercedes-Benz, began construction in May of its second factory for lithium batteries, worth about 500 million euros, in Kamenz, a German town 90 km (56 miles) from Cinovec. Tesla Motors Inc. has also announced plans to build another  Gigafactory  for batteries, possibly in Europe, to match its plant in Nevada, the United States. European Metals still has steps to take before it can develop the mining site at Cinovec. It has to apply for permits from the State Mining Administration (SMA), a process that could last more than a year, an SMA spokesman said. It also needs approval from the Environment Ministry, which would consider any objections from nearby municipalities, although local communities have indicated they support the plan. Slideshow (6 Images) It would be a contribution to our town,  said Mayor Petr Pipal of Dubi, the municipality that includes Cinovec. Other companies are also showing interest in the resource.  Cinovecka Deponie, a unit of privately-owned Czech investment group RSJ, won permits to extract lithium from tailings left around Cinovec from past tin mining. It did not offer further details when contacted by Reuters. Albright Stonebridge Group, co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, made enquiries to the regional authorities about possible lithium extraction, Czech media reported. The group did not respond to Reuters queries. One challenge for miners is that ore around Cinovec contains relatively small amounts of lithium. Jaromir Stary, an expert at the Czech Geological Survey, said it contains four times less lithium in its ore than at the Greenbushes mine in Australia. But European Metals is undeterred. Its pre-feasibility study in April estimated costs at $3,483 per tonne of lithium carbonate, a level it said would ensure it could turn a profit. It said the magnetic-sensitive nature of Cinovec's ore makes processing cheaper than other types. Spot battery grade 99.5 percent lithium carbonate in China, where most lithium batteries are manufactured, now trades around 140,000 yuan ($20,575.53) per tonne, after a peak of about 171,000 yuan last year.

Spurred by Britain's decision to leave the European Union and pressure from the United States, Brussels has seized on deeper military ties proposed last year by France and Germany to show its citizens the bloc can still provide security in the face of Islamist militant attacks and a resurgent Russia.  Defence and security is one of the fields through which we can re-launch the European Union,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a news conferences. Failings in Europe's bombing campaign in Libya in 2011, when the United States had to step in with refuelling planes, and Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea have reignited EU defence plans that date back to the 1950s but have remained elusive. Britain had long blocked EU defence integration and France's Defence Minister Sylvie Goulard said on Wednesday now was the time to act:  This is a turning point to better share the costs, but also the defence capacities,  she said in a statement. Although the European Union has more than a dozen military missions abroad, the world's biggest trading bloc has never been able to match its economic might with broad defensive power, preferring to rely on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. But U.S. President Donald Trump's sharp criticism of European allies for low defence spending and his refusal to fully back the alliance added to concerns that without Washington and London, the European Union was vulnerable to a host of threats, from cyber to militant attacks. A year since proposals on an  European Defence Union  from Paris and Berlin, the European Commission said it was willing to provide money from the EU's common budget for the first time for defence. The Commission said it would also create a fund to reverse billions of euros in defence cuts to let governments club together to develop and buy new helicopters and planes at lower costs, also opening the door to new drones, cyber warfare systems and other hi-tech gear. The plan still needs to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament, where a German leftist lawmaker, Sabine Losing, was critical:  The EU Defence Fund is taking a fatally-flawed direction.   The defence industry might be pleased as punch to hear that - but it’s a dark day for those of us who are working towards a peaceful and social European Union 5.5 Bln Euro Fund? While the amounts of money depend on EU governments' willingness to collaborate, the Commission said it would put forward at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) a year from the bloc's budget for the research and purchase of assets. That could generate some 5.5 billion euros a year after 2020 if enough governments come forward with funds, EU officials said, stressing that national governments would remain the owners of all equipment. German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the plan.  It is ambitious and shows how far we have gone over the last 12 months in establishing a defence and security union,  she said in a statement, calling for more such steps. Defence research spending in the EU has fallen by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006. While the European Union spends about half as much as the United States on researching and producing weapons, it only has about 15 percent of the assets that Washington can deploy on the battlefield. EU governments champion national companies, often leading to duplication and wasted funds, according to EU data. In 80 percent of cases, governments award defence contracts to their own firms rather than use European consortiums. The European Union's defence fund idea is part of an emerging network of proposals that EU leaders are set to consider at a summit in Brussels on June 22-23. The European Union is setting up a military headquarters for training missions abroad and wants to make it easier to use its EU battlegroups that have never been deployed. Paris also wants to set up a system in which coalitions of willing EU countries come together to carry out and pay for military missions together, rather than leaving future peacekeeping operations to bigger countries such as France. The European Defence Agency, the body that helps EU governments develop their military capabilities, has also proposed a separate fund made up of EU states' public money that would aim to work on smaller, collaborative projects.

Recent attempts by federal, provincial and local governments to cool the housing market through various measures, so far have not dampened prices and risks may escalate for banks, though given healthy capital levels a modest correction would be manageable,  added Gamboa. The big six Canadian banks still dominate the housing sector and Fitch does not see this changing even with the rise of the nonbank mortgage sector. Currently, nonbank mortgage companies account for 13% of the $1.4 trillion mortgage market. With eyes on Home Capital Group (HCG), the largest alternative mortgage lender, Fitch notes that the liquidity issues are specific to its business model and current credit measures do not suggest asset quality problems.  It's unlikely that nonbank mortgage companies will dominate the housing sector anytime soon as the tightening of CMHC mortgage insurance rules implemented in October 2016 impacted a significant funding source for mortgage companies,  concluded Gamboa.

The drug's success would be a much needed boost for Teva, Israel's biggest company and the world's largest generic drugmaker. Analysts have estimated it could generate at least $1 billion in sales annually. Teva's stock price has plummeted over the past few months after a series of costly acquisitions and delayed drug launches, while its best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone faces new generic competition. The new migraine treatment, fremanezumab, significantly reduced the amount of headaches suffered by patients during a phase III trial in episodic migraine prevention using both monthly and quarterly doses, Teva said. Teva also released positive results for the drug treating less-prevalent chronic migraines a week ago.  Teva plans to submit a Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fremanezumab later this year in both episodic and chronic migraine with anticipated approval and launch in the second half of 2018,  it said. Its shares, which hit a decade low last month, were up 0.6 percent in early trading in New York on Wednesday. Teva as well as companies such as Amgen Inc, Eli Lilly Co and Alder BioPharmaceuticals Inc are developing similar drugs to target calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, a protein involved in pain-signalling during migraine. The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each company's drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts have forecast. This could help to offset an expected blow to Teva which faces new generic competition to Copaxone. About 40 million Americans suffer from migraine - intense headache characterized by throbbing pain and sensitivity to light and nausea. The condition, which can last for days, is incurable.

It's not that he lost but the manner in which he lost,  said one fan on the B92 website's (www.b92.net) message board after the effervescent Thiem swept aside the former world number one and defending Roland Garros champion 7-6 (5) 6-3 6-0.  His career has plummeted since he won last year's French Open and now constitutes an ordeal of a passionless competitor.   Another supporter pulled no punches in echoing his views on Djokovic's current form.   Novak has disintegrated into a million pieces,  he said. Djokovic, who is now assured of losing the number two spot in the ATP rankings, has suffered a dramatic dip in form since winning his maiden French Open title last year, the last of his overall 12 grand slam honours. In December, he parted company with coach Boris Becker who helped him to six grand slam titles during his three-year stint with the Serb, who also dismissed the rest of his backroom staff last month with the exception of Spaniard Pepe Imaz. Former player Imaz, described as a  spiritual guru  was the squad's only survivor to welcome the arrival of Andre Agassi, who teamed up with Djokovic shortly before the French Open. But Agassi left midway through the tournament due to what Djokovic had described as prior personal arrangements and the 30-year old from Belgrade was blown away by Thiem after beating Spaniard Albert Ramos Vinolas in his mentor's absence. Many Serbian fans feel that Djokovic has hit his lowest ebb since turning professional in 2003 and few were confident that he would return to the pinnacle.  The only positive Djokovic can draw from his crushing defeat by Thiem is that he can't play any worse than he is doing at the moment,  said a disenchanted supporter. One who introduced himself as an  ex Nole fan  added:  Novak no longer strikes fear into the hearts of anyone on tour. He's become a punching bag.

Markets will also be focused on former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday before a Senate panel probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  We're basically battening down the hatches before all the event risks tomorrow,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.  There's plenty to move the market and I don't think anybody has a strong grasp of how things will play out,  he added. The ECB is widely expected to keep its policy unchanged on Thursday, including its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying program, and pledge to keep interest rates low. But sources told Reuters last week the ECB will acknowledge the improved economic outlook by removing a reference to  downside risks  in its statement. Comey, on the other hand, will likely hold back in his testimony from accusing President Donald Trump of trying to interfere with an investigation into possible links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russian officials, Reuters quoted legal sources as saying. Trump fired Comey on May 9 in a shock move that heightened scrutiny of the matter. Britain's elections are also on the market's radar, as they could determine whether the country has a smooth or hard exit from the European Union. A majority victory for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May would ensure a smooth transition out of the EU, analysts said. Opinion polls have shown May's lead over the opposition Labor party narrow over the last three weeks, with some even suggesting she could fall short of a majority government. Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York, however, said the impact of the events on Thursday seem to have been  downgraded to neutral,  which should reverse some of the flight-to-quality trades in the market this week. In mid-morning trading, U.S. 10-year Treasuries were last down 4/32 in price, with yields at 2.160 percent, from 2.147 percent late on Tuesday. U.S. 30-year bonds fell 9/32 in price, yielding 2.824 percent, compared with Tuesday's 2.81 percent. U.S. two-year yields, on the other hand, were at 1.310 percent, from 1.298 percent late on Tuesday.

The move could mean substantial delays in a full deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea, as the environmental review may take well over a year according to a senior official at the presidential Blue House. South Korea said last week that four more launchers had been introduced for the anti-missile defence system, months after the controversial battery was deployed in March with just two of its maximum load of six launchers. The additional launchers had been brought in to the deployment site in the southeastern region of Seongju without being reported to the new government or to the public, new President Moon Jae-in's office said last week, asking for a probe into why it was not informed of the move by South Korea's defence ministry. The four launchers have yet to be installed and made operational.  It doesn't make sense to withdraw the two initial launchers which had already been deployed and installed, but additional installation will be decided after the environmental impact assessment is over,  the administration official told reporters on Wednesday.  Whether we must urgently move forward with additional instalment by ignoring legal transparency and due procedure is a question.  The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. U.S. defence company Lockheed Martin Corp is the lead contractor for the THAAD system. During his successful election campaign, Moon had pledged to review the previous South Korean government's decision to deploy THAAD, saying that the deployment was rushed without assessing its environmental impact or seeking parliamentary approval. Moon's decision to order an investigation into the THAAD deployment came amid signs of easing tensions between South Korea and China, which is North Korea's sole major diplomatic ally. The decision to deploy the system in South Korea was made by Moon's conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and thrown from office in a corruption scandal that engulfed South Korea's business and political elite. Moon took office on May 10 without a transition period because a snap presidential election was held just two months after Park was ousted. He inherited her defence minister, along with the rest of the cabinet, and has yet to name his own. Moon has said his order for the probe at the defence ministry was purely a domestic measure and was not aimed at stopping the deployment of THAAD, which has drawn angry protests from China. North Korea has conducted three ballistic missile tests since Moon took office, maintaining its accelerated pace of missile and nuclear-related activities since the beginning of last year in defiance of U.N. sanctions and U.S. pressure.

The deal comes just four days after Juve lost 4-1 to Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Cardiff, prompting speculation the manager might leave the Turin-based side. Allegri, greeted with scepticism and hostility by the fans when he arrived at Juve three years ago, has won three league and cup doubles in as many seasons and has also led them to two Champions League finals, although they lost both.  Today's agreement extends a working relationship that has seen (Juventus) consolidate their position as Italy's top team and also evolve into one of European football's major forces,  the club said in a statement on Wednesday.  Since being appointed manager in the summer of 2014, the Bianconeri have won three Serie A titles, three Coppa Italia trophies and one Italian Super Cup,  Juve added. Under Allegri, Juventus have won 84 of 114 Serie A matches, scoring 269 goals and conceding 71, the club added. Juventus have won Serie A six times in a row, the previous three under current Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. Allegri, a former midfielder who had a journeyman playing career, also won Serie A with AC Milan in 2011, although he was fired by the club in January 2014. He previously coached at Serie A side Cagliari, having started his career with fourth tier Aglianese in 2003.

The drug's success would be a much needed boost for Teva, Israel's biggest company and the world's largest generic drugmaker. Analysts have estimated it could generate at least $1 billion in sales annually. Teva's stock price has plummeted over the past few months after a series of costly acquisitions and delayed drug launches, while its best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone faces new generic competition. The new migraine treatment, fremanezumab, significantly reduced the amount of headaches suffered by patients during a phase III trial in episodic migraine prevention using both monthly and quarterly doses, Teva said. Teva also released positive results for the drug treating less-prevalent chronic migraines a week ago.  Teva plans to submit a Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fremanezumab later this year in both episodic and chronic migraine with anticipated approval and launch in the second half of 2018,  it said. Its shares, which hit a decade low last month, were up 0.6 percent in early trading in New York on Wednesday. Teva as well as companies such as Amgen Inc, Eli Lilly Co and Alder BioPharmaceuticals Inc are developing similar drugs to target calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, a protein involved in pain-signalling during migraine. The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each company's drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts have forecast. This could help to offset an expected blow to Teva which faces new generic competition to Copaxone. About 40 million Americans suffer from migraine - intense headache characterized by throbbing pain and sensitivity to light and nausea. The condition, which can last for days, is incurable.

New York City and State pension funds and the California Teachers' Retirement System are urging shareholders to vote on June 22 against Coury and five other directors because of the board's oversight of Coury's high pay package and issues related to its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment business and its deal-making. The investors, who hold 4.3 million shares, said Mylan walked away from a deal with rival Teva International Industries Ltd in 2015, causing shares to lose value. Mylan met with ISS on Monday and discussed the role of Coury in growing the company, according to the letter, and defended his compensation, which was more than $97 million in 2016. Mylan also defended its dealings with Teva, saying it  never  received an offer from the Israeli drugmaker. Teva said in an open letter in April 2015 it would pay $82 per share in cash and stock, and Coury responded in a letter to Teva that the offer was too low and that the starting point for discussions was $100 per share. Teva walked away in July 2015 after reaching a $40 billion deal for Allergan Plc's generic unit. Mylan shares rose 0.5 percent to $38.74 on Wednesday. Mylan has been the subject of federal and state investigations and agreed last fall to pay $465 million to settle U.S. Justice Department allegations it overcharged the government for EpiPens, although the agreement has not been finalized. Last week, a government agency put out a report saying that Mylan may have overcharged the government by $1.27 billion.

Zuma has survived calls to resign from sections of the ANC in recent months following a string of corruption scandals, waning public support and economic instability caused by a heavily-criticized cabinet reshuffle in March. Though Zuma can remain South African president until an election in 2019, senior ANC sources opposed to him have told Reuters they will push for his removal as head of state shortly after he steps down as party leader in December. ANC's top leadership, including Mantashe, have been critical of some of Zuma's decisions but have not publicly said they back proposals to remove him. Asked if it would be easier for Zuma's ANC opponents to remove him after the party conference, Mantashe told Reuters:  Yes, that's exactly the point I'm making. After December ... he will not be the president of the ANC, who by resolution should be president of the republic. It's less complex.  Mantashe gave as an example former president Thabo Mbeki who was recalled as head of state by the ANC in 2008, less than a year after he was ousted as party leader. Zuma is unpopular with most investors and the possibility of him leaving office before 2019 would be welcomed by markets. Corruption Backroom rifts within the ANC have been thrust into the open this week after more than 100,000 emails leaked to local media allegedly showed improper dealings in lucrative government contracts by business friends of Zuma. Zuma and the Gupta family, wealthy Indian-born businessmen whose companies have contracts with state-owned firms, have not commented, though they have denied similar allegations in the past. Reuters could not independently verify the new allegations. Mantashe said the allegations were damaging the reputation of the ANC and called for a judicial inquiry to investigate the influence of business interests in government. Zuma has not yet agreed to such an investigation.  It damages the ANC because we are the governing party. Many of the people cited there as beneficiaries of the Guptas are leaders of the ANC, so we're paying the price for that,  Mantashe said. The latest allegations of influence-peddling are deepening divides in the ANC as factions battle for control ahead of the December party conference.     Zuma has backed his ex-wife and former African Union chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to succeed him, while other ANC factions are supporting Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. Opposition parties have made upbeat comments about unseating the ANC in 2019, an unthinkable scenario a few years ago for a party that has led comfortably since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of white-minority rule in 1994. The ANC lost control of major cities last year in its worst local election results since coming to power, partly due to a drop in public support for Zuma.   When we go to the 2019 elections we will have a new face of the ANC. It doesn't matter whether he (Zuma) leaves after December or doesn't leave,  Mantashe said.  There is an inherent risk that you can win and equally a risk that you can lose. We take every election seriously.

During a meeting of euro zone finance ministers last month, Greece, its euro zone lenders and the IMF failed to agree on the debt relief measures to be implemented after its current bailout expires in 2018, mainly because of different growth assumptions. They are now aiming for a deal at a June 15 Eurogroup meeting. Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said growth incentives in the coming years, such as investment packages, could help bridge the differences and help  find the common ground needed for a comprehensive solution sought by all sides .  This is an issue which has engaged the current discussions and it may be the key to reach a deal, in other words to find the common ground among all sides on growth projections,  Tzanakopoulos said during a press briefing. He said the country's European lenders put Greece's average growth rate at 1.3 percent by 2060 and the IMF at 1 percent. Tzanakopoulos was optimistic that an agreement could be reached on June 15 but said discussions may continue until an EU summit on June 22. Some European countries, including Germany, are worried that concessions could affect the pace of economic reforms in Greece and want any debt relief put off until 2018. The IMF has said it will not participate financially in the country's latest bailout unless there is clarity on the matter. Greece passed more pension cuts and tax increases last month that will be implemented after 2018, in an effort to convince the IMF to participate in its current bailout, the third rescue package since 2010, and push for debt relief. Athens hopes that clarity on debt relief would help Greece qualify for the European Central Bank's quantitative easing programme, which in turn would allow it to return to bond markets as early as this summer. Greek debt stands at about 180 percent of its GDP, despite a 2012 haircut. In 2016, its lenders agreed in principle on further debt relief and promised to consider it depending on Greece's bailout progress.

A once thriving steel town in central England, Corby has backed the winning party in every British general election since 1983 and if Labour is to upset opinion polls which point to victory for May's Conservatives, this is the kind of parliamentary seat it needs to take. The town overwhelmingly backed leaving the European Union in last year's referendum, following a campaign when immigration became a central issue.  While Brexit negotiations have yet even to begin, a number of Corby residents told Reuters that national security has become their main worry since the militant attacks in London and Manchester - and some still link it to the immigration question. Voters were unimpressed with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran, anti-war campaigner who the Conservatives have tried to paint as soft on fighting terrorism. Corbyn has invited supporters of the Palestinian group Hamas to parliament, and advocated dialogue with Irish republicans who fought British forces in northern Ireland until the late 1990s, although he says he condemns political violence by all sides. Local residents, however, have little time for May either, even though the Conservatives have traditionally portrayed themselves as the party of law and order.   I am voting Conservative because I would never vote for Jeremy Corbyn, but May is also very weak on terrorism and is an indecisive leader without principles,  said Claire Soltzed, 61, who owns a boutique shop in the town's shopping mall.  In no way am I a May supporter, but she is the lesser of two evils.  The Corby parliamentary constituency has been hotly contested by the two main parties, changing hands five times since 1983. In 2015, the Conservatives won it by 2,412 votes and Labour has made it a top target this time round. In worrying increasingly about national security, Corby residents appear broadly typical of voters across Britain. After Saturday's attack in London in which eight people died, an Opinium poll showed 11 percent of respondents said anti-terrorism policy would influence their vote, up from just 2 percent last week. Britain Under Attack Once a destination for Scots who moved south to work in Corby's huge steelworks, large numbers of eastern European immigrants from countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria have arrived in the past decade. The surrounding rural areas remain affluent, but the steelworks have closed, to be replaced by retail chains and indoor shopping centers. Corby's main shopping street is now lined with discount stores. FILE PHOTO: Shoppers walk down Corporation Street in Corby, Britain, November 15, 2012.Eddie Keogh/File PhotoThe mix of immigration and the recent attacks now looms large for locals, although two of the three recent attacks were staged by British-born militants.  I hate Corbyn, he is a terrorist sympathizer,  said taxi driver Phil Andrews, who voted for the anti-EU UK Independence Party in 2015 but will be backing the Conservatives this time.  I voted for Brexit, I lived here for all my life and I think immigration is a big issue in this election. At one point Corby was called little Scotland, now it is called little Poland.  Butcher Susan Short, in her 50s, said:  My main issue is terror, there are a lot of immigrants in the UK and I worry about more terrorism.  Since May called the snap election in April, her lead in the polls has narrowed from more than 20 percentage points to single figures, suggesting that instead of a landslide, she might even struggle to win an overall parliamentary majority. May's own ratings have fallen significantly too and her record on security has come in for criticism as police numbers were reduced every year under her watch as interior minister from 2010-2016.  I do not like Theresa May. The last few weeks have shown how weak she is on terrorism,  said Mary Talbot, in her mid 50s, who works in a convenience store in Corby.  I did not think that it was a main issue until the last few weeks and now I am worried about my kids and about safety. May has cut police officers and made our country less secure.  William Wagner, in his 40s, who did voluntary work in the town, said he was still undecided on his vote but he was not going to back the Conservatives.  I hate Theresa May,  he said.  My main issue is terrorism. We need to stop it right away.  May's theme throughout the campaign has been that she would provide strong and stable leadership in contrast to Corbyn. Only last year he had to fend off a challenge to his leadership by  lawmakers in his own party who thought he was not up to the job. Anthony Smith, a 21-year-old a bar supervisor who supports Brexit, dismissed May's pitch for power.  She says one thing and then says something completely different. She's making promises she can't keep,  he said. Samantha Turner, 55, works in a corner shop, was equally scathing of Corbyn.  I am not voting Labour for the first time in a while,  she said.  Corbyn is weak and I do not trust him for the future of my kids. He will not make a good deal for Brexit.

The decision, which was announced in a Wednesday securities filing, sets lower prices for smaller quantities of liquefied petroleum gas sold in domestic markets. For industrial LPG, Petrobras will follow Brazil's National Energy Policy Council's guidelines seeking higher prices. Final prices for LPG stored in cylinders of less than 13 kilograms and sold to Brazilian households will correspond to the average of butane and propane prices in European markets plus a 5 percent markup. The move will spark a 6.7 percent average household increase starting on Thursday, with consumer prices rising an estimated 2.2 percent. Chief Executive Pedro Parente sought to allay concern that the move would mark a comeback of state meddling in Petrobras' pricing decisions, noting that the markup is enough to reverse years of government-mandated subsidies. Brazil's federal government controls Petrobras, which for years was used as a policy tool to tame inflation and boost growth. The move to adjust pricing in the LPG market helped Petrobras conclude a year-long effort to peg domestic fuel costs to global prices. During the tenure of the left-wing Workers Party, between 2003 and 2016, Petrobras booked hefty losses for heavily subsidizing fuel prices in Brazil.  I don't think this rule aims to stop us from reversing the losses that the company incurred in this market for years,  Parente told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. Prices for so-called GLP-P13 natural gas will be revised at the fifth day of every month, the company said. Preferred shares, the company's most widely traded class of stock, gained 0.8 percent to 13.28 reais in early trading on Wednesday.

Owners of Popular bonds faces losses of some 2 billion euros, while Santander will ask its shareholders for around 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of capital to absorb Spain's sixth biggest bank.  Popular's rescue was unveiled as the European Central Bank announced the lender was set to be wound down, echoing a banking crash some five years ago that cost Spain 40 billion euros. Santander's takeover of the bank, which has been weighed down by risky property loans, for a nominal one euro marks the first use of a stricter European Union regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the financial crisis. The sale was organized in less than 24 hours, and followed a recent acceleration in the withdrawal of deposits, which two people with knowledge of the matter said had in recent weeks hit 18 billion euros, equivalent to almost one quarter of the total. A final decision to sell Popular was made at about 0430 GMT on Wednesday, Dominique Laboureix, a member of the Single Resolution Board, told a news conference in Brussels. The SRB is the agency set up by the EU to wind down stricken banks. In contrast to earlier crises, the hurried sale of Popular did not spook markets and banking stocks rose in Europe.  This deal is good for Spain and it's good for Europe,  Santander chairman Ana Botin said of the agreement, which breaks the mold of using taxpayers' money, instead imposing losses on shareholders and creditors of the bank.

The ECB said there was a  significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days  and that in the near future Popular would have been  unable to pay its debts . Up to 2 billion euros a day was being taken out of the bank by savers last week, another source told Reuters.  We got it done before markets opened. That was the target,  Elke König, who chairs the Resolution Board, said. Santander Chairwoman Ana Botin arrives for a news conference after Santander announced on Wednesday that it would buy struggling rival Banco Popular for a nominal one euro after European authorities determined the lender was on the verge of insolvency, in Madrid, Spain, June 7, 2017.Juan MedinaUnlike Italy, which has been grappling with problem lenders for years, Spain's reaction was prompt and in contrast to the 2008 banking crisis it met with calm in the markets.  This shouldn't pose any real problems for other banks,  Aberdeen Asset Management Head of Credit Research Laurent Frings said.  But it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second-tier names.  Botin Sees Benefits Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said Santander's takeover was a good outcome for Popular given its situation in recent weeks and it would have no impact on public resources or other banks. Slideshow (6 Images)Botin welcomed Popular customers and said that the combination of the two would strengthen Santander's geographic reach as the economies in Spain and Portugal improved.  It gives certainty and stability to Spain's financial sector,  she said.  Santander, which was unaffected by the banking crisis in Spain that forced Madrid to seek international aid, said buying Popular would accelerate growth and profit from 2019. The group, with operations from South America to Britain, said it would set aside 7.9 billion euros to cover the cost of non-performing assets, which are loans at risk of non-payment. Struggling under the weight of 37 billion euros of non-performing property assets left over from Spain's financial crisis, Popular had seen its share price slump. It was among a handful of banks that emerged as vulnerable to stress, such as an economic downturn, in a European Banking Authority simulation last summer and had remained vulnerable with a ratio of risky loans around three times above the average of its Spanish rivals. But Popular's small and medium-sized company loan portfolio, the largest among Spanish lenders, presents an opportunity for Santander, which said it would now lead this growing market.  It will also sell off at least half of Popular's property assets within about 18 months.

A powerful Arab group including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties and imposed a blockade on Qatar on Monday over the natural gas producer's alleged support for Islamist groups and Iran. Hamas officials are tight-lipped about the pressure being put on Qatar, not wishing to draw attention to their own dilemma posed by the worst crisis among Gulf Arab for two decades. But Gaza-based analysts concede the situation is precarious. One potential fallout is a sharp cut in Qatari funding for Hamas, especially if the emirate wants to show the Saudis and others that it takes seriously the charge that it finances militant groups tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, such as Hamas. If financial aid is cut - Qatar has paid out or pledged $1.5 billion since 2012 to help build roads, houses, schools and clinics in impoverished Gaza - it will hurt Gaza's two million people - and could have ramifications for Israel as well.  In the past, when Hamas has felt backed into a corner, it has led to conflict. Since 2007, when it seized control of Gaza from the rival Palestinian movement Fatah, Hamas's militant armed wing has fought three wars with Israel, all producing a heavy death toll and severe destruction in Gaza.  It will be difficult for Qatar to resume its financial support for Gaza now because of the assault against it,  said Adnan Abu Amer, an independent political analyst in Gaza.  The political support to the entire Palestinian cause is going to be affected, not only by Qatar, but in the Gulf in general, and that may leave the Palestinians alone in the face of Israel.  Equally, he said, Hamas is unlikely openly to kick up a fuss so as not to compound the pressure Qatar is under.  Hamas feels it owes Qatar gratitude because of its political and financial support all these years,  he said. In a sign that Hamas has been under pressure from Qatar to moderate its positions, the group unveiled a new policy document at an event in Doha last month, distancing itself from the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hamas was formed in the 1980s as an offshoot of the pan-Arab Brotherhood but has more recently stressed its basis as a Palestinian liberation movement, in part to defuse Egyptian enmity and draw support from wealthy Arab states. Palestinian workers work on a Qatari-funded construction project in the southern Gaza Strip June 7, 2017.Ibraheem Abu MustafaHamas officials would not directly address the threats they face, but were critical of Saudi Arabia for leading the squeeze on Qatar, and in particular about comments by Riyadh's foreign minister calling on Qatar to sever relations with Hamas.  We in Hamas urge the brothers in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to stop these statements that hurt the kingdom and hurt its positions towards the cause of our people and their legitimate rights,  Hamas said in a statement. Those statements, it added, could spur Israel to  conduct more violations and crimes against our people, our land and our sacred sites and against the blessed Al-Aqsa mosque  in Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest site. Egypt Opening? As well as financial support, Qatar has long hosted exiled Hamas officials, including its former political chief, Khaled Meshaal. Meshaal was recently succeeded by Ismail Haniyeh, who remains in Gaza but is expected to move to Qatar's capital Doha. Reports in Arab media said Qatar planned to expel several Hamas officials, including Saleh al-Aruri, who is believed to be the leader of Hamas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and who was previously kicked out of Turkey. But Hamas in Gaza denied any such expulsions had taken place. Meshaal remains in Qatar. In a sign that Hamas is rapidly reassessing what the regional shifts mean, its new leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is currently in Egypt for meetings. Egypt wants Hamas to cut ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, which Cairo considers a terrorist group, and adopt a more pragmatic regional stance.  It is not clear what message Sinwar has taken to Cairo, but analysts believe the aim is to try to keep Egypt on side and show Hamas can be a partner. The question is whether it can work, and whether Hamas can afford to cold-shoulder Qatar.  Things are foggy for Hamas now,  said Ashraf Abouelhoul, a writer and analyst for Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper.  The fate of Hamas's leadership in Qatar is also in question. Will they leave Qatar? Where can they go? The Saudi position is very clear: Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood must leave Qatar.   Abouelhoul said he believed Hamas needed to distance itself from Qatar, and withdraw its officials from Doha, if it wanted to retain the support of other Gulf states.  If Hamas hesitates or acts too late or chooses the Iranian-Qatari camp it will face difficulties on all fronts,  he said.  Hamas maybe the biggest loser of what is happening with Qatar.

National Bank of Oman (NBO), Ahli Bank SAOG (ABO), Bank Dhofar (BD) and Bank Sohar (BS) have also been affirmed at Long-Term IDR 'BBB-'. The Outlooks on all the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. Fitch has downgraded the Viability Rating (VR) of ABO, reflecting its weaker funding profile relative to peers, particularly its high reliance on wholesale funding and high deposit concentration. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS AND SENIOR DEBT - BM, NBO, ABO, BD and BS BM's, NBO's, ABO's, BD's and BS' IDRs, Support Ratings (SRs) and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) reflect Fitch's expectation of a high probability of support from the Omani authorities in case of need. Fitch believes Oman has the financial flexibility to support its banking system despite some weakening as a result of lower oil prices. The fiscal policy response to the drop in oil prices has not prevented a significant deterioration in public finances. Fitch believes the Omani authorities' willingness to support domestic banks remains high, partly because of high contagion risk (small number and high concentration of banks in the system) and the importance of the banking system in building the local economy. We view NBO (12% market share), ABO (6%), BD (13%) and BS (8%) as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) in Oman; their SRF is therefore equal to the 'BBB-' D-SIB SRF in Oman. As the country's dominant bank with a 36% market share, BM's SRF is one notch higher at 'BBB'. NBO and BM have their SRFs at the same level with their VRs, respectively at 'BBB-'/'bbb-' and 'BBB'/'bbb'. In both cases, the IDRs are driven by the intrinsic financial strength of the banks (as measured by the VRs) and are underpinned by sovereign support. The IDRs of ABO, BD and BS are exclusively driven by sovereign support because their VRs are below the 'BBB-' SRF. We assign Short-Term IDRs according to the mapping correspondence described in our rating criteria. A 'BBB' Long-Term IDR can correspond to a Short-Term IDR of either 'F2' or 'F3'. In the case of BM, whose Long-Term IDR is 'BBB', we opted for 'F3', the lower of the two Short-Term IDR options. This is because approximately 35% of the bank's funding is related to the government and a stress scenario for the bank is likely to come at a time when the sovereign itself is experiencing some form of stress. The banks' senior debt ratings are driven by the same factors that drive the IDRs. IDRS AND SR - HBON HBON's IDRs and SR are driven by our expectation of an extremely high probability of support available to the bank from its ultimate parent, HSBC Holdings (HSBC - AA-/Stable/aa-). This reflects HSBC's strong ability to support HBON, and HBON's manageable and negligible size of total group assets at end-2016. This view is supported by HBON's role in the group, providing products and services in a market identified as strategically important to HSBC. Our support view also factors in strong integration (including management, systems and risk practices), common branding and the high reputational risk that an HBON default would cause to HSBC. If transfer and convertibility considerations did not apply, HBON's Long-Term IDR would be notched down once from HSBC's 'AA-' Long-Term IDR. According to our criteria, a Long-Term IDR of 'A-' corresponds to a Short-Term IDR of either 'F1' or 'F2'. We have affirmed the 'F1' Short-Term IDR because we view the liquidity profile of HBON's parent as extremely strong. We do not assign a SRF to HBON because in our view the most likely source of extraordinary support for this bank is its shareholder and not the government authorities. SRFs are assigned to banks which would, in our opinion, receive extraordinary support from the government in the first instance. VRS The VR of BM is underpinned by its dominant franchise in Oman, which supports its ability to generate healthy operating profits, and within the context of the operating environment, its sound and resilient asset quality. We also take into account its capital ratios with satisfactory buffers over regulatory minimums in light of some lending concentration, and a substantial depositor base with a strong retail component. Deposits are diversified compared with domestic and regional peers. Liquidity is stable and sound and is a focus for the bank. The management team is one of the strongest in the country, with depth, stability and experience and sound execution of the bank's strategy. BM's VR is capped by the operating environment and, more specifically, by the Omani sovereign rating of 'BBB'. The VR of ABO is constrained by a weaker funding profile relative to peers, with high deposit concentration, greater reliance on wholesale markets to fund its loan book than peers, and tightening liquidity. The bank benefits from being part of the Ahli United Bank group and its wider regional network, notably in terms of depth, stability and experience of upper management. The bank's track record of resilient asset quality and performance compares well with peers. The bank's VR also factors in the bank's satisfactory capital buffers above the minimum regulatory requirements and in light of high lending concentrations, as well as a moderate franchise in Oman. NBO's VR reflects a solid franchise in Oman, the depth, stability and experience of upper management, and less loan concentration compared with peers. We expect some pressures on asset quality from the operating environment, which could lead to higher loan impairment charges. However, NBO's cost efficiency and high net interest margins are likely to support profitability. Fitch core capital (FCC) is only adequate; however, measured risk appetite and growth targets underpin satisfactory regulatory capital buffers. The VR also factors in the bank's adequate and stable liquidity and diversified funding compared with some peers. HBON's VR is supported by the bank's company profile, which benefits from being part of the HSBC group for product offering, geographical reach and the depth, stability and experience of management. Sound buffers of regulatory capital and higher liquidity than peers are also factored into the rating, particularly as Fitch expects ample liquidity and capital would be available from the group in case of need. HBON's balance sheet is more liquid than that of peers and this is one reason for the bank's weak profitability, which remains below peer average but is continuously improving. Impaired loans remain fairly high compared with domestic peers, but these are primarily legacy loans and are well covered by reserves. New impaired loans are reasonably limited. The bank's current more conservative underwriting standards should continue to support stable asset quality. The VR of BD reflects its tight capital buffers, above-peer average loan and deposit concentrations, and tight funding, with greater reliance on wholesale funding than higher-rated peers, which contributes to high funding costs. The VR also factors in the bank's sound Omani franchise (with a 13% market share), depth and stability of management, good cost control and resilient asset quality metrics. Nevertheless we expect some pressures on asset quality from the operating environment that could lead to higher loan impairment charges. The VR of BS reflects a weaker funding profile relative to peers, with high deposit concentration, higher balance of term deposits, and greater reliance on wholesale and interbank markets to fund its loan book than peers. It also factors in the bank's tight capital buffers in light of lending concentrations, limited liquidity and modest earnings. It also reflects high management turnover, some reliance on a few key individuals and the lack of a clear strategy following the end of merger talks with BD. Positively, BS' asset quality metrics have proved resilient. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SRS, SRFS AND SENIOR DEBT BM's, NBO's, ABO's, BD's and BS' IDRs, SRs and SRFs are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions around the Omani authorities' propensity or ability to provide timely support to the banking sector. If the sovereign is downgraded by one notch the SRFs would also be revised down by one notch. This would affect the Long-Term IDRs of ABO, BD and BS as they are driven by the SRF. This would also affect the Long-Term IDR of BM as BM is unlikely to be rated above the sovereign. HBON's Long-Term IDR and SR are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of HSBC's ability or propensity to provide support. A one notch downgrade of the Omani sovereign is also likely to result in a one notch downgrade of HBON's Long-Term IDR as Fitch's Country Ceiling, which captures transfer and convertibility risk, is also likely to be downgraded. The senior debt ratings are sensitive to the same factors that affect the IDRs. VRS BM's VR is the highest in Oman and is constrained by the operating environment. A downgrade of the VR would most likely be a result of a sovereign downgrade or a deteriorating operating environment, particularly should that lead to worsening asset quality or an inability to generate stable earnings through the cycle. Weakening of NBO's liquidity or significant worsening of asset quality could put pressure on the VR. An upgrade of the VR is unlikely given the difficult operating environment. ABO's VR is sensitive to changes in the bank's funding and liquidity. HBON's VR is sensitive to material changes in asset quality and profitability metrics. An upgrade of BD's VR would be contingent on the bank significantly strengthening its franchise in Oman, its funding profile and its capitalisation. Downward pressure would most likely be a result of weakening capital, funding or asset quality. The VR of BS is sensitive to further deterioration of its funding profile or weakening capital, whether as a result of rapid growth or worsening asset quality, although this is not Fitch's expectation. A prolonged delay in setting a clear and well-defined strategy could be negative for the VR if that leads to a weakening financial profile. An upside to the VR is contingent on the bank significantly strengthening its funding profile and capitalisation.

The footage, found on a mobile phone as government forces closed in on the fighters in Marawi City, showed a group of men in a room discussing how they would take hostages from a school, seal off roads and capture a highway into the lakeside town.  There was indeed a bigger plan and it was supposed to wreak more havoc,  military spokesman Restituto Padilla told a news conference after the video became public. The battle for Marawi has raised concern that Islamic State, on a back foot in Syria and Iraq, is building a regional base on the Philippine island of Mindanao that could pose a threat to neighboring Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore too. Officials have said that, among the several hundred militants who seized the town on May 23, there were about 40 foreigners from Indonesia and Malaysia but also fighters from India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Chechnya. The strike on Marawi City suggested to many that pro-Islamic State outfits wanted to establish the town as a Southeast Asian ‘wilayat’ – or governorate - for the radical group, a view reinforced by the video footage. The military has said that the fighters are increasingly penned in around a built-up area of the town, and troops have been clearing houses that the militants had defended with snipers for the past two weeks. Philippine senators said members of the upper house were last week shown the video of the militants making their plans, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters from the Philippines military. The men pored over a map and one, identified by a subtitle as 'Abdullah', pointed to three locations and discussed options for attack.  We can jailbreak ... we can go inside schools ... we can take hostages,  he said in a mix of regional languages and English.  But we need to seize a highway so people will be scared.   Seated at a table among them was Isnilon Hapilon, leader of the Abu Sayyaf group who was proclaimed by Islamic State last year as its  emir  of Southeast Asia. The U.S. State Department has offered a bounty of up to $5 million for his arrest. Hapilon has formed an alliance with the Maute group, a tactically smart, social-media savvy outfit, and at least two other factions that have lined up behind the ultra-radical Islamic State. A joint group of police and military forces kick a door while conducting a house to house search as part of clearing operations in different sections of Marawi city, Philippines June 7, 2017.Stringer It was clear that these terrorists, the Maute group, their end goal is to make Marawi ... independent, or to separate from the republic,  Senator JV Ejercito told Reuters.  With a plan like this, this is already rebellion and a threat to national security, so declaration of martial law is justified,  he said, referring to the martial law declared by President Rodrigo Duterte across Mindanao when the siege began. The Associated Press first reported on the video on Tuesday. Armed forces Chief of Staff General Eduaro Año told the agency that the images showed an intention to dismember  a portion of the Philippine territory by occupying the whole of Marawi City and establishing their own Islamic state or government . 'Not a Religious War' Slideshow (12 Images)The fighters prepared for a long siege, stockpiling arms and food in tunnels, basements, mosques and madrasas, or Islamic religious schools, military officials say. The Philippines is largely Christian, but Marawi City is overwhelmingly Muslim. Progress in the military campaign has been slow because hundreds of civilians are still trapped or being held hostage, some as human shields, the military said.  A Catholic priest and about a dozen of his parishioners were taken on the first day of the battle by militants who burst into the town's cathedral and set it alight. Military spokesman Padilla appealed to social media users not to circulate material - such as video images of the militants destroying religious statues and pulling down a cross inside a church - that may fan religious tension.  Let us not buy into the plan of these terror groups to inflame the feelings of our other religions,  he said.  This is not a religious war.  A four-hour ceasefire to evacuate residents trapped in the town was interrupted by gunfire on Sunday, leaving some 500 to 600 inside with dwindling supplies of food and water.  Officials say that 1,545 civilians have been rescued. The latest numbers for militants killed in the battle is 134, along with 39 security personnel. The authorities have put the civilian death toll at between 20 and 38.

It would, at first glance, seem that way.  In the red (-leather seat) corner sits the London Metal Exchange (LME), the 140-year-old incumbent, still dominant in terms of global price-setting but recently showing signs of wobbly frailty.  In the blue (-sky technology) corner awaits the challenger, NFEx Markets, a new digital platform designed by London's Autilla, a self-described  fintech  company riding the disruptive blockchain wave. The first round of the bout is scheduled for the start of next year, when NFEx is due to launch its  new market for the trading of nonferrous metals .  There is needle in this looming confrontation.  The challenger's advisory team includes Martin Abbott, former chief executive of the LME, Mark Bradley, a former head of market surveillance at the LME, Nigel Owens, a former IT manager at the LME and Jim Coupland, serial director and committee member of the LME over three decades.  It promises to be an entertaining and intriguing clash of the old LME guard using new weapons against the new LME guard defending old positions. Except that things may be a bit more complex than advertised on the fight bill.  While there can be little doubt that NFEx is a direct consequence of the LME's strategic flailing since its acquisition in 2012 by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), this battle will be fought not for what the LME has but for what it has lost.  The Fruits of Discontent NFEx's press release on Monday pulled off the tricky feat of not once mentioning the LME, other than in the biographies of most of its advisory team.  It will, though, have  contracts and trade dates (that) match established physical industry practise .  For which read something very similar, if not identical, to the LME's own previously unique trading system, incorporating daily, weekly and monthly prompts revolving around a continually rolling three-month anchor price.  Indeed, it is discontent about the way the new LME, under pressure from HKEx (0388.HK) to recoup some of the 1.388 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) purchase price, has tried to adapt this system that spawned NFEx in the first place.  Fee hikes, particularly on short-dated spreads, alienated both core brokers and industrial users.  Attempts to compensate for the resulting slide in volumes by attracting more financial players, including the high-frequency  flash boys , just annoyed everyone more.  Around this time last year a group of brokers commissioned Abbott to conduct a feasibility study on a new LME.  At the time, it looked like a way of pressuring the LME's executive into reversing its fee hikes. And it was partly successful insofar as the exchange did indeed partly reverse them.  That half-win loosened the original broker alliance but the project took on a life of its own, dropping on the mat of Autilla, which was already active in trying to disrupt the precious part of the London metals establishment.  Graphic on LME volumes, by major contract:  tmsnrt.rs/2s3E8Ky A Fight for the Shadows Traders and clerks work at the London Metal Exchange (LME) in London, July 22, 2011. A string of warehouses in Detroit, most of them operated by Goldman, has stockpiled more than a million tonnes of the industrial metal aluminium, about a quarter of global reported inventories. The LME certifies and regulates the Detroit sheds as part of a global network of more than 640 warehouses. Picture taken July 22, 2011.  To match Special Report LME-WAREHOUSINGPaul Hackett/Files (BRITAIN - Tags: BUSINESS) - RTR2PD9PNFEx's target, initially at least, will be to attract the business that the LME has lost to the over-the-counter (OTC) market.  Which is, presumably, why it can without blushing claim its new platform  will not replace or disturb current trading models but will be complementary to them . You can't replace what has already gone.  LME volumes have been falling consistently since the start of 2015, when the new management first raised trading fees. Only one of the core contracts, nickel, has seen volumes rise over both a one- and two-year timeframe.  Worst hit have been volumes on those short-dated spreads, particularly the shortest of all,  tom-next , a daily position roll much beloved by financiers of physical metals stocks.  Despite media attention on the supposed battle for market-share between the LME and CME, all the evidence suggests that the disappearing volumes have gone into the OTC shadows rather than to another exchange.  The LME's all-encompassing  Discussion Paper on Market Structure  gives a taste of what it might be contemplating in terms of trying to get this volume back.  It would, for example,  consider further reducing the fees on short-dated carries  with an offsetting rise on other types of trade.  Rebalancing fees between member and client contracts might also address the current cost incentive for brokers to place clients in an OTC structure.  There's more, much more. Fifty-seven pages in fact. NFEx, for its part, is giving little away as to its solution for bringing the shadow volumes back.  Cost will be an obvious selling point but in an age of electronic trading, where activity on even an active contract such as LME three-month copper is fractured into a million single-lot parts, how to generate liquidity without going down the same path?  As a new player, unencumbered by legacy technology or mindset, Autilla has what must seem from the LME's perspective an enviably blank canvas.  More Fish in a Much Bigger Ocean? If it can come up with an answer, the rewards might be much greater than the crumbs that have slid off the LME's table over the last three years.  One core theme permeating the world of industrial metals exchange trading has been the shifting balance between the share of trading originating from industrial and financial players.  One of the revelations from the LME's consultations on its warehousing reform program was the depth of discontent among industrial giants such as Alcoa and Rusal about the financialization of what they felt to be  their market .  This undercurrent has been running a lot longer than the last few years and is part of a broader trend of investment participation in the commodities complex.  However, there is a case to be made that the LME's relatively high-cost structure, overlaid with a steady tightening of credit credentials for participation, has served to disenfranchise all but the largest industrial users.  Many smaller players, whether scrap merchants, wire manufacturers or die-casters, stopped actively participating on the LME many years before the fee hikes of 2012.  They may still have LME prices hard-wired into their physical contracts but how many actually hedge their exposure on the exchange any more is a moot point.  There is a yawning gap in the exchange-traded metal market space. If NFEx can find a way of filling it, the new guard and the old guard of the LME could yet find themselves unlikely allies rather than competitors.

Dubai's Emaar Properties jumped on a plan for an initial public offer by one of its units. The Qatari index lost 1.0 percent to a fresh 17-month low, taking its losses to 9.7 percent since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic links and transport ties on Monday, accusing Doha of backing terrorism. A little over one-sixth of total traded value came from other Gulf investors, more than the usual 5 to 10 percent - suggesting some Gulf investors were liquidating assets in Qatar. Other foreign funds also traded actively, bourse data showed. The Qatari riyal slipped to an 11-year low of 3.6517 against the dollar in the spot market on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters data, another sign of capital outflows. Qatar Islamic Bank slumped 8.2 percent to 89 riyals, its lowest close since January 2016, in heavy trade. It is one of the Qatari banks most dependent on deposits from other Gulf states, obtaining a quarter of its deposits from that source, said Olivier Panis, analyst at Moody's. On Wednesday, 23 other shares fell but 12 advanced, including telecommunications operator Vodafone Qatar, up 1.6 percent to 7.74 Qatari riyals. After sharp falls in stocks,  there is value there, and although the political situation is not encouraging, there are some good buys,  said a regional equities fund manager. Reflecting the political tensions, he declined to be named. However, many money managers said that the longer the diplomatic crisis lasted, the higher the risk premium demanded by foreign foreign investors in Qatar would go.  Tensions are still high and mediation efforts by fellow Gulf Cooperation Council state Kuwait have yet to lead to a concrete solution, so investors will likely remain on edge,  said a Dubai-based trader. Emaar Properties, Ezz Steel In Dubai, the largest listed real estate developer Emaar Properties surged 8.6 percent in its heaviest trade since April 2015 after it said it planned to offer up to 30 percent of its United Arab Emirates real estate development business in an initial public offer. Subject to market conditions, funds raised through the IPO would be distributed to shareholders of Emaar. The company said the IPO would be Dubai's largest since its flotation of Emaar Malls, which raised 5.8 billion dirhams ($1.58 billion) in 2014 and was heavily oversubscribed. Emaar Malls was up 1.6 percent. The Dubai index climbed 2.5 percent, its largest single-day gain since December 2016. In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas rocketed 10.9 percent in very heavy trade after saying it had received $40 million from the Egyptian government towards its outstanding receivables; its current receivables balance in Egypt now stands at $187 million. The Abu Dhabi index, however, fell 0.1 percent, weighed down by a 1.4 percent decline of shares of the largest listed bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank. The Saudi Arabian index rose 0.2 percent in the heaviest trading volume this year as 87 shares rose and 63 declined. Buying of Saudi stocks favoured by foreign funds, in anticipation of a decision by MSCI on June 20 to begin reviewing Riyadh for possible inclusion in its emerging market index, has buoyed the market in recent days. Dairy producer Almarai rose 0.6 percent and its largest shareholder Savola Group added 0.7 percent, to its highest close in 17 months. In Cairo, the index edged up 0.1 percent in its 12th consecutive session of gains to a fresh all-time high. Ezz Steel soared 7.5 percent after the trade ministry imposed a temporary import tariff on rebar steel from China, Turkey and Ukraine to protect local manufacturers suffering from losses. The decision is valid for fourth months. Highlights Saudi Arabia * The index added 0.2 percent to 6,946 points. Dubai * The index jumped 2.5 percent to 3,406 points. Abu Dhabi * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 4,454 points. Qatar * The index lost 1.0 percent to 8,965 points. Egypt * The index edged up 0.1 percent to 13,633 points.

The most important thing is that we are united against terrorism across the political spectrum,  Minister for Home Affairs Anders Ygeman said.  We are going to go forward robustly in making it more difficult for terrorists and increasing security in our country.   The government has already said it will fast-track plans to make it a criminal offence to be a member of what it deems a terrorist organization. In 2010 it became illegal to recruit or encourage people to commit terrorist crimes.

Currency, bond and equity trading desks in London will be staffed as results trickle in late on Thursday and in the early hours of Friday. With opinion polls showing Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the Labour opposition narrowing in the last three weeks and some suggesting her Conservatives could even lose their majority in parliament, the outcome looks much more uncertain than the landslide predicted when May called the election in April. And after Britain's vote last June to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's election as U.S. President in November caught markets off-guard, traders are taking no chances.  We'll have increased staffing overnight to cope with potential volatility, looking particularly at the exit poll at 10 p.m. and what it could do to markets if its suggests a hung parliament,  said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at spread betting firm ETX Capital.  Then very much all hands on deck for the market open on Friday.  Fixed income trading platform Tradeweb said it would open early on Friday due to the election, extending its operating hours across all European asset classes from 0200 London time (0100 GMT). The big global banks in London have operations in Asia that would normally handle trading throughout the European night. But on Thursday night, they will be drawing on resources across the world.   With high profile, market-moving events, we will have more staff working extended hours in one or more centers to make sure we can help our clients and manage our risk,  HSBC said.  Barclays said foreign exchange sales and trading teams in London, New York and Singapore would stay late on Thursday and be at their desks early on Friday as results come through. Thursday's vote will define Britain's approach to its divorce talks and future relationship with the European Union, which analysts say will be a major driver of UK assets. Expecting the Unexpected One broker said that if results indicated an outright Conservative win, as suggested by a poll taken after Saturday's deadly attack in London, it would leave trading to colleagues in Asia. More volatile scenarios would keep London staff at their desks overnight. Louis Gargour, chief investment officer of hedge fund LNG Capital, said his traders would work though the night with counterparties in Asia  if the unexpected happens .  Investors with exposure to UK securities need to think ahead, we can't not hedge prior to the election and assume that we can liquidate positions or sell to hedge ourselves on Friday after the outcome,  he said.   While UK stocks will begin trading at 8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday and British government bonds only really trade when the futures market opens, also at 8:00 a.m., sterling is a global currency traded at all hours. After the Brexit vote, the pound initially soared 1 percent to above $1.50 on polls showing the  remain  camp ahead. But as it became clear Britain had voted  leave , sterling fell, hitting 31-year lows around $1.32. Trump's surprise election on Nov. 9 triggered a volatile day for the pound and a kneejerk fall in equities before they reversed course to rise on expectations his policies would fuel growth and reflation.  This time, the pound is down 2.8 percent in trade-weighted terms since May 10, giving back all the gains made since the election was called on April 18.  In practice, only the currency markets are liquid enough to trade through the night,  said Colin McLean, managing director of the UK equity growth fund at SVM Asset Management.  We won't be in all night, but will likely make an early start,  he added. Currency analysts at ING said they would be in all night to watch the results and support clients. Others, though, have no plans to increase staffing.  Business as usual,  said Northern Trust head of global equities Gary Paulin.  (There's been) no real change as the poll lead has narrowed, since it's still an expected Conservative victory, just a bit smaller,  said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at brokerage IG. For many, however, the risk of missing a big move was the over-riding concern.  Brexit was the real eye opener - we stayed late but not that late, and the market traded very sharply on that outcome,  said LNG's Gargour.  Those traders pulling an all-night shift will not be fueled by adrenaline alone.  Pizzas have been ordered,  said ETX Capital's Wilson.

Human Rights Council and called for reforming the body to eliminate what it called its  chronic anti-Israel bias .  The United States is looking carefully at this Council and our participation in it. We see some areas for significant strengthening,  Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Geneva forum, opening a three-week session. The Council's critical stance of Israel has long been a contentious issue for the United States, Israel's main ally. The body has taken a strong position against Israel's occupation of territory seized in the 1967 Middle East war, its treatment of Palestinians, and its building of Jewish settlements. Most countries consider the settlements, in areas the Palestinians envisage as part of an eventual independent state, illegal. Washington says the Council is stacked with opponents of Israel and boycotted it for three years under President George W. Bush before rejoining under Barack Obama in 2009.  Tragically, we’ve been down this road before, Haley later told the Graduate Institute of Geneva.  America does not seek to leave the Human Rights Council.  We seek to reestablish the Council’s legitimacy.  She named Venezuela, Cuba, China, Burundi, and Saudi Arabia as not upholding the highest standards despite their membership and said that the forum was becoming  discredited  like its predecessor body, the Human Rights Commission. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (R) leaves after addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland June 6, 2017.Denis BalibouseThe 47-member Council adopted five  biased  resolutions on Israel and the Palestinian territory at its March session, but never even considered a resolution on Venezuela, she said.  This relentless, pathological campaign against a country that actually has a strong human rights record makes a mockery not of Israel, but of the Council itself,  Haley said, as some in the audience interrupted briefly with laughter at the remark. She called for the Council to address serious human rights violations in Venezuela and for the government of President Nicolas Maduro to address them.  If Venezuela cannot, it should voluntarily step down from its seat on the Human Rights Council until it can get its own house in order. Being a member of this council is a privilege, and no country who is a human rights violator should be allowed a seat at the table,  she said. Haley called for the council to adopt strong resolutions on abuses in Syria, Eritrea, Belarus, Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo at its session. Some activists urged Washington to focus on abuses at home.  It's hard to take Ambassador Haley seriously on U.S. support for human rights in light of Trump administration actions like the Muslim ban and immigration crackdowns,  Jamil Dakwar, director of the human rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Reuters.  The United States must get its own house in order and make human rights at home a priority - then, it can begin to credibly demand the same of other countries abroad.  additional reporting by Tom Miles, Editing by Angus MacSwan","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-un-rights-idUSKBN18X15H"},

In six days of war in June 1967, Israel seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria. Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem as their capital. The last round of peace talks collapsed in 2014.  In a speech opening a three-week session of the U.N. Human Rights Council, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein observed the 50th anniversary of when he  first heard the sound of war  as a boy in Amman, Jordan. He said Palestinians were now marking  a half-century of deep suffering under an occupation imposed by military force  and marked by  systematic  violations of international law.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley was to address the Council later in the day and expected to signal that the United States might withdraw unless reforms were ushered in including a removal of what it sees as an  anti-Israel bias . There are now 350,000 Israelis living in settlements across the West Bank with an air of permanence. Many countries see the settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this, citing historical, biblical and political connections to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as security considerations.

Alitalia filed in May to be put under special administration for the second time in less than a decade, starting a process that will lead to the loss-making airline being overhauled, sold off or wound up. Administrators said on Tuesday they had received 32 expressions of interest before the deadline to submit potential offers expired on Monday, but did not provide any names.  We have submitted an expression of interest,  a Ryanair spokesman said in an emailed statement.  As previously stated, we are not interested in buying Alitalia. However, we have offered to feed Alitalia’s long haul traffic.  Two weeks ago Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he planned to submit an expression of interest in order to participate in the process rather than to purchase the airline, and that he believed the Italian carrier had a viable future if sensibly restructured. Ryanair said it wanted to provide short-haul traffic to feed Alitalia's long-haul network and could deploy up to 20 aircraft at two weeks' notice this summer if Alitalia cut capacity significantly. The spokesman did not say on what terms Ryanair might provide feeder flights, but it has offered to link up to other long-haul carriers in recent months on condition Ryanair would not be responsible for any missed connections.  Alitalia has refused a similar offer in the past.  The Italian government appointed three commissioners to assess whether Alitalia can be restructured, and has given them six months to come up with a plan.  Several Italian media said none of the expressions of interest were for the entire airline but only for certain assets, such as fleet or airport slots.  The government has repeatedly said it would prefer to sell the airline in one block, partly to minimize the impact on its 12,500 staff. It has ruled out re-nationalizing Alitalia. The commissioners will now examine the submissions and select those that will be given access to Alitalia's data room.  Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said this week the German airline would look at any opportunities that arise in Italy, but it had no plans to buy Alitalia.  He added Lufthansa would look at Alitalia planes should they come up for sale. Turkish Airlines denied reports it was interested in Alitalia's assets.  Alitalia could not immediately be reached for comment.

Currency, bond and equity trading desks in London will be staffed as results trickle in late on Thursday and in the early hours of Friday. With opinion polls showing Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the Labour opposition narrowing in the last three weeks and some suggesting her Conservatives could even lose their majority in parliament, the outcome looks much more uncertain than the landslide predicted when May called the election in April. And after Britain's vote last June to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's election as U.S. President in November caught markets off-guard, traders are taking no chances.  We'll have increased staffing overnight to cope with potential volatility, looking particularly at the exit poll at 10 p.m. and what it could do to markets if its suggests a hung parliament,  said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at spread betting firm ETX Capital.  Then very much all hands on deck for the market open on Friday.  Fixed income trading platform Tradeweb said it would open early on Friday due to the election, extending its operating hours across all European asset classes from 0200 London time (0100 GMT). The big global banks in London have operations in Asia that would normally handle trading throughout the European night. But on Thursday night, they will be drawing on resources across the world.   With high profile, market-moving events, we will have more staff working extended hours in one or more centers to make sure we can help our clients and manage our risk,  HSBC said.  Barclays said foreign exchange sales and trading teams in London, New York and Singapore would stay late on Thursday and be at their desks early on Friday as results come through. Thursday's vote will define Britain's approach to its divorce talks and future relationship with the European Union, which analysts say will be a major driver of UK assets. Expecting the Unexpected One broker said that if results indicated an outright Conservative win, as suggested by a poll taken after Saturday's deadly attack in London, it would leave trading to colleagues in Asia. More volatile scenarios would keep London staff at their desks overnight. Louis Gargour, chief investment officer of hedge fund LNG Capital, said his traders would work though the night with counterparties in Asia  if the unexpected happens .  Investors with exposure to UK securities need to think ahead, we can't not hedge prior to the election and assume that we can liquidate positions or sell to hedge ourselves on Friday after the outcome,  he said.   While UK stocks will begin trading at 8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday and British government bonds only really trade when the futures market opens, also at 8:00 a.m., sterling is a global currency traded at all hours. After the Brexit vote, the pound initially soared 1 percent to above $1.50 on polls showing the  remain  camp ahead. But as it became clear Britain had voted  leave , sterling fell, hitting 31-year lows around $1.32. Trump's surprise election on Nov. 9 triggered a volatile day for the pound and a kneejerk fall in equities before they reversed course to rise on expectations his policies would fuel growth and reflation.  This time, the pound is down 2.8 percent in trade-weighted terms since May 10, giving back all the gains made since the election was called on April 18.  In practice, only the currency markets are liquid enough to trade through the night,  said Colin McLean, managing director of the UK equity growth fund at SVM Asset Management.  We won't be in all night, but will likely make an early start,  he added. Currency analysts at ING said they would be in all night to watch the results and support clients. Others, though, have no plans to increase staffing.  Business as usual,  said Northern Trust head of global equities Gary Paulin.  (There's been) no real change as the poll lead has narrowed, since it's still an expected Conservative victory, just a bit smaller,  said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at brokerage IG. For many, however, the risk of missing a big move was the over-riding concern.  Brexit was the real eye opener - we stayed late but not that late, and the market traded very sharply on that outcome,  said LNG's Gargour.  Those traders pulling an all-night shift will not be fueled by adrenaline alone.  Pizzas have been ordered,  said ETX Capital's Wilson.

However, Pedro Santana Lopes told SIC television that nothing has been decided yet even though the government had indeed suggested that  social economy  entities like SCML, which is also a lottery operator, buy into Montepio and reinforce its capital. Santana Lopes said the government's aim was not to rescue Montepio, but to reorganise the way charities work with the financial sector, giving them a say in a private-sector bank, adding that there was no need for any hurried decision.  We will only enter if the risk has been well measured ... SCML is studying the (Montepio) file as the authorities have requested, but we are a private entity and ... if the risk is considered inequitable, SCML will not enter,  he said.

Germany's Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks called the ruling a  colossal nuisance  as well as a slap in the face for the previous coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel that was in charge when the tax was introduced in late 2010. The verdict marks a second success for utilities after a court ruled in December that a push to shut down all of Germany's nuclear plants violated some of their property rights. E.ON, RWE and EnBW have been hit hard by Chancellor Merkel's swift decision to exit nuclear power by 2022, a move prompted by the disaster at Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011. Related CoverageGerman government to pay utilities around 6.3 billion euros after court rulingBudget targets not affected by German nuclear tax ruling - MerkelGerman minister says court's nuclear tax ruling is very irritatingImposed between 2011 and 2016, the nuclear fuel tax has further weighed on utilities, amounting to payments of 6.285 billion euros from nuclear plant operators. A source familiar with the matter said the sum to be paid back could exceed 7 billion euros. Merkel, who faces a national election in September, said on Wednesday the ruling, which effectively forces the government to refund utilities, would not endanger Germany's budgetary goals. Earlier, the Karlsruhe-based Constitutional Court said the tax was  formally unconstitutional and void , adding the government did not have the legal competence to claim it. E.ON shares rose as much as 6.2 percent, hitting their highest level in more than 16 months. RWE shares, too, climbed as much as 7 percent to a nearly 2-year high. Thinly-traded shares in EnBW were up 2.6 percent.  Little if any compensation would have been baked into consensus... so the ruling is close to pure upside for the shares,  analysts at Berenberg wrote, keeping a  buy  on both E.ON and RWE. E.ON said the ruling meant it would be refunded about 2.85 billion euros plus 450 million euros in interest, adding this would boost its net profit and lower its net debt. RWE expects a refund of 1.7 billion euros plus about 200 million in interest.  EnBW said it has paid 1.44 billion euros. In the aftermath of Fukushima, E.ON and RWE have both undergone major corporate overhauls, separating their conventional power plant businesses from operations such as renewables and networks. The fuel tax required nuclear plant operators to pay 145 euros per gram of nuclear fuel each time they exchanged a fuel rod, which usually happens about twice a year.

I think if you compare the two that Watergate pales, really, in my view, compared to what we're confronting now,  Clapper told reporters in Canberra, Australia's capital. The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Hotel in Washington in 1972, and subsequent cover-up, brought down former Republican U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1974. Clapper’s appearance in Canberra comes before highly anticipated testimony by sacked FBI director James Comey before the Senate intelligence committee on Thursday.  Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testifies about potential Russian interference in the presidential election before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill.Aaron P. BernsteinThe committee is examining whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian officials to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. [nL1N1J320B] [nL1N1J31ZP] Trump in May removed Comey as director of FBI, despite a U.S. Justice Department probe into contacts between presidential aides and Russia, raising the specter of political interference in the investigation. Trump has called the probe a  witch hunt  and said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel could all weigh on investor sentiment. Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump might shed more light on a probe by the FBI into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's legislative agenda of rolling back healthcare reforms and overhauling the tax code. The closely-fought election in Britain is also keenly watched, with one poll showing Prime Minister Theresa May increasing her parliamentary majority, while another suggesting a neck-and-neck race with the Labour Party.  It's the calm before the storm. We have a quiet week in terms of economic data and there's a general global unease at the moment,  said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The impact of Comey's statement really depends on what he says, and anyway these hearings are long and dragged out. The UK elections could have an impact if there is a hung parliament and the various polls are adding a level of uncertainty.  The ECB will also hold its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to reiterate its plan to extend the money-printing scheme at least until the end of the year. Safe havens turned attractive, with gold steadying near seven-month highs and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovering near lows not seen since the November U.S. election.

Germany's Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks called the ruling a  colossal nuisance  as well as a slap in the face for the previous coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel that was in charge when the tax was introduced in late 2010. The verdict marks a second success for utilities after a court ruled in December that a push to shut down all of Germany's nuclear plants violated some of their property rights. E.ON, RWE and EnBW have been hit hard by Chancellor Merkel's swift decision to exit nuclear power by 2022, a move prompted by the disaster at Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011. Related CoverageGerman government to pay utilities around 6.3 billion euros after court rulingBudget targets not affected by German nuclear tax ruling - MerkelGerman minister says court's nuclear tax ruling is very irritatingImposed between 2011 and 2016, the nuclear fuel tax has further weighed on utilities, amounting to payments of 6.285 billion euros from nuclear plant operators. A source familiar with the matter said the sum to be paid back could exceed 7 billion euros. Merkel, who faces a national election in September, said on Wednesday the ruling, which effectively forces the government to refund utilities, would not endanger Germany's budgetary goals. Earlier, the Karlsruhe-based Constitutional Court said the tax was  formally unconstitutional and void , adding the government did not have the legal competence to claim it. E.ON shares rose as much as 6.2 percent, hitting their highest level in more than 16 months. RWE shares, too, climbed as much as 7 percent to a nearly 2-year high. Thinly-traded shares in EnBW were up 2.6 percent.  Little if any compensation would have been baked into consensus... so the ruling is close to pure upside for the shares,  analysts at Berenberg wrote, keeping a  buy  on both E.ON and RWE. E.ON said the ruling meant it would be refunded about 2.85 billion euros plus 450 million euros in interest, adding this would boost its net profit and lower its net debt. RWE expects a refund of 1.7 billion euros plus about 200 million in interest.  EnBW said it has paid 1.44 billion euros. In the aftermath of Fukushima, E.ON and RWE have both undergone major corporate overhauls, separating their conventional power plant businesses from operations such as renewables and networks. The fuel tax required nuclear plant operators to pay 145 euros per gram of nuclear fuel each time they exchanged a fuel rod, which usually happens about twice a year.

Modest gains for the loonie came as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast that Canada's economy will grow 2.8 percent this year after a 1.4 percent expansion in 2016.                  The OECD said higher interest rates will help cool  booming housing markets  and that macro-prudential measures should be tightened further to address economic and financial risks related to the housing market.      Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell on renewed concerns about the efficacy of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries-led production cuts due to rising tensions within the export group over Qatar and growing U.S. output.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 1.22 percent at $47.6 a barrel.

The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3461, while it touched its strongest since May 29 at C$1.3427.     Against the euro, the Canadian dollar strengthened to C$1.5109 after a report suggesting the European Central Bank, rather than swinging decisively towards a tighter monetary stance this week, is preparing to cut its outlook for inflation.                      The Bank of Canada's review of developments in the financial system is also due on Thursday, followed by a news conference with Governor Stephen Poloz. Investors will weigh Poloz's assessment of the health of the housing and mortgage markets in light of recent troubles at non-bank lender Home Capital.     The value of Canadian building permits declined 0.2 percent in April, the third monthly decrease in a row, data from Statistics Canada showed.

Alitalia filed in May to be put under special administration for the second time in less than a decade, starting a process that will lead to the loss-making airline being overhauled, sold off or wound up. Administrators said on Tuesday they had received 32 expressions of interest before the deadline to submit potential offers expired on Monday, but did not provide any names.  We have submitted an expression of interest,  a Ryanair spokesman said in an emailed statement.  As previously stated, we are not interested in buying Alitalia. However, we have offered to feed Alitalia’s long haul traffic.  Two weeks ago Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he planned to submit an expression of interest in order to participate in the process rather than to purchase the airline, and that he believed the Italian carrier had a viable future if sensibly restructured. Ryanair said it wanted to provide short-haul traffic to feed Alitalia's long-haul network and could deploy up to 20 aircraft at two weeks' notice this summer if Alitalia cut capacity significantly. The spokesman did not say on what terms Ryanair might provide feeder flights, but it has offered to link up to other long-haul carriers in recent months on condition Ryanair would not be responsible for any missed connections.  Alitalia has refused a similar offer in the past.  The Italian government appointed three commissioners to assess whether Alitalia can be restructured, and has given them six months to come up with a plan.  Several Italian media said none of the expressions of interest were for the entire airline but only for certain assets, such as fleet or airport slots.  The government has repeatedly said it would prefer to sell the airline in one block, partly to minimize the impact on its 12,500 staff. It has ruled out re-nationalizing Alitalia. The commissioners will now examine the submissions and select those that will be given access to Alitalia's data room.  Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said this week the German airline would look at any opportunities that arise in Italy, but it had no plans to buy Alitalia.  He added Lufthansa would look at Alitalia planes should they come up for sale. Turkish Airlines denied reports it was interested in Alitalia's assets.  Alitalia could not immediately be reached for comment.

Sanlam's normalised headline earnings – a commonly used profit measure that strips out certain one-off items – increased by 9 percent for the four-months ended April, the company said, without giving further details.

The third attempt to create a super bourse by linking London and Frankfurt ended in March after European Union competition regulators opposed the deal, and German officials objected to the head office being based in Britain.  One of the lessons learned is that consolidation across the exchange business, at least in Europe, is currently not supported by politicians and regulators,  Deutsche Boerse CFO Gregor Pottmeyer said at the Sandler O'Neill Global Exchanges and Brokerage Conference at Le Parker Meridien Hotel in New York City. He said uncertainty as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union also did not help the exchange M&A; landscape, so Deutsche Boerse would focus on areas where the political dependency to get a deal done is not as strong.  That means looking at index, data and analytics businesses, as well as foreign exchange and commodities, he said.  But overall, it always needs two for a tango and therefore our focus is on our standalone strategy, but we are also open for these kinds of M&A; opportunities,  he said.

However, bullion came under some pressure after the dollar rose against the euro due to reports that the European Central Bank was preparing to cut its inflation forecasts on Thursday.     A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially subduing demand.            Spot gold        was down 0.2 percent at $1,291.1 an ounce at 1345 GMT. On Tuesday, it gained 1.1 percent to hit its highest level since November last year at $1,295.97.

Indian tax changes over the weekend could increase demand for tola bars.      Tola is a traditional Indian measurement unit of 0.375 troy ounces.

In Britain, markets are worried the ruling Conservative party might not get a majority in Thursday's elections. Prime Minister Theresa May wants to increase her majority to strengthen Britain's hand in exit talks with the European Union.     Traders are also looking ahead to a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve next week.      We do expect gold to hit some turbulence as we approach the June Fed rate hike, but things could open up for the precious metal post-meeting if the central bank's language remains  dovish,  said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.     Among other precious metals, platinum        fell 0.7 percent to $949.5 an ounce and palladium        slid 1.6 percent to $839.5 after earlier touching $859.80 an ounce, its highest since Sept. 2014.     Platinum is used mainly to make autocatalysts for diesel-fuelled cars, while palladium is mainly used for autocatalysts in gasoline-fuelled cars.      (Palladium has) a much broader exposure to global car markets. According to data from the United States, Europe and Japan, the recent slowdown in sales continued also in May,  Julius Baer analysts said in a note.      We stick to our negative view (on palladium) and short-position, expecting prices to realign with the weaker demand backdrop over the coming months.

He had led a campaign to find a journalist presumed abducted in 2014 and had repeatedly complained to police about death threats. The Maldives government denies targeting any critic unfairly and President Abdulla Yameen has condemned Rasheed's murder, vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice.

We welcome the government’s commitment to ensuring an objective and impartial investigation into the killing of blogger and prominent human rights defender, Yameen Rasheed,  Britain's ambassador Julian Braithwaite said in the statement, noting that Rasheed's father Hussain attended the session. The joint statement urged the government to  prevent the intimidation of human rights defenders , including by those who promote violent extremism.  Legitimate opposition remains a vital component of a healthy democracy, and it is essential that the freedoms of assembly and expression are granted to all.  Forum-Asia, a non-governmental organization which promotes human rights and development, welcomed the  unprecedented censure  at the council, adding that  the government is yet to hold a credible investigation  into Rasheed's murder.

In the meantime, corruption and violence are again spreading across Democratic Republic of Congo, long consigned to the ranks of the world's poorest countries by poor governance and a myriad of militia groups, despite copious mineral resources. The currency has lost more than half of its value in the past year and inflation is nearing 30 percent, prompting comparisons with the later rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, who was eventually ousted by Kabila's father in a civil war that went on to kill millions.  Today, we have to ask the question: do we let Congo collapse again?  said Daniel Mukoko Samba, a former budget minister under Kabila, referring to the 1990s, when massive corruption and rifts with Western donors under Mobutu sparked hyperinflation and economic disintegration.  Uncontrollable  When Kabila, in power since his father's assassination in 2001, refused to step down at the end of his mandate in December, many Congolese hoped protests could unseat him. Instead, he has weathered all challenges, maintaining a firm grip over the security forces that suppressed anti-government protests last year, killing dozens.  He has also co-opted opponents with government posts -- despite fears he aims to change the constitution so he can run again, a charge he has neither confirmed nor denied. Those opponents have duly stopped agitating for elections.   The planned funeral of leading opposition light Etienne Tshisekedi was expected to bring hundreds of thousands onto the streets in a rare moment of unity against Kabila. But Tshisekedi's party is feuding with officials over the burial place while the longstanding icon of Congo's democratic struggle has languished since February in a morgue in Brussels, where he went for medical treatment shortly before he died. The effects of all this 'glissement' -- slippage, as the Congolese call it -- has been to aggravate crises in the vast, central African nation once under Belgian colonial rule. More Congolese fled their homes due to violence last year than Syrians or Iraqis. An insurrection in Congo's normally peaceful center has killed hundreds since last August. Thousands escaped from Kinshasa's maximum security prison last month after an attack linked to a separatist group. Several expatriates have been kidnapped.  The administration is falling apart in the territories (areas outside Kinshasa), which have become practically uncontrollable,  said Jean Omasombo, a Congo expert at the Royal Central Africa Museum in Belgium.  Heading for Disaster  Large companies, even ones used to Congo's risk, are shying away. They are reluctant to speak on the record to avoid angering the government, but some of their actions suggest a move towards the exit. Last year Freeport McMoRan sold off its stake in the Tenke copper mine, one of the world's largest. It cited a desire to reduce its debts, though analysts say the operating environment played an important role in the decision. The Chamber of Commerce last week decried a deteriorating business climate in Congo's copper-mining southeast, including harassment by tax authorities to the tune of over $300 million in what it said were bogus customs duties.  We've clearly seen diminishing interest in Congo among large companies, especially Western ones,  said Vincent Rouget, Congo analyst at Control Risks.  Kabila's former Western allies are deserting him, just as they did Mobutu before him. The European Union and United States both slapped sanctions last week on Congolese officials who they say have committed human rights abuses and impeded progress toward elections. Western donors rejected Congolese requests for financial support last year.  Former Kabila minister Mukoko, now an economics professor at Kinshasa University, said a decade after donors withdrew support for Mobutu's Zaire, the country fell apart as war engulfed the east.  If the government says to itself 'we don't need a dialogue, we are going to do what we want,' we are heading for disaster,  he said. Congolese officials reject comparisons with the dying days of Mobutu, whose reign ended with regional wars that sucked in more than a half-dozen countries between 1996 and 2003.   Mobutu left due to a rebellion supported by the neighboring countries,  said Tryphon Kin Kiey Mulumba, a leader in Kabila's ruling coalition.  President Kabila ... has the support of the sub-region.  That support is being tested. Traditional ally Angola continues to publicly back him but has expressed growing alarm over insecurity as fighting in Kasai has driven 20,000 refugees across its border.

Fitch has also affirmed SEMAPA's EUR340 million euro medium-term programme (EMTN) at 'AA-'/'F1+' and the company's EUR250 million French commercial paper (Titres de creances negociables; TCNs) programme at 'F1+' KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch classifies SEMAPA as a credit-linked entity under its public-sector entities rating criteria, due to tight control by and strong support from its 92% owner and public sponsor, the City of Paris (AA/Stable/F1+). Despite its large development projects and part of its debt being guaranteed by the City of Paris, SEMAPA is rated one notch below its sponsor. This is because we do not view SEMAPA as a priority for the City of Paris in times of financial distress, at least for the non-guaranteed debt. The Outlook on SEMAPA reflects that on the city. As a developer, SEMAPA's role is to design, plan and realise urban projects. SEMAPA's developer activity implies financing equipment and works before cashing the revenue of building rights or contributions determined through the conventions a few years later. As a public limited company (SPLA), SEMAPA can only be owned by local authorities. The city exercises strong administrative, legal and financial oversight over SEMAPA, in the same way it oversees its own departments. Fitch believes this should help keep SEMAPA's budget in check and to anticipate potential cash flow problems. SEMAPA's long-term debt (EUR300 million at end-2016) is not consolidated with Paris's accounts, but the city guarantees EUR224 million of SEMAPA's debt. In response to SEMAPA's increasing financial requirements, the City of Paris has decided to increase the total amount of its guarantee on SEMAPA's borrowing, up to EUR456 million, representing 80% of SEMAPA's total debt (EUR570 million) raised for the  Paris Rive Gauche  (PRG) project. PRG is the most important urban project in Ile-de-France region for which SEMAPA is the urban developer. SEMAPA can only operate within the mandates its shareholders assign to it, and in accordance with the law, it is only allowed to develop on territory that belongs to its shareholders. SEMAPA will be entrusted with new development projects assigned by the City of Paris, representing a 30% increase in its programme workload in the medium term. To this end, SEMAPA will modify its legal status in 2017 to extend its activity throughout the entire territory of Paris. Its current activity is mainly concentrated on the PRG project, which represents 90% of SEMAPA's total revenue. Fitch views SEMAPA's business risk as limited given that the financial risk of the company's activities is mostly borne by the City of Paris, which means the city is ultimately responsible for SEMAPA's rights and obligations at the end of each project. In case of modifications to a project or extension of the date of expiry (at was the case for the PRG project in 2015), Paris's financial contribution is adjusted to balance the project's budget. At end-2016, all operations managed by SEMAPA continued to post a balanced result. Due to limited equity (EUR7.9 million at end-2016) relative to the size of the operations, SEMAPA is forced to rely on external financing. Fitch expects financial needs to peak at EUR385.8 million in 2018, from an expected EUR322.4 million in 2017 (without taking into account new operations that may be entrusted to SEMAPA). To cover its financing needs, in addition to bank loans, SEMAPA benefits from diversified funding instruments with an EMTN programme with a ceiling of EUR340 million (of which 80% can be guaranteed by Paris), issue of NSV's bonds (Namensschuldverschreibung; German registered bonds) and a EUR250 million French commercial paper programme. This diversification reduces the risk of refinancing in the medium term. SEMAPA will also benefit from the sponsor's reputation on debt capital markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES A rating action on the City of Paris would be reflected in SEMAPA's ratings. Changes indicating a weakening of the city's control and financial support to SEMAPA could have a negative impact on its ratings.

The third attempt to create a super bourse by linking London and Frankfurt ended in March after European Union competition regulators opposed the deal, and German officials objected to the head office being based in Britain.  One of the lessons learned is that consolidation across the exchange business, at least in Europe, is currently not supported by politicians and regulators,  Deutsche Boerse CFO Gregor Pottmeyer said at the Sandler O'Neill Global Exchanges and Brokerage Conference at Le Parker Meridien Hotel in New York City. He said uncertainty as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union also did not help the exchange M&A; landscape, so Deutsche Boerse would focus on areas where the political dependency to get a deal done is not as strong.  That means looking at index, data and analytics businesses, as well as foreign exchange and commodities, he said.  But overall, it always needs two for a tango and therefore our focus is on our standalone strategy, but we are also open for these kinds of M&A; opportunities,  he said. The focus on data and index business acquisitions mirrors the recent actions of two of Deutsche Boerse's biggest rivals. Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) said last Thursday it reached an agreement to acquire Bank of America Merrill Lynch's (BAC.N) global research index platform for an undisclosed amount. Two days earlier, LSE said it agreed to buy Citigroup's (C.N) Yield Book fixed-income analytics service and its related indexing business for $685 million in cash, the exchange group's first big deal since the Deutsche Boerse merger fell through. LSE said the Citi acquisition would boost the size and capabilities of its FTSE Russell indexes business, taking assets under management using its indexes to about $15 trillion.

Germany plans to move the 280 German troops to an air base in Jordan but has stressed it wants to minimize any disruption to the U.S.-led coalition operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, of which it is part. Turkey has refused to allow German lawmakers to make what they see as a routine visit to the base, saying that Berlin needs to improve its attitude towards Turkey first.  Turkey was infuriated when Germany, citing security concerns, banned some Turkish politicians from campaigning on its soil, where many Turks live. Ankara responded by accusing Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics and reigniting a row over Incirlik.  Given that Turkey is currently not in a position to allow German parliamentarians the right to visit Incirlik, the cabinet today agreed to move the Bundeswehr (armed forces) from Incirlik to Jordan,  Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen told reporters. German armed forces are subordinated to parliament, not the government, meaning lawmakers have oversight of the troops. Some  want a full parliamentary vote on the withdrawal but one official told Reuters that would not happen.

She will brief cabinet and parliament next week. She has said withdrawing German refueling aircraft would take two to three weeks, and the relocation of reconnaissance jets two to three months. Slideshow (2 Images)Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel made a last attempt on Monday to persuade Ankara to avert a pullout but said Turkey had again refused the visit for  domestic political reasons.  Chancellor Angela Merkel, running for a fourth term in the  September election, stressed that the two countries have mutual interests and must keep talking even after the withdrawal.  We have a huge range of common interests with Turkey and also close economic relations so discussions are very necessary,  she said, also pointing to the migrant crisis. Critics accuse Merkel of cozying up to President Tayyip Erdogan to secure his help in stemming the flow of migrants to western Europe. Relations between the NATO allies have soured significantly  in the last year. Ankara reacted angrily to German and European concerns over a domestic crackdown after a failed coup attempt last July. Berlin is also demanding the release of a German-Turkish journalist in jail in Istanbul on charges of propaganda in support of a terrorist organization and inciting violence.

With what's going on here, it'll be a miracle if it happens by Dec. 31,  said Kalala, surveying an impatient crowd of 100 residents outside a secondary school. Congolese have flocked to register in Kinshasa since voter enrolment began in the capital last week. Many said they hoped for an eventual end to two decades of Kabila family rule while holding out little hope for a vote this year. The election should have taken place by the end of last year and voter registration began in some parts of the country almost a year ago, but the election commission has said technical delays may mean the new deadline has to be pushed back. In the meantime, corruption and violence are again spreading across Democratic Republic of Congo, long consigned to the ranks of the world's poorest countries by poor governance and a myriad of militia groups, despite copious mineral resources. The currency has lost more than half of its value in the past year and inflation is nearing 30 percent, prompting comparisons with the later rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, who was eventually ousted by Kabila's father in a civil war that went on to kill millions.  Today, we have to ask the question: do we let Congo collapse again?  said Daniel Mukoko Samba, a former budget minister under Kabila, referring to the 1990s, when massive corruption and rifts with Western donors under Mobutu sparked hyperinflation and economic disintegration.  Uncontrollable  When Kabila, in power since his father's assassination in 2001, refused to step down at the end of his mandate in December, many Congolese hoped protests could unseat him. Instead, he has weathered all challenges, maintaining a firm grip over the security forces that suppressed anti-government protests last year, killing dozens.  He has also co-opted opponents with government posts -- despite fears he aims to change the constitution so he can run again, a charge he has neither confirmed nor denied. Those opponents have duly stopped agitating for elections.   The planned funeral of leading opposition light Etienne Tshisekedi was expected to bring hundreds of thousands onto the streets in a rare moment of unity against Kabila. But Tshisekedi's party is feuding with officials over the burial place while the longstanding icon of Congo's democratic struggle has languished since February in a morgue in Brussels, where he went for medical treatment shortly before he died. The effects of all this 'glissement' -- slippage, as the Congolese call it -- has been to aggravate crises in the vast, central African nation once under Belgian colonial rule. More Congolese fled their homes due to violence last year than Syrians or Iraqis. An insurrection in Congo's normally peaceful center has killed hundreds since last August. Thousands escaped from Kinshasa's maximum security prison last month after an attack linked to a separatist group. Several expatriates have been kidnapped.  The administration is falling apart in the territories (areas outside Kinshasa), which have become practically uncontrollable,  said Jean Omasombo, a Congo expert at the Royal Central Africa Museum in Belgium.  Heading for Disaster  Large companies, even ones used to Congo's risk, are shying away. They are reluctant to speak on the record to avoid angering the government, but some of their actions suggest a move towards the exit. Last year Freeport McMoRan sold off its stake in the Tenke copper mine, one of the world's largest. It cited a desire to reduce its debts, though analysts say the operating environment played an important role in the decision. The Chamber of Commerce last week decried a deteriorating business climate in Congo's copper-mining southeast, including harassment by tax authorities to the tune of over $300 million in what it said were bogus customs duties.  We've clearly seen diminishing interest in Congo among large companies, especially Western ones,  said Vincent Rouget, Congo analyst at Control Risks.  Kabila's former Western allies are deserting him, just as they did Mobutu before him. The European Union and United States both slapped sanctions last week on Congolese officials who they say have committed human rights abuses and impeded progress toward elections. Western donors rejected Congolese requests for financial support last year.  Former Kabila minister Mukoko, now an economics professor at Kinshasa University, said a decade after donors withdrew support for Mobutu's Zaire, the country fell apart as war engulfed the east.  If the government says to itself 'we don't need a dialogue, we are going to do what we want,' we are heading for disaster,  he said. Congolese officials reject comparisons with the dying days of Mobutu, whose reign ended with regional wars that sucked in more than a half-dozen countries between 1996 and 2003.   Mobutu left due to a rebellion supported by the neighboring countries,  said Tryphon Kin Kiey Mulumba, a leader in Kabila's ruling coalition.  President Kabila ... has the support of the sub-region.  That support is being tested. Traditional ally Angola continues to publicly back him but has expressed growing alarm over insecurity as fighting in Kasai has driven 20,000 refugees across its border.

It would follow an upward revision in April, when the central bank signaled that growth was shifting into higher gear after emerging from the doldrums. But inflation remains stubbornly weak and may force the BOJ to again cut its price forecast at a quarterly review of its projections in July, the people said. The disconnect between growth and inflation suggests the BOJ will be in no rush to withdraw the massive monetary support put in place to meet its 2 percent inflation target, analysts say.  Almost all components of the economy are performing well. There's no doubt the economy is in pretty good shape,  one of the people said.  Inflation, on the other hand, has been underperforming,  the person added, a view echoed by two other sources. At the previous policy meeting in April, the BOJ offered the most optimistic assessment in nine years to say the economy has been  turning toward a moderate expansion.  The central bank will brighten the language to describe the economy as  expanding moderately,  either at a rate review on June 15-16 or the following meeting in July, the people said. The change underscores a growing view within the BOJ that the benefits of the export-driven recovery are broadening and pushing up domestic demand, making it resilient to any future slowdown in overseas shipments, they said. Price Forecast Cut Eyed Japan's economy grew in the first quarter at its fastest pace in a year on robust exports and a helpful boost from private consumption. Analysts expect the economy to continue growing above its potential as long as overseas demand holds up. Still, core consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in April from a year earlier, as companies remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away price-sensitive households. Wage growth remains tame, dashing central bankers' hopes that a tightening job market will lead to higher wages and give households more income to spend. The yen's JPY= recent rebound and stalling oil price rises LCOc1  also mean the boost to inflation from higher import costs could be smaller than initially expected, analysts say. The BOJ may thus cut its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year at its July 19-20 rate review, when it conducts a quarterly review of its projections, the sources said. The central bank now projects core consumer inflation to hit 1.4 percent in the year ending March 2018 and 1.7 percent in fiscal 2018. That is far more optimistic than forecasts made by analysts in a Reuters poll in May that inflation will hit 0.7 percent in the current fiscal year and 0.9 percent the following year.  Consumption is holding up, but is not strong enough to convince companies they can now raise prices,  said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  I can't see how the BOJ can avoid cutting its inflation forecast in July. The question is how big the cut would be.  After four years of heavy money printing failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework last year to one better suited for a long-term battle against deflation. Despite a strengthening economy, the BOJ is seen lagging well behind its U.S. and European counterparts in normalizing monetary policy given stubbornly low inflation. Of the eight policy-setting meetings held each year, the BOJ reviews its long-term growth and price forecasts at four, including one in July. It also issues a verbal assessment of the state of the economy and inflation at all eight meetings.

Many banks in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain suspended new business with Qatar soon after their governments cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism. But it was still unclear on Wednesday whether tens of billions of dollars of existing deals - from loans to bank deposits and cross-border shareholdings, as well as merchandise trade contracts - would have to be unwound, and if so how fast. That left bankers and businessmen in limbo as they  continued to insist to clients that commercial links had not been severed, even though their ability to service these links was in doubt.  Customers keep asking the bank whether it is still operating in UAE and the bank’s response is, it's business as usual,  said an executive at a Qatari bank in the UAE. He added that the UAE business did not do interbank deals locally and obtained funding from its head office in Doha, so it was able for now to continue corporate and retail banking. Like most other businessmen, he declined to be named when talking about Qatar because of political sensitivities. The UAE has threatened anyone publishing expressions of sympathy towards Qatar with up to 15 years in prison. The UAE central bank issued a statement saying payments and remittances in the UAE financial system were occurring normally after the diplomatic split, but it did not specify whether UAE banks would be required to close out their exposure to Qatar. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Reuters that the UAE could not rule out more curbs on bilateral business. He did not give details of banking policy. Bank Guidance Bankers in Riyadh said they had received informal guidance from the central bank which essentially banned new transactions with any Qatari institution.  The guidance was ambiguous about whether existing deals, such as syndicated loans involving Saudi and Qatari banks, could remain in place. The bankers said they hoped to clarify the new policy in coming days. The Saudi, UAE, Bahraini and Qatari central banks did not respond to requests for comment. Some bankers believe the lack of official guidance is deliberate - if the diplomatic crisis can be resolved within days or weeks, all sides could save money by avoiding a forced sale of assets in each other's countries.  There is still a feeling that this will be resolved,  said a banker at a major international institution which does a lot of business with Qatar. But the head of Middle Eastern debt capital markets at a European bank in Dubai said his institution had put all new Qatari business on hold while it awaited guidance from the UAE central bank, which was expected to imitate Riyadh's policy. The chief executive of an Abu Dhabi bank said he was bracing for the possibility that he would have to close out his Qatar exposure by boosting his access to ready funds.  Stopping new business was relatively easy - the difficulty would be unwinding existing business,  he said.  Exposure Trade and investment between Qatar and other Gulf countries is small compared to the size of their economies. Countries rely heavily on oil and gas exports and obtain most imports from outside the region; the UAE is Qatar's biggest trading partner among Gulf Arab states but only its fifth largest globally. Nevertheless, there is significant banking exposure. Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, estimated the Saudi banking sector’s total exposure to Qatar, including loans and customer and interbank deposits, totaled up to $30 billion. The exposure of UAE banks is believed to be in the same area. Individual companies have big cross-border physical assets. Dubai's DAMAC Properties last month launched a 31-storey residential tower project at Lusail in Doha; UAE-based retail conglomerate Majid Al Futtaim has Qatari outlets.  Shares in QG Medical Devices, a Doha-based maker of medical equipment that has done considerable business in Saudi Arabia, have plunged 18 percent since Monday. Even where doing business with Qatar is still technically possible, it is becoming harder in practice. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are expelling all Qatari citizens; foreigners who live in Qatar and have Qatari residence visas are not eligible for visas on arrival in the UAE, Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways said. This makes moving staff around the region more difficult for multinational companies which in the past have saved money by treating Gulf Arab countries as a single market. One Western multinational, citing the political tensions, asked its staff in the Middle East on Wednesday not to communicate with clients about Qatar at all.  The chief executive of a regional private equity firm said some foreign banks might ultimately be forced out of Qatar.  If the rift continues, international banks will be told by Saudi to choose between the two camps.

The Power of Siberia pipeline, expected to be launched by the end of the decade or in the early 2020s, should bring 38 bcm to China per year.

The pound has fallen 2.5 percent in trade-weighted terms in less than four weeks =GBP as opinion polls showed the opposition Labour party gaining ground on the ruling Conservatives before polling day, raising the prospect of no party winning an overall parliamentary majority and some form of coalition government emerging.  U.S. futures market positioning data shows investors have flipped back to betting more against the pound 1096742NNET.  However, even if the Conservatives prove the polls wrong and secure an increased majority of parliamentary seats, many hedge funds expect any recovery in sterling to be short-lived.    We think the pound will fall because we think investors have been taking the elections and the cost of Brexit too much under the radar -– they are under-estimating the risks,  said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro at $9 billion fund Algebris Investments.  He said he is positioned for the pound to fall due to long-standing problems in the British economy, regardless of Thursday's result.  We think there is a strong chance that sterling would fall again because of consumer high debt levels in the UK and the distance between the UK negotiating positions and the European ones,  he said. Traditional views of whether Conservatives or Labour are good or bad for the pound have been muddied in this election, with some banks saying a high spending Labour government could be a boon for the economy. But whatever the makeup of the future government, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union remains the biggest unknown. Stephen Coltman, a senior investment manager at financial giant Aberdeen Asset Management, which invests directly in about 130 hedge funds, also said there is  definitely a bearish view among hedge fund managers on sterling .  The majority view amongst the managers we speak to is that the pound is likely to depreciate versus both the euro and the US dollar over the medium term irrespective of the election result,  said Coltman.  If the Tories win with a strong majority you could see sterling rally on the night, but I believe most managers would be inclined to sell in to that rally.  Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio management at specialist currency manager Millennium Global in London, said he assumed the market would quickly move back to Brexit issues once the election results were in.  I assume that May will win and maybe slightly extend the current majority and then you will get a 1 percent pop in sterling,  he said.  But then we move on to the next story - which is a hard Brexit.  Divide The polls have painted a wildly varying picture of British public opinion going into Thursday's vote. Some say May is only 1-3 points ahead and will fall short of an overall majority. Others that she leads by 10 points or more, enough for a 100 seat landslide. Bookmakers' odds stand somewhere in between but still bet overwhelmingly on the Conservatives forming the next government.  A hung Parliament would be seen as a negative short-term for negotiations, resulting in lower Sterling, but we think it may actually turn into a softer stance versus Theresa May’s antagonistic approach medium term,  said Gallo at Algebris Investments.     Philippe Ferreira, head of hedge funds research at Lyxor Asset Management, said human-led so-called 'macro' hedge funds that sit on his firm's platform are overall short sterling.       A hung Parliament would likely translate into additional challenges in dealing with the EU; increasing the likelihood of a bad deal or no deal at all,  said Ferreira, whose firm invests $16.4 billion in alternative investments, including hedge funds. But there are those who believe the fall will be short-lived and offer an opportunity to pick up the currency cheaply.     My assumption is still that we will get to a favourable outcome for the Conservatives and in a week’s time we will get back to the path we were on before she called an election,  said Stephen Jen, founder of London-based hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital.       I know that sterling is under pressure. It may travel back to the mid $1.20s before the election. That would be the low and an opportunity to buy.

Chambers will join as non-executive director and chairman designate on Sept. 1 before becoming chairman on Nov. 1, Anglo said in a statement. Anglo's share price was up 1.24 percent at 1058 pence at 1330 GMT, when the FTSE mining sector index was up 0.8 percent. Analysts said that the former chairman of ARM, regarded as Britain's most successful technology company, could prove a shrewd choice as Anglo American focuses on technological fixes to improve margins. They also noted Chambers' experience in handling big takeovers. He presided over the sales last year of ARM, to Japan's Softbank for $32 billion, and Rexam to Ball Corp for 4.43 billion pounds ($5.7 billion). Parker will step down on Oct. 31 after serving eight years as chairman, including seeing the company through the commodity price crash in 2015-16 that hit Anglo American particularly badly. Last year shares in Anglo recovered strongly, leading gains by FTSE 100 index constituents with a 300 percent rise, having fallen by 75 percent in 2015. This year the recovery has stalled as the commodity price rally has faltered. Challenges for management also include a need to ascertain the intentions of Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, the head of Indian miner Vedanta Resources who has bought a 2 billion-pound ($2.58 billion) stake in the company. So far Agarwal has said he views the stake as an investment by his family trust, not by Vedanta, and is not seeking to take control of the company. However, analysts and industry sources predict he will at the very least add to the pressure on Anglo American to deliver returns as activist shareholders target the mining sector, widely regarded as undervalued, and demand reforms.  This new chairman is from one of the best-run companies focused on technology,  said one senior industry source, who asked not to be named.  Anglo knows it has to change because it had a near-death experience,  he said in reference to the 2015 price crash. Anglo's chief executive Mark Cutifani also said Chambers was bringing relevant skills in  technology-led innovation  and would help to continue to rebuild Anglo.  We have materially restored Anglo American's balance sheet and transformed the business performance over the last three years, and our task now is to unlock the very considerable value that we can see from our world-class asset base,  Cutifani said. Before serving as chairman of ARM and Rexam until 2016, Chambers, aged 61, was a non-executive director at British retailer Tesco until 2015 and was previously a top executive at glassmakers Pilkington and its subsequent parent Nippon Sheet Glass. He began his career at oil major Shell as a chemical engineer.  Anglo American has emerged from the commodity price downturn more resilient and with a renewed sense of purpose, both strategically and in terms of the role it plays in society,  Chambers said.

France's new President Emmanuel Macron is leading the charge to keep the momentum on the landmark accord that was reached in the French capital in 2015, after a pullout decision by Trump that drew condemnation from world leaders.  The aim of the president and Nicolas Hulot (Ecology Minister) is to go beyond the targets we set ourselves within the framework of the Paris agreement,  government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters after a government meeting. Castaner said a detailed list of policy actions would be issued in the next 15 days. He said they would lay out climate changes for the next five years and also seek to show where France will exceed its previous commitments. The government will also launch a website dedicated to attract climate change researchers from the United States and other countries as well as businesses involved in climate-linked innovation to France, Castaner said. Macron and Hulot met non-governmental organisations, businesses and researchers on Tuesday to hear proposals that could help France exceed its earlier climate commitments.  There is momentum and France wants to seize it. President Trump's decision gives us the opportunity to accelerate these decisions and policies,  a source at Macron's office said on Tuesday. Details of the policy actions have not been circulated in public but the source said initiatives on a carbon floor price, climate finance and increased development of renewable energy sources to curb French dependence on nuclear power could be among the proposals.

The pound has fallen 2.5 percent in trade-weighted terms in less than four weeks =GBP as opinion polls showed the opposition Labour party gaining ground on the ruling Conservatives before polling day, raising the prospect of no party winning an overall parliamentary majority and some form of coalition government emerging.  U.S. futures market positioning data shows investors have flipped back to betting more against the pound 1096742NNET.  However, even if the Conservatives prove the polls wrong and secure an increased majority of parliamentary seats, many hedge funds expect any recovery in sterling to be short-lived.    We think the pound will fall because we think investors have been taking the elections and the cost of Brexit too much under the radar -– they are under-estimating the risks,  said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro at $9 billion fund Algebris Investments.  He said he is positioned for the pound to fall due to long-standing problems in the British economy, regardless of Thursday's result.  We think there is a strong chance that sterling would fall again because of consumer high debt levels in the UK and the distance between the UK negotiating positions and the European ones,  he said. Traditional views of whether Conservatives or Labour are good or bad for the pound have been muddied in this election, with some banks saying a high spending Labour government could be a boon for the economy. But whatever the makeup of the future government, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union remains the biggest unknown. Stephen Coltman, a senior investment manager at financial giant Aberdeen Asset Management, which invests directly in about 130 hedge funds, also said there is  definitely a bearish view among hedge fund managers on sterling .  The majority view amongst the managers we speak to is that the pound is likely to depreciate versus both the euro and the US dollar over the medium term irrespective of the election result,  said Coltman.  If the Tories win with a strong majority you could see sterling rally on the night, but I believe most managers would be inclined to sell in to that rally.  Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio management at specialist currency manager Millennium Global in London, said he assumed the market would quickly move back to Brexit issues once the election results were in.  I assume that May will win and maybe slightly extend the current majority and then you will get a 1 percent pop in sterling,  he said.  But then we move on to the next story - which is a hard Brexit.  Divide The polls have painted a wildly varying picture of British public opinion going into Thursday's vote. Some say May is only 1-3 points ahead and will fall short of an overall majority. Others that she leads by 10 points or more, enough for a 100 seat landslide. Bookmakers' odds stand somewhere in between but still bet overwhelmingly on the Conservatives forming the next government.  A hung Parliament would be seen as a negative short-term for negotiations, resulting in lower Sterling, but we think it may actually turn into a softer stance versus Theresa May’s antagonistic approach medium term,  said Gallo at Algebris Investments.     Philippe Ferreira, head of hedge funds research at Lyxor Asset Management, said human-led so-called 'macro' hedge funds that sit on his firm's platform are overall short sterling.       A hung Parliament would likely translate into additional challenges in dealing with the EU; increasing the likelihood of a bad deal or no deal at all,  said Ferreira, whose firm invests $16.4 billion in alternative investments, including hedge funds. But there are those who believe the fall will be short-lived and offer an opportunity to pick up the currency cheaply.     My assumption is still that we will get to a favourable outcome for the Conservatives and in a week’s time we will get back to the path we were on before she called an election,  said Stephen Jen, founder of London-based hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital.       I know that sterling is under pressure. It may travel back to the mid $1.20s before the election. That would be the low and an opportunity to buy.

Gazprom, which is already building a gas pipeline from Eastern Siberia to China - the Power of Siberia - was in talks over two more routes: the so-called western gas route and a gas pipeline from the Pacific Island of Sakhalin.   The Power of Siberia-2 (the western route) and the Sakhalin pipeline - there are no moves. There are a lot of factors and they (China) are not yet ready to take any decisions,  a source familiar with the Russia-China energy talks said.  A Gazprom source also said there were no developments on the two pipelines, whose combined capacity, if built, is seen adding up to another 40 billion cubic meters (bcm) in possible gas supplies from Russia to China per year.  The Power of Siberia pipeline, expected to be launched by the end of the decade or in the early 2020s, should bring 38 bcm to China per year. Gazprom managed to clinch the Power of Siberia deal after ten years of painstaking talks with Beijing.  Neither Gazprom nor state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) immediately responded to requests for comment. According to BP's energy outlook to 2035, the share of pipeline gas supplies to China, including from Russia, will remain largely unchanged over the ten years from 2025, with the share of LNG and China's own gas output significantly rising.

The measure, to be signed by Mayor Ed Murray on Tuesday, was approved on a 7-1 vote despite staunch opposition from the American Beverage Association, which said the tax would hit poor and working-class families and small businesses hardest. Enactment will add Washington state's largest city to a growing national movement seeking to curb consumption of soft drinks and other high-caloric beverages that medical experts say are largely to blame for an epidemic of childhood obesity. Other localities that have adopted similar measures during the past few years include Philadelphia, San Francisco, its Bay-area neighbors of Berkeley, Oakland and Albany, California, Boulder, Colorado, and Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago. A growing body of research has identified sugary drinks as the biggest contributors to added, empty calories in the American diet, and as a major culprit in a range of costly health problems associated with being overweight. Under the measure, due to go into effect in January, distributors of all bottled and canned sodas, juice drinks, sports and energy drinks, flavored waters, sweetened teas and ready-to-drink coffee beverages sold in Seattle would pay a tax of 1.75 cents per ounce.  At that rate, the cost of a typical 12-ounce can of soda would rise by 21 cents. An equivalent rate would be collected on the syrups used to sweeten fountain drinks sold by restaurants, convenience stores and fast-food outlets in the city. As higher costs are passed on to consumers, supporters aim to put a dent in sales, as was the case in Berkeley, where according to public health officials retail purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages dropped nearly 10 percent during the first year of that city's soda tax. The new Seattle soda levy is projected to generate about $15 million in revenue a year. One-hundred-percent fruit juices and zero-calorie diet drinks are to be exempted, along with dairy-based beverages.  But the language of the measure leaves unclear whether an exemption applies to syrups used in milk-based coffee drinks prepared to order by baristas in coffee shops including those in the Seattle-based Starbucks chain. City Councilman Tim Burgess, the measure's chief sponsor, said those details would be ironed out through implementing regulations still to be developed by the mayor's office. Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Tom James; Editing by Steve Gorman and Michael Perry","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-seattle-sodatax-idUSKBN18X09T"},

The 70-year-old Deuba replaced Prachanda, a former rebel commander, as prime minister after a parliamentary vote on Tuesday. He has pledged to complete the remaining phase of village and municipal assembly elections set for June 28, leading to provincial and national elections before the end of the year.  The first phase of local polls was held on May 14.  These are early appointments and the prime minister will expand the cabinet in consultation with coalition partners,” said Deuba's aide and nephew, Bhanu Deuba. Nepal's President Bidhya Devi Bhandari (L) administers the oath of office to the newly-elected Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba (R), in the presence of outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal also known as Prachanda (2nd L) and Constituent Assembly chairperson Onsari Gharti Magar (3rd L) at the presidential building in Kathmandu, Nepal June 7, 2017. REUTER/Navesh ChitrakarThe main appointment was Home Minister Janardan Sharma, a former guerrilla fighter, who will be in charge of overseeing all three elections the government hopes will complete a difficult transition since the monarchy was abolished in 2008. Slideshow (6 Images)The president's office said three members of the ethnic Madhesi minority were among the seven appointments. Those appointments are seen as a bid to appease the Madhesis, who live on the southern plains bordering India and say a new constitution that creates new provinces will unfairly consolidate the power of the country's hill elite over them. Among others appointed to the cabinet was Krishna Bahadur Mahara, also a Maoist, who will be a deputy prime minister in charge of the foreign ministry, the president's office said in a statement.

Sales of the PlayStation VR headset, released in October, have  exceeded our expectations,  Atsushi Morita, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment Japan Asia, said in an interview.  We are boosting production and a supply shortage should be solved accordingly,  Morita told Reuters. The sales momentum supports analysts' view that Sony is in a good position to build an early lead in the high-end VR headset race with its more modest price tag and by tapping the nearly 60 million users of its flagship PlayStation 4 console. The headset, designed to work with the PlayStation 4 rather than requiring new equipment, retails at $399, cheaper than Facebook Inc's $599 Oculus Rift and HTC Corp's $799 Vive. According to researcher IDC, about 2 million VR headsets were shipped worldwide in the first three months of 2017. Excluding cheaper smartphone-based headsets, Sony ranked top with 429,000 units. Morita stressed it was still the beginning of Sony's long-term vision of VR eventually taking over functions offered by television sets.  I believe that VR technology is the (greatest) innovation since the birth of television,  he said.  VR allows you to travel to World Heritage sites or to space while staying at home. It's like a time machine or a door to anywhere.

A handful of vegetables litter the floor below. Dinner is far from ready. The last meal that 15-year-old Murugesan ate was some rice and leftover lentils. More than eight hours later, and there is still no freshly cooked food in sight.  There is rice and my younger sister will make some rasam (tamarind based soup),  she said from the cramped kitchen of her two-room home in Manjanaickenpatti village in Tamil Nadu. Back from a 10-hour shift at a spinning mill, she says she is  not very hungry anyway, just very tired . Murugesan is one of up to 400,000 workers employed by some 1,600 mills in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, a major hub in India's $40 billion garment and textile industry. Like most adolescent girls employed by the industry, she is overworked, underweight, anemic and hungry at work, according to doctors who have been running health camps in the region.  More than 50 percent of the girls are hungry through the day, skipping meals or barely eating in their rush to get to work,  said Dr Bobby Joseph, head of the community health department at the Bengaluru-based St John's Medical College. In studying health in the garment sector, Joseph has mapped girls in Coimbatore, Dindigul, Tirupur and Erode districts. Nearly 45 percent are underweight, the study found, with most of the girls rarely eating fruit or veg. An Egg a Month The findings echo those of non-profit Serene Secular Social Service Society, which ran a health camp in Dindigul district that showed most of its young workers were also malnourished.  The meals they eat don't have sufficient calories,  said S James Victor, whose Society works on labour rights.  We found that 65 percent of them have broiler chicken or an egg once a month and only 11.2 percent have greens in a month. What they eat is not enough for the work they do.  Murugesan's favorite vegetable is a variety of broad beans topped with grated coconut. But she can't remember the last time she ate it.  We don't eat vegetables like that, we just add a few pieces to the lentils and then eat it with rice and pickle,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. A large portion of her roughly 5,500 rupees ($85) monthly salary goes on pain-relieving balms and medicines, not food, she added. Murugesan gets up at the crack of dawn, gulps a cup of tea and boards the factory bus at 6 a.m. for her 8 a.m. shift. Her first meal of the day is at the spinning mill at about 10 a.m. It is an unpalatable meal but she forces herself to eat a few mouthfuls to see her through the day, she said.  Often the rice in undercooked, sometimes there is too little salt, sometimes more,  she said. Since the management deducts a monthly canteen services fee of up to 750 rupees ($12), she brings no food from home. Some friends bring a small, steel lunch box, packed with rice and leftovers. But they still pay for the canteen, too.  Even if the food was good, we just get 30 minutes, in which we have to queue up to use the restroom and also finish our food. Every minute that we are late, we are fined.  A survey by non-profit Community Awareness Research Education Trust shows workers get less than 10 minutes to eat.  Most girls use the toilets during this break and it takes them a minimum 10 minutes,  said S.M. Prithviraj of the trust.  Another 10 minutes are spent in queuing up for plates, food, getting a glass of water and finding a place to sit. That gives each girl just about 10 minutes to eat her food, clear her plate and get back to the machine.   So most eat a little, gulp water and head back to work. Murugesan is back home by 7 p.m. Then she washes clothes, has a bath and eats a bit of dinner before sleeping.  I am very, very tired and it often feels like my body is like a machine,  she said.  All I can think of at the end of the day is to sleep. I eat a little because my mother insists.   Basic Welfare The industry, which produces yarn, fabric and garments for high-end brands, mostly employs young village women from poor, illiterate and low-caste communities.  They work up to 12 hours a day and say they routinely face intimidation, sexual remarks and harassment. Joseph's study identifies a  lack of concern  by management.  Because labour is cheap and available, they don't think it is necessary to invest more than the basic on their health needs,  he said. Workers don't have a say in the food served, said Victor, adding that traditional health boosters like palm jaggery and banana had been discontinued by most mills to cut costs. P.V. Chandran, vice president of the Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association, said it was unfair to paint the entire industry with the same brush, with many initiatives underway.  The women spend only eight hours in our mills, where we try and give them good food. The rest of the onus also lies with the family,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  For girls living in mill hostels, there is a constant endeavor to improve facilities. But sometimes it is the girls who say they don't want vegetables in the menu and demand spicy curries instead.  Velankani Muttiah, 18, admits to liking tangy gravies -  but not everyday . As she watches her mother kindle a fire to make rice for the night, she says all her co-workers complain of ill health.  We work in a trance,  she said.  And we all spend way too much on visiting doctors and buying medicines. We know fruits and vegetables are good for us, but we simply cannot afford it.

RCom said last week it had won a seven-month reprieve from lenders in India on its loan-servicing obligations as it pursues the sale of a stake in its tower company and the merger of its wireless unit with rival Aircel - asset deals that would allow it to cut its $7 billion debt pile by 60 percent. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday the step constituted a default under their ratings definitions, while warning the company would still have about 200 billion rupees ($3.1 billion) left in debt even if it pulled off the two deals. The ratings agencies reinforced market doubts about RCom's long-term debt, and its ability to pull off the two deals, sending shares down 4 percent. Bonds due 2020 recouped some losses but were still down half a point to 70/73 cents on the dollar. They have lost about a third of their value since mid-May.  We respectfully disagree with the recent rating actions by both these agencies, and believe that these rating actions do not reflect the servicing track record of the Company,  RCom said in a statement.  The rating agencies have not given due credit to the advanced stage of the corporate transactions.  RCom added it had met its coupon payments on the 6.5 percent bonds maturing in November 2020, while noting it was  fully current in servicing.  Deals Needed RCom Chairman Anil Ambani has said the company may pursue options including sale of a stake in its undersea cable unit to further cut debt. Costly airwave auctions had bruised India's telecom sector, but it was a price war triggered by the arrival last year of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, run by Anil's elder brother and India's richest man, that brought the sector to its knees. RCom is under pressure to show progress as it seeks to sell a 51 percent stake in its mobile towers unit to Canada's Brookfield Infrastructure Group for 110 billion rupees. It will own 50 percent of the mobile joint venture company to be called AirCom after merging its wireless business with rival Aircel. The company has said it will complete those two deals by Sept. 30 after getting necessary approvals. Fitch cast doubt on whether RCom would be able to even accomplish those two deals, highlighting the  weakening cash generation  in the Indian wireless sector and warning about RCom's cash flow. Other market players were also sceptical.  We have started sharpening our pencils on the situation. My gut feeling is those two are not done deals,  said a distressed-debt investor, who requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter. Failure to clinch the deals could see lenders acquire control of RCom by converting part of their loans to equity, raising alarm among bondholders, amid persistent doubts about its long-term debt levels.  We have been getting calls from Chinese banks who have exposure to Reliance Communications and want to get rid of it,  said a banker who offloaded debt exposure to the company in 2016 and took a 'haircut' of 10 cents on the dollar in the process. It was not immediately known how much RCom owes the Chinese banks. In 2012, Chinese state banks agreed to lend $1.18 billion to the company.

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America. It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said. The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide  a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand,  said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer, in a media briefing. Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV (MBLY.N), which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O). Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies' statement said. French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA) will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev's chief performance officer.    The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing.    Initially, the vehicles will have  safety  drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added.    Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions.  Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries.  The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA (VIE.PA), the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years.

Short-sell campaigns have gained pace in Hong Kong in recent years, with an uptick that investors say underscores persistent problems with governance, disclosure and specifically market manipulation, which they say is not being tackled by regulators. Carson Block, founder of research firm Muddy Waters, and GeoInvesting co-founder Dan David outlined their new positions to a packed audience of hedge fund managers and bankers in the city, sending the shares of targeted firms tumbling. The short-sell positions unveiled brings the number of such campaigns against Hong Kong companies to at least seven this year, putting 2017 on track for a potential six-year high, according to Activist Insight data. Block shot to fame using his own money to bet that shares in Chinese companies he believed were overvalued would fall. A report from Muddy Waters accusing Toronto-listed Sino-Forest Corp. of fraud in 2011 prompted a regulatory investigation, and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012. More recently he has targeted China's Huishan Dairy. Block, whose presence this year made for standing-room only at the Sohn Hong Kong Investment Conference, said he had a short position in sofa-maker Man Wah Holdings, which he accused of financial irregularities including inflated profit margins. The company's stock fell more than 15 percent before being halted. David, who last month targeted property and healthcare company Fullshare Holdings, presented his short position on Dali Foods Group, which he accused of suspect finances including inconsistencies in its tax filings. Shares in the company fell more than 7 percent. Representatives for Man Wah Holdings and Dali Food Groups could not immediately be reached for comment. Face Time Block moved from Hong Kong to California in 2012 after receiving death threats, and since then public appearances by top short sellers in the city have been rare. Along with peers such as Jon Carnes of Alfred Little, Block helped wipe more than $21 billion off the value of U.S.-listed Chinese companies during the first wave of such campaigns between 2009 to 2011, with several targets ultimately delisted. Since then, Block and other new arrivals to the scene including Anonymous Analytics, Gotham City and most recently Blazing Research, have set their sights on Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong, where they say loose rules and poor enforcement continues to allow dodgy companies to thrive. In particular, Hong Kong's low free float requirement of just 25 percent makes it easy for listed companies to manipulate their own stock price, attracting short-sellers who screen for irregular trading activity as a major red flag, they said.  We don't think there are more pure frauds out there than before. However, there are noticeably more manipulated stocks out there, and that's just going to attract attention,  Anonymous Analytics, which made its name targeting Tianhe Chemicals Group in 2014, said in an email.  Hong Kong needs to do something about this problem.  The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has said stamping out malfeasance by public companies is a top priority, while former SFC chief Martin Wheatley told the Sohn Conference, a charitable event that raises money to fight childhood cancer, that short-sellers were helping to keep companies in check. The Hong Kong stock exchange, meanwhile, now requires companies to quickly address allegations - making for more protracted campaigns as the companies and short-sellers swap public rebuttals. Chinese companies, notoriously opaque and historically inclined to intimidate short-sellers, are fighting back through public relations campaigns, hiring corporate communications consultants and openly engaging with the press. The management of Credit China Fintech Holdings and AAC Technologies Holdings, both held open press briefings to discuss allegations made against them last month by Anonymous Analytics and Gotham City respectively - a rare event. These public rebuttals do seem to help the share price, say short sellers and corporate communications executives. But it is unclear how long for.  Although these active responses may show confidence of management, institutional and professional investors will only evaluate a company based on arguments and evidence,  Blazing Research, an anonymous new research firm that recently targeted Cogobuy Group, said in an email.  These public rebuttals may only be effective to persuade retails investors.

Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge to ditch the landmark accord to tackle global warming. Trump chose to walk away from nearly every other nation in the world on one of the most pressing challenges of the century. But Satyarthi said his action would hit the poorest hardest.  I have been advocating for years on the very direct effect of climate change and global warming on the trafficking, migration and slavery of children,  Satyarthi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I would appeal to Mr Trump to reconsider his decision, but if he doesn't, then definitely it is going to create more harm for children, as they are often the biggest victims of disasters.  A prominent child rights activist, Satyarthi said disasters were already pushing poor rural families so deeply into poverty that many were exploited by traffickers, who promise good jobs and decent pay for their children, only to enslave them. In 2014, Satyarthi was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize with Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai for his work on curbing child labor and advocating for their right to education. Trump drew worldwide condemnation with his decision to withdraw from the 2015 agreement to cut emissions, saying it undermined the U.S. economy and cost Americans their jobs. Scientists say climate change will mean more intense weather events, which will not only hit agricultural output and food security, but also lead to water shortages and trigger outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue. They say climate change will severely impact countries such as India, where many of its 1.3 billion people live in areas vulnerable to hazards such as floods, droughts and cyclones. Post-disaster human trafficking is already common in regions such as South Asia where the breakdown of institutions in devastated areas creates difficulties in securing food and humanitarian supplies, leaving women and children vulnerable. Satyarthi's charity Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood Movement) is credited with rescuing more than 80,000 enslaved children.

Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems installed 365 turbines at Lake Turkana in the hot desert north of the east African country in March, completing construction in less than a year and two months ahead of schedule.  The project, which the government says will produce around 300 megawatts (MW) of power, is located in one of Africa's windiest places. Costing 70 billion Kenyan shillings ($678 million), it is the country's largest single private investment and closely watched by investors looking for opportunities in African renewable energy.   The wind farm had planned to begin producing power this month, but construction of the transmission line to the power grid, being built by state-run Kenya Transmission Company (KETRACO), has been delayed.  The challenge is now to get the wind farms connected to the grid and that is indeed a project which is not with us,  head of Vestas' Central European and sub-Saharan business Nils de Baar told Reuters in an interview at the Africa Energy Forum in Copenhagen.  The expectation is that it will happen in early 2018,  he said, adding that the project is Vestas' largest-ever in terms of the number of wind turbines being installed. The 428 km powerline from Loiyangalani in northern Kenya to Suswa in the centre of the country was due to be completed by October last year, but demands for compensation from landowners along the route and other issues have delayed it. Once in operation, the Turkana Lake wind farm is expected to provide 15 percent of Kenya's total electricity needs.

Settlement payments must be directed to victims affected by the defendants' actions and then to the federal government, according to a statement on Wednesday by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It was the latest action by the Republican Trump administration to end policies put in place by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Such agreements were a feature of several U.S. settlements with banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Under Obama, the Justice Department aimed to hold banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. From 2013 to 2016, the department reached $46 billion in settlements with U.S. banks that in part directed funds to approved housing aid and other related groups. In Obama's final weeks in office, the department sued Barclays PLC over similar claims.  In recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes required or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement,  Sessions said in a statement.  We are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct.  The change could affect other banks still under federal investigations over mortgage issues such as Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Wells Fargo & Co, UBS Group AG and HSBC. Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached for comment. Sessions, in a one-page memo dated on Monday, told the nation's 94 U.S. attorney generals they could not make any agreements in civil or criminal cases  that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.  Sessions cited three exceptions to the new policy: payments or loans that directly aim to address harm such as to the environment or official corruption; legal or other professional services from the case; and restitution, forfeiture and other payments required by law. Sessions' memo raises questions about whether the Justice Department will finalize a $12 million settlement against Harley-Davidson Inc announced in August. The company also agreed to stop selling illegal after-market devices that cause its motorcycles to emit too much pollution. As part of the settlement, Harley agreed to spend $3 million on an unrelated project to reduce air pollution, the Justice Department said in August. The new policy would likely have barred part of the Environmental Protection Agency's diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen AG, which requires the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero emission vehicle efforts over 10 years.

The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday, partly over the tiny Gulf monarchy's alleged support for Islamist groups such as the Brotherhood.

The Kingdom's insistence on backing the obscene putschist (Egyptian) regime, providing it with financial and political support, attacking the moderate Islamist movement represented in the Muslim Brotherhood, and accusing it of terrorism, puts the Kingdom's credibility at stake,  the Brotherhood said. Egypt's military, then led by Sisi, ousted former President Mohamed Mursi, a Brotherhood leader, from power in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. The move was backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  Do not listen to the princes of oppression and injustice in the UAE, those corrupt men are a plague on the (Islamic) nation and the Kingdom both. They are the cohorts of Zionists and finances of oppression and obscenity,  the group said.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on Monday cut ties with Qatar, which denounced the move as based on lies about it supporting Islamist militants.  Qatar must be completely transparent and answer precisely the questions that have been asked notably by its neighbors. That's what France is asking for,  government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters in a weekly briefing.  It's not about taking sides. We are a country that is friends with these states and with which our cooperation is historic and deep, so we call on all parties to reconnect and to achieve that the questions have to be answered.   Castaner was responding to a question on whether Paris agreed with the accusation by the Saudi-led group that Qatar supported  terrorist  groups. Qatar vehemently denies this.    Speaking in Paris on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said Qatar must take several steps, including ending its support for the Palestinian group Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, to restore ties with other Arab states.  France nurtured close economic and military ties with Gulf Arab states and Egypt, which has included sales of fighter jets to both Cairo and Doha, under the previous Socialist government of then-President Francois Hollande.  It initially took almost a day to respond when Qatar crisis erupted on Monday and had wanted to position itself as being able to talk to all sides. New President Emmanuel Macron, who said during his election campaign he would be attentive to accusations that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar financed Islamist militants, spoke to Qatari and Emirati leaders on Wednesday. He said that it was important to preserve stability in the Gulf region but that Paris would be uncompromising in fighting terrorism.  There are economic matters at stake for our companies in all these countries,  Castaner said.  It's important for France to stay in the circle of partnership with all those countries.

The absorption of Popular by Spain's biggest bank Santander for a nominal one euro was the first use of a regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the 2008 financial crisis and made barely a ripple in Europe's stock and debt markets. Indeed, as the morning wore on the success of the process pushed shares in many major banks higher, supporting a recovery for Madrid's stock market and fending off this week's broadly weaker mood. There was some shock initially at the imposition of steep losses on junior bondholders and shareholders in Popular, but senior bondholders were spared. European banking shares rose 1.6 percent. Wall Street was set to open flat to slightly higher.  The market has taken Banco Popular as positive news because essentially this is not a bankruptcy but a sort of rescue, even if its subordinated bondholders have been sharply hit,  said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan.  The fall in subordinated debt at other Spanish banks today lasted just around one hour. It's seen positively because it draws a line under (the problem) involving only risk capital.  Ecb Cut? The bank rescue does, however, underline the risks to growth, banking and government debt burdens that are likely to delay a major switch in language and policy direction by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday. The euro fell half a percent against the dollar in morning trade in Europe, spurred by a Bloomberg report that the ECB instead of flipping towards tighter policy would cut its inflation forecasts.  Maybe tomorrow's ECB meeting sees nothing but platitudes and disappoints a market that is getting ahead of itself,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes,  But (for us) that would be a huge euro buying opportunity, because ECB normalisation IS coming. And when it does, the euro simply won't be able to sustain undervalued levels for long.  European blue chip shares had risen by just over half a percent by 1250 GMT  and Madrid's IBEX recovered from early losses to trade 0.2 percent stronger on the day. Oil prices, however, were again more than 1 percent lower and investors remain attracted by the perceived security of Japan's yen. The yen rose half a percent against the euro and as high as 109.11 yen per dollar - its strongest in seven weeks - before steadying. The greenback has lost 1 percent so far this week, pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows. A surprisingly closely-fought British election set for Thursday is weighing on investors' minds along with U.S. Senate testimony from James Comey, the former FBI chief fired by President Donald Trump. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony are likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhaul the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.  Tomorrow is what is being dubbed as 'Triple Threat Thursday', ... an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.

The Outlooks are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The IDR upgrade of Mapfre, the holding company of the group, follows the upgrade of Mapfre's unconstrained IFS assessment to 'A+' from 'A'. The holding company's IDR is notched down twice from the unconstrained IFS assessment of 'A+'. Fitch continues to apply a sovereign constraint of 'A-', meaning that Mapfre's IFS ratings are capped at 'A-'. Fitch has also assigned a rating of 'BBB-' to Mapfre's EUR600 million subordinated bond issued in March 2017. The notes are rated three notches below Mapfre's IDR of 'A-' to reflect their subordination (two notches) and moderate risk of non-performance (one notch), in line with Fitch's notching criteria. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of Mapfre's unconstrained IFS to 'A+' from 'A' reflects the group's strong and resilient earnings and solid capital position. However, Mapfre's exposure to sovereign debt is reflected in the sovereign constraint of 'A-' being applied to Mapfre's ratings, one notch higher than the sovereign rating of Spain (BBB+/Stable) due to international diversification of Mapfre's earnings. Mapfre is substantially exposed to the Spanish economy as around 60% of its operating profits originate from Spain. Mapfre has consistently demonstrated resilient operating performance despite the downturn in Spain during the financial crisis and the most recent recession in Brazil. The group reported a combined ratio of 97.4% in 2016 (2015: 98.6%). The improvement in the combined ratio reflects improved underwriting discipline and cost-saving initiatives in Mapfre's core markets. Mapfre's five-year average combined ratio is 96.7% and its target combined ratio is unchanged at 96% or less. Fitch expects the group to maintain robust underwriting performance. Fitch assesses Mapfre as being strongly capitalised, based on a 'Strong' score from Fitch's Prism Factor Based Model (FBM). Shareholders' funds increased 6% to EUR9.1 billion at end-2016, supported by strong retained earnings and appreciation of main currencies. The group's Solvency II ratio was also strong at 210% at end-2016 (2015: 198%). Mapfre's financial leverage ratio of 15% is low compared with peers and is a positive rating factor. Mapfre's ratings are heavily influenced by the group's exposure to Spanish sovereign debt (EUR17 billion at end-2016, 1.5x shareholders' funds). This holding represents a large concentration risk and a potential source of volatility for capital adequacy. However, based on the results of scenario tests, Fitch believes that Mapfre's capital position is resilient against potential stress from the substantial exposure to Spanish sovereign debt. The ratings also reflect Mapfre's strong franchise and access to distribution in Spain and Latin America, particularly Brazil. Mapfre is a leader in the non-life insurance segment in Spain with a 14.6% market share and has strong positions in Spanish life insurance with a 6.3% market share and Latin American non-life market with a share of 8.2% in 2015. This makes it the 10th largest European and the third-largest Latin American insurance group. RATING SENSITIVITIES Mapfre's ratings could be downgraded if exposure to the core insurance markets or sovereign debt results in losses with a material impact on the group's capitalisation. Mapfre's ratings could also be downgraded if the Spanish sovereign is downgraded. Factors that could trigger an upgrade include an upgrade of Spain's sovereign rating, providing that Mapfre maintains strong earnings and capitalisation. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Mapfre SA Long-Term IDR upgraded to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable EUR1,000 million senior debt upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB' EUR700 million 5.921% subordinated debt due 2037 with step-up in 2017 upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' EUR600 million 4.375% subordinated debt due 2047 assigned a long-term rating of 'BBB-' The IFS Ratings for the following entities have been affirmed at 'A-'/Stable: Mapfre Espana Compania de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A.

Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge to ditch the landmark accord to tackle global warming. Trump chose to walk away from nearly every other nation in the world on one of the most pressing challenges of the century. But Satyarthi said his action would hit the poorest hardest.  I have been advocating for years on the very direct effect of climate change and global warming on the trafficking, migration and slavery of children,  Satyarthi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I would appeal to Mr Trump to reconsider his decision, but if he doesn't, then definitely it is going to create more harm for children, as they are often the biggest victims of disasters.  A prominent child rights activist, Satyarthi said disasters were already pushing poor rural families so deeply into poverty that many were exploited by traffickers, who promise good jobs and decent pay for their children, only to enslave them. In 2014, Satyarthi was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize with Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai for his work on curbing child labor and advocating for their right to education. Trump drew worldwide condemnation with his decision to withdraw from the 2015 agreement to cut emissions, saying it undermined the U.S. economy and cost Americans their jobs. Scientists say climate change will mean more intense weather events, which will not only hit agricultural output and food security, but also lead to water shortages and trigger outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue. They say climate change will severely impact countries such as India, where many of its 1.3 billion people live in areas vulnerable to hazards such as floods, droughts and cyclones. Post-disaster human trafficking is already common in regions such as South Asia where the breakdown of institutions in devastated areas creates difficulties in securing food and humanitarian supplies, leaving women and children vulnerable. Satyarthi's charity Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood Movement) is credited with rescuing more than 80,000 enslaved children.

In statement on its website, the world's oldest Islamist movement called on the kingdom to cease its support for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and not to listen to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates, whom it called corrupt and oppressive. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday, partly over the tiny Gulf monarchy's alleged support for Islamist groups such as the Brotherhood. Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said on Tuesday Qatar needed to take several steps, including ending its support of Palestinian Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, to restore ties with other key Arab states.  The Kingdom's insistence on backing the obscene putschist (Egyptian) regime, providing it with financial and political support, attacking the moderate Islamist movement represented in the Muslim Brotherhood, and accusing it of terrorism, puts the Kingdom's credibility at stake,  the Brotherhood said. Egypt's military, then led by Sisi, ousted former President Mohamed Mursi, a Brotherhood leader, from power in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. The move was backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  Do not listen to the princes of oppression and injustice in the UAE, those corrupt men are a plague on the (Islamic) nation and the Kingdom both. They are the cohorts of Zionists and finances of oppression and obscenity,  the group said. The Brotherhood, a global organisation which started in Egypt in 1928, has experienced splits ever since it lost power in its country of origin. The statement came from a Cairo-based wing.

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America. It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said. The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide  a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand,  said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer, in a media briefing. Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV (MBLY.N), which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O). Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies' statement said. French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA) will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev's chief performance officer.    The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing.    Initially, the vehicles will have  safety  drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added.    Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions.  Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries.  The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA (VIE.PA), the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years. In May, German automaker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) announced that Delphi will join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.

Owners of Popular bonds faces losses of some 2 billion euros, while Santander will ask its shareholders for around 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of capital to absorb Spain's sixth biggest bank.  Popular's rescue was unveiled as the European Central Bank announced the lender was set to be wound down, echoing a banking crash some five years ago that cost Spain 40 billion euros. Santander's takeover of the bank, which has been weighed down by risky property loans, for a nominal one euro marks the first use of a stricter European Union regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the financial crisis. The sale was organized in less than 24 hours, and followed a recent acceleration in the withdrawal of deposits, which two people with knowledge of the matter said had in recent weeks hit 18 billion euros, equivalent to almost one quarter of the total. A final decision to sell Popular was made at about 0430 GMT on Wednesday, Dominique Laboureix, a member of the Single Resolution Board, told a news conference in Brussels. The SRB is the agency set up by the EU to wind down stricken banks. In contrast to earlier crises, the hurried sale of Popular did not spook markets and banking stocks rose in Europe.  This deal is good for Spain and it's good for Europe,  Santander chairman Ana Botin said of the agreement, which breaks the mold of using taxpayers' money, instead imposing losses on shareholders and creditors of the bank. Related CoverageSRB changed tack on Popular wind down due to liquidity crunchDeposit outflow from Popular around 18 billion euros in recent weeks: sourcesSantander purchase of Popular is good outcome: Spanish Economy MinisterThis resolution worked in Santander's favor, and was described by two debt investors as unexpected, with the owners of so-called AT1 and AT2 bonds suffering roughly 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of losses and shareholders losing everything. The ECB said there was a  significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days  and that in the near future Popular would have been  unable to pay its debts . Up to 2 billion euros a day was being taken out of the bank by savers last week, another source told Reuters.  We got it done before markets opened. That was the target,  Elke König, who chairs the Resolution Board, said. Santander Chairwoman Ana Botin arrives for a news conference after Santander announced on Wednesday that it would buy struggling rival Banco Popular for a nominal one euro after European authorities determined the lender was on the verge of insolvency, in Madrid, Spain, June 7, 2017.Juan MedinaUnlike Italy, which has been grappling with problem lenders for years, Spain's reaction was prompt and in contrast to the 2008 banking crisis it met with calm in the markets.  This shouldn't pose any real problems for other banks,  Aberdeen Asset Management Head of Credit Research Laurent Frings said.  But it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second-tier names.  Botin Sees Benefits Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said Santander's takeover was a good outcome for Popular given its situation in recent weeks and it would have no impact on public resources or other banks. Slideshow (6 Images)Botin welcomed Popular customers and said that the combination of the two would strengthen Santander's geographic reach as the economies in Spain and Portugal improved.  It gives certainty and stability to Spain's financial sector,  she said.  Santander, which was unaffected by the banking crisis in Spain that forced Madrid to seek international aid, said buying Popular would accelerate growth and profit from 2019. The group, with operations from South America to Britain, said it would set aside 7.9 billion euros to cover the cost of non-performing assets, which are loans at risk of non-payment. Struggling under the weight of 37 billion euros of non-performing property assets left over from Spain's financial crisis, Popular had seen its share price slump. It was among a handful of banks that emerged as vulnerable to stress, such as an economic downturn, in a European Banking Authority simulation last summer and had remained vulnerable with a ratio of risky loans around three times above the average of its Spanish rivals.

Britain's vote last June to leave the EU has sparked fierce competition among financial centers elsewhere in the bloc, including Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg, to attract banks and other financial companies. Currently, EU rules allow a fund manager in London to sell and manage funds across the bloc, but it is unclear whether that will continue to the same extent after Brexit as the shape of future UK-EU trading relations has yet to be hammered out. Overall, asset managers in London may have to move between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs to various cities on the continent, Jean-Louis Laurens, International Ambassador for French Asset Management Association (AFG) told Reuters in an interview in London.     Paris has stepped up its attempts to win business from financial firms currently based in Britain since the election of Emmanuel Macron as French president last month. Macron has vowed to overhaul the labor market and simplify the French tax and pension systems.   I have never seen so much alignment in the government to make France attractive as a financial center,  said Laurens, who also worked at Rothschild at the same time as former investment banker Macron.    The number one issue is labor laws, but that will be addressed by the new government.  The French regulator for the funds industry, AMF (Autorite des marches financiers) had a call with 53 senior executives from U.S. and UK asset managers on May 12 to discuss the process of setting up entities and ways to help, said Laurens.   There is a realization from the UK and U.S. firms that the Brexit negotiations will be so constrained that they might not have access to the single market. This means that companies will need to devise a plan,   he said. The AMF is also offering fund firms a fast track approval process of two weeks for regulatory licenses, said Laurens, which compares with two months in countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg which are also vying for asset managers, he said.  Britain's markets watchdog said on May 31 it had asked asset managers and investment firms to spell out how Brexit would affect their ability to continue serving EU customers and whether they needed to move to the bloc. So far though, there is little sign of a rush to Paris among the first fund managers to set out their Brexit plans.  Legal & General (LGEN.L) has said it would move some of its investment management operations to Ireland, while fund manager M&G; (PRU.L) is to set up a management company in Luxembourg.

The RBI said masala bonds must have a minimum maturity of three years for issuances of up to $50 million. Sales above that amount would need to have maturities of five years or above. It also set an all-in-cost ceiling of 300 basis points above a similar maturity government bond for masala bond issuances. The RBI said it was changing the rules for masala bonds  with a view to harmonize  the present regulations on external commercial borrowings. It did not elaborate any further. India has been keen to spur the sales of rupee-denominated bonds overseas, but the RBI has been cautious about domestic companies raising funds abroad because of worries about having excessive debts owed to overseas investors. Traders said these RBI rules would most likely impact lower-rated issuers, as they will now have less flexibility while issuing masala bonds.  This is a new market, one needs to nurture the market with soft hands,  said a corporate bond dealer at a foreign bank.  Let the foreign investor decide at what rate and what maturity he wants to buy the rupee bond.  India has seen a handful of issuances since the country allowed masala bonds in 2015, including from Housing Development Finance Corp, Adani Transmission as well as from a few state-run companies.

Currency, bond and equity trading desks in London will be staffed as results trickle in late on Thursday and in the early hours of Friday. With opinion polls showing Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the Labour opposition narrowing in the last three weeks and some suggesting her Conservatives could even lose their majority in parliament, the outcome looks much more uncertain than the landslide predicted when May called the election in April. And after Britain's vote last June to leave the European Union Donald Trump's election as U.S. President in November caught markets off-guard, traders are taking no chances.  We'll have increased staffing overnight to cope with potential volatility, looking particularly at the exit poll at 10 p.m. and what it could do to markets if its suggests a hung parliament, said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at spread betting firm ETX Capital.  Then very much all hands on deck for the market open on Friday.  The big global banks in London have operations in Asia that would normally handle trading throughout the European night. But on Thursday night, they will be drawing on resources across the world.   With high profile, market-moving events, we will have more staff working extended hours in one or more centres to make sure we can help our clients and manage our risk,  HSBC said.  Barclays said foreign exchange sales and trading teams in London, New York and Singapore will stay late on Thursday and be at their desks early on Friday as results come through. Thursday's vote will define Britain's approach to its divorce talks and future relationship with the European Union, which analysts say will be a major driver of UK assets. Expecting the Unexpected One broker said that if results indicated an outright Conservative win, as suggested by a poll taken after Saturday's deadly attack in London, it would leave trading to colleagues in Asia. More volatile scenarios would keep London staff at their desks overnight. Louis Gargour, chief investment officer of hedge fund LNG Capital, said his traders would work though the night with counterparties in Asia  if the unexpected happens .  Investors with exposure to UK securities need to think ahead, we can't not hedge prior to the election and assume that we can liquidate positions or sell to hedge ourselves on Friday after the outcome,  he said.   While UK stocks will begin trading at 8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday and British government bonds only really trade when the futures market opens, also at 8:00 a.m., sterling is a global currency traded at all hours. After the Brexit vote, the pound initially soared 1 percent to above $1.50 on polls showing the  remain  camp ahead. But as it became clear Britain had voted  leave , sterling fell, hitting 31-year lows around $1.32. Trump's surprise election on Nov. 9 triggered a volatile day for the pound and a kneejerk fall in equities before they reversed course to rise on expectations his policies would fuel growth and reflation.  This time, the pound is down 2.8 percent in trade-weighted terms since May 10, giving back all the gains made since the election was called on April 18.  In practise, only the currency markets are liquid enough to trade through the night,  said Colin McLean, managing director of the UK equity growth fund at SVM Asset Management.  We won't be in all night, but will likely make an early start,  he added. Currency analysts at ING said they would be in all night to watch the results and support clients. Others, though have no plans to increase staffing.  Business as usual,  said Northern Trust head of global equities Gary Paulin.  (There's been) no real change as the poll lead has narrowed, since it's still an expected Conservative victory, just a bit smaller,  said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at brokerage IG. For many, however, the risk of missing a big move was the over-riding concern.  Brexit was the real eye opener -– we stayed late but not that late, and the market traded very sharply on that outcome,  said LNG's Gargour.  But those traders pulling an all-night shift will not be fuelled by adrenaline alone.  Pizzas have been ordered,  said ETX Capital's Wilson.

General election in Britain, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel could all weigh on investor sentiment. Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump might shed more light on a probe by the FBI into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's legislative agenda of rolling back healthcare reforms and overhauling the tax code. A closely-fought election in Britain is also weighing on investors' minds, with one poll showing Prime Minister Theresa May increasing her parliamentary majority, while another suggesting a neck-and-neck race with the Labour Party.  It's the calm before the storm. We have a quiet week in terms of economic data and there's a general global unease at the moment,  said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The impact of Comey's statement really depends on what he says, and anyway these hearings are long and dragged out. The UK elections could have an impact if there is a hung parliament and the various polls are adding a level of uncertainty.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 8 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 22,511 contracts. The ECB will also hold its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to reiterate its plan to extend the money-printing scheme at least until the end of the year. Safe havens turned attractive, with gold steadying near seven-month highs and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovering near lows not seen since the November U.S. election. Wall Street ended near session lows on Tuesday as traders shied away from risky assets ahead of major political and economic headlines. Still, U.S. equities continue to hover near record levels, helped by a stellar first-quarter corporate earnings season. Oil prices dipped on renewed concerns about the efficacy of OPEC-led production cuts due to rising tensions within the export group over Qatar and growing U.S. output.

Permits dipped 0.2 percent, the third monthly decrease in a row. Figures for March were upwardly revised to show a decline of 4.9 percent from the previously reported 5.8 percent decrease. Residential building permits were down 2.5 percent as a decline in plans for single-family homes offset a gain in intentions to build multi-family buildings, such as apartments. Permits for single-family homes tumbled 8.1 percent, driven by declines in Ontario. In Toronto, Canada's largest city, construction plans for single-family homes fell to the lowest level since January 2016.

Currency, bond and equity trading desks in London will be staffed as results trickle in late on Thursday and in the early hours of Friday. With opinion polls showing Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the Labour opposition narrowing in the last three weeks and some suggesting her Conservatives could even lose their majority in parliament, the outcome looks much more uncertain than the landslide predicted when May called the election in April. And after Britain's vote last June to leave the European Union Donald Trump's election as U.S. President in November caught markets off-guard, traders are taking no chances.  We'll have increased staffing overnight to cope with potential volatility, looking particularly at the exit poll at 10 p.m. and what it could do to markets if its suggests a hung parliament, said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at spread betting firm ETX Capital.  Then very much all hands on deck for the market open on Friday.  The big global banks in London have operations in Asia that would normally handle trading throughout the European night. But on Thursday night, they will be drawing on resources across the world.  With high profile, market-moving events, we will have more staff working extended hours in one or more centres to make sure we can help our clients and manage our risk,  HSBC said. Barclays said foreign exchange sales and trading teams in London, New York and Singapore will stay late on Thursday and be at their desks early on Friday as results come through. Thursday's vote will define Britain's approach to its divorce talks and future relationship with the European Union, which analysts say will be a major driver of UK assets. Expecting the Unexpected One broker said that if results indicated an outright Conservative win, as suggested by a poll taken after Saturday's deadly attack in London, it would leave trading to colleagues in Asia. More volatile scenarios would keep London staff at their desks overnight. Louis Gargour, chief investment officer of hedge fund LNG Capital, said his traders would work though the night with counterparties in Asia  if the unexpected happens .  Investors with exposure to UK securities need to think ahead, we can't not hedge prior to the election and assume that we can liquidate positions or sell to hedge ourselves on Friday after the outcome,  he said. While UK stocks will begin trading at 8:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday and British government bonds only really trade when the futures market opens, also at 8:00 a.m., sterling is a global currency traded at all hours. After the Brexit vote, the pound initially soared 1 percent to above $1.50 on polls showing the  remain  camp ahead. But as it became clear Britain had voted  leave , sterling fell, hitting 31-year lows around $1.32. Trump's surprise election on Nov. 9 triggered a volatile day for the pound and a kneejerk fall in equities before they reversed course to rise on expectations his policies would fuel growth and reflation. This time, the pound is down 2.8 percent in trade-weighted terms since May 10, giving back all the gains made since the election was called on April 18.  In practice, only the currency markets are liquid enough to trade through the night,  said Colin McLean, managing director of the UK equity growth fund at SVM Asset Management.  We won't be in all night, but will likely make an early start,  he added. Currency analysts at ING said they would be in all night to watch the results and support clients. Others, though have no plans to increase staffing.  Business as usual,  said Northern Trust head of global equities Gary Paulin.  (There's been) no real change as the poll lead has narrowed, since it;s still an expected Conservative victory, just a bit smaller,  said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at brokerage IG. For many, however, the risk of missing a big move was the over-riding concern.  Brexit was the real eye opener -– we stayed late but not that late, and the market traded very sharply on that outcome,  said LNG's Gargour. But those traders pulling an all-night shift will not be fuelled by adrenaline alone.  Pizzas have been ordered,  said ETX Capital's Wilson.

The Guardian newspaper said meat processing company JBS, which supplies beef to several leading UK food stores, had previously bought cattle from a farm in northern Brazil which is being investigated for using workers as modern-day slaves. JBS told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it had stopped buying from the farm on discovering a possible link to labor abuses. Upmarket British food store Waitrose said it was pulling one of its three own brand corned beef products while it investigated.  While we have found no such concerns in our own supply chain ... we are taking these allegations seriously so have stopped sourcing any of our corned beef from there (JBS) while we investigate fully,  the supermarket said in a statement. JBS produce is also used in tinned corned beef sold by Marks & Spencer, Co-op, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Princes, according to the Guardian, which added that some of these stores were now also investigating and examining their supply chains. Co-op said tackling modern slavery was central to its ethical trade strategy.  We take such allegations very seriously and will be investigating with our suppliers in order to address any issues,  a spokesman said. Marks & Spencer said it had not sourced canned corned beef from Brazil since autumn 2016.  Corned beef, a salt-cured product widely used during both world wars when fresh meat was rationed, remains popular in Britain where it is commonly used in sandwiches. The newspaper said documents showed JBS paid 2 million pounds ($2.58 million) between 2013 and 2016 for cattle reared on a farm in the state of Para where prosecutors say workers were being subjected to modern slavery. Brazilian police reportedly discovered men forced to live in inhumane and degrading conditions, with no shelter, toilets or drinking water. Prosecutors believe the workers were in debt bondage, the Guardian said. The 2016 Global Slavery Index estimated about 46 million people are in some form of modern slavery - forced into manual labor, trafficked to brothels, victims of debt bondage or born into servitude - with about 161,000 people in Brazil enslaved.  JBS said the farm at the center of the allegations had never been included in the government's  blacklist  for slave labor.   As soon as JBS became aware of irregularities in the farm's operations in 2016, all livestock purchases from (there) were immediately stopped,  spokeswoman Carla Saemi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.  JBS does not buy cattle from any farms which have any association with slave labor as listed by the Brazilian government.

The single currency had recovered almost 10 percent against the dollar in the past five months, benefiting from broad greenback weakness but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018. But with global inflation pressures waning, and with euro zone data coming in weaker in recent data releases, that view has started to shift, and the ECB is not expected to signal a change in policy at its meeting this week. Bloomberg, citing unnamed euro zone officials, said the central bank's staff forecasts for inflation for the next three years had been cut to 1.5 percent, from 1.7 percent, 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively in March. Those have still to be approved by the two-day meeting of the Governing Council that starts on Wednesday, the news agency said, but, if true, would be a signal of a softer line than many in currency and bond markets have been expecting. The ECB declined to comment on the report.  If you downgrade your inflation forecasts the next year you’re basically sending a message to the market – ‘We’re not in any rush’,  CMC Markets' chief markets analyst, Michael Hewson, said.  The ECB doesn’t want a strong euro so what better way of pushing it back down against a weakening dollar and pulling the rug out from any potential hawkishness at tomorrow’s meeting. They’ve basically lowered expectations.  By 1155 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.6 percent to $1.1215 and 122.72 yen respectively. It was similarly weaker at 86.88 pence per pound. The dollar rates compare with a seven-month high of $1.1285 hit last week. The moves also came as the dollar recovered some of this week's more than 1 percent loss against the yen, due largely to broad nerves over the pace of U.S. growth and government policy that have cut U.S. Treasury yields to the lowest since November. Traders remain cautious before Thursday's UK election, which some worry may be far closer than some polls indicate, as well as the U.S. Senate testimony of James Comey, the former FBI chief sacked by President Trump. The greenback fell as low as 109.115 yen, its weakest since April 21, before recovering to stand flat on the day at 109.49 yen.  Tomorrow’s what is being dubbed as 'Triple Threat Thursday'...an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride,  ING currency strategist Viraj Patel wrote in a note to clients. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony is likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhauling the tax system - an agenda that sent the dollar to 14-year highs this year.

Heavy rains have slowed expected output and rattled farmers, with many switching to food crop production to make a more reliable living. “The rains have been so severe in recent times, coming even when least expected, generating production worries for both farmers and the government,” said Jerome Mvondo, director-general of the Cameroon Cocoa Development Corporation, at an event in Buea, the capital of the country’s Southwest region and its main cocoa-producing zone. Cameroon is the world's fifth biggest cocoa grower behind the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Indonesia. According to government statistics, the crop accounts for about half the country’s exports of basic products such as food, timber, fish and minerals.  Cocoa sales contribute about 250 billion CFA francs ($426 million) to state coffers each year. In 2012, Cameroon's government announced plans to increase cocoa production from around 225,000 tonnes annually to 600,000 tonnes by 2020. But that goal is now threatened by erratic and prolonged rains, especially in the Southwest region. In the last 2015-2016 season, production was around 269,000 tonnes, Mvondo said. Plans to plant an additional 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of new cocoa trees each year have fallen short, with the area under cultivation having grown by just 2,500-3,500 hectares since 2014, Mvondo said. 'The Rains Come in Any Order' Farmers say they used to worry that rain during the harvest would delay the drying of their cocoa beans, but now rains often take them by surprise at the heart of the dry season, when the cocoa plants flower and produce buds. “The rains now come in any order, making it difficult for us to plant new crops, spray cocoa pods with pesticides against diseases and dry the cocoa bean naturally. This has really reduced our output and income,” said Ajasco Nzeme, a cocoa farmer from Tombel, in Cameroon's Southwest region. “I am almost giving up cocoa farming. I had planned on expanding my cocoa farm by four hectares by 2018, but with the disturbing rains it is not worth the trouble,” said Nzeme, who grows 16 hectares (40 acres) of the crop. Rains have been coming as early as February rather than at the more common beginning of April, causing buds to fall off the cocoa trees and the pods to blacken. “The farmers are even refusing free pesticides offered by the government for fear it will be washed away by the rains as soon as it is applied,” Mvondo said. Besides killing cocoa flowers and young pods, the unusual rain can affect the quality of the crop that is harvested, and force farmers to smoke-dry beans instead of drying them in the open air, farmers said. Many farmers say they also face increasing difficulty getting their harvest to market on mostly earthen roads. Andrew Ngomnkalle, a 59-year-old cocoa farmer in Tombel, said his yield had dwindled from 60 bags per acre in 2014 to 35 bags in 2016. “I have been a cocoa farmer all my life but have never witnessed such confusion in the pattern of rainfall,” he said. Harvest Losses, Lower Prices Changing weather is also making cocoa more susceptible to pests and disease, said Zachee Nzohngandembou, executive officer of the Centre for the Environment and  Rural Transformation, a nongovernmental organization in Limbe that works with local farmers. Losses from diseases and pests claimed between 30 and 40 percent of Cameroon’s harvest in the 2014-15 season, according to the National Cocoa and Coffee Board, which regulates cocoa and coffee production. The farmers’ situation has been made worse over the past year by a slump of more than one third in the prices paid for the beans by exporters, following a downward trend in prices on the international market. According to government data, a kilo of beans fetches about 900-960 FCA francs ($1.50 to $1.65) in production areas, down from 1,600 francs in 2012-13. In some remote areas, particularly in the Southwest region, prices can be as low as 700 francs. Many farmers in Cameroon say they are deserting cocoa production for other cash and food crops. “We have no choice than to concentrate on cash crops like plantains and cocoyam to be able to feed our families,” said Nzeme. Experts agree that worsening climate variability has become a major bottleneck faced by cocoa producers worldwide. Global production decreased by 217,000 tonnes in the 2015-2016 season, to just over 4 million tonnes, a decline of 5 percent from the previous season, according to a November 2016 report by the International Cocoa Organization. In Africa, production is estimated to have fallen over the same period by 124,000 tonnes - almost 4 percent - to 2.9 million tonnes, with the drop attributed mostly to adverse weather conditions and an outbreak of black pod disease. Nevertheless, the government says it still hopes to boost cocoa production by giving farmers better meteorological information so that they can make more informed decisions on when to plant and harvest. Henry Eyebe Ayisi, Cameroon’s minister of agriculture, said the government is partnering with non-governmental organisations such as the Global Centre for Compliance, Hazards and Disaster Management to help farmers better understand climate threats. A new program will send monthly text messages to help growers better plan their farming activities in the face of changing weather conditions, Eyebe said.

Nadal, bidding for a record-extending 10th title at Roland Garros, was leading 6-2 2-0 when Carreno Busta decided he could not continue after receiving lengthy treatment for an abdominal muscle injury at the end of the first set. Nadal, who next faces Austrian Dominic Thiem after he knocked out holder Novak Djokovic, has spent only about eight hours on court, dropping 22 games, to reach his 10th French Open semi with his 100th win in a best-of-five sets match on clay. It is the fewest games the 31-year-old Nadal has lost on his way to the last four on the Paris clay. In 2008, he dropped 25. Swede Bjorn Borg holds the record for the fewest games lost in a winning a French Open campaign, having conceded 32 in 1978, but Nadal's focus is elsewhere.

The rest of the things, we can always find behind the stones. And we are going to find more and more records, but at the end of the day these kind of things are not important. Slideshow (6 Images) Now remains probably the toughest part against a very tough opponent in the semi-finals.

In Rome it was not a good day for me. I was not in a position to play well the way I wanted to,  said Nadal referring to Thiem's 6-4 6-3 quarter-final win at last month's Italian Open.

Various grids may require more imports to cover expected demand rises when consumers switch on air conditioning devices and thermal generation plants need more cooling water, ENTSO-E said in its biannual  adequacy report  on 36 countries. The report covered the outlook from June 1 through Oct. 2 and stretched from central European countries as far as Turkey, Kosovo, Malta, and Burshtyn Island in Ukraine. Most of Europe should experience above-normal temperatures from June to August, except the northern half of Britain and most of Scandinavia which will be cooler than average, a recent report from the Weather Company predicted.  Italy has potential supply deficit situations over several weeks between mid-June until the end of July,  Alban Joyeau an expert in ENTSO-E's system development group, said in a webinar. This was due to reduced generation capacity in the North and Central North regions after plant closures and could be worsened by a combination of temperatures above 28 degrees Celsius (82.4°F) and low hydroelectric resources, he said. But Italy's transmission system operator (TSO), Terna , was preparing to take countermeasures such as more imports, demand side response - when consumers agree to take less electricity - and the temporary use of idled plants. TSOs are in charge of getting electricity to consumers in an increasingly unified market in Europe, while facing the challenge of more intermittent renewable energy, as countries strive to curb their reliance on carbon-polluting fossil fuels. ENTSO-E monitors and co-ordinates their efforts to ensure that supply is secure at all times. Joyeau said Poland could be exposed if there was little or no solar and wind capacity during daytime consumption peaks of 1300 to 1400 Central European Time. The weeks starting July 17 and July 24 were likely to be most critical, he added. Although solar capacity in neighbouring Germany is high and could potentially help, Poland's import capacity is limited, which in August 2015 led to enforced plant closures and sent local prices sky-high. The report also said that there could be some unwanted solar power surpluses in southern Italy and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia during sunny Sundays, when consumption is low. Electricity flows between the EU's two main power markets, France and Germany, are sizeable and represent capacity equivalent to five nuclear reactors, providing regular and efficient exchanges of supply.

Defending champion Djokovic, who recently split with his long-term coaching team and worked with former great Andre Agassi in the first week in Paris, crumbled to a 7-6(5) 6-3 6-0 defeat by Austrian Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals. The last set whizzed by in 20 minutes as Djokovic appeared to be going through the motions -- falling short of a seventh successive French Open semi-final.  The problem when one of the people on your team is all about love and peace and has been part of the camp for over a year, it's not something that you can fall back on when you are pushed into a hole,  American Courier, working for British broadcaster ITV, said. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 7, 2017   Serbia's Novak Djokovic during a press conference after his quarter final defeat to Austria's Dominic Thiem   Reuters / Benoit Tessier Novak showed no fight and maybe it was partly down to the windy conditions. He despises playing in the wind. He really seemed to accept the outcome well before it was conclusive.  Courier said world number two Djokovic must seek out Agassi to try and rediscover the spark that appears to be missing.  Andre knows how to broach this type of thing and will ask the right questions to see how Novak can avoid this kind of thing going forward,  Courier said.  But there are questions remaining about Novak. Since Wimbledon last year there have been so many question marks about what's going on, on and off the court.  Imaz, a former Spanish player, has been described as a  spiritual guru  who uses the philosophy  peace and love  at his tennis academy. Djokovic linked up with him last year.

Analysts said investors are waiting to see the real impact of the floods and landslides caused by the worst torrential rains in 14 years, killing over 200 people and devastating crops. The Colombo stock index ended down 0.08 percent at 6,664.00, its lowest close since May 30. Turnover was 2.09 billion rupees ($13.70 million), its highest since May 24 and well above this year's daily average of 901.1 million rupees. Inflation could rise in the short term, especially due to crop damage and difficulties in distributing fresh food produce and staple food items, analysts said.  Today, the turnover was very healthy with some crossings. But despite that, the market ended weaker as investors are worried over the real impact of the flooding,   said Yohan Samarakkody, head of research, SC Securities.  The gloomy investor sentiment that we have seen during this week is mainly due to the floods, which will have an impact on the economy.  Foreign investors, however, were net buyers of 316.3 million rupees worth of shares, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 20.1 billion rupees. Ceylon Cold Stores Plc, which accounted for 55 percent of the day's turnover, ended down 5.6 percent. Shares of Ceylon Tobacco Company slipped 1.11 percent, while the biggest listed lender Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc declined 0.37 percent, Bukit Darah Plc shed 2.69 percent, Carson Cumberbatch Plc dropped 2.23 percent.

The new government faces challenges in restoring political stability and public confidence in the political system, and in realigning policy in its preferred direction. Macedonia's parliament last week passed a vote of confidence in a new government under Zoran Zaev, leader of the Social Democrats (SDSM), in formal coalition with two parties representing ethnic Albanians, DUI and the Alliance for Albanians. Between them, the coalition parties hold 62 of the 120 parliamentary seats. A fourth party, which holds five seats, has agreed to provide informal support. Macedonia had been operating under a caretaker government after former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE party was unable to reach a coalition deal with DUI in January following delayed legislative elections the previous month. The formation of a government signals that political tensions have eased in recent weeks, after peaking in late April when protestors stormed parliament after a new speaker was elected, which drew widespread condemnation from the international community. But it may be difficult for the SDSM-led government to enact its policies, which include economic reforms and kick-starting moves to join the EU and NATO. With 51 seats, VMRO-DPMNE remains the largest single party in parliament, and after a decade in power it has long-standing connections with state institutions and the media. Given the persistent disagreements between SDSM and VMRO-DPMNE in areas such as the investigation of 2015's wire-tapping scandal and Albanian's status as an official language, it is possible that political tensions will flare up again, and that VMRO-DPMNE will seek to obstruct the implementation of the new government's policies. The lengthy political crisis appears to have taken its toll on the economy through weaker business and consumer sentiment. High-frequency indicators on industrial production, retail sales and credit growth show that economic activity slowed in 1Q17, and we have significantly revised down our real GDP growth forecast for 2017, to 2.6% from 3.4%. Slower growth would also imply a larger 2017 fiscal deficit without offsetting spending cuts. We think the new government is likely to revise the 2017 budget, and its electoral promises of higher public sector wages and enhanced social protection and healthcare access for the public could result in a 2017 fiscal deficit that is wider than our 3.3% of GDP forecast. This would cause the public debt ratio, estimated at 42.3% of GDP in 2016, to rise further, bringing it closer to the 'BB' category median of 43.9%. We affirmed Macedonia's 'BB'/Negative sovereign rating in February. As we stated at the time, a marked easing in political tension and uncertainty, or implementation of a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation programme, could result in a stabilisation of the Outlook. Conversely, an escalation in political instability, fiscal slippage, or a widening of external imbalances that put pressure on reserves or the currency peg could be negative for the rating.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards ending at 152.85/95 per dollar, compared with Tuesday's close of 152.88/93.  There was (dollar) selling in the latter part of the day. We also saw a state bank selling. There was a bit of (dollar) inflows,  a currency dealer said, asking not to be named. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Wednesday. Foreign investors bought a net 740 million rupees ($4.86 million) worth of government securities in the week ended May 31. They have sold a net 41.33 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trade was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. The hospitality and manufacturing sectors are likely to be the worst hit, analysts said. However, dealers said there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance, which could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. Dealers said the aid inflows could help the rupee, but the central bank will have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending, dealers said. The markets will be closed on Thursday for a Buddhist religious holiday. Normal trading will resume on Friday.

We are executing the deleveraging that we outlined previously ... The (debt) ratio is far from perfect but the deleveraging trend is there,  Christophe Salmon told Reuters. Trafigura has high debt levels relative to rival trading houses in terms of the net debt to earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) metric. Its 'adjusted total debt' stood at $8.63 billion at the end of its fiscal year in September 2016 while EBITDA stood at $1.63 billion, giving a ratio of over five times, which compares with about 1.5 times for rival Glencore. In the six months ended March 31, 'adjusted total debt' fell to $7.9 billion while EBITDA rose 12 percent to $921.4 million Salmon said 'total adjusted debt' still included some forms of short-term borrowing, including some financing of inventories, and hence the core metric for Trafigura's net debt should be its 'corporate debt', which currently stands at around $3 billion. With annual EBITDA of $1.6-$1.8 billion the corporate debt to EBITDA ratio should be below two times.  The corporate debt to EBITDA will decrease over the course of the next few quarters,  Salmon said. He also said the firm's 'adjusted total debt' to equity fell to 1.14 times at the end of March from 1.48 times in September 2016 with the group's equity rising to $6.93 billion from $5.85 billion. Buy-Back Decreasing Trafigura has paid out billions of dollars in share buybacks to its shareholders, including departing founders. But this year it will reduce buybacks to $475 million from $719 million in 2016, $775 million in 2015 and $885 million in 2014, Salmon said. He said the company had yet to buy back the stake of its main founder, Claude Dauphin, who died in 2015. The company has said it would continue buybacks while recycling the shares back to current employees as former employees sell out, provided it generates enough profits.  The payout to shareholders will have no impact on the debt ratio,  said Salmon. He also said the firm was working on boosting liquidity. Earlier this year, it issued a $600 million perpetual security listed on the Singapore stock exchange with an annual coupon of 6.875 percent. The bond has no fixed redemption date and carries an option to defer the coupon.  We will never do an IPO but this perpetual bond shows that large institutional investors believe in our story,  said Salmon.  Given the nature of this bond, you can view it as affordable equity or expensive debt,  he added. (Editing by Greg Mahlich)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/trafigura-debt-idUSL8N1J42W6"},

The board will hear a report by the four IOC vice presidents on the possibility of awarding two summer Olympic Games at the same time and will make a recommendation to be voted on before the 2024 Games election on Sept. 13. With only Los Angeles and Paris left in the race for the 2024 Olympics after four other cities pulled out over cost and size concerns, the IOC decided to reform the bidding process to make it more attractive to prospective hosts. What was once perceived as the hottest of sports properties is now seen by many cities as a liability that can potentially drag an entire country's economy down. Rome, Budapest, Hamburg and Boston also thought along those lines before pulling the plug on their bids. IOC President Thomas Bach said the bid process was creating  too many losers , with cities that lost out in an IOC vote hesitant to try again. Both the cost for bidding, which can reach 80 million euros (about $90 million) or even more, as well as the financial demands of the multi-billion dollar Games are deterring factors.  The (bidding) process is too expensive and perfectionist,  Bach said this week.   It does not work any more in many western countries. So we need to change something. It is about reducing costs.  Sharing Games  What the IOC's widely-expected recommendation practically means is that the two cities left in bidding process -- LA and Paris -- will share the next two summer Games between them. What will be left to decide is in which order. Sources close to the process said the IOC Executive Board was likely to decide on the general process of awarding two Games and possibly calling for a full session in July, when the two cities will make a scheduled presentation to the members for the penultimate time before the vote in Lima in September. At such a session, members could then vote on a more concrete proposal before heading to Lima two months later.  It makes sense. It is difficult to find two better cities in the world to host the Olympics,  an Olympic insider, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.  Are you prepared to lose one of them?  Paris appears to have the edge for 2024, having bid three times without success and with its plans needing government support, compared to the privately-funded American bid. Both cities have insisted their bids were only for 2024, not 2028, but Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti hinted earlier this month his city could live with hosting the Games in 2028.  They (IOC) have asked us to think about – both Paris and us – what would it take for us to consider one of us going first and the other going second,  Garcetti said earlier this month. He said getting to host any Olympics would be a success.  Given some of the challenges we face globally right now with leadership, that would be, I think, quite a coup and something for us all to celebrate.

The plaintiffs, Paul Bishop and Robert Kraus, had said the Wall Street bank had requested Federal Reserve loans on various occasions when it was in violation of certain banking regulations, in a complaint filed in 2011.

In a White House meeting, Trump welcomed indications by senior Republicans that the Senate might vote on a healthcare bill in July, before it breaks for the summer, after the House of Representatives passed its own version in May.  Now the Senate I'm sure will follow suit and get a bill across the finish line this summer that will be great healthcare and I'm looking forward to seeing it,  Trump said. The gathering included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and his No. 2, Senator John Cornyn, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and his deputies, Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. Buffeted by criticism on many fronts, Trump wants faster action from his fellow Republicans who control Congress, pressing lawmakers to finish the job of dismantling the Obamacare healthcare law and move on quickly to another of his priorities: tax cuts. McConnell said Senate Republicans are  getting close  to a healthcare plan after he presented an outline at a lunchtime meeting but he declined to say when he might bring it up for a vote. Other senior Republicans say they hope to vote by early July.  The leader would like to do this soon,  Senator Orrin Hatch told reporters. The Senate requires a 60-vote supermajority to advance most legislation but Republican Mike Enzi, head of the Senate Budget Committee, said the health bill that passed the House qualifies for an expedited process that would require only 51 votes. Still, Republicans have little margin for error because they only control 52 seats in the 100-seat chamber and remain divided over key questions such as how quickly to scale back the Medicaid health plan for the poor.  You have to get 50 people - that means they have to get me and a lot of people who are concerned about Medicaid,  said Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, a state that depends heavily on the program. Medicaid was expanded under Obamacare but the House bill would phase that expansion out in 2020. The Senate bill might keep the expansion in place beyond that date, said Republican Senator John Barrasso. Comey Testimony U.S. President Donald Trump walks out to annouce proposed reforms to the U.S. air traffic control system during an event at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. June 5, 2017.Jonathan ErnstWhatever the White House's efforts to push ahead with policy plans, there will be a spotlight on testimony by James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump last month, to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Senators will question Comey on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an FBI investigation into ties between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia, an attempt that critics have said could constitute obstruction of justice. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and has called the investigation a  witch hunt.  The Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to oversee its probe into the Russia issue and several congressional panels also are investigating the matter.   Elected on pledges to overhaul the healthcare system and slash taxes, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative win, and time is running out before lawmakers leave Washington for the August break. There has been little progress on healthcare since the House passed its bill. McConnell told Reuters late last month he did not yet know how to amass the votes needed to pass a bill on  healthcare. He appeared to make some progress on Tuesday. Some Republican lawmakers praised an outline that McConnell presented at a lunchtime meeting, although they cautioned that much work remained to be done.  Senator Bill Cassidy said the plan offered more protections than the House bill for people who already have pre-existing illnesses when they apply for insurance coverage - a major point of contention.  I think personally they are moving in the right direction,  he said. The House healthcare bill could result in 23 million people losing insurance, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis.  Congress might then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that such changes not add to the national debt, Marc Short, Trump's top aide on Capitol Hill, told reporters on Monday that the top priority would be cutting taxes. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. The proposal has been short on details, including how much the tax cuts would cost and what loopholes would be closed. Others are eager to move past healthcare as well.  We need to bring this to an end and move to taxes,  said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.

The Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (NAFEX) mechanism, commonly referred to as the  Investors' and Exporters' FX Window , appears to be boosting FC supply and the flow of FC liquidity into the banking system. Improved access to FC means that liquidity pressures have, for now, eased for Fitch-rated banks. FC was in acute short supply through much of 2016 and early 2017, restricting imports and forcing several Nigerian banks to extend maturities on their trade finance obligations. NAFEX provides investors and exporters with a more transparent mechanism through which they can sell FC to willing buyers. Authorised banks act as intermediaries, clearing funds supplied by portfolio investors and exporters and ensuring timely execution of settlement for buyers. Despite its short record, volumes transacted through NAFEX are growing. In our opinion, NAFEX offers a more transparent alternative to accessing FC than is available through the other foreign-exchange markets in the country. Several exchange rates operate in Nigeria. The CBN was the main supplier of FC during the height of the FC liquidity crisis and it still sells FC to the market through regular auctions, with banks acting as intermediaries. Its official exchange rate is NGN305 to the US dollar but it sets alternative official rates at its FC auctions and different rates apply for retail, wholesale, personal and small business purchasers of FC. NAFEX introduces yet another exchange rate, which adds to the confusion, but its rates are set by market participants and this is already attracting greater volumes than other exchange mechanisms. Access to FC is essential to boost growth in the country's highly import-dependent economy. The ability of market participants to set their own rates under NAFEX is also forcing down exchange rates on the parallel markets. This is positive for the banks as it helps to draw funds back into the banking sector. Over time, exchange rates may converge, but this will depend on a range of market and political considerations. The CBN can intervene on NAFEX, but we understand from our recent discussions with banks that CBN interventions have been limited. NAFEX rates have averaged about NGN380 to the US dollar recently and volumes are reaching about USD1 billion a week, according to these discussions. While the improved FC access is credit positive for banks, the ratings of all the Nigerian banks remain constrained by our sovereign rating of 'B+'/Negative.

As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are among those to have cut ties with Qatar over its alleged support for terrorism, an accusation Qatar vehemently denies. Qatar is dependent on imports for its basic needs, which are transported by land and sea. Container ships carry vital consumer supplies, including food. Fewer container services will also hurt Qatar's ability to trade. Evergreen, the world's no.6 container shipping line and OOCL, the world's no. 7 carrier, said in separate statements that they had temporarily suspended services to and from Qatar until further notice. Evergreen said this was  in light of the blockade imposed on Qatar , while OOCL cited  the current political climate in the region .  We are working closely with our stakeholders to address the impact on services,  OOCL added. Denmark's Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping line, said on Tuesday it was unable to transport goods in or out of Qatar because it could not take them through the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali. Maersk added that it was trying to find alternative routes. In contrast, the world's No.2 line, MSC of Switzerland, said on Wednesday  cargo acceptance to and from Qatar is still ongoing .  The company is in dialogue with the relevant authorities and assessing the potential impact on its operations,  MSC said. The ban imposed earlier this week has meant that container ships and other types of vessels sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain. The UAE said on Wednesday that more moves against Qatar, including further curbs on business, remained on the table. Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines especially use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali. Evergreen said before the suspension it had offered a direct service to Doha by taking cargo slots on ships operated by France's CMA CGM, the world's no.3 line. Evergreen said other cargoes had been separately transhipped via Jebel Ali. CMA CGM did not immediately respond to requests for comment over whether it had suspended services.

The board will hear a report by the four IOC vice presidents on the possibility of awarding two summer Olympic Games at the same time and will make a recommendation to be voted on before the 2024 Games election on Sept. 13. With only Los Angeles and Paris left in the race for the 2024 Olympics after four other cities pulled out over cost and size concerns, the IOC decided to reform the bidding process to make it more attractive to prospective hosts. What was once perceived as the hottest of sports properties is now seen by many cities as a liability that can potentially drag an entire country's economy down. Rome, Budapest, Hamburg and Boston also thought along those lines before pulling the plug on their bids. IOC President Thomas Bach said the bid process was creating  too many losers , with cities that lost out in an IOC vote hesitant to try again. Both the cost for bidding, which can reach 80 million euros (about $90 million) or even more, as well as the financial demands of the multi-billion dollar Games are deterring factors.  The (bidding) process is too expensive and perfectionist,  Bach said this week.   It does not work any more in many western countries. So we need to change something. It is about reducing costs.  Sharing Games  What the IOC's widely-expected recommendation practically means is that the two cities left in bidding process -- LA and Paris -- will share the next two summer Games between them. What will be left to decide is in which order. Sources close to the process said the IOC Executive Board was likely to decide on the general process of awarding two Games and possibly calling for a full session in July, when the two cities will make a scheduled presentation to the members for the penultimate time before the vote in Lima in September. At such a session, members could then vote on a more concrete proposal before heading to Lima two months later.  It makes sense. It is difficult to find two better cities in the world to host the Olympics,  an Olympic insider, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.  Are you prepared to lose one of them?  Paris appears to have the edge for 2024, having bid three times without success and with its plans needing government support, compared to the privately-funded American bid. Both cities have insisted their bids were only for 2024, not 2028, but Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti hinted earlier this month his city could live with hosting the Games in 2028.  They (IOC) have asked us to think about – both Paris and us – what would it take for us to consider one of us going first and the other going second,  Garcetti said earlier this month. He said getting to host any Olympics would be a success.  Given some of the challenges we face globally right now with leadership, that would be, I think, quite a coup and something for us all to celebrate.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's office also got involved in what has become a public boardroom battle, asking a former cabinet minister to look into the suspension of FGV's top executives.  Turmoil at FGV - whose biggest shareholder is state-owned Felda - could hurt Najib, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. Its shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states. The board of FGV, the world's third-largest palm oil plantation operator, suspended its chief executive and chief financial officer on Tuesday as it investigates transactions at a subsidiary. Two other directors have also been suspended.  CEO Zakaria Arshad has denied wrongdoing and refused to step down as instructed by chairman Mohd Isa Abdul Samad, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Zakaria had called on the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to conduct its own investigation.       The anti-corruption agency is looking into FGV following Tuesday's developments and an investigation will be opened as soon as possible, MACC Deputy Chief Commissioner Azam Baki told Reuters on Wednesday.   We are looking into claims of graft and possible abuse of power involving several officials,  he said, declining to name the officials or give specifics on the claims. Key Vote Bank The Malaysian government appointed Idris Jala as an independent party  to establish the facts of the case  regarding the suspension of the four executives and  recommend the way forward , according to a statement from the PM's office. Idris, who served as a minister in the PM's department, is known as a turnaround specialist in Malaysia. As chief executive of Malaysia Airlines in 2006, he returned the national carrier to profitability by cutting costs and thousands of jobs. Solving the public spat would be critical for Najib and FGV's controlling shareholder Felda, or Federal Land Development Authority.  Felda  settlers , or land owners, are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the parliament. They own shares in FGV, which raised over $3 billion in one of the world's biggest listings of 2012. The shares have dropped 70 percent since that stock market launch, hurting settlers who have also complained about delayed payments from Felda, which buys the palm fruit the settlers produce in their land. Shares of FGV fell about 1 percent initially on Wednesday before rebounding to close up 2.5 percent. They had declined 6 percent on Tuesday, falling at one point to their lowest in five months. Earlier this year, settlers had also expressed doubts about Felda's $505 million purchase of a non-controlling stake in PT Eagle High Plantations Tbh, owned by one of Indonesia's biggest conglomerates, the Rajawali Group. Plantation analysts said the purchase price was steep by some valuation measures. Focused on Restructuring  Zakaria was perceived by FGV shareholders as someone who was focused on restructuring efforts and improving the share's value, according to industry analysts. He took over in April last year from Mohd Emir Mavani Abdullah, who was replaced after a failed initial attempt in 2015 to buy the Eagle High stake.  Since then, Zakaria has said FGV will rationalize its operations to address its  structural and financial issues . The FGV board said a deal with Dubai-based palm oil buyer Safitex was at the heart of the company's internal investigation. In a statement on Wednesday, the FGV board said a PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit showed that Safitex's debt to an FGV subsidiary, Delima Oil Products, had grown from $8.3 million at the end of 2015 to $11.7 million in 2016.  Management had continuously represented that the balance would be fully recoverable,  FGV said. Instead, it grew to exceed the allocated credit limit for the financial year ended Dec. 31, 2016, it said. After receiving the PwC report, the board then instructed internal auditors to probe the matter and they  detected potential contraventions of group policies , FGV said. Brokerage CIMB on Wednesday downgraded FGV to a  reduce  rating from  hold , saying the suspension of the CEO and CFO for an indefinite period of time will lead to uncertainties about its direction.

Average house prices in the three months to May were 3.3 percent higher than a year earlier, the weakest increase since May 2013 and slowing from a 3.8 percent rise in April. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected to see a somewhat sharper slowdown to 3.0 percent. In May alone, house prices were 0.4 percent higher than in April, confounding forecasts for 0.1 percent drop. With Britons just a day away from voting in a national election, the figures added to signs that households are reining back spending in the face of higher inflation fuelled by rising energy costs and the weakened pound since the vote for Brexit. A separate survey from rival mortgage lender Nationwide last week showed house prices fell for three months in a row for the first time since 2009.  The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to deteriorate further over the coming months with consumers' purchasing power squeezed further by a combination of higher inflation and muted earnings growth,  Howard Archer, economist for forecasters EY ITEM Club said. The housing market has slowed sharply since last June's vote to leave the European Union, when prices were growing by almost 10 percent a year. Bank of England figures showed the number of mortgages approved by lenders slid to a seven-month low in April. Still, Halifax said a weak supply of new homes and existing properties for sale, combined with low interest rates and high unemployment, should support house prices over the coming months.

Our vision is to be the most credible bank in Greece,  said CEO Christos Megalou, who took over in April.  Our strategy plan makes sense and is not pie in the sky,  Megalou, who was previously CEO of rival Eurobank, said.  Our goals are demanding but achievable.  Piraeus, which is 26.2 percent owned by Greece's bank rescue fund HFSF, is still struggling with problem loans after a deep recession in Greece pushed unemployment to record highs. The bank plans to slim down by selling wholly-owned subsidiaries in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Albania and the Ukraine as part of its  Agenda 2020  plan to reduce its foreign exposures. The group also plans to divest other holdings, including a 40 percent stake in shipping company Hellenic Seaways and the bank's 33 percent stakes in fish farms Nireus Aquaculture and Selonda, Megalou said. Piraeus, 67 percent owned by institutional investors, will create a separate division to be known as  Piraeus Legacy Unit,  as part of efforts to clean up its balance sheet. Piraeus Bank will remain as the  good bank  with risk-weighted assets of 28 billion euros and a 2 percent non-performing loans ratio, comprising corporate banking, retail operations and asset management. It will aim for a 1.1 percent return on assets. The legacy unit, with risk-weighted assets of 25 billion euros and a 64 percent non-performing loan ratio, will include international and non-core banking operations earmarked for sale. It will aim to shrink its bad loans via sales and restructuring. A mountain of non-performing exposures (NPEs), comprising non-performing loans (NPLs) and restructured loans likely to turn bad, is the biggest challenge facing Greek banks. The banks' stock of NPEs stands at about 58 percent of economic output. Piraeus will seek to shrink its NPEs to below 20 billion euros by 2020 from 33.3 billion in the first quarter and its NPLs, loans past due more than 90 days, to around 8 billion euros from 23 billion at end-March. Piraeus, with a current market value of 1.8 billion euros, also aims to pay back 2.0 billion euros of contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) to the HFSF rescue fund by 2020. The funds were injected into the bank a recapitalisation two years ago.  By then we will have generated the cash and capital to fully pay back the bonds,  Megalou said. The group also aims to restore its access to wholesale funding markets and reduce borrowing from the Greek central bank's emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) down to zero by 2020 from 11 billion euros last year.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's office also got involved in what has become a public boardroom battle, asking a former cabinet minister to look into the suspension of FGV's top executives.  Turmoil at FGV - whose biggest shareholder is state-owned Felda - could hurt Najib, who government sources say is expected to call elections later this year. Its shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states. The board of FGV, the world's third-largest palm oil plantation operator, suspended its chief executive and chief financial officer on Tuesday as it investigates transactions at a subsidiary. Two other directors have also been suspended.  CEO Zakaria Arshad has denied wrongdoing and refused to step down as instructed by chairman Mohd Isa Abdul Samad, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Zakaria had called on the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to conduct its own investigation.       The anti-corruption agency is looking into FGV following Tuesday's developments and an investigation will be opened as soon as possible, MACC Deputy Chief Commissioner Azam Baki told Reuters on Wednesday.   We are looking into claims of graft and possible abuse of power involving several officials,  he said, declining to name the officials or give specifics on the claims. Key Vote Bank The Malaysian government appointed Idris Jala as an independent party  to establish the facts of the case  regarding the suspension of the four executives and  recommend the way forward , according to a statement from the PM's office. Idris, who served as a minister in the PM's department, is known as a turnaround specialist in Malaysia. As chief executive of Malaysia Airlines in 2006, he returned the national carrier to profitability by cutting costs and thousands of jobs. Solving the public spat would be critical for Najib and FGV's controlling shareholder Felda, or Federal Land Development Authority.  Felda  settlers , or land owners, are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the parliament. They own shares in FGV, which raised over $3 billion in one of the world's biggest listings of 2012. The shares have dropped 70 percent since that stock market launch, hurting settlers who have also complained about delayed payments from Felda, which buys the palm fruit the settlers produce in their land. Shares of FGV fell about 1 percent initially on Wednesday before rebounding to close up 2.5 percent. They had declined 6 percent on Tuesday, falling at one point to their lowest in five months. Earlier this year, settlers had also expressed doubts about Felda's $505 million purchase of a non-controlling stake in PT Eagle High Plantations Tbh, owned by one of Indonesia's biggest conglomerates, the Rajawali Group. Plantation analysts said the purchase price was steep by some valuation measures. Focused on Restructuring  Zakaria was perceived by FGV shareholders as someone who was focused on restructuring efforts and improving the share's value, according to industry analysts. He took over in April last year from Mohd Emir Mavani Abdullah, who was replaced after a failed initial attempt in 2015 to buy the Eagle High stake.  Since then, Zakaria has said FGV will rationalize its operations to address its  structural and financial issues . The FGV board said a deal with Dubai-based palm oil buyer Safitex was at the heart of the company's internal investigation. In a statement on Wednesday, the FGV board said a PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit showed that Safitex's debt to an FGV subsidiary, Delima Oil Products, had grown from $8.3 million at the end of 2015 to $11.7 million in 2016.  Management had continuously represented that the balance would be fully recoverable,  FGV said. Instead, it grew to exceed the allocated credit limit for the financial year ended Dec. 31, 2016, it said. After receiving the PwC report, the board then instructed internal auditors to probe the matter and they  detected potential contraventions of group policies , FGV said. Brokerage CIMB on Wednesday downgraded FGV to a  reduce  rating from  hold , saying the suspension of the CEO and CFO for an indefinite period of time will lead to uncertainties about its direction.

Various grids may require more imports to cover expected demand rises when consumers switch on air conditioning devices and thermal generation plants need more cooling water, ENTSO-E said in its biannual  adequacy report  on 36 countries. The report covered the outlook from June 1 through Oct. 2 and stretched from central European countries as far as Turkey, Kosovo, Malta, and Burshtyn Island in Ukraine. Most of Europe should experience above-normal temperatures from June to August, except the northern half of Britain and most of Scandinavia which will be cooler than average, a recent report from the Weather Company predicted.  Italy has potential supply deficit situations over several weeks between mid-June until the end of July,  Alban Joyeau an expert in ENTSO-E's system development group, said in a webinar. This was due to reduced generation capacity in the North and Central North regions after plant closures and could be worsened by a combination of temperatures above 28 degrees Celsius (82.4°F) and low hydroelectric resources, he said. But Italy's transmission system operator (TSO), Terna , was preparing to take countermeasures such as more imports, demand side response - when consumers agree to take less electricity - and the temporary use of idled plants. TSOs are in charge of getting electricity to consumers in an increasingly unified market in Europe, while facing the challenge of more intermittent renewable energy, as countries strive to curb their reliance on carbon-polluting fossil fuels. ENTSO-E monitors and co-ordinates their efforts to ensure that supply is secure at all times. Joyeau said Poland could be exposed if there was little or no solar and wind capacity during daytime consumption peaks of 1300 to 1400 Central European Time. The weeks starting July 17 and July 24 were likely to be most critical, he added. Although solar capacity in neighbouring Germany is high and could potentially help, Poland's import capacity is limited, which in August 2015 led to enforced plant closures and sent local prices sky-high. The report also said that there could be some unwanted solar power surpluses in southern Italy and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia during sunny Sundays, when consumption is low. Electricity flows between the EU's two main power markets, France and Germany, are sizeable and represent capacity equivalent to five nuclear reactors, providing regular and efficient exchanges of supply.

The absorption of Popular by Spain's biggest bank Santander for a nominal one euro was the first use of a regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the 2008 financial crisis and made barely a ripple in Europe's stock and debt markets. Indeed, as the morning wore on the success of the process pushed shares in many major banks higher, supporting a recovery for Madrid's stock market and fending off this week's broadly weaker mood. There was some shock initially at the imposition of steep losses on junior bondholders and shareholders in Popular, but senior bondholders were spared. European banking shares rose 1.2 percent. Wall Street was set to open flat to marginally higher.  The market has taken Banco Popular as positive news because essentially this is not a bankruptcy but a sort of rescue, even if its subordinated bondholders have been sharply hit,  said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan.  The fall in subordinated debt at other Spanish banks today lasted just around one hour. It's seen positively because it draws a line under (the problem) involving only risk capital.  Ecb Cut? The bank rescue does, however, underline the risks to growth, banking and government debt burdens that are likely to delay a major switch in language and policy direction by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday. The euro fell half a percent against the dollar in morning trade in Europe, spurred by a Bloomberg report that the ECB instead of flipping towards tighter policy would cut its inflation forecasts.  Maybe tomorrow's ECB meeting sees nothing but platitudes and disappoints a market that is getting ahead of itself,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes,  But (for us) that would be a huge euro buying opportunity, because ECB normalisation IS coming. And when it does, the euro simply won't be able to sustain undervalued levels for long.  European blue chip shares had risen by 0.1-0.2 percent by 0850 GMT  and Madrid's IBEX recovered from early losses to trade flat on the day. Oil prices, however, were again almost 1 percent lower and the flow of money into the perceived security of Japan's yen this week continued. The yen rose 0.6 percent against the euro and as high as 109.11 yen per dollar - its strongest in seven weeks, before steadying. The greenback has lost 1 percent so far this week, pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows. A surprisingly closely-fought British election set for Thursday is weighing on investors' minds along with U.S. Senate testimony from James Comey, the former FBI chief fired by President Donald Trump. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony are likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhaul the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.  Tomorrow is what is being dubbed as 'Triple Threat Thursday', ... an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.

UAE airlines Etihad and Emirates announced the details of the travel restrictions on Wednesday after Australian carrier and Emirates partner Qantas Airways said it would not fly Qataris to Dubai because of the government restrictions.  Abu Dhabi-owned Etihad also said foreigners living in Qatar with residence permits would no longer be eligible for visas upon arrival in the United Arab Emirates. Several Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, cut ties with Qatar on Monday over what they say is its support for terrorism, an accusation the Gulf state vehemently denies. The UAE had already said Qataris would not be allowed to enter the country, though the practical impact on airline passengers had been unclear. The airlines have now clarified Qataris cannot fly to Abu Dhabi or Dubai even to change planes. The travel curbs add to the woes of Qatar's flagship airline Qatar Airways which has now lost access to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, its two key markets for transfer passengers, said John Strickland, director at JLS Consulting. Qatar Airways has canceled all flights to those countries, which averaged 55 a day before the diplomatic row, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. The airline's website said it has offered refunds or rebookings to affected passengers.  If the actions become protracted then it's probable that  customers outside the region will seek increasingly to book on competitor airlines to avoid the longer routings and disruptions which Qatar is currently subjected to as a result of overflight bans,  Strickland said. The transit ban on Qataris is stricter than the restrictions for Israeli passport holders who are allowed up to 24 hours to change planes at UAE airports, even though Israel and the United Arab Emirates don't have diplomatic relations. Qatar Airways Offices Shut UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority ordered all Qatar Airways offices to close in the UAE, the official WAM news agency reported. A Qatar Airways spokesman confirmed the move.  Saudi Arabia and Bahrain revoked the licenses of Qatar Airways on Tuesday and ordered its offices to be closed within 48 hours. OPSGROUP, an industry flight operations service, said it had advised airlines of a series of restrictions on Qatari nationals, including a ban on transit through the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were the largest markets by the number of available seats for Qatar Airways and the loss of the four Arab markets could lead to a double-digit decline in revenue for the carrier, CAPA said.  This is the strongest accusation to date of Qatar being connected with terrorism. Many travelers and corporate accounts could blacklist Qatar Airways,  Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a note published on Wednesday. Indonesia said on Wednesday it had diverted Muslim pilgrims going to Saudi Arabia to other airlines. An Islamic Religious Council of Singapore spokesman said alternative flights to Saudi Arabia were being sought, with less than 200 people affected.  Moroccan airline Royal Air Maroc canceled flights via Doha to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Egypt, state news agency MAP and the airline's customer service said.

LCH, part of the London Stock Exchange, clears the bulk of euro-denominated derivatives in Europe. The EU is due on June 13 to say whether this activity should be shifted to an EU state after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019. LCH Group Chief Operating Officer Daniel Maguire said the clearing house, which stands between two sides of a trade to ensure its smooth completion, is already directly registered and supervised in many countries. It has a clearing house in Paris. Brussels is looking at several options, such as forced relocation or an EU role in directly supervising LCH in London where it is regulated by the Bank of England. Maguire said it was very encouraging that the so-called  enhanced supervision  option was on the table.  For global markets it makes sense to move towards more enhanced oversight,  he told a Futures Industry Association (FIA) conference. There was talk among delegates at the event that Brussels was leaning towards caps on the volume of euro-denominated clearing that could take place outside the bloc without relocation. Maguire referred to a recent speech by Christopher Giancarlo, acting head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who said the United States could still supervise clearers in London that handle dollar-denominated securities, despite an ocean the size of the Atlantic between them.  We should also think that the sea as big as the Channel is not too big for us to get across and ensure you have the same level of enhanced oversight,  Maguire said.  I definitely think there is a willingness to do that.   We hope that over time there will be sensible debate, cooperation and discussion, and a conclusion that keeps markets together, which is to the advantage of the EU, and the real economy, clients, members, central banks,  Maguire said It did not make sense for a global currency like the euro to become  localised , he said. This week the FIA warned that forced relocation of euro clearing would lead to a near doubling of the $83 billion users currently set aside in case of contract defaults. Eurex Clearing in Frankfurt, which has said it was ready to handle relocated euro clearing, dismissed this figure.  I think it's very far from a realistic number,  Eurex Clearing CEO Eric Mueller told the conference. He also cautioned against dismissing arguments put forward by the European Central Bank and others in favour of relocation.  We as an industry need to find answers to the concerns, instead of just saying, you know it's not a good idea,  Mueller said.  We need to work with those constituencies to find answers... There is some understanding that things on the oversight angle have to change.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - Reports of Britain being on the verge of a current account crisis are almost always greatly exaggerated but the second half of 2017 could be the hardest time for years to convince overseas investors that they should keep on plugging the yawning deficit. Economic growth is slowing, Brexit uncertainty will crystallise as negotiations over Britain's departure from the European Union get under way, and the relative yields on offer to foreign buyers of UK gilts are the lowest in decades. Having one of the developed world's biggest current account deficits means Britain relies on  the kindness of strangers , in the words of Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney, to balance its books. Last year the deficit was 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, meaning Britain needed about $100 billion from abroad. The shock Brexit vote a year ago did not cool demand for gilts from overseas investors immediately. They kept buying but demand peaked in November at a three-month rolling rate of nearly 40 billion pounds ($50 billion) a month. That was the highest since BoE records began in 1986. Gilt investors often include foreign reserve managers at central banks and sovereign wealth funds, with long-term horizons and deep pockets. They are prepared to ride out short-term volatility if they see longer-term value. They are unlikely to cut and run just because of Brexit and slowing growth. If anything, sterling's 12-percent fall since June last year will have fuelled more purchases just to maintain the currency composition of their FX reserves. But appetite for gilts at any price is not unlimited, particularly from sovereign wealth managers, who are more sensitive to rates of return than reserve managers. Since November, foreign purchases of gilts have waned and the rolling average for most of this year has been a small net outflow. State Street Global Markets' EMEA head of macro strategy, Tim Graf, believes foreign demand is the  swing variable  for financing the current account. Worryingly, that demand may be about to dry up, he said. Feel Flows You can see why. Returns offered by gilts seem low in light of the potential risks ahead. Official interest rates are a record low 0.25 percent and the 10-year yield is back below 1 percent, the lowest since October. The difference between British and the G3 - U.S., German and Japanese - average 10-year yield is about 17 basis points, close to the lowest in decades, according to State Street. Meanwhile, inflation is 2.7 percent - already above the BoE's 2 percent target - and rising, putting the squeeze on real earnings, consumer spending and overall growth. This comes just as the Brexit uncertainty is set to crank up a level irrespective of the outcome of this week's national election and break-up talks with the EU begin in earnest.  The risk is for reduced inflows in the short run and potential outflows over the long run. That's a worry for me,  Graf said. And it is not just bonds. According to Office of National Statistics data, foreign investors sold a net 60 billion pounds of UK equities in the fourth quarter of 2016, their biggest single quarterly sales on record going back to 1980. On a four-quarter rolling basis the total outflow was 114.5 billion pounds, also the biggest fourth quarter outflow on record. Mutual fund flows data from EPFR Global show that cumulative UK equity fund inflows have evaporated since the start of last year. Outflows are now the largest for years. Meanwhile, a report this week by asset manager Invesco showed that sovereign investors view Brexit as a significant risk for all UK investments. The study, based on interviews with 97 sovereign wealth funds, state pension funds and central banks with assets in excess of $12 trillion, showed that Britain saw the biggest drop in attractiveness, scoring 5.5 out of 10 versus 7.5 last year. Some 41 percent of sovereigns expect to introduce new underweight positions to UK assets in 2017, compared with just 5 percent planning new overweight positions. A majority of 54 percent said they would not make any changes to their weighting, preferring to wait to assess the longer term impact of Brexit. But foreign investors do not need to sell UK assets for current account funding - and therefore sterling - to come under pressure. They just need to buy less, or not buy at all.

UAE airlines Etihad and Emirates announced the details of the travel restrictions on Wednesday after Australian carrier and Emirates partner Qantas Airways said it would not fly Qataris to Dubai because of the government restrictions. Abu Dhabi-owned Etihad also said foreigners living in Qatar with residence permits would no longer be eligible for visas upon arrival in the United Arab Emirates. Several Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, cut ties with Qatar on Monday over what they say is its support for terrorism, an accusation the Gulf state vehemently denies. The UAE had already said Qataris would not be allowed to enter the country, though the practical impact on airline passengers had been unclear. The airlines have now clarified Qataris cannot fly to Abu Dhabi or Dubai even to change planes. The travel curbs add to the woes of Qatar's flagship airline Qatar Airways which has now lost access to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, its two key markets for transfer passengers, said John Strickland, director at JLS Consulting. Qatar Airways has cancelled all flights to those countries, which averaged 55 a day before the diplomatic row, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. The airline's website said it has offered refunds or rebookings to affected passengers.  If the actions become protracted then it's probable that customers outside the region will seek increasingly to book on competitor airlines to avoid the longer routings and disruptions which Qatar is currently subjected to as a result of overflight bans,  Strickland said. The transit ban on Qataris is stricter than the restrictions for Israeli passport holders who are allowed up to 24 hours to change planes at UAE airports, even though Israel and the United Arab Emirates don't have diplomatic relations. Qatar Airways Offices Shut UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority ordered all Qatar Airways offices to close in the UAE, the official WAM news agency reported. A Qatar Airways spokesman confirmed the move. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain revoked the licences of Qatar Airways on Tuesday and ordered its offices to be closed within 48 hours. OPSGROUP, an industry flight operations service, said it had advised airlines of a series of restrictions on Qatari nationals, including a ban on transit through the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were the largest markets by the number of available seats for Qatar Airways and the loss of the four Arab markets could lead to a double-digit decline in revenue for the carrier, CAPA said.  This is the strongest accusation to date of Qatar being connected with terrorism. Many travellers and corporate accounts could blacklist Qatar Airways,  Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a note published on Wednesday. Indonesia said on Wednesday it had diverted Muslim pilgrims going to Saudi Arabia to other airlines. An Islamic Religious Council of Singapore spokesman said alternative flights to Saudi Arabia were being sought, with less than 200 people affected. Moroccan airline Royal Air Maroc cancelled flights via Doha to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Egypt, state news agency MAP and the airline's customer service said.

The SNB on Wednesday reported the first decline in its foreign exchange holdings since January and this week posted a drop in domestic sight deposits, a proxy for its foreign currency purchases, which are aimed at softening the strong Swiss franc. For a graphic see tinyurl.com/lk9ejws An analysis of sight deposit data shows an increase of just 89 million Swiss francs ($92 million) last week, down from an average of nearly 2.1 billion francs per week so far in 2017. But the reduction has been masked in recent weeks as Swiss individuals paid their taxes in April and May, inflating the level of total sight deposits, a keenly watched figure seen as a signal of the SNB's strategy.  The increase in sight deposits in recent weeks was likely not down to currency interventions, but more seasonal effects like tax revenues being paid to the central government,  said Alexander Koch, an economist at Bank Raiffeisen.  That will have increased sight deposits by around 10 billion francs,  he said.  This has probably had an important psychological effect on the market, and helped the SNB by giving the impression it is being more active in the market.  The SNB has been using a combination of foreign currency purchases and negative interest rates to ward off interest in the Swiss franc since it scrapped its limit on the currency versus the euro two-and-a-half years ago. The bank, which gives its latest monetary policy update next week, declined to comment on its interventions. Chairman Thomas Jordan said last week he remained committed to its twin-track strategy and has room to expand its balance sheet. Its balance sheet has now expanded to nearly 783 billion francs, 18 percent larger than Swiss GDP in 2016. Other economists said the SNB was intervening less than in recent weeks, with its actions following a pattern of responding to political uncertainty which usually drives demand for the franc.  The SNB is certainly hoping it won't have to intervene as much as it has in the past,  said Alessandro Bee, an economist at UBS.  Risk aversion which was in the market before has now been reduced.

Spurred by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Brussels has seized on deeper military ties proposed last year by France and Germany to show its citizens the bloc is still relevant and can provide security in the face of Islamist militant attacks and a resurgent Russia.  Defense and security is one of the fields through which we can re-launch the European Union,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a news conferences. Failings in Europe's bombing campaign in Libya in 2011, when the United States had to step in with refueling planes, and Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea have reignited EU defense plans that date back to the 1950s but have remained elusive.  Britain had long blocked EU defense integration, fearing a European armed force wearing the same uniforms.  This is not about creating an EU army,  European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen told reporters.  NATO does not have a NATO army,  he said, stressing that Western military alliances are formed by national forces working together. Although the European Union has more than a dozen military missions abroad, the world's biggest trading bloc has never been able to match its economic might with broad defensive power, preferring to rely on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.     The EU is not seeking to compete with NATO, Mogherini said. But U.S. President Donald Trump's sharp criticism of European allies for low defense spending and his refusal to fully back the alliance publicly has added to concerns that without the United States and Britain, the European Union is vulnerable to a host of threats, from cyber to militant attacks. A year since proposals on an  European Defence Union  from Paris and Berlin, the European Commission said it was willing to provide money from the EU's common budget for the first time for defense research. The Commission said it would also create a fund to reverse billions of euros in defense cuts to let governments club together to develop and buy new helicopters and planes to lower costs, also opening the door to new drones, cyber warfare systems and other hi-tech gear. 5.5 Bln Euro Fund? While the amounts of money depend on EU governments' willingness to collaborate, the Commission said it would put forward at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) a year from the bloc's budget for the research and purchase of assets. That could generate some 5.5 billion euros a year after 2020 for research and development if enough governments come forward with funds, EU officials said, stressing that national governments would remain the owners of all equipment. German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the plan.  It is ambitious and shows how far we have gone over the last 12 months in establishing a defense and security union,  she said in a statement, calling for more such steps. Defense research spending in the EU has fallen by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006, and while the European Union spends about half as much as the United States on researching and producing weapons, it only has about 15 percent of the assets that Washington can deploy on the battlefield. EU governments champion national companies, often leading to duplication and wasted funds, according to EU data. In 80 percent of cases, governments award defense contracts to their own firms rather than use European consortiums. The European Union's defense fund idea, which still needs to be approved by governments and the European Parliament, is part of an emerging network of proposals that EU leaders are set to consider at a summit in Brussels on June 22-23. The European Union is setting up a military headquarters for training missions abroad. It wants to make it easier to use its EU battlegroups that have never been deployed, and plans to set up a system to better identify weaknesses in equipment.  Paris also wants to set up a system in which coalitions of willing EU countries come together to carry out and pay for military missions together, rather than leaving future peacekeeping operations to bigger countries such as France. The European Defence Agency, the agency that helps EU governments develop their military capabilities, has also proposed a smaller fund made up of EU states' public money, the so-called Cooperative Financial Mechanism, or CFM.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, therapies extract immune system T-cells from an individual patient, alter their DNA to better spot and kill cancer cells, and infuse them back into the same patient. Investors had been closely watching the fortunes of CAR-T developers, including Kite Pharma Inc and Bluebird Bio Inc. This week, the therapies took center stage at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, with new results on their use for multiple myeloma patients. The science  is quite revolutionary,  said Dr. Michael Sabel, chief of surgical oncology at University of Michigan Health Systems, who is not involved in the trials.  We have struggled for years with the idea of getting T-cells to actually recognize the cancer cell and form that bond, that latch, that allows it to be an effective killing cell,  he said.  We are now seeing that advance.  CAR-T therapies are expected to reach the U.S. market for the first time this year. U.S. regulators are reviewing treatments from Kite and Novartis AG which target a protein called CD19 found in lymphoma and leukemia, achieving remission in more than 80 percent of patients with advanced-stage disease.  CAR-Ts can also pose serious risks, including a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition, though researchers said at ASCO they have become more confident in managing though side effects.  What used to be a sideshow has moved on to the main stage,  said Nick Leschly, chief executive officer at Bluebird Bio. The company, which is developing a therapy with Celgene Corp, gave an update on its clinical trial of multiple myeloma patients who had exhausted other options. All 15 patients evaluated so far have responded to the treatment, and 27 percent had a complete remission, Bluebird said. Shares of Bluebird are up 17 percent so far this week. BMO Capital Markets estimated sales of the therapy, bb2121, could reach $3.6 billion annually. A relatively unknown company, Nanjing Legend Biotech, also surprised ASCO participants with a small CAR-T trial in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. All 35 patients enrolled so far have responded to the treatment. Of the 19 patients followed for more than four months, 14 saw complete remission.     Most trial patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition, but researchers said the side effect was temporary and manageable in most patients.      Dr. Frank Fan, chief scientific officer at Nanjing Legend Biotech, a unit of Genscript Biotech Corp, said the company plans to enroll a total of 100 patients in the Chinese trial and to start a similar U.S. trial in early 2018. Juno Therapeutics Inc scrapped its initial CAR-T candidate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after five patient deaths. The company said at ASCO that early trial results for a different CAR-T found that 66 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients responded to the drug, and 18 percent suffered severe neurological side effects. One patient died, although the company said the death was not attributed to the CAR-T treatment.     Data from Kite showed remission in 73 percent of 11 patients with relapsed ALL who took its CAR-T treatment axi-cel. It plans to launch a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter, possibly at a lower dose. Globally, there are more than 183 clinical CAR-T trials underway, said Dr. Carl June, professor in immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, and one of the first researchers in the CAR-T field. ASCO awarded June the David A. Karnofsky Memorial Award, its highest scientific prize, this week.      This takes immuno-oncology to another level,  June told a packed lecture hall on Sunday.

In a Reuters interview, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said it would be very complex to disentangle the  very diverse  business ties between Qatar and its neighbors but suggested this might be necessary.  You cannot rule out further measures,  he said.  We hope that cooler heads will prevail, that wiser heads will prevail and we will not get to that,  he said.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move on Monday, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran. Qatar strongly denies supporting terrorism, and on Tuesday called for talks to settle the dispute. Closing all transport links with Qatar, the three Gulf states gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave, and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt banned Qatari planes from landing and forbade them from crossing their air space.  This is a very diverse relationship that Qatar has with the UAE and with Saudi and Bahrain – families, business, travel, interests ... It will be quite complex to disentangle, but we are intent on saying we cannot go back to the status quo ante.   If we have to, these are all entanglements that we have to deal with as the crisis develops and create solutions to them and this will be a very, very sad course that we need to take, but I am hoping that cooler heads will prevail in Qatar.   Gargash said Qatar was still engaged in what he called media grand-standing over the rift: It had to make an iron-clad commitment to change its policies before talks could begin to resolve the crisis. Iran's Role  What we are hoping is that our action will send some sense into the decision-makers in Qatar when they will see their overall interest is in not undermining their neighbors.  Asked if he worried that Qatar was being pushed into the arms of Shi'ite Muslim power Iran, Gargash suggested Tehran was seeking to exploit the row to widen Gulf Arab divisions.  Qataris were part and parcel of Gulf Arab society  and I think the issue is Iran would like to take advantage of this .  It would be very unwise for Qatar to allow Iran to play a larger role through escalation, I would rather see the Qataris deal with this issue through rationality and wisdom.  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has strongly criticized U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's leaders for a new regional alliance against Tehran unveiled in May, saying it would bear no fruit.Qatar, which has signaled unhappiness with the anti-Tehran alliance, said on Wednesday it was in talks with Iran and Turkey to secure food and water supplies amid concerns of possible shortages two days after supplies were cut by its biggest suppliers, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Economic output in the euro zone country is still below levels prior to the financial crisis of 2008 as exports have been hit by a string of problems including the decline of Nokia's former phone business and a recession in neighbouring Russia. In the January-April period, exports were up 15 percent year-on-year, the customs office said. Banks have recently lifted their Finnish forecasts and Danske Bank gave the most bullish estimate yet on Wednesday, lifting its view on 2017 gross domestic product to 2.8 percent from previous 1.5 percent. In 2018, however, the bank sees GDP growth cooling down to 1.5 percent.  Exports have long stumbled, but they have recovered this spring and the near future looks bright on the back of global growth,  said Danske economist Pasi Kuoppamaki, adding that investments were also set to pick up. Also on Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a growth forecast of 2.0 percent for this year and 1.5 percent for 2018.

Morgan Asset Management that will help finance product development and international expansion as the unprofitable, privately-held company looks to increase sales.  Existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, 8VC, Accel and DCVC were among the participants in the Series D round, which brought total funding to $267 million, Illumio said. The new funding valued Sunnyvale, California-based Illumio at $1.18 billion, up from $1 billion in an April 2015 financing that raised $100 million, according to PitchBook Data.  The company declined to comment on that estimate.  Illumio sells software that large organizations use to segment computers from each other in a bid to prevent hackers from gaining access to large networks by compromising a single machine. Competitors include VMware Inc (VMW.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O). The company plans to use the funds to expand its sales, marketing and customer service operations as it enters new markets in Europe and Asia, Chief Executive Andrew Rubin said in a telephone interview. Rubin said he is focused on growth, not turning a profit, because the company wants to establish itself as a leader in the rapidly-growing market for network segmentation technology. He declined to discuss the company's sales performance or targets.  We've been fortunate to be well-funded since very early on,  Rubin said.  Profitability is not an issue in a rapidly-growing space - as long as you are growing rapidly and leading.  Illumio has about 100 customers including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) and Workday Inc (WDAY.N), Rubin added.

Two Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC), which can each carry up to 2 million barrels of oil, successfully loaded Abu Dhabi grades on Wednesday, despite having taken on Qatari crude in an earlier leg of the voyage, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed on Wednesday. The loadings come amid Abu Dhabi's easing of restrictions on oil cargoes going to or coming from Qatar, according to a shipping circular seen by Reuters. Tensions in the Middle East erupted on June 5, when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed their ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The Arab allies, which halted air, land and sea movements to and from Qatar also implemented shipping restrictions. The restrictions left oil shippers, unsure of the restrictions' impact, scrambling to take precautionary measures such as seeking smaller tankers to load and ship only Qatari cargoes. Supertanker Apollo Dream loaded Abu Dhabi's Upper Zakum crude after already taking a cargo of Qatar Marine onboard. The Panamanian-flagged vessel, which is managed and chartered by Japanese oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan, loaded the Qatari grade at Halul Island on June 5-6, before heading to Zirku Island in Abu Dhabi to take on the Upper Zakum crude. A second supertanker New Friendship also loaded Abu Dhabi Das Blend crude on Wednesday. The VLCC had earlier taken on Qatari Deodorized Field Condensate (DFC) from Ras Laffan over June 4-5. Both tankers sailed directly from Qatari to UAE berths, and as of 1041 GMT were signalling Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura as their next port of call. 'Business as Usual' The two supertanker voyages point towards the status quo of shipping activities in the region.  Until we hear an example of a 'ban', business as usual for now,  a Singapore-based trader who specialises in Middle East markets said. Two Asian refiners, who declined to be identified because of the commercial sensitivity of the matter, said they did not experience any problems with the shipment of Qatari cargoes.  I think we are fine, we can handle it,  one of the sources said.

Spurred by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Brussels has seized on deeper military ties proposed last year by France and Germany to show its citizens the bloc is still relevant and can provide security in the face of Islamist militant attacks and a resurgent Russia.  Defense and security is one of the fields through which we can re-launch the European Union,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a news conferences. Failings in Europe's bombing campaign in Libya in 2011, when the United States had to step in with refueling planes, and Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea have reignited EU defense plans that date back to the 1950s but have remained elusive.  Britain had long blocked EU defense integration, fearing a European armed force wearing the same uniforms.  This is not about creating an EU army,  European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen told reporters.  NATO does not have a NATO army,  he said, stressing that Western military alliances are formed by national forces working together. Although the European Union has more than a dozen military missions abroad, the world's biggest trading bloc has never been able to match its economic might with broad defensive power, preferring to rely on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.     The EU is not seeking to compete with NATO, Mogherini said. But U.S. President Donald Trump's sharp criticism of European allies for low defense spending and his refusal to fully back the alliance publicly has added to concerns that without the United States and Britain, the European Union is vulnerable to a host of threats, from cyber to militant attacks. A year since proposals on an  European Defence Union  from Paris and Berlin, the European Commission said it was willing to provide money from the EU's common budget for the first time for defense research. The Commission said it would also create a fund to reverse billions of euros in defense cuts to let governments club together to develop and buy new helicopters and planes to lower costs, also opening the door to new drones, cyber warfare systems and other hi-tech gear. 5.5 Bln Euro Fund? While the amounts of money depend on EU governments' willingness to collaborate, the Commission said it would put forward at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) a year from the bloc's budget for the research and purchase of assets. That could generate some 5.5 billion euros a year after 2020 for research and development if enough governments come forward with funds, EU officials said, stressing that national governments would remain the owners of all equipment. German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the plan.  It is ambitious and shows how far we have gone over the last 12 months in establishing a defense and security union,  she said in a statement, calling for more such steps. Defense research spending in the EU has fallen by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006, and while the European Union spends about half as much as the United States on researching and producing weapons, it only has about 15 percent of the assets that Washington can deploy on the battlefield. EU governments champion national companies, often leading to duplication and wasted funds, according to EU data. In 80 percent of cases, governments award defense contracts to their own firms rather than use European consortiums. The European Union's defense fund idea, which still needs to be approved by governments and the European Parliament, is part of an emerging network of proposals that EU leaders are set to consider at a summit in Brussels on June 22-23. The European Union is setting up a military headquarters for training missions abroad. It wants to make it easier to use its EU battlegroups that have never been deployed, and plans to set up a system to better identify weaknesses in equipment.  Paris also wants to set up a system in which coalitions of willing EU countries come together to carry out and pay for military missions together, rather than leaving future peacekeeping operations to bigger countries such as France. The European Defence Agency, the agency that helps EU governments develop their military capabilities, has also proposed a smaller fund made up of EU states' public money, the so-called Cooperative Financial Mechanism, or CFM. That would aim to work on smaller, collaborative projects. ($1 = 0.8885 euros) Editing by Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-defence-idUSL8N1J41IQ"},

May unexpectedly called the snap vote seven weeks ago, seeking to increase her working parliamentary majority of 17 seats ahead of the start of negotiations on leaving the European Union. But the campaign has seen unexpected twists - a steep decline in May's once-commanding poll lead over the opposition Labour Party, and attacks in Manchester and London that killed 30 people. Pollsters still expect May's Conservatives to win, although talk of a landslide majority of more than 100 seats has faded. A final flurry of polls put her party's lead in a range between 1  and 12 percentage points, with most of them suggesting she would increase her majority. The polls started narrowing after May launched a new policy on care for the elderly that proved unpopular. She backtracked days later, prompting opposition parties to pour scorn on her claim to offer  strong and stable leadership . Then came a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester on May 22 that killed 22 children and adults, and a van and knife attack on London Bridge and in nearby Borough Market that killed eight people on June 3, five days before the election. The attacks threw the campaign spotlight onto security and prompted questions from May's opponents and media about her record overseeing cuts in police numbers during her years as interior minister from 2010 to 2016. But the security issue was not seen as helpful to her main rival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has voted against counter-terrorism legislation and expressed reservations in the past about police shoot-to-kill tactics. May vs Corbyn On Wednesday, the eve of the vote, May tried to bring the campaign back to Brexit. Related CoverageFactbox: UK internet crackdown effort fizzles in last days of election campaignPolls on eve of UK election suggest PM May will boost majority When it comes to the election tomorrow, I think the choices and the questions that people need to ask are exactly the same today as they were right at the beginning of the campaign,  she told a campaign rally in Norwich, eastern England.  And the first is a question of who do you trust to actually have the strong and stable leadership that is going to deliver the best deal for Britain in Europe.  May has sought to portray Corbyn as the weak leader of a spendthrift party which would crash Britain's $2.5 trillion economy and lead the country to ruin in chaotic Brexit negotiations. Corbyn, a veteran left-winger who unexpectedly won the Labour leadership in 2015 after three decades on the party fringe, has hit back that Conservative fiscal austerity has hurt the poor and increased social inequalities. Labour propose to build a fairer society through policies such as increasing tax for the richest 5 percent, boosting workers' rights, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds in infrastructure.  The choice is quite simple. Five more years of a Tory government, five more years of austerity, five more years of cuts. Or something different,  Corbyn told supporters in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, to cheers and applause. Workers in protective equipment are reflected in the window of a betting shop with a display inviting customers to place bets on tbe result of the general election with images of Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, in London, June 7, 2017.Marko DjuricaFor May, the challenge is not only to win but to surpass handsomely the 12-seat majority her Conservative predecessor David Cameron won in 2015. A narrow victory would undermine her authority both inside her party and at talks with the 27 other EU leaders. Up to five more opinion polls are expected before voting begins at 0600 GMT on Thursday. Britons have until 2100 GMT to vote, and there will be an exit poll as soon as voting ends. The first handful of seat results are expected to be announced by 2300 GMT, with the vast majority of the 650 constituencies due to announce results between 0200 GMT and 0500 GMT on Friday morning. Jitters Slideshow (25 Images)London police were still dealing with the fallout from Saturday night's attack, when three jihadis drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before running into narrow streets bustling with nightlife, stabbing and slashing people indiscriminately. They said they arrested three more people on Wednesday and searched two locations in connection with the attack. They have also made 25 arrests for hate crimes since Saturday and had stepped up their presence in communities to provide reassurance. With the capital still jittery, police carried out a controlled explosion near the site where a new U.S. embassy is  being built in southwest London because of two suspicious vehicles, but later said it had been a false alarm. Police confirmed on Wednesday the Saturday death toll had risen to eight after they found a body in the River Thames. They also made another arrest in east London in connection with the attack. The dead include people from France, Australia, Canada, Spain and Britain. The attack left 48 injured, of whom 29 were still in hospital on Wednesday. Health authorities said 10 were in a critical condition. Security has been increased nationwide and the violence has dominated the final weeks of campaigning. May responded to the attack with a pledge to crack down on Islamist extremism and strengthen police powers.  If human rights laws get in the way of doing these things, we will change those laws to make sure we can do them,  she said in an interview with the Sun. The head of campaign group Amnesty International said the pledge was outrageous and a gift to autocratic leaders around the world. Two of the three London Bridge attackers, who were all shot dead at the scene by police, had been known to authorities beforehand.  Italy said it had flagged Youssef Zaghba as a potential risk after he moved to England last year, while Khuram Butt was known to British security services.

Second baseman Brandon Phillips finished 2-for-4, recording his eighth multi-hit game in his past 16 starts.

He lasted a season-worst 2 2/3 innings in a 10-0 loss to the San Francisco Giants on June 2, giving up five runs (four earned) on six hits. Eickhoff held Atlanta to one run on two hits with seven strikeouts over five innings in a no-decision April 22. Foltynewicz continues asserting himself as a long-term part of Atlanta’s rotation. He pitched seven innings of two-hit shutout ball Friday in Cincinnati, striking out 10 in a game the Braves bullpen blew in extra innings. The 25-year-old has posted a 3.21 ERA while going 3-1 in his past five starts - giving up one earned run or fewer three times - and limited the Phillies to one run on four hits with nine strikeouts in a no-decision April 23. Walk-Offs 1. Philadelphia CF Odubel Herrera recorded his seventh double in the past four games Tuesday, giving him nine RBIs in that span. 2. Phillies RHP Aaron Nola was the first Philadelphia starter this season to go more than seven innings, giving up one run on five hits with six strikeouts in eight frames Tuesday. 3.

The Rangers will try to take advantage of the slumping Mets again and earn a sweep of the two-game interleague set when they host the finale on Wednesday. Texas entered the series with losses in four straight and 10 of its last 12 but had little trouble solving New York ace Jacob deGrom while bashing its way to a 10-8 win in Tuesday's opener. The Rangers got at least one hit from each member of the starting lineup as part of the 16-hit attack, including four from right fielder Nomar Mazara, who went 1-for-9 with four strikeouts over the weekend against the Astros. Trying to slow that offense on Friday will be right-hander Zack Wheeler while the Mets tackle Texas ace Yu Darvish. New York could use a little length out of Wheeler after watching deGrom get bounced after four innings Tuesday as the Mets' staff allowed double-digit runs for the third time in the last four contests.

The 27-year-old is coming back from Tommy John surgery but seems to have passed all restrictions on pitch counts after tossing over 100 pitches against the Brewers. Wheeler is 1-0 with a 3.22 ERA in four starts on the road this season, including a win at the Los Angeles Angels in his lone interleague start. Darvish is trying to snap a two-start losing streak and lasted only five innings against Houston on Friday, yielding three runs on seven hits and a walk. The Japan native struck out eight in those five frames and owns 80 in 74 2/3 innings. Darvish did not factor in the decision in his lone previous start against the Mets and is 8-2 with a 2.19 ERA in 14 career interleague outings. Walk-Offs 1.

Houston failed to match the club mark of 12 straight victories when a bullpen meltdown on Tuesday allowed Kansas City to score six times over the final two innings en route to a 9-7 victory. Keuchel has won 11 consecutive decisions dating back to last season and is vying to match the franchise mark shared by Mark Portugal (1993) and Wade Miller (2002). Kansas City's Mike Moustakas belted a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning to cap a strong effort in which he went 4-for-5 with three RBIs.

The 29-year-old, who is the first Astros pitcher to start 9-0 since Roger Clemens in 2004, hasn't served up a homer in his last four starts while striking out 28 in 23 innings. Keuchel is 3-1 with a 3.32 ERA in six career starts against the Royals - including a win on April 8 in which he gave up one run and two hits over seven frames - and has shut down Salvador Perez (2-for-18) and Alex Gordon (1-for-10). Vargas is second in the majors in ERA in a strong bounce-back season now that he is fully recovered from the Tommy John surgery he underwent in the summer of 2015. The 34-year-old tossed his seventh career shutout in his last turn, when he gave up seven hits against Cleveland. Vargas beat the Astros on April 7 as he allowed one run and six hits over six innings to improve to 1-2 with a 6.84 ERA in five career starts and has struggled with Carlos Beltran (6-for-12, one homer) and Jose Altuve (5-for-12, one homer).

The White Sox aim to answer a disastrous five-game losing skid with their second straight win on Wednesday when they visit the reeling Rays, who have been outscored 32-9 during their four-game slide. Chicago was blitzed to the tune of 49-18 during its skid before Todd Frazier homered for the second straight contest and fourth in his last eight in Tuesday's 4-2 triumph over Tampa Bay. Yolmer Sanchez and Avisail Garcia also went deep to highlight their two-hit performances, with the former going 6-for-13 with three runs scored during his four-game hitting streak while the latter is also 6-for-13 in his last three contests. Tampa Bay's Kevin Kiermaier recorded his third three-hit performance in the last eight games to account for half of his team's total on Tuesday, although the two-time Gold Glove recipient had issues reading Sanchez's fly ball in the first inning.

Pelfrey owns an 0-1 career mark with a 4.43 ERA in four starts versus Tampa Bay and has permitted the Rays to bat .304 against him. Faria, who was recalled from Triple-A Durham on Tuesday, was understandably excited when asked about his feelings ahead of his major-league debut.  It's the one thing I've been working for since I was 6. I don't think there's anything right now that trumps this moment for me,  said the 23-year-old Faria, who posted a 6-1 mark with a 3.07 ERA in 11 starts with the Bulls.

After hitting just .158 in all of May, Calhoun continued his torrid stretch with his fourth homer in five games this month in Tuesday's 5-3 victory in the series opener. Calhoun is 11-for-23 with seven RBIs and six runs scored during his hitting streak for the Angels, who have won nine of their last 13 at Comerica Park. The home tenants of that park saw their red-hot bats cooled after erupting for 38 runs during their previous four contests and will look to exact a bit of revenge for last month's loss against Wednesday starter Alex Meyer.

The 27-year-old pitched well in his last outing on Thursday, yielding just a solo homer among his five hits over six innings in a no-decision versus Minnesota. Both of those outings were at home, where he has permitted four runs and 10 hits in three outings as opposed to 13 and 15, respectively, in three trips to the mound on the road this year. Detroit is expected to recall Farmer from Triple-A Toledo to fill Matt Boyd's spot in the rotation while also giving second-year starter Michael Fulmer an additional day of rest. The 26-year-old certainly fared well in his previous outing with the Tigers, notching his first major-league win on May 27 after scattering three hits and striking out 11 over 6 1/3 scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox.

TV: 9 p.m. ET, ABC ABOUT THE WARRIORS: Golden State has rolled to 14 consecutive postseason victories and seems even harder to beat with small forward Kevin Durant playing superbly and averaging 35.5 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the series.  I'm not going to take a step back,  Durant told reporters of his team's 2-0 lead.  We know this is far from over. We know how hard it is to be the best team in the league.  Point guard Stephen Curry is averaging 30 points 10.5 assists and eight rebounds in the series and shooting guard Klay Thompson displayed signs of breaking out of a postseason slump by scoring 22 points on 8-of-12 shooting in Game 2. ABOUT THE CAVALIERS: Cleveland collapsed in the third quarter of each of the first two games as it wilted under Golden State's offensive firepower. Both coach Tyronn Lue and star forward LeBron James insist the Cavaliers won't try to slow down play and will stick with the style they prefer.  That's not our game. We don't play slowdown basketball,  James told reporters.  We play at our pace. We play our game. We got to this point playing our way. We have won a lot of games playing the way we play, so we're not going to change.  Buzzer Beaters 1. James recorded 29 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds in Game 2 for his eighth career postseason triple-double, tying for first all-time with legendary Magic Johnson. 2. Curry drained all 14 free-throw attempts in Game 2 after not attempting a single one in the opener. 3. Cleveland SG J.R. Smith has just three points on 1-of-6 shooting in the series but coach Tyronn Lue said on Tuesday that Smith will again start in Game 3.

Chicago made it five straight overall and eight in a row at home with a 10-2 rout of the Marlins on Tuesday, as Anthony Rizzo hit a three-run blast and Jason Heyward had three hits and two RBIs. The Cubs’ offense has come to life during the homestand after totaling just nine runs during an 0-6 West Coast road trip, but the pitching has been dominant, too. Chicago has allowed six hits or fewer in six straight games and has iced a Marlins' lineup that entered the series averaging six runs and 10 hits while winning seven of its previous eight contests.

Reserves rose $24 billion in May to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion, compared with an increase of $21 billion in April, central bank data showed on Wednesday. It was the first time since June 2014 that reserves climbed for four months in a row, and the biggest gain since reserves moved back above the closely watched $3 trillion level in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise  $10 billion. A weaker U.S. dollar boosted the value of other currencies and assets held by China in May, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement explaining the rise. Foreign exchange supply and demand was basically balanced in the month, it added. In May, the dollar recorded its largest monthly percentage loss against a basket of major currencies .DXY since January. Tighter restrictions on taking funds out of the country imposed in recent months continue to keep a lid on capital outflows, said Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based analyst at Commerzbank.  From their perspective, they have done a very successful job.  Apart from valuation effects, Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard said China's central bank may also have been purchasing small quantities of foreign currencies again in May after having sold forex to shore up the sagging yuan for 18 straight months.  This a major shift in policy that has been achieved thanks to an easing of capital outflows,  he said.  Given our forecast for China’s May trade balance (due out on Thursday), today’s figures still point to capital outflows of around $10 billion last month. But this is down from $30 billion in April and $65 billion at the end of last year.      Turning the Tide? In April, net foreign exchange sales by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) fell to the lowest in nearly two years as capital outflows eased in the face of strict regulatory curbs and a pause in the dollar's rally. The forex regulator said last month that China's current cross-border capital flows are stabilizing, but debt risks and signs of slowing economic growth have forced policymakers to keep a tight leash on outflows.  China burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves last year but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. After steadying early this year, the yuan CNY=CFXS suddenly bolted to near seven-month highs in recent weeks after the central bank changed the way it calculates its official daily reference point to quash expectations of further depreciation and outflows as the U.S. raises interest rates. The uncharacteristically rapid appreciation engineered by Chinese authorities were also seen as a show of strength and a warning to speculators after the country's credit rating was downgraded by Moody's on May 24. The moves have prompted some investment banks to scale back views of yuan weakness this year, with some now saying it could end 2017 relatively unchanged.  In further evidence that Beijing remains concerned about a resurgence of outflows, the foreign exchange regulator announced last Friday that Chinese banks would be required to report daily on bank card holders' overseas transactions exceeding 1,000 yuan  ($147). To be sure, veteran China watchers have cautioned that Chinese companies and individuals would find ways around the capital controls eventually.     Indeed, French investment bank Natixis said in a report that its capital flow tracker for China showed outflows for the second quarter will rise somewhat, reversing the trend in the first quarter. But while moves to stabilize the yuan may have reassured China's financial markets, they have come at a price. Persistent depreciation fears along with China's tighter capital controls and currency interventions have dealt a setback to Beijing's ambitions to make the yuan a global currency. On Wednesday, a central bank advisor said China should urgently reform its foreign exchange rate system or risk impeding the economy and plans for the yuan to play a larger role on the global stage. Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told a forum in Beijing that an inflexible foreign exchange rate would limit the opening of the economy and yuan internationalization. The yuan has slipped to the seventh-most actively traded currency for global trade finance, transaction service provider SWIFT said. Some Western firms have also been concerned about their ability to remit profits and dividends from China.     The value of gold reserves fell to $75.004 billion at the end of May, from $75.019 billion at end-April, data published on the People's Bank of China website also showed.

Swiss-based Kempinski Hotels SA will inaugurate its Gran Hotel Manzana in the heart of the capital on Wednesday, billing it as Cuba's first true luxury hotel.  The five-star property, managed by Kempinski but owned by the Cuban government, occupies the top floors of a renovated Belle Epoque shopping mall filled with glitzy Gucci and Montblanc stores. Farther down the iconic Paseo de Prado boulevard toward the Caribbean Sea, workers are developing two other sites into luxury hotels to be operated respectively by Spain's Iberostar and France's Accor SA ACCP.SA, the largest hotel group in Europe.  Tourism is the one bright spot in Cuba's moribund economy, which is struggling with falling exports and upheaval in major trade partner Venezuela.  Cuban Tourism minister Manuel Marrero said in May that more than 4.2 million tourists were expected this year, up from 4 million in 2016. He said the country was adding 2,000 hotel rooms a year to its stock of 65,000 hotel rooms and 21,000 homes renting to tourists. Visits by Americans have soared since U.S.-operated cruises and scheduled flights were relaunched last year as part of the detente pursued by former President Barack Obama after a half-century hiatus. However, his successor Trump is considering tightening those rules when he announces his Cuba policy as soon as this month, according to current and former U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions. That would likely hurt tourism, at least in the short run, and might slow the pace of hotel construction.    We hope that trade and travel restrictions eased by the Obama administration will not be tightened again by the current U.S. government,  said Alessandro Benedetti, a marketing director at Kempinski.   That would not be favorable for any kind of businesses connected to tourism, such as cruise ship operators, airlines or hotel chains.  The Cuban government has courted foreign hotel operators to develop untapped markets, particularly in high-end tourism. With its gleaming white stone facade and French bay windows, the Gran Hotel Manzana features a rooftop infinity pool overlooking Havana's central park, as well as a spa with steamroom and sauna. There is also a cigar lounge with a tobacco sommelier. Industry experts say Cuba, which offers a plethora of low- and mid-range accommodation, is right to bet on luxury, although it will be a challenge for operators to maintain standards in a tightly controlled Soviet-style economy.  We have travel agencies contact us saying they had never worked with Cuba because it didn't offer anything up to their standards,  said Benedetti.  But now that's changed,  he said, citing strong interest from U.S. tourists seeking more luxurious destinations. Cubans Have Mixed Feelings It remains unclear how far Trump will go in rolling back Obama’s changes. Any reinstatement of U.S. restrictions on Cuba travel would face criticism from American travel companies as well as a growing number of U.S. lawmakers.  Cuba's Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero attends the official inauguration of the Gran Hotel Manzana, owned by the Cuban government and managed by Swiss-based Kempinski Hotels SA, in Havana, Cuba June 7, 2017.StringerThe number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year, but Americans are still not officially allowed to visit as tourists. Because their trips must fit certain categories, like educational travel, most descend on Havana rather than the coastal resorts. While Cuba has been building resorts around the island, it has redoubled its focus on the capital, where hotels are fully booked year-round and demand is growing.  With this increase, it would be appropriate to have products of high standard,  said Francisco Camps, Cuba deputy general manager for Spain's Meliá Hotels International S.A. (MEL.MC), which wants to introduce its two main luxury brands. Despite assurances tourism revenues will benefit all Cubans, the move has stirred mixed feelings in a country that prides itself on social equality.  The hotels are very pretty, but they are too expensive for Cubans,  said retiree Antonio Cazamayor, who lives on a monthly pension of $10. Rooms at the Gran Hotel Manzana will range from $360 for a low-season double to $5,000 for the 150-square-meter (1,600-square-foot) presidential suite. Slideshow (19 Images)Cazamayor's home in the densely populated back streets of central Havana is just a few blocks from the hotels but feels like a different world. His building appears derelict from the outside, with the ground-floor windows boarded up, but inside it teems with families packed into tiny units. Many neighborhood buildings, which date to the 1920s and 1930s, are missing walls or balconies. Collapses are common. An apartment block in front of Cazamayor's was recently evacuated after its stairwell caved in.  If that one collapsed, and this one is falling apart, why don't they build homes?  Cazamayor asked.  Hobbled by an inefficient, centrally planned economy and a U.S. economic embargo, Cuba has struggled to maintain its infrastructure in a punishing tropical climate. Since the country opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, Havana reinvested much of its revenue in renovating historic buildings, from Art Deco hotels to colonial palaces.   They have returned the sparkle to part of Old Havana,  said Abraham Rodriguez, 45. He attended a school in the building that now houses the Gran Hotel Manzana and recalls how the classrooms flooded when it rained. But much of the rest of the city is still falling into ruin. Cubans working in the private sector as restaurateurs, taxi drivers and tour guides say the arrival of Kempinski and its rivals spells good business for them. Yet the benefits for the more than two-thirds of the government employees are less obvious. Josefa Cespedes, 73, has been living for a quarter-century in a building that houses a unit of the Communist Party charged with keeping tabs on the neighborhood because her home collapsed.  The poor have to wait for the state to help,  she said. Reporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cuba-tourism-idUSL8N1IX5UI"},

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, therapies extract immune system T-cells from an individual patient, alter their DNA to better spot and kill cancer cells, and infuse them back into the same patient. Investors had been closely watching the fortunes of CAR-T developers, including Kite Pharma Inc and Bluebird Bio Inc. This week, the therapies took center stage at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, with new results on their use for multiple myeloma patients. The science  is quite revolutionary,  said Dr. Michael Sabel, chief of surgical oncology at University of Michigan Health Systems, who is not involved in the trials.  We have struggled for years with the idea of getting T-cells to actually recognize the cancer cell and form that bond, that latch, that allows it to be an effective killing cell,  he said.  We are now seeing that advance.  CAR-T therapies are expected to reach the U.S. market for the first time this year. U.S. regulators are reviewing treatments from Kite and Novartis AG which target a protein called CD19 found in lymphoma and leukemia, achieving remission in more than 80 percent of patients with advanced-stage disease.  CAR-Ts can also pose serious risks, including a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition, though researchers said at ASCO they have become more confident in managing though side effects.  What used to be a sideshow has moved on to the main stage,  said Nick Leschly, chief executive officer at Bluebird Bio. The company, which is developing a therapy with Celgene Corp, gave an update on its clinical trial of multiple myeloma patients who had exhausted other options. All 15 patients evaluated so far have responded to the treatment, and 27 percent had a complete remission, Bluebird said. Shares of Bluebird are up 17 percent so far this week. BMO Capital Markets estimated sales of the therapy, bb2121, could reach $3.6 billion annually. A relatively unknown company, Nanjing Legend Biotech, also surprised ASCO participants with a small CAR-T trial in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. All 35 patients enrolled so far have responded to the treatment. Of the 19 patients followed for more than four months, 14 saw complete remission.     Most trial patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition, but researchers said the side effect was temporary and manageable in most patients.      Dr. Frank Fan, chief scientific officer at Nanjing Legend Biotech, a unit of Genscript Biotech Corp, said the company plans to enroll a total of 100 patients in the Chinese trial and to start a similar U.S. trial in early 2018. Juno Therapeutics Inc scrapped its initial CAR-T candidate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after five patient deaths. The company said at ASCO that early trial results for a different CAR-T found that 66 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients responded to the drug, and 18 percent suffered severe neurological side effects. One patient died, although the company said the death was not attributed to the CAR-T treatment.     Data from Kite showed remission in 73 percent of 11 patients with relapsed ALL who took its CAR-T treatment axi-cel. It plans to launch a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter, possibly at a lower dose. Globally, there are more than 183 clinical CAR-T trials underway, said Dr. Carl June, professor in immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, and one of the first researchers in the CAR-T field. ASCO awarded June the David A. Karnofsky Memorial Award, its highest scientific prize, this week.      This takes immuno-oncology to another level,  June told a packed lecture hall on Sunday.

Reserves rose $24 billion in May to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion, compared with an increase of $21 billion in April, central bank data showed on Wednesday. It was the first time since June 2014 that reserves climbed for four months in a row, and the biggest gain since reserves moved back above the closely watched $3 trillion level in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise  $10 billion. A weaker U.S. dollar boosted the value of other currencies and assets held by China in May, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement explaining the rise. Foreign exchange supply and demand was basically balanced in the month, it added. In May, the dollar recorded its largest monthly percentage loss against a basket of major currencies .DXY since January. Tighter restrictions on taking funds out of the country imposed in recent months continue to keep a lid on capital outflows, said Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based analyst at Commerzbank.  From their perspective, they have done a very successful job.  Apart from valuation effects, Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard said China's central bank may also have been purchasing small quantities of foreign currencies again in May after having sold forex to shore up the sagging yuan for 18 straight months.  This a major shift in policy that has been achieved thanks to an easing of capital outflows,  he said.  Given our forecast for China’s May trade balance (due out on Thursday), today’s figures still point to capital outflows of around $10 billion last month. But this is down from $30 billion in April and $65 billion at the end of last year.      Turning the Tide? In April, net foreign exchange sales by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) fell to the lowest in nearly two years as capital outflows eased in the face of strict regulatory curbs and a pause in the dollar's rally. The forex regulator said last month that China's current cross-border capital flows are stabilizing, but debt risks and signs of slowing economic growth have forced policymakers to keep a tight leash on outflows.  China burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves last year but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. After steadying early this year, the yuan CNY=CFXS suddenly bolted to near seven-month highs in recent weeks after the central bank changed the way it calculates its official daily reference point to quash expectations of further depreciation and outflows as the U.S. raises interest rates. The uncharacteristically rapid appreciation engineered by Chinese authorities were also seen as a show of strength and a warning to speculators after the country's credit rating was downgraded by Moody's on May 24. The moves have prompted some investment banks to scale back views of yuan weakness this year, with some now saying it could end 2017 relatively unchanged.  In further evidence that Beijing remains concerned about a resurgence of outflows, the foreign exchange regulator announced last Friday that Chinese banks would be required to report daily on bank card holders' overseas transactions exceeding 1,000 yuan  ($147). To be sure, veteran China watchers have cautioned that Chinese companies and individuals would find ways around the capital controls eventually.     Indeed, French investment bank Natixis said in a report that its capital flow tracker for China showed outflows for the second quarter will rise somewhat, reversing the trend in the first quarter. But while moves to stabilize the yuan may have reassured China's financial markets, they have come at a price. Persistent depreciation fears along with China's tighter capital controls and currency interventions have dealt a setback to Beijing's ambitions to make the yuan a global currency. On Wednesday, a central bank advisor said China should urgently reform its foreign exchange rate system or risk impeding the economy and plans for the yuan to play a larger role on the global stage. Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told a forum in Beijing that an inflexible foreign exchange rate would limit the opening of the economy and yuan internationalization. The yuan has slipped to the seventh-most actively traded currency for global trade finance, transaction service provider SWIFT said. Some Western firms have also been concerned about their ability to remit profits and dividends from China.     The value of gold reserves fell to $75.004 billion at the end of May, from $75.019 billion at end-April, data published on the People's Bank of China website also showed.

Amman is a unit of oil and gas company Medco Energi Internasional, which bought the Batu Hijau copper mine in West Nusa Tenggara from Newmont Mining Corp last year.  We are reviewing our manpower so we can be more efficient going forward,  said Rachmat Makkasau, chief executive of Amman. Fellow copper miner, Freeport-McMoran's Indonesian unit, has already laid off some workers due to a contract dispute with the Indonesian government and a prolonged strike at its giant Grasberg mine. Bambang Gatot, Indonesia's director general of coal and minerals at the mining ministry, said that Amman has informed the government of its plan to offer voluntary resignation to 500-700 employees while production is low. Production has fallen in the Batu Hijau mine due to a delay in development in the mine, Gatot said. According to Medco, the mine produced 240 million pounds of copper and 0.3 million ounces of gold in 2015. Gatot said when Amman's smelter project is completed, the miner would hire more workers. Petrus Mahdi, secretary general of Amman's labour union, confirmed that the company has offered benefits for employees who volunteered to leave. Mahdi said the offer would last until the end of July.  If (the firm) starts to force people to quit, then we will stand up for them,  he said. The union said Amman currently employs around 3,500 people. Gatot said in March that Amman has committed to invest $9.2 billion to expand its business, including the construction of a new copper smelter near its mine. Makkasau said the company is currently conducting a study for a smelter with the capacity to process 2 million tonnes of copper concentrate. He denied media reports that Amman is in talks with Freeport Indonesia to jointly build a smelter, although saying the firm is open to possibility of partnering with anyone. Freeport, the world's largest publicly traded copper miner, started laying off workers in February amid an escalation of a mining contract dispute with the government. In late May, it said approximately 4,000 striking workers at Grasberg mine have been deemed to have resigned due to failure to report for work.

Government data out on Wednesday data showed gross domestic product (GDP) rose a pedestrian 0.3 percent in the first quarter, a pullback from the previous quarter's rapid 1.1 percent.  Yet that growth allayed fears of an outright contraction and helped lift the local dollar AUD=D4 a third of a U.S. cent to a one-month high of $0.7542.   The Australian economy has had to contend with a lot of factors in the past year – geopolitics, weather events, the on-going unwinding of the mining construction boom and variable housing markets,  said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec.  Economic growth has trekked a zig-zag path but the bottom line is that the doomsayers will need to find another target.  Wednesday's result should be a relief for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which just the day before conceded the March quarter would likely disappoint. But the central bank expressed confidence growth would pick up over the next couple of years to above 3 percent, and held interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent where they have been since last August. So far, investors seem almost convinced the RBA is done with its five-year easing campaign. The futures market <0#YIB:> implies a 16 percent chance of another rate cut by December. Australia has not seen a recession since 1991 and growth  regularly outpaced its peers in recent years. But that changed in the March quarter when annual growth braked to 1.7 percent, below the 2 percent achieved by the United States and Britain.  Members of the public wait at a bus stop as an illuminated financial advertisement adorns the bus shelter in central Sydney, Australia April 28, 2017.  Picture taken April 28, 2017.Steven SaphoreData from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed output for the 12 months to March amounted to A$1.72 trillion ($1.28 trillion) in current dollars, or about A$71,000 for each of the country's 24 million people. Save Less or Spend Less Treasurer Scott Morrison blamed bad weather for much of the slowdown and argued things could only get better as the year progressed. Morrison launched his annual budget just a month ago and already its economic projections are looking ambitious. Slideshow (4 Images)Many economists suspect the current quarter will be marred by the giant cyclone that barreled through Queensland in late March and caused weeks of disruption to coal exports. Perhaps the most worrying risk to growth is subdued consumer spending as Australians are burdened by record-low wage growth and high levels of mortgage debt. The share of GDP contributed by wages is at its lowest since September 1964.  Household consumption grew at just 2.3 percent in the year to March, half the pace that was considered normal a decade ago. Household debt is a dangerously high 189 percent of disposable income and well above much of the rich world. To maintain their spending habits Australians are having to save less. The savings ratio dropped to 4.7 percent in the march quarter, a fall of two full percentage points in just a year and the lowest since late 2008.  A lot of the rise in consumption was because households further reduced their saving rate to a 10-year low,  said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics.  They can't do that indefinitely, so we suspect that slow income growth will soon result in more modest consumption growth. As such, we believe signs of a more sustained slowing in GDP growth are emerging.

Cebu Air, also known as Cebu Pacific, said in a statement on Wednesday the seven A321CEO aircraft are for delivery from March 2018. The A321NEO aircraft will now be delivered between the fourth quarter of 2018 until 2022, compared to the earlier plan of deliveries beginning September 2017 until 2021, it said. Cebu Air said it has decided to defer the A321NEO deliveries due to delays with the Pratt & Whitney engines selected to power the aircraft.  We have decided to take a conservative approach to the introduction of the A321NEO into our operations,  Cebu Air Chief Finance Officer Andrew Huang said in the statement.  We remain confident that Pratt & Whitney will address all issues on the GTF (Geared Turbo Fan) engine.  Pratt & Whitney, the aircraft-engine unit of United Technologies Corp, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The $812 million value of the latest order is based on list prices. Aircraft manufacturers typically give discounts to list prices. Airlines in Southeast Asia, including AirAsia and Vietjet Aviation JSC, have placed large aircraft orders in recent years, driven by the potential of rapid growth in the region. Airbus COO John Leahy was quoted in the Cebu Air statement as saying that the airline will be able to respond to growing demand with the A321 purchases. Cebu Air and its main rival Philippine Airlines are busy expanding their fleets, especially given favorable conditions in the domestic market amid the growth momentum for the local economy. Cebu Air recently took delivery of two brand-new planes, an Airbus A330 and an ATR 72-600, bringing its fleet to 61. Its fleet now comprises four Airbus A319, 36 Airbus A320, eight Airbus A330, eight ATR 72-500, and five ATR 72-600 aircraft. The carrier flies to 37 domestic and 26 international destinations, operating over 100 routes spanning across Asia, Australia, the Middle East and the United States.

Turkey has good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Qatar has for years parlayed its enormous gas wealth and media strength into broad influence in the region.

Bayer, which is buying U.S. seeds giant Monsanto (MON.N), has also issued 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in bonds that it can pay back with up to 6.1 percent of Covestro's shares and in addition it will transfer another 4 percent stake in Covestro into Bayer's pension trust. The three measures combined could eventually see drugmaker Bayer's stake in Covestro decline to 34.7 percent but it will be up to Bayer whether to settle the bonds in cash, Covestro shares or a combination of the two when the contract expires in 2020.  Bayer, which floated Covestro in 2015, reaffirmed plans to sell all of its shares in the medium term. While Bayer has stressed that the sale of assets, Covestro in particular, would not be a necessary part of funding the $66 billion Monsanto deal, analysts said the proceeds will come at an opportune time. Selling shares serves  to strengthen the balance sheet  ahead of an expected capital increase, said DZ Bank analyst Peter Spengler.      As an initial step on the way to raising $19 billion worth of equity capital for the Monsanto deal - the biggest ever to be paid for in cash - Bayer placed 4 billion euros in mandatory convertible notes in November with a rights issue expected later this year.

The price of Covestro shares at which Bayer can pay back the exchangeable bond in 2020 is initially set at 80.93 euros but it may change depending on Covestro's dividend payments. The 8.5 percent stake was sold via an accelerated bookbuilding procedure for 62.25 euros apiece, generating just over 1 billion euros in gross proceeds as targeted.

The sales momentum supports analysts' view that Sony is in a good position to build an early lead in the high-end VR headset race with its more modest price tag and by tapping the nearly 60 million users of its flagship PlayStation 4 console. The headset, designed to work with the PlayStation 4 rather than requiring new equipment, retails at $399, cheaper than Facebook Inc's $599 Oculus Rift and HTC Corp's $799 Vive. According to researcher IDC, about 2 million VR headsets were shipped worldwide in the first three months of 2017. Excluding cheaper smartphone-based headsets, Sony ranked top with 429,000 units. Morita stressed it was still the beginning of Sony's long-term vision of VR eventually taking over functions offered by television sets.  I believe that VR technology is the (greatest) innovation since the birth of television,  he said.  VR allows you to travel to World Heritage sites or to space while staying at home.

But one thing he does not want is foreign troops returning to front-line combat in Afghanistan.   We know our own country better and we can defeat our enemies ourselves,  he says.   NATO can help Afghan forces with training, they can provide more equipment but we will recruit Afghans.  As U.S. and NATO officials contemplate the way forward in Afghanistan, government soldiers face a resilient enemy and an array of problems from lack of equipment, poor leadership, political interference and chronic corruption. While high-profile attacks in the capital Kabul, such as the truck bomb that killed more than 80 people last week, grab headlines, a grinding conflict in the provinces is costing the lives of hundreds of soldiers and police a month. A soldier since his teenage years with the anti-Soviet mujahideen in the 1980s, Sangin has been leading his brigade in a clearing operation to drive insurgent fighters out of Chaparhar, a district of mud-walled compounds dotted with poppy fields ready for harvest. The occasional rattle of machine gun fire can be heard from the fighting a couple of kilometers away but he says the operation has gone well, with the district center now clear at the cost of only a handful of casualties. However, experience has shown that there is no certainty of holding on to the gains.  We launch operations, we carry out searches and push the insurgents to the mountains. Later, I have to take my forces to other places for operations and as soon as we leave the area the insurgents return,  he said. U.S. officials are preparing plans that have been expected to see some 3,000-5,000 more military trainers sent to Afghanistan and fears have grown that this could be a prelude to the United States being sucked back into the war. Overstretch Sixteen years after the U.S.-led campaign that ousted the Taliban, more than 13,000 foreign troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a peak of more than 100,000, but NATO officials have said repeatedly they will not resume the combat mission they ended in 2014. However, officials say plans are being considered which would see more trainers at times move out of Corps headquarters down to brigade-level operations such as the one being carried out by Sangin's men in Chaparhar, increasing the likelihood of their being drawn into fighting. Despite assurances from foreign and Afghan officials about progress in improving leadership and tackling corruption, security forces have struggled to contain the insurgency and now control no more than 60 percent of the country. Most of the issues the troops talk about - lack of reinforcements and equipment, endless tours of duty - are well known despite promises of improvement. Afghan National Army (ANA) keep watch at a check post in Chaparhar district of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan May 24, 2017. Picture taken on May 24, 2017.ParwizAt the same time, security forces have suffered what the U.S. Congressional watchdog SIGAR described as  shockingly high  casualties. Official figures are patchy but at least 807 soldiers and police were killed in the first six weeks of the year after 6,785 in the first 10 months of 2016. Privately, many officials say the real numbers are even higher. The heavy casualties have also contributed to the other persistent problem facing the army, maintaining the strength of the units doing the fighting. A third of the security forces' personnel does not re-enlist every year and the actual number of troops available for duty is far below official totals, leaving front-line troops increasingly stretched.   It was very dangerous and busy last year but this year, it's been busier,  said Assadullah, a sergeant who, like many Afghans, goes by one name.  We were in Achin and when that operation we were in Torkham and now we're in Chaparhar without any break.   I haven't been home in seven months. I go from one position to another. We're tired but there's no alternative.  Questions Slideshow (2 Images)Even in Nangarhar, where Islamic State has established a foothold but is otherwise a relatively stable province, the army is conducting active operations in nine districts, compared with just three last year, officers said. In other parts of the country, like the opium-rich Taliban heartlands of Helmand and Kandahar in the south and Badakhshan and Kunduz in the north, the situation is much worse. Although General Sangin and his commanders say morale is good among their men, several of whom have the red, black and green of the Afghan flag strapped jauntily around their magazine clips, it does not take much effort to hear other points of view. As well as high casualties and the relentless tempo of operations, morale is sapped by political corruption that  persists despite President Ashraf Ghani's efforts to stamp it out, leading some soldiers to ask what they are fighting for. In Chaparhar, where the poppy fields reach into the district center, powerful interests follow operations closely.   We are not fighting for the nation, we are fighting for a mafia,  said one officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  We'll arrest some insurgents during an operation and soon we get a call from powerful figures inside government to let them go.   We are soldiers and we have to obey orders. But the next day, when we go to another operation, our soldiers do not fight the way they were fighting previously. They believe that this is a fight for no reason,  the officer said. It is hard to know how widespread such feelings are but soldiers have continued to fight and die in numbers that underline the resilience of the troops, however battered their morale. Despite the setbacks, they have held up. Sangin, a stocky, confident figure with thick black eyebrows and a salt and pepper beard says that after more than three decades, warfare has become a way of life.  I've always been at war. All the time. It hasn't been comfortable.  Reporting by James Mackenzie; Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-army-idUSKBN18W0SJ"},

Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria jumped off his bike to help a woman who was being stabbed in the rampage, fighting off her attacker with a skateboard, his family told Spanish media. However, he was set upon by two other men and was last seen slumped on the pavement, the family said, citing friends who were with him at the time. Echeverria's family has travelled to London to assist in any identification. The 39-year-old is from Madrid but lived in London, where he worked for HSBC. Police received his fingerprints on Sunday but they were not enough to make an identification and they have asked for DNA tests, which could delay the process further, El Pais newspaper reported.  The amount of time Britain is taking to identify people seems strange to me,  Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said in an interview with Radio Nacional on Wednesday, echoing similar remarks made by the foreign minister on Tuesday.  Ignacio Echeverria's family is showing exemplary behaviour and is going through an inhuman and desperate situation,  he added. London police said specialist officers were working with the families of victims to identify those who were killed and liaison officers had been sent out to families of people believed to be dead. They have so far officially identified two victims. The death toll stands at seven, with dozens wounded. Police said there were a number of reasons why an identification could take longer in some circumstances and that families would be notified as soon as possible.  We work in liaison with the coroner, that's how the system works. When the coroner is content and we are content with the ID we have got we will issue that publicly,  a police spokesman said. In a Facebook post on Tuesday night, his brother Joaquin Echeverria wrote:  Still no news from Ignacio Echeverria. The UK authorities ask us for 24 or 48 more hours to give us information.  The French government announced and named on Wednesday a second French victim who was killed on Saturday night and is waiting for confirmation on a third man who may have been knocked off London Bridge during the attacks. The Australian foreign affairs department on Wednesday confirmed two Australians died in the attack, but did not name them. The families named the victims as Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kristy Boden, 28. Both were listed as missing for days and they were not identified until after their parents flew to London and met directly with police.

The prediction came in a 97-page annual report to Congress that saw advances throughout the Chinese military in 2016, funded by robust defense spending that the Pentagon estimated exceeded $180 billion. That is higher than China's official defense budget figure of 954.35 billion yuan ($140.4 billion). Chinese leaders, the U.S. report said, appeared committed to defense spending hikes for the  foreseeable future,  even as economic growth slows. The report repeatedly cited China's construction of its first overseas naval base in Djibouti, which is already home to a key U.S. military base and is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.   China most likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan,  the report said. Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fueled worries in India that it would become another of China's 'string of pearls' of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The report did not address India's potential reaction to a Chinese base in Pakistan. But Pakistan, the U.S. report noted, was already the primary market in the Asian-Pacific region for Chinese arms exports. That region accounted for $9 billion of the more than $20 billion in Chinese arms exports from 2011 to 2015. Last year, China signed an agreement with Pakistan for the sale of eight submarines. China's Defence Ministry expressed its  resolute opposition  to the contents of the report, saying it hyped up the China threat theory. China follows the path of peaceful development and its defense expenditures are  open and transparent , it said in a statement.  The criticism in the U.S. report is pure conjecture,  it added.  We hope the U.S. side can rationally and objectively view China's national defense and military building.  At a daily news briefing earlier, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the comment on Pakistani bases as  conjecture  and declined a specific response.

The prediction came in a 97-page annual report to Congress that saw advances throughout the Chinese military in 2016, funded by robust defense spending that the Pentagon estimated exceeded $180 billion. That is higher than China's official defense budget figure of 954.35 billion yuan ($140.4 billion). Chinese leaders, the U.S. report said, appeared committed to defense spending hikes for the  foreseeable future,  even as economic growth slows. The report repeatedly cited China's construction of its first overseas naval base in Djibouti, which is already home to a key U.S. military base and is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.   China most likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan,  the report said. Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fueled worries in India that it would become another of China's 'string of pearls' of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The report did not address India's potential reaction to a Chinese base in Pakistan. But Pakistan, the U.S. report noted, was already the primary market in the Asian-Pacific region for Chinese arms exports. That region accounted for $9 billion of the more than $20 billion in Chinese arms exports from 2011 to 2015. Last year, China signed an agreement with Pakistan for the sale of eight submarines. China's Defence Ministry expressed its  resolute opposition  to the contents of the report, saying it hyped up the China threat theory. China follows the path of peaceful development and its defense expenditures are  open and transparent , it said in a statement.  The criticism in the U.S. report is pure conjecture,  it added.  We hope the U.S. side can rationally and objectively view China's national defense and military building.  At a daily news briefing earlier, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the comment on Pakistani bases as  conjecture  and declined a specific response. But China and Pakistan enjoyed friendly cooperative ties that did not target any third parties, she added.

The lower house of Congress passed the much-anticipated tax reform bill last week, aimed at generating revenue to fund a multi-billion dollar infrastructure programme key to the government's economic agenda.     The bill should widen the tax base and boost revenue, Fitch Ratings said in a statement on Wednesday.      We (the Philippine market) have been rallying on the back of news that the tax-reform programme might be passed sooner than expected,  said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with Manila-based AB Capital Securities.     Among the key stocks that gained, SM Investment Corp rose as much as 3.7 percent to a record high, while Ayala Land  climbed 3.1 percent to close at its highest in nearly 10 months.     Foreign investors have been net buyers of equities for nearly a month and a half and that has also been pushing the market higher, Felix added.     Other Southeast Asian markets were mixed, with investors cautious ahead of key political and economic events including UK elections and the European Central Bank's policy meeting.      Indonesian shares pared early gains to close 0.2 percent higher, with Bank Central Asia gaining 1.4 percent and Bank Rakyat Indonesia rising 1.7 percent.

Military Commercial Joint-Stock Bank hit an all-time high, while Vietinbank jumped to its highest in nearly 11 months.

The Paris prosecutor's office swiftly launched a counter-terrorism investigation into the attack, the first since President Emmanuel Macron won power last month and days before the first round of a parliamentary election in France. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the attacker was carrying the identification card of an Algerian student and that preliminary information indicated he had acted alone. Dozens of armed police sealed off the area and put the Gothic cathedral into lockdown with nearly 1,000 tourists and worshippers inside. The incident came three days after militants drove a van at high speed into pedestrians in London before stabbing revelers on the street and in nearby bars, killing seven people and wounding dozens. That followed a suicide bombing in the northern English city of Manchester that killed 22 people.  This happens nearly every week now. I just hope it has nothing to do with the election,  David Stoklo, an American visitor to Paris, told Reuters TV. Tuesday's attack will put a renewed focus on France and Europe's struggle to deal with unsophisticated, low-tech attacks in the countdown to the first round of the parliamentary election on Sunday. A second round will be held on June 18. Macron's rivals portrayed him as weak on security during the presidential election campaign. Collomb said fighting terrorism was the president's  number one  priority.  It was too early to tell if the attack would have any impact on the outcome of the two-round parliamentary election. A poll published earlier on Tuesday showed Macron's new Republic on the Move party heading for a landslide win. French police and gendarmes stand at the scene of a shooting incident near the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, June 6, 2017.Philippe WojazerCopycat Attacks Anna Levy, an American tourist, said she had been about to enter the cathedral when she heard gunshots.  It was just scary because you didn’t know what was happening. People were just running,  she said.  Slideshow (7 Images)Inside the cathedral when the attacker struck were about 900 holidaymakers and worshippers. One of them, Dean Blair, posted on Twitter:  Not the holiday experience wanted. Trapped in Notre Dame Cathedral after police shoot a man. We are with our 2 terrified children.  Macron wants to extend a state of emergency that has been in place since jihadi gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in coordinated attacks on entertainment venues in Paris in late 2015.  In total, more than 230 people have died in attacks across France in the past two-and-a-half years, most of them claimed by Islamic State. Tuesday's attack had parallels with one in April when a militant shot dead one police officer and wounded two others on Paris' Champs-Elysees boulevard. Other attacks have targeted the security forces and have been noticeable for their simplicity.  We have moved on from sophisticated terrorism to a form of terrorism where any object can be used to attack,  Collomb told reporters. He echoed British Prime Minister Theresa May who in the wake of the London Bridge attack said Britain was facing a new trend where militants are inspired by  copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack .

The sports and recreation hub would be built in the western city of Pengzhou with the local government, Lander said in a statement to the Shenzhen exchange on Wednesday. Lander, with potential partners, will fund the 4-billion yuan-investment.

Industry sources, however, said a deal for the English club was not completely dead in the water. Lander said in April that whether the company could  eventually complete the acquisition  of an 80 percent stake in the club  remained uncertain . The company had earlier this year said it had struck a deal with Southampton owner Katharina Liebherr. Chinese entities and individuals have ploughed billions of dollars into overseas soccer investments since late 2015, encouraged by avid fan President Xi Jinping, who wants the country to become a soccer superpower. However, Beijing's attitude has cooled of late, and a number of sports-related deals have hit hurdles. Beijing has said it would rein in risks from  irrational  outbound investments, with particular focus on sectors including entertainment and sports.

The FTSE 100 was up 0.2 percent on the final day of a campaign which has seen polls suggesting support for Prime Minister Theresa May's party was slipping, raising the possibility of a smaller majority or a hung parliament. But investors still saw a Conservative majority as the most likely outcome and although volatility has ticked up over the past week, it remains near historic lows and far from its levels in the run-up to the Brexit vote in June last year. Mid-caps outperformed blue-chip stocks, up 0.5 percent after three sessions in the red. The more domestically-exposed stocks have been under more pressure of late due to the perception of heightened British political risk.  I think mid-caps will do better on the back of a Conservative win,  said Colin McLean, manager of the UK growth fund at SVM Asset Management, adding they may suffer from a win by Labour whose policies could increase labour costs.  The bigger picture is that international stocks have been doing less well ... quite a lot of what drove markets last year has gone into reverse over the last six months and investors are looking again at some of the beneficiaries of lower growth and deflation,  he added.  That probably drives investors a little bit more than the election.  Royal Bank of Scotland was the top FTSE gainer on a subdued day of trading, leading financials stocks which were the biggest boost to the index, helped higher by relief after the rescue of Spain's Banco Popular by Banco Santander . Lloyds and Barclays gained 1.4 to 1.6 percent. Europe's banking stocks were among the best sectoral gainers. Pharmaceuticals companies were the top fallers among major global companies. Astrazeneca fell 1.4 percent, after selling the rights for its migraine drug Zomig to Grunenthal for up to $302 million. Shire also dropped 2 percent. House prices in May came in 3.3 percent higher than a year ago, slightly ahead of the forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, giving a slight boost to housebuilders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. Money managers were treading carefully ahead of the next big potential macro shock, mindful of the unexpected outcomes of the Brexit vote and U.S. election.  This is a dangerous game to play - as polls and bookmakers alike can often be wrong. Even with the result known, market direction is difficult to predict,  said Asbjorn Trolle Hansen, manager of the Nordea GBP diversified return fund. Packaging group RPC's profits more than doubled, yet it fell 2.2 percent, among the worst-performing mid-caps. Some brokers had raised concerns over its acquisition-heavy strategy.  The group has tried to address these concerns with increased disclosure in these results but has clearly failed to satisfy the market,  said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Yet for all the fuss that greeted babies Ella and Alexander Clooney, they may end up the warm-up act to this summer's blockbuster.  Beyonce also is expected to give birth to twins any day now, turning motherhood into the biggest celebrity story of the year despite the striking contrast in styles of the two women who have become the focus of a baby-obsessed public.  Music superstar Beyonce, 35, has delighted in displaying her belly in Instagram photos and stage performances, whereas Amal Clooney, 39, made it clear during her pregnancy that she would like fans to focus more on her work than her baby bump.  It is a marked change from Beyonce's first pregnancy, with now 5-year-old Blue Ivy, when the singer was so rarely photographed that it spawned unfounded conspiracy theories that the  Single Ladies  star had faked her condition. This time, Beyonce announced she was expecting twins a year after her  Lemonade  album chronicled her response to widespread reports of infidelity by husband Jay Z.  What better sign to show to the world that you and your husband are a unit than to say, 'Hey I'm pregnant. We're back on track again.' And twins is even better,  said Berkeley Kaite, professor of English at McGill University in Montreal. Clooney, however, a top-flight humanitarian lawyer based in London, shunned the limelight that comes from being the spouse of the dashing  Ocean's Eleven  actor, who in the past had declared he did not want kids.  Clooney having children is exciting to many people because he's perceived as a guy who took a while to settle down, and with an amazing woman who is very interesting,  said JD Heyman, deputy editor of People magazine. Demi Moore Uncovers a Trend  FILE PHOTO - Beyonce performs at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on February 12, 2017.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoAside from the usual fascination with the private lives of public figures, the attention given to the double sets of twins  reflects conflicting attitudes to modern motherhood. Celebrity pregnancies became big business after actress Demi Moore's nude, seven-month pregnant photo shoot for Vanity Fair in 1991. The photo of Moore proudly caressing her belly was included in Time magazine's 2016  100 Photographs: The Most Influential Images of All Time,  where it was hailed as showing that maternity could be both empowering and sexy and for changing what had been a relatively private affair into a public event.   FILE PHOTO - Beyonce performs at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on February 12, 2017.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMore than 25 years on, motherhood remains a double-edged sword with assumptions about what women should or should not do, said Ann C. Hall, co-editor of the 2009 book  Mommy Angst.   Women have a lot of baggage... Everyone is happy, but on the other hand there is a whole host of expectations, and a lot of judgment,  said Hall, who is also chair of comparative humanities at the University of Louisville, Kentucky.  Some of us want to figure out what they are going to do with these babies. How are they going to negotiate their careers and their maternity? There aren't really any hard and fast rules for negotiating that any more, which is great and liberating but also anxiety producing,  Hall said. Beyonce and Clooney also highlight the trend towards older mothers, which comes with worries over infertility and the growth of the estimated $3 billion to $4 billion U.S. fertility market as women delay having children. According to the 2017 National Vital Statistics report, birth rates for women ages 30 to 44 in the U.S. were the highest in 2015 since the early 1960s. Childless celebrities undergo equal scrutiny, as highlighted by Jennifer Aniston in a 2016 open letter objecting to the endless media speculation over whether she is, is not, or will ever be pregnant.  We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child ... we don't need to be married, or mothers to compete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves,  Aniston wrote.

Amal Clooney, 39, and the 56-year-old Oscar-winning star of films like  Ocean's Eleven  and  Three Kings  married in Italy in 2014, making them one of the world's biggest celebrity couples.

Amal Clooney largely continued her work as a human rights lawyer, addressing the United Nations in March and urging the international community to investigate crimes committed by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

On Tuesday, social media lit up with congratulatory messages and  Ella and Alexander  was among the top trending topics on Twitter in the United States.

Slideshow (5 Images) Good lord, the Clooneys have given their twins lovely ordinary names. Shocking. And they call themselves celebrities...,  wrote British journalist Nicola Jane Swinney on Twitter. Comedian Ellen DeGeneres posted a Twitter message saying,  Congratulations, George and Amal, or as I’m now calling you, Ocean’s Four.  Congratulations also came from actress Mia Farrow and U.S. journalist Katie Couric. People magazine reported on Tuesday that former U.S. President Barack Obama paid a long, private visit with the Clooneys at their home in the countryside west of London on May 27. George Clooney canceled a visit to Armenia for a humanitarian event this past weekend, saying in a message to organizers that  if I came there and my wife had twins while I was there, I could never come home.

Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told a forum in Beijing that an inflexible foreign exchange rate would limit the opening of the economy and yuan internationalization. Efforts to promote the yuan on the international stage have actually  gone backwards , in some respects, as a result of inflexibility and efforts to stop capital outflows, he said. Reforms to the exchange rate system were  a relatively urgent matter , he said without elaborating. Officials at the People's Bank of China reiterated through different channels over the past few months that the country would continue to promote yuan internationalization, which was a long-term strategy. The yuan is limited to trading within a band of two percent on either side of a midpoint reference rate determined daily by the central bank. Late last month, the PBOC said it was considering changes to the way it set the midpoint, adding a  counter-cyclical factor  to the formula. It has yet to explain this new element in detail, but analysts and traders think it gives the PBOC more leeway to alter the rate irrespective of market conditions. Analysts say curbs on capital outflows imposed last year have checked the pace of the internationalization of China's currency. In 2016, the yuan CNY=CFXS weakened 6.5 percent against the resurgent dollar. So far this year, the yuan has strengthened around 2.3 percent against the dollar. Last week was the yuan's best week since February 2016, as it gained 0.65 percent against the dollar - a sizable leap for a currency that normally trades in a wafer-thin range. The yuan's sudden reversal has diminished expectations the currency is on a weakening path, and the moves via state banks to prop up the exchange rate appeared to have gathered pace from May 24, when Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's sovereign credit rating for the first time since 1989.

Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told a forum in Beijing that an inflexible foreign exchange rate would limit the opening of the economy and yuan internationalization. Efforts to promote the yuan on the international stage have actually  gone backwards , in some respects, as a result of inflexibility and efforts to stop capital outflows, he said. Reforms to the exchange rate system were  a relatively urgent matter , he said without elaborating. Officials at the People's Bank of China reiterated through different channels over the past few months that the country would continue to promote yuan internationalization, which was a long-term strategy. The yuan is limited to trading within a band of two percent on either side of a midpoint reference rate determined daily by the central bank. Late last month, the PBOC said it was considering changes to the way it set the midpoint, adding a  counter-cyclical factor  to the formula. It has yet to explain this new element in detail, but analysts and traders think it gives the PBOC more leeway to alter the rate irrespective of market conditions. Analysts say curbs on capital outflows imposed last year have checked the pace of the internationalization of China's currency. In 2016, the yuan CNY=CFXS weakened 6.5 percent against the resurgent dollar. So far this year, the yuan has strengthened around 2.3 percent against the dollar. Last week was the yuan's best week since February 2016, as it gained 0.65 percent against the dollar - a sizable leap for a currency that normally trades in a wafer-thin range. The yuan's sudden reversal has diminished expectations the currency is on a weakening path, and the moves via state banks to prop up the exchange rate appeared to have gathered pace from May 24, when Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's sovereign credit rating for the first time since 1989.

Efforts to defuse the Qatar crisis -- prompted on Monday when the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others severed diplomatic ties with it over alleged support for Islamist groups and Iran -- have showed no immediate signs of success. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has been on a push to resolve the crisis, has said that isolating Qatar, including by the use of sanctions, would not resolve the rift.  It will not contribute to solving any problem to try and isolate in this way Qatar, which we know for sure has fought very effectively against terrorist groups,  he said following a fast-breaking dinner for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Tuesday. Erdogan has been in talks with the leaders of Qatar, Russia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and others on lowering the tension.  We appreciate the cool-headed and constructive attitude which Qatar has shown,  he said.  We as Turkey will continue to develop our relations with Qatar as with all our friends.  Turkey has good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbours. Qatar has for years parlayed its enormous gas wealth and media strength into broad influence in the region. But Gulf Arab neighbours and Egypt have long been irked by its support for the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which they regard as a political enemy.

The Guardian newspaper said meat processing company JBS, which supplies beef to several leading UK food stores, had previously bought cattle from a farm in northern Brazil which is being investigated for using workers as modern-day slaves. JBS told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it had stopped buying from the farm on discovering a possible link to labor abuses. Upmarket British food store Waitrose said it was pulling one of its three own brand corned beef products while it investigated.  While we have found no such concerns in our own supply chain ... we are taking these allegations seriously so have stopped sourcing any of our corned beef from there (JBS) while we investigate fully,  the supermarket said in a statement. JBS produce is also used in tinned corned beef sold by Marks & Spencer, Co-op, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Princes, according to the Guardian, which added that some of these stores were now also investigating and examining their supply chains. Co-op said tackling modern slavery was central to its ethical trade strategy.  We take such allegations very seriously and will be investigating with our suppliers in order to address any issues,  a spokesman said. Marks & Spencer said it had not sourced canned corned beef from Brazil since autumn 2016.  Corned beef, a salt-cured product widely used during both world wars when fresh meat was rationed, remains popular in Britain where it is commonly used in sandwiches. The newspaper said documents showed JBS paid 2 million pounds ($2.58 million) between 2013 and 2016 for cattle reared on a farm in the state of Para where prosecutors say workers were being subjected to modern slavery. Brazilian police reportedly discovered men forced to live in inhumane and degrading conditions, with no shelter, toilets or drinking water. Prosecutors believe the workers were in debt bondage, the Guardian said. The 2016 Global Slavery Index estimated about 46 million people are in some form of modern slavery - forced into manual labor, trafficked to brothels, victims of debt bondage or born into servitude - with about 161,000 people in Brazil enslaved.  JBS said the farm at the center of the allegations had never been included in the government's  blacklist  for slave labor.   As soon as JBS became aware of irregularities in the farm's operations in 2016, all livestock purchases from (there) were immediately stopped,  spokeswoman Carla Saemi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.  JBS does not buy cattle from any farms which have any association with slave labor as listed by the Brazilian government.

But rather than getting a shocked response, Wang simply shrugged his shoulders, Li told Reuters.  He told me he looks after garbage collection, water pipes, that sort of thing. Same-sex marriage isn't up to him,  said Li, who works for the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.   That's the problem in China. Who is in charge of this stuff?  After decades of Communist prudery about sex of all kinds, during recent years of economic reform and growth, gay Chinese have sprung forward to reclaim the country's long history of relative tolerance toward homosexuality. With no clear, bureaucratic way forward to legalize same-sex marriage, unlike in Taiwan which approved the step last month, and deeply conservative attitudes among the older generation toward sex, gay Chinese are pushing against old social norms and legal uncertainty to assert their rights.  Until 2001, China listed homosexuality as a mental disorder, but it is not illegal to be gay.  Many big cities have thriving gay scenes, although gay men and women still face family pressure to marry and have children, fulfilling the Confucian tradition of honoring ancestors by ensuring the family line. While Taiwan's decision paving the way for same-sex couples to marry was largely ignored by the mainstream Chinese media, it got big play on social media, with many supportive comments. Next week, China's cosmopolitan business capital Shanghai will host its ninth gay pride event, four days of films, talks and parties, though without a parade that accompanies such events in other cities around the world. Evie Wu, Shanghai Pride's director, told Reuters that about 6,000 people were expected to attend. For the 10th anniversary next year, organizers hope to hold Pride events in other cities, including Beijing.  People have told us that attending Pride has led to them accepting themselves, that they have a community and that they are not alone. That's inspired us to continue,  Wu said. 'Family First' It is hard to gauge the degree of popular acceptance of homosexuality in the world's most populous nation. Sexologist Li, who has backed parliamentary proposals to legalize gay marriage that went nowhere, said a survey she had conducted in 2007 showed many people simply had no view about homosexuality.  Since ancient times there's been no particular feeling that homosexuality is wrong, unlike in Christianity or what the Bible says,  she said. But Chinese society had always placed huge importance on the family line, and that is what has driven opposition to homosexuality, Li said.  It's always family first, happiness second.  Li's old friend Wang is now in the Communist Party's elite ruling inner core, and heads the powerful anti-corruption watchdog, which did not respond to requests for comment about her conversation with him when he was Beijing's mayor. While the government often turns a blind eye to gay events, the Communist Party has intensified a crackdown on civil society since President Xi Jinping took office four years ago. Last month, police in the city of Xian briefly detained nine gay activists, saying the city did not welcome gay people, after they tried to organize a conference. Unbowed, the same group is organizing an event in Chengdu this month, encouraged by support on social media. One of the organizers, who asked to be identified only as Matthew, said he was nervous the Chengdu event could draw official attention.  I've held events in Chengdu before, and I've never had any official notification I either can or cannot do this,  he told Reuters.  Even with the Xian event, before it all went down we didn't get any sort of message.  Still, on the weekend before Taiwan's marriage decision, gay activists held a packed fund-raising event at a Beijing bar complete with lip-synching drag queens that went off without a hitch. The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which technically has oversight over civil issues like marriage, declined to comment on questions from Reuters about the possibility of same-sex marriage or whether there was an institutionalized problem with homophobia in China. Activists say the government vacillates on its attitudes toward homosexuality, pointing out that gay clubs and bars are often left alone while gay dramas are banned on television. Overtly hostile opinions do surface publicly from time to time. Zeng Weizhu, a philosopher at China's Shanxi Agricultural University, wrote an open letter to the people of Taiwan last month on the Confucian Net website denouncing the marriage decision as a  disaster  perpetrated by youth  ignorant of worldly affairs .  Parents of Taiwan, come to the mainland! Your children and grandchildren will multiply, your life will be extended and your latter years won't be lonely,  Zeng wrote. The comments section underneath his letter largely scorned his view as absurd and offensive.  Dying of laughter. Support gays and oppose discrimination,  wrote one person, using the handle  When Love Comes To Call . Zeng declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index reversed to trade 0.2 percent higher in its first session of gains this week, while Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.2 percent and Germany's DAX fell 0.1 percent. Although shares in Santander fell 2.4 percent in choppy trade and Banco Popular's were suspended, European banks were among the standout performers, gaining 0.7 percent. Santander said that it would buy Popular and carry out a capital increase of around 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).  We're getting rid of a weak link from Europe in terms of Banco Popular being taken over by Santander,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  As a stand-alone bank, (Popular) was close to failing ... and the failure of any bank, as we've seen in the past, can set of that chain of events where the whole banking sector gets freaked out, investors especially,  van Dulken added. Spain's Bankia, Italy's BPER Banca and France's Societe Generale were all up between 2.2 percent and 3.8 percent. European utilities also enjoyed gains, led by Germany's E.ON and RWE, which both rose around 4 percent after the country's highest court declared a nuclear fuel tax illegal, enabling them to claim back 6 billion euros ($6.76 billion) in cash. A rise among basic resources stocks and energy firms also helped support the wider market. Shares in Swedish biometric firm Fingerprint Cards were the top risers, jumping more than 7 percent after confirming an order for its sensors. On the downside, Covestro dropped more than 4 percent after Bayer cut its stake further in the plastics maker to 44.8 percent from 53.3 percent. Investors were also looking ahead to the UK's election on Thursday, as well as the European Central Bank's policy meeting.  Whatever the outcome on Friday morning, markets actually have very little to go on to be able to judge whether such a new government would be more or less successful in negotiations with the EU,  Don Smith, chief investment officer at Brown Shipley, said in a note.

The decision by several Arab states to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism, made markets - especially in the region - uneasy Adding to the frayed nerves were three key events scheduled for Thursday - Britain's general election, a European Central Bank policy meeting and testimony by former FBI director James Comey which could impact on U.S. President Donald Trump's economic agenda. MSCI's emerging stock benchmark slipped 0.2 percent, with heavyweight South Korea falling 0.4 percent, while bourses elsewhere in Asia , Turkey and parts of emerging Europe also suffered losses.  There are worries about the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and Qatar and how that will play out ... It's a geopolitical oil story that creates a risk off sentiment,  said Per Hammarlund at SEB.  In the U.K., people are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see how this will pan out - if you have an acrimonious Brexit that will hurt the Central and Eastern European countries, and it could hurt the EU too, so it has wider ramifications.  Markets in the Gulf remained under some pressure after U.S. President Donald Trump supported Saudi Arabia against Qatar. Qatar's stock exchange fell 0.3 percent, having tumbled nearly 9 percent over the last two days. Doha's dollar-denominated debt edged lower across the curve, with some issues trading at their weakest in around 2-1/2 months. Currencies fared little better, despite a steady dollar. South Africa's rand had a soft start to the session after data showed on Tuesday that Africa's most industrialized nation slipped into recession for the first time in eight years. The news raised the prospect of further credit rating downgrades and heaped pressure on President Jacob Zuma, who is already facing corruption allegations. However, the rand recovered most of its losses to trade 0.2 percent weaker after central bank data showed FX reserves grew unexpectedly.  The downgrade question is definitely one of the factors,  said SEB's Hammarlund, referring to Moody's next assessment scheduled for release on Friday.  But if you look at the rand and emerging markets in general over the longer term, you are still looking at a positive cycle - the worries about the rand will be short lived.  Russia's rouble and Mexico's peso also weakened against the dollar. In Poland, central bank policy makers are scheduled to conclude their interest rate setting meeting, though analysts expect no change until the third quarter of 2018 given the benign outlook for inflation. Interest rates are at an all-time low of 1.5 percent.

Following a 90-million-euro pilot investment from the EU's common budget in 2017-2019, the European Commission is proposing 500 million euros ($563 million) for the 2019-2020 period that could rise to 1.5 billion euros a year from 2021, Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska told Reuters.  European citizens see security as the number one thing that Europe should provide to them, so it's time to propose this,  Bienkowska said in an interview. With Britain, one of EU's leading military powers, leaving the bloc, ideas for common EU defense are gathering pace in the wake of Islamic attacks in Western Europe. Europeans are also worried about U.S. commitment to NATO under President Donald Trump. Under the proposal unveiled on Wednesday, at least three firms and two member states would have to submit a joint project to be eligible for financing from the EU budget.  If agreed by governments and the European Parliament, the EU budget would put up 20 percent of the costs of developing prototypes, Bienkowska said.  The prototype phase is the riskiest one and it is very important to have incentives from the European budget to prepare common projects,  she added. A European drone is often cited as an example of how EU funding can help get projects underway. Bienkowska said she also hoped to see cyber projects from smaller firms and innovative startups. She said she wants negotiations and legislative work between the Commission, member states and the European Parliament to finalize by the end of 2018.  Brexit Factor The EU's political capital Brussels hopes it can turn the tables on Brexit - an unprecedented setback in 60 years of European integration - by moving ahead with closer defense and security cooperation, which London had long blocked.  The EU, where most governments are also NATO allies, have also come under increased pressure from Trump, who last month scolded the Europeans for failing to spend enough on their own defense. Though Bienkowska said work on promoting more security and defense cooperation in the EU has started two years ago, she admitted Europe's unease about Trump gives it additional momentum:  All developments in the United States will make our cooperation (in Europe) stronger.   We will work more closely in the European Union, what we want to achieve is to have a stronger European defense and a stronger NATO.   Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its subsequent backing for militias fighting Kiev troops in the industrial east of the former Soviet republic also add to the bloc's security concerns.  The EU estimates it loses up to a 100 billion euros a year on duplication, leaving it with far fewer capabilities than the United States. Years of defense cuts have worsened the issue as national governments jealously protect their own firms. Europe has 37 types of armored personal carriers and 12 types of tanker aircraft compared to nine and four respectively in the United States, according to EU analysis.  Up until now, member states were doing things completely separately, without any cooperation. I want to appeal to the member states to think about common projects, because the money will be there,  Bienkowska said. For the future, Bienkowska is mulling a common European defense bond for joint purchases from 2021, though she said no decisions had yet been taken. Italy is a proponent of issuing joint EU debt, as well as exempting various types of spending from budget deficit limits. Germany, on the other hand, which is the bloc's largest economy and key power, is opposed to both these approaches.

Under the plan, the currently separate chief competitive officer (CCO) roles at Renault (RENA.PA) and Nissan (7201.T) would be fused into a single position at the 18-year-old alliance's helm, the sources said. Nissan Chief Performance Officer Jose Munoz and CCO Yasuhiro Yamauchi are seen internally as strong contenders, they said, along with Stefan Mueller, Munoz's counterpart at Renault. Ghosn, 63, aims to fill the new post later this year, backed by further steps to combine Renault and Nissan manufacturing, research and development and other key activities.  He's already preparing the next stage,  one of the people said.  The process is underway.  A Renault-Nissan spokeswoman declined to comment. Brazilian-born Ghosn recently stepped back from his role as Nissan chief executive officer but remains CEO at Renault, where his contract ends in 2018. He still serves as chairman of both carmakers as well as Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T), controlled by Nissan through a 34 percent stake. Ghosn has repeatedly tussled with Renault's biggest shareholder, the French state, over the future of the company and its 44 percent stake in Nissan. For years, he sang the praises of a consensual, arm's length approach to cooperation - often invoking the long list of failed auto deals to explain why a merger was a bad idea. Renault and Nissan are currently targeting 5.5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) in joint savings, or 3.8 percent of combined sales. But the tone changed in February, when Ghosn suggested the carmakers would be ready for a full tie-up if only France sold its near-20 percent Renault holding. Nissan  will not accept any move on capital structure as long as the French state remains a shareholder,  Ghosn said as he presented Renault's 2016 earnings.  The day the French state decides to get out, everything is open, and I can tell you it won't take too much time.  The new CCO hiring process began around the same time, the sources said, with senior executives at both companies vying for what is likely to be an internal appointment. Senior alliance appointments are beset by the same cultural and political sensitivities that have held back integration. Being neither French nor Japanese could be a diplomatic edge for Munoz or Mueller, respectively Spanish and German. Renault CCO Thierry Bollore is considered a long shot, the sources added. Bollore, 54, has played a prominent role in publicly defending the company against diesel fraud allegations that remain under investigation by French prosecutors. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa will likely stay in the role he inherited in April, with Ghosn also remaining Renault CEO  for an initial period . Ghosn, who has run Nissan since 1999 and its French parent since 2005, is expected to continue presiding over the alliance from one or more chairman roles. The other changes will see Renault and Nissan departments folded into alliance teams that were created in 2014 across four key areas, the same people said: manufacturing and supply chain; research and development; purchasing; and human resources.  We'll see convergence efforts in the same fields,  said one.  But they are stepping up a notch.  Renault shares were up 1 percent to 84.44 euros at 0939 GMT on Wednesday. Nissan shares earlier closed 0.6 percent higher at 1,074 yen in Tokyo.

Exports rose 8.4 percent from a year earlier, slowing from a 9.4 percent gain in April, the finance ministry said on Wednesday, but better than the 7.2 percent pace forecast in a Reuters poll. The data bodes well for the trade-reliant economy and reinforces expectations the central bank will leave its key policy rate steady for the fourth quarter in a row this month.  There is no urgent reason for the central bank to raise interest rates this year. The current CPI (consumer price index) level remains low and export momentum could drop off in the second half of the year,  said Kevin Wang, an analyst of Taishin Securities Investment Advisory in Taipei. While expectations for Apple's iPhone 8 and other tech products are high, the ministry cautioned against early optimism.  It is difficult to predict the momentum for new products like high-end smartphones,  said Beatrice Tsai, a ministry official.  Exports for the second half of the year can be expected to slow down, in part because of a higher base last year.  The government has raised its 2017 economic growth forecast to a three-year high, as exports improve on strong global demand. Taiwan is a major link in the global manufacturing supply chain and its export trend is a key gauge of worldwide demand for technology gadgets. The island's export industries traditionally experience a slow season in the second quarter. Shipments in May to its two biggest markets, China and the United States, were strong, up 6.4 percent and 12.9 percent from a year earlier, respectively. Imports rose 10.2 percent versus a forecast 11.4 percent gain. That produced a trade surplus of $3.46 billion in May, slightly more than economists' expectations of $3.315 billion. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States was $628 million in May, expanding to $1.648 billion from January to May, the ministry said. That remained below one of the thresholds that could trigger punitive trade talks by the U.S. Treasury.  We haven't gone over the red line,  Tsai said. Taiwan appeared again alongside China, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Germany on the latest watchlist of countries that the United States would monitor as potential currency manipulators. The Taiwan dollar is one of the region's best-performing currencies, up around 7 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year. Its central bank has refrained from weakening the currency through market intervention, as a precaution against being labeled a currency manipulator by the U.S. Treasury.

Like many Italians mired in poverty, he is throwing his weight behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is gearing up for local and national elections and promising large welfare payouts to help the swelling numbers of struggling households. Critics say the measure smacks of populism and risks bankrupting heavily indebted Italy. Five-Star - which leads national opinion polls alongside the ruling Democratic Party - says Italy is the only European Union country besides Greece that does not help the long-term unemployed and vows to change this. The party pledge certainly resonates on the island of Sicily, where the jobless rate stands at 22 percent, youth unemployment is almost 60 percent. Fifty-five percent of people live on, or below, the poverty line - double the national average.  Unless you have powerful friends here, you don't get anything,  said Costanza, 39, who lives in Palermo's working-class neighborhood of Cruillas and gets by with odd jobs repairing broken-down household appliances.  Of course I am going to vote for the 5-Star. I don't know if they will change anything in the end, but at least they are promising to do things differently,  he said. While sun-drenched Sicily might historically be more deprived than the rest of the country it has also proved an accurate bellwether of Italian politics over the past 60 years. For four decades it supported the dominant Christian Democrats before switching allegiances to Silvio Berlusconi's center-right bloc, which famously won all 61 seats on offer here in a 2001 national election, and then drifted towards the center-left. It now looks set to embrace the maverick 5-Star. Latest opinion polls show the party, which was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, is backed by 37 percent of voters in Sicily, its highest score in any of Italy's 20 regions. That puts it in a strong position to do well in municipal and regional elections set for June and November. It could also help drive the party towards national power by handing it the lion's share of Sicily's seats in the 630-seat national assembly at the next general election, due by May 2018. The risk of a 5-Star triumph in Sicily generating momentum nationwide is often cited as reason for the keenness of the ruling Democratic Party to hold a snap national election this autumn, before the Sicilian regional ballot in November.  We are a laboratory for Italian politics. The trends set here are replicated across the country within six months,  said Giancarlo Cancelleri, 42, who is frontrunner to be selected as the 5-Star's candidate for regional governor.  The others are afraid of us, that is why they are rushing to a general election,  added Cancelleri.   Mistrust Unlike other non-traditional - so-called populist - parties that have flourished across Europe since the 2008 financial crisis, 5-Star straddles ideological divides, focusing its anger on rampant corruption rather than on mass immigration. The strategy has proved effective, and the eight-year-old party is backed by around 30 percent of voters nationally, according to opinion polls. Tapping into festering mistrust of politicians, 5-Star lawmakers in the regional government only accept half their salary and have renounced their right to a monthly pension of 1,000 euros ($1,125) after just a single legislature. Victory in November would be a milestone for the movement, giving it control of its first region, and one which enjoys significant autonomy. Sicily has its own parliament and writes its own laws, meaning the 5-Star would have the ability to introduce a pilot of its so-called citizen's wage. The scheme proposes topping up a single person's income to a maximum 780 euros a month, while a family of four would be guaranteed at least 1,482 euros. Opponents says this would cost Sicily 2.4 billion euros a year.  It would be catastrophic if they introduced this measure because we don't have the money,  said Giovanni La Via, a center-right Euro lawmaker from Sicily's second city, Catania.  Any spare funds we have must go on improving infrastructure and creating the conditions to grow the economy. What we need here are jobs and motorways, not handouts,  he told Reuters. Cancelleri estimated the universal salary would cost no more than 700 million euros on the island and said it would be accompanied by policies to promote the private sector.  We will introduce it in an experimental phase and then review progress,  he said.  Meltdown Sicily's economic output fell more than 13 percentage points between 2008 and 2015. Although the economy has since started to grow again, it will take many years before it recovers the lost ground, leaving whoever is in charge with few resources. The current governor, the center-left's Rosario Crocetta, says his main achievement has been to save Sicily from default after it flirted with meltdown in 2012, and cutting waste. As evidence of this, he points to a reduction in the number of forestry workers to 20,000 from 26,000. By comparison, Britain's Forestry Commission, which operates in an area nine times the size of Sicily, employs just 2,500. Like many local administration positions in Sicily, the forestry jobs are often viewed as de-facto welfare, not genuine employment. The 5-Star says it will slim the public service, while cutting the red tape that stifles the private sector. Although it has the most support of any party in Sicily, the movement has been hit by internal feuding - a problem that has often tripped it up across Italy thanks to a flat leadership structure that has led to fierce local power tussles. The Sicilian divisions flared over allegations that 14 5-Star members, including three lawmakers, falsified signatures to enable candidates to run in the 2012 municipal elections in Palermo, the island's capital. With a trial looming, mutual recriminations have flown over the scandal, hurting the party's bid to win the next mayoral election in the city this month. The 5-Star candidate for mayor, Ugo Forello, dismisses the controversy and says he is confident he can overcome voter distrust to land the party its first triumph on the island.  It is normal with such a diffuse base to have strong differences of opinion and the occasional dispute,  he says as he walks round the Cruillas district, drumming up support. Standing in the shade of a tree and watching Forello from a distance, the jobless Costanza says he isn't bothered by the party divisions. His main concern is taking care of his family, especially his deaf, three-year-old son, who has been waiting for a year for treatment. Hospitals say their clinics are full.  I want this citizen' wage. It wouldn't resolve all my problems, but it would give me a base to survive from.

Deeper restructuring would come just six months after INCJ agreed to invest up to 75 billion yen ($685 million) in the liquid crystal display (LCD) maker, and five years after INCJ helped form Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp.

The absorption of Popular by Spain's biggest bank Santander for a nominal one euro was the first use of a regime to deal with failing banks adopted after the 2008 financial crisis and made barely a ripple in Europe's stock and debt markets. Indeed, as the morning wore on the success of the process pushed shares in many major banks higher, supporting a recovery for Madrid's stock market and fending off this week's broadly weaker mood. But the rescue also underlines the risks to growth, banking and government debt burdens that are likely to delay a major switch in language and policy direction by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday. That in turn has kept the euro in check this week and it was down 0.15 percent against the dollar in morning trade in Europe.  Maybe tomorrow's ECB meeting sees nothing but platitudes and disappoints a market that is getting ahead of itself,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes,  But (for us) that would be a huge euro buying opportunity, because ECB normalisation IS coming. And when it does, the euro simply won't be able to sustain undervalued levels for long.  European blue chip shares had risen by 0.1-0.2 percent by 0850 GMT  and Madrid's IBEX recovered from early losses to trade flat on the day. European banking shares rose 1.2 percent Oil prices, however, were again almost 1 percent lower and the flood of money into the perceived security of Japan's yen this week continued. It was up another 0.2 percent at 109.17 yen per dollar - a 7-week high. The greenback has lost more than 1 percent so far this week, pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows. A surprisingly closely-fought British election set for Thursday is weighing on investors' minds along with Senate testimony from James Comey, the former FBI chief fired by President Donald Trump. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony are likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhaul the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.  Tomorrow’s what is being dubbed as 'Triple Threat Thursday', ... an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.

The idea of developing the Xiongan New Area, about 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Beijing, was announced on April 1. The planned zone in Hebei province has been touted as having the same national significance as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone that helped launch China's economic transformation in 1980.   We estimate the proposal would be submitted to the central government for review by the end of June,  Xu Kuangdi, chief adviser for the planning of the Xiongan economic zone, said at a forum on regional development in Beijing.  All infrastructure in the zone, including transport, water and electricity, will be built underground to make room for green spaces and pedestrians, Xu said on Tuesday.  Inter-city transport would be  ultra-convenient , with the commute between Xiongan and Beijing a mere 41-minute ride by high speed rail, he said.  There are, however, still challenges, such as securing water supplies in such a dry area, reviving the ecology of the Baiyangdian lake, and ensuring the city is so smart and high-tech that it would  still be advanced in 100 years , a requirement set out by President Xi Jinping.  President Xi's words have given us lots of pressure,  Xu said. Xu said he was inspired by the planning of Paris, saying it was similar to the ideal envisioned by Chinese experts for Xiongan. Xiongan's core area will be about 100 square kilometers and an  expanded area  of 1,000 square kilometers.

The idea of developing the Xiongan New Area, about 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Beijing, was announced on April 1. The planned zone in Hebei province has been touted as having the same national significance as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone that helped launch China's economic transformation in 1980.   We estimate the proposal would be submitted to the central government for review by the end of June,  Xu Kuangdi, chief adviser for the planning of the Xiongan economic zone, said at a forum on regional development in Beijing.  All infrastructure in the zone, including transport, water and electricity, will be built underground to make room for green spaces and pedestrians, Xu said on Tuesday.  Inter-city transport would be  ultra-convenient , with the commute between Xiongan and Beijing a mere 41-minute ride by high speed rail, he said.  There are, however, still challenges, such as securing water supplies in such a dry area, reviving the ecology of the Baiyangdian lake, and ensuring the city is so smart and high-tech that it would  still be advanced in 100 years , a requirement set out by President Xi Jinping.  President Xi's words have given us lots of pressure,  Xu said. Xu said he was inspired by the planning of Paris, saying it was similar to the ideal envisioned by Chinese experts for Xiongan. Xiongan's core area will be about 100 square kilometers and an  expanded area  of 1,000 square kilometers.

Trafigura, which rivals Glencore (GLEN.L) as the world's second largest oil trader, said its first half core earnings or EBITDA rose 12 percent to $921.4 million, while gross profit increased 6 percent to $1.238 billion, helped by better revenues in the metals unit. Revenues grew 53 percent to $67.317 billion. Trafigura reports results on an October-October basis, so the first half results reflect its performance from October to March, when oil markets saw record low volatility. Related CoverageTrafigura says no impact on gas trading so far from Gulf crisisThe firm said its gross profit margin stood at 1.8 percent versus 2.7 percent in the first six months of 2016 due to  low levels of realized volatility, with prices largely range-bound from December .  This reduced profitable opportunities for trading,  it said, adding that gross profit from oil trading fell by 17 percent from the first half of 2016 to $652 million. Gross profit and margins in oil fell despite total volumes in oil trading rising by 25 percent from the period a year earlier to an average of 4.995 million barrels per day, broadly on a par with Glencore and only behind the world's top oil trader Vitol.  We expect our daily average volume traded for the full 2017 financial year to exceed 5 million barrels per day, compared to 2016 daily average volume of 4.3 million barrels,  Trafigura said, citing its rising role in exporting U.S. shale crude and increasing sales to China and India. Trafigura also said it saw a 37 percent rise in metals and minerals volumes in the first half. As a result, gross profit in the metals division rose by more than 50 percent to $586 million. It said the market showed signs of supply tightness in zinc and copper concentrates while refined metals saw a sharp expansion in demand, with aluminum a particularly strong performer.  In coal, Chinese supply curbs stimulated new import flows, for example from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa, while the iron ore market also showed new signs of life, Trafigura added in its report.  We were able to expand overall trading volumes and gross profit, with refined non-ferrous metals, coal and iron ore all showing strong tonnage growth and non-ferrous concentrates maintaining leading market positions without sacrificing margins,  it said.

The 44-year-old is set to be named in the coming days to succeed Georges Plassat, whose contract as chairman and chief executive of the world's second-largest retailer expires in May 2018, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. And according to associates, Bompard has the daring and determination that could help him succeed in revitalizing Carrefour's core business where others have struggled or failed. Last year, the father of three stunned the retail world when as CEO of Fnac he won a bidding war with South African giant Steinhoff for electricals chain Darty to create a French market leader with annual sales of over 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).  Alexandre Bompard made thousands of calls himself. He is someone who will not be easily deterred,  said billionaire businessman Xavier Niel, who knows him well. Since taking the reins at Carrefour in June 2012, Plassat has led a recovery focused on price cuts, accelerating expansion into convenience shops and renovating stores. The 68-year-old, credited with saving Carrefour from a possible break-up, leaves a group which has progressed in most of Europe and in Brazil, its second-largest market. But a more sluggish performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has hampered the stock's performance. In March, Carrefour reported its first fall in operating profit since 2012. For some, Bompard ticks many boxes for the task ahead, with a track record of cutting costs and growing online operations - both of which could be central to reviving French hypermarkets.  FILE PHOTO: Alexandre Bompard, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Fnac, attends the company's 2015 annual results presentation in Paris, France, February 18, 2016.Benoit TessierShares in Fnac, which Bompard has led since January 2011, have nearly tripled in value since their stock market listing in 2013. And if radical action is needed, the avid Twitter user with a fascination for the French World War II resistance movement, will not shy away, those who know him say.  His image with the market changed with the Darty deal. He beat a large company, showing swift decision-making and daring,  said French businessman and political adviser Alain Minc. 'No Limits' Arnaud Lagardere, owner of the Europe 1 radio station that Bompard headed between 2008 and 2010 and who shares with him a passion for tennis, said:  He is very friendly but he is not naive. He is extremely resolute and if he thinks he has the right strategy, he will forge ahead, with no limits.  Such determination could be crucial when dealing with Carrefour's powerful shareholders, who include the Moulin family, owner of department store Galeries Lafayette, France's richest man Bernard Arnault, and the family of Brazilian retail tycoon Abilio Diniz. Some at Fnac Darty, however, are more critical of Bompard, disappointed that a highly paid boss is leaving with the integration of the two merged companies far from complete.  He is a man in a hurry and demanding,  said Philippe Coutanceau, a representative of the CGT trade union.  We will remember an astronomical remuneration, out of line with the group's size or results.   Fnac Darty shareholders on May 24 approved Bompard's pay package of 13.8 million euros for 2016. At Carrefour, Force Ouvriere union representative Dejan Terglav is cautious:  We will judge him on his actions. He has a reputation for cutting heads. We await his strategy on hypermarkets and new technologies where Carrefour lags,  Additional reporting Gwenaelle Barzic in Paris; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-carrefour-ceo-bompard-newsmaker-idUSKBN18Y0WZ"},

In 2015, the number of electric cars, including battery-electric, plug-in hybrid electric and fuel cell electric passenger light-duty vehicles, was 1 million, the IEA said in a report. Even though that doubled last year, the global electric car stock is only 0.2 percent of the total number of passenger light-duty vehicles in circulation.  They have a long way to go before reaching numbers capable of making a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets,  the IEA said.  In order to limit temperature increases to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the number of electric cars will need to reach 600 million by 2040,  it added. Research and development and mass production improvements are resulting in lower battery costs and this trend should continue, which should narrow the cost competitiveness gap between electric vehicles and internal combustion engines.  There is a  good chance  the global electric car stock could reach carmaker estimates of between 9 and 20 million by 2020 and between 40 and 70 million by 2025, the report said. The electric car market is still concentrated in a limited number of countries. Globally, 95 percent of electric car sales are taking place in just ten countries - China, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.  Last year, China overtook the United States as the country with the largest electric car stock, with around a third of the global total, the report said. Even though battery costs have fallen since 2009, they are still a major component of cost and drive up retail prices. Therefore, financial incentives such as rebates, tax breaks or exemptions are important to support electric car deployment, but they might need to be phased out when electric car costs rival those of internal combustion engines, the report said.

Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) said in a statement the incident occurred during a check on radioactive storage inside a  controlled  room at the facility in Oarai, with no radioactive material leaking outside. Shunichi Tanaka, the chairman of the regulator Nuclear Regulation Authority, in a weekly news conference on Wednesday criticized JAEA for not being more careful and said the level of exposure within the room where the accident happened was  high . Up to 22,000 becquerels of radioactive materials were detected in the lungs of one of the workers, JAEA said. That could potentially expose him to levels of radiation many times higher than most people over the coming decades. A JAEA spokesman who declined to be named said the material in that worker's lungs was plutonium, marking the highest such measurement for plutonium from any atomic accident in the country.  Another company spokesman said measurements of radioactive materials between 2,200 becquerels and 14,000 becquerels were detected in the other four workers. He said some of this may have come from plutonium.  The workers had no (immediate) irregularities in their health, but we cannot deny the possibility of any health impact in the future,  he said. The workers were wearing coveralls, caps, gloves and half-masks. Japan's nuclear industry has been in tatters in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, with parts of the public deeply skeptical about the safety of atomic energy.  Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said in a news conference that he had been told the exposure would not pose an immediate risk to the workers' health.

It has held on to most of its gains, however, with most analysts attributing its resilience to investors still being confident of a Conservative win.  The consolidation is still continuing,  said Martin Arnold, currency strategist at ETF Securities.  I think the market's still thinking there's going to be a majority for the Conservatives and the election result historically has generally been more tied to the leadership preference rather than the actual polls.  Britain's Conservative Party is generally perceived by investors to be business-friendly. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2895 by 0819 GMT. Against the euro, it was 0.1 percent higher at 87.28 pence, investors also awaiting the European Central Bank's policy announcement on Thursday for clues on its stance towards tapering its stimulus programme. One-week sterling-dollar implied volatility, which measures the cost of hedging against price swings in the currency pair, was at 12.8 percent, near its highest levels since Jan. 17, when May set out her Brexit strategy. Despite keeping gains versus the dollar, sterling has fallen 2.5 percent in trade-weighted terms in less than four weeks since polls first suggested a narrowing lead for the Conservatives. U.S. positioning data shows speculative investors have flipped back to betting more against the pound; many hedge funds expect any recovery in sterling will be short-lived, regardless of the election result.  Large majorities are no guarantee that sterling will sustain its gains, and with UK growth stalling, market complacency over the start of Brexit negotiations and positioning now broadly neutral, our bias would be to sell sterling rallies,  Bank of America currency strategist Kamal Sharma wrote in a research note.

In 2015, the number of electric cars, including battery-electric, plug-in hybrid electric and fuel cell electric passenger light-duty vehicles, was 1 million, the IEA said in a report. Even though that doubled last year, the global electric car stock is only 0.2 percent of the total number of passenger light-duty vehicles in circulation.  They have a long way to go before reaching numbers capable of making a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets,  the IEA said.  In order to limit temperature increases to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the number of electric cars will need to reach 600 million by 2040,  it added. Research and development and mass production improvements are resulting in lower battery costs and this trend should continue, which should narrow the cost competitiveness gap between electric vehicles and internal combustion engines.  There is a  good chance  the global electric car stock could reach carmaker estimates of between 9 and 20 million by 2020 and between 40 and 70 million by 2025, the report said. The electric car market is still concentrated in a limited number of countries. Globally, 95 percent of electric car sales are taking place in just ten countries - China, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.  Last year, China overtook the United States as the country with the largest electric car stock, with around a third of the global total, the report said. Even though battery costs have fallen since 2009, they are still a major component of cost and drive up retail prices. Therefore, financial incentives such as rebates, tax breaks or exemptions are important to support electric car deployment, but they might need to be phased out when electric car costs rival those of internal combustion engines, the report said.

The similarly-rated Southern European neighbours are often compared in the bond market, and the difference in their government bond yields used as a measure of risk in the bloc. As the Italian debt agency prepared to sell 30-year bonds later in the day, Italy's benchmark 10-year debt underperformed the rest of the euro zone bond market. While the bond sale may have marginally exacerbated the effect, Italian yields have been rising in recent weeks on political worries, expectations of a move away from extraordinary European Central Bank monetary stimulus and concerns over banking system.  The Italian long-end spreads are being hit by the 30-year deal, but overall it's more the focus on politics that is making the bonds weaker,  said ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder.  The Italian parliament is voting on a new electoral system which means we could have elections in September - that could coincide with the ECB's timeline for normalising its policy,  he said. Italy's Constitutional Affairs Committee on Monday signed off on a new electoral law after the main parties reached a deal which could pave the way for a national election in the autumn. In addition, the ECB meets on Thursday and is widely expected to take a small step towards normalising policy by ruling out the introduction of further stimulus. Italy is seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's current ultra-loose policy. Most high-grade euro zone bond yields were unchanged, but lower-rated southern European bonds underperformed, their yields rising 2-3 basis points. The Italian 10-year yield spread over Germany -- the benchmark for the region -- hit 201.7 basis points on Wednesday, the widest since April 21. The Italy-Spain bond yield spread, at 74 bps, was just 1 basis point off its March peak, when the gap was at its widest since the euro zone debt crisis in February 2012. The move came after the European Commission approved the sale of struggling Spanish lender Banco Popular to Santander as a way of preventing Popular going into insolvency. The quick resolution of this banking issue contrasts sharply with Italy, where several banks are struggling with a bad loans crisis. Rescue proposals are yet to be approved because they may transgress rules preventing a state bailout of banks. The rescue of Banco Popular did not involve state aid.

The 44-year-old is set to be named in the coming days to succeed Georges Plassat, whose contract as chairman and chief executive of the world's second-largest retailer expires in May 2018, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. And according to associates, Bompard has the daring and determination that could help him succeed in revitalizing Carrefour's core business where others have struggled or failed. Last year, the father of three stunned the retail world when as CEO of Fnac he won a bidding war with South African giant Steinhoff for electricals chain Darty to create a French market leader with annual sales of over 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).  Alexandre Bompard made thousands of calls himself. He is someone who will not be easily deterred,  said billionaire businessman Xavier Niel, who knows him well. Since taking the reins at Carrefour in June 2012, Plassat has led a recovery focused on price cuts, accelerating expansion into convenience shops and renovating stores. The 68-year-old, credited with saving Carrefour from a possible break-up, leaves a group which has progressed in most of Europe and in Brazil, its second-largest market. But a more sluggish performance in France, which accounts for 47 percent of sales and 44 percent of operating profit and where struggling hypermarkets still dominate, has hampered the stock's performance. In March, Carrefour reported its first fall in operating profit since 2012. For some, Bompard ticks many boxes for the task ahead, with a track record of cutting costs and growing online operations - both of which could be central to reviving French hypermarkets.  FILE PHOTO: Alexandre Bompard, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Fnac, attends the company's 2015 annual results presentation in Paris, France, February 18, 2016.Benoit TessierShares in Fnac, which Bompard has led since January 2011, have nearly tripled in value since their stock market listing in 2013. And if radical action is needed, the avid Twitter user with a fascination for the French World War II resistance movement, will not shy away, those who know him say.  His image with the market changed with the Darty deal. He beat a large company, showing swift decision-making and daring,  said French businessman and political adviser Alain Minc. 'No Limits' Arnaud Lagardere, owner of the Europe 1 radio station that Bompard headed between 2008 and 2010 and who shares with him a passion for tennis, said:  He is very friendly but he is not naive. He is extremely resolute and if he thinks he has the right strategy, he will forge ahead, with no limits.  Such determination could be crucial when dealing with Carrefour's powerful shareholders, who include the Moulin family, owner of department store Galeries Lafayette, France's richest man Bernard Arnault, and the family of Brazilian retail tycoon Abilio Diniz. Some at Fnac Darty, however, are more critical of Bompard, disappointed that a highly paid boss is leaving with the integration of the two merged companies far from complete.  He is a man in a hurry and demanding,  said Philippe Coutanceau, a representative of the CGT trade union.  We will remember an astronomical remuneration, out of line with the group's size or results.   Fnac Darty shareholders on May 24 approved Bompard's pay package of 13.8 million euros for 2016. At Carrefour, Force Ouvriere union representative Dejan Terglav is cautious:  We will judge him on his actions. He has a reputation for cutting heads. We await his strategy on hypermarkets and new technologies where Carrefour lags,  Additional reporting Gwenaelle Barzic in Paris; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/carrefour-ceo-bompard-idUSL8N1J3108"},

Trafigura, which rivals Glencore (GLEN.L) as the world's second largest oil trader, said its first half core earnings or EBITDA rose 12 percent to $921.4 million, while gross profit increased 6 percent to $1.238 billion, helped by better revenues in the metals unit. Revenues grew 53 percent to $67.317 billion. Trafigura reports results on an October-October basis, so the first half results reflect its performance from October to March, when oil markets saw record low volatility. Related CoverageTrafigura says no impact on gas trading so far from Gulf crisisThe firm said its gross profit margin stood at 1.8 percent versus 2.7 percent in the first six months of 2016 due to  low levels of realized volatility, with prices largely range-bound from December .  This reduced profitable opportunities for trading,  it said, adding that gross profit from oil trading fell by 17 percent from the first half of 2016 to $652 million. Gross profit and margins in oil fell despite total volumes in oil trading rising by 25 percent from the period a year earlier to an average of 4.995 million barrels per day, broadly on a par with Glencore and only behind the world's top oil trader Vitol.  We expect our daily average volume traded for the full 2017 financial year to exceed 5 million barrels per day, compared to 2016 daily average volume of 4.3 million barrels,  Trafigura said, citing its rising role in exporting U.S. shale crude and increasing sales to China and India. Trafigura also said it saw a 37 percent rise in metals and minerals volumes in the first half. As a result, gross profit in the metals division rose by more than 50 percent to $586 million. It said the market showed signs of supply tightness in zinc and copper concentrates while refined metals saw a sharp expansion in demand, with aluminum a particularly strong performer.  In coal, Chinese supply curbs stimulated new import flows, for example from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa, while the iron ore market also showed new signs of life, Trafigura added in its report.  We were able to expand overall trading volumes and gross profit, with refined non-ferrous metals, coal and iron ore all showing strong tonnage growth and non-ferrous concentrates maintaining leading market positions without sacrificing margins,  it said.

Raiffeisen has promised the Polish regulator KNF it will list 15 percent of shares in Raiffeisen Bank Polska, also known as Raiffeisen Polbank IPO-RBP.WA, on the Warsaw bourse by June 30.  But widening losses and a huge portfolio of unprofitable Swiss franc-denominated mortgages led the Austrian lender to delay the listing, sources have told Reuters.  RBI decided to suspend the prospectus proceedings. The investor's obligation to conduct the IPO of Raiffeisen Bank Polska by June 30, 2017, is still binding,  KNF said in a statement.   We are in discussions with the Polish regulator about the IPO,  an RBI spokeswoman said. She declined to provide further details. In late May Raiffeisen met with the regulator, but KNF said afterwards that the commitment regarding the timing of the IPO remained unchanged. Analysts said that the regulator could strip the main shareholder from voting rights in the bank or force it to sell it if it does not meet the IPO requirement.  Michal Sobolewski, an analyst with DM BOS brokerage, said that until now the regulator has not forced any companies to press ahead with an IPO if it would lead to a loss for the owner.

Central European assets were rangebound ahead of key global events on Thursday.      The big events will be the British elections, the testimony of (former FBI Director James) Comey (about last year's U.S. elections), and the ECB's meeting,  one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.      Analysts in a Reuters poll last week unanimously projected that the Polish bank could keep its main interest rate unchanged at a record low 1.5 percent.      According to their median forecast, it could start to lift interest rates in the third quarter of next year. A month ago they had projected the second quarter.      The delay is seen due to recent data showing a retreat in inflation in the region despite an economic pick-up, and dovish comments from Polish rate setters.     The zloty, after drifting to a 2-week low on Tuesday past the psychological line at 4.2 against the euro, was steady at 4.192 at 0828 GMT.     The forint eased 0.1 percent, after disappointing Hungarian and Czech industrial output figures.      Output fell in April by 3 percent in annual terms in Hungary, even though analysts had predicted a rise, while a 2.5 percent Czech decline was faster than forecasts.     Hungary's retail sales growth also slowed in April according to data released on Tuesday.     Analysts said the output fall was at least partly caused by fewer working days this year due to the Easter holidays.     But the sales of cars - the production of which is a key industry in the region - has picked up again in Europe in May, Takarekbank analyst Gergely Suppan said in a note.      A likely pick-up in industrial output is also indicated by PMI indices...,  he said.  Output growth can accelerate to 6 percent this year, due to last year's low base and as new food, tyre and car battery production capacities have stepped in.      The leu marginally firmed, to 4.5655 against the euro, still near last month's 4-year highs.     Romania kept its first-quarter GDP growth estimate unchanged at a robust 5.7 percent. Finance Minister Viorel Stefan said on Tuesday that Romania would scale back public sector wage hikes next year to ensure that it meets budget targets.     The leu's moderate reaction showed that markets remain cautious as the government still plans wage hikes and tax cuts that may boost the the budget deficit.

Banking sources said some banks from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain delayed letters of credit and other deals with Qatari banks after their governments cut diplomatic ties and transport links with Doha on Monday, accusing Qatar of backing terrorism. Saudi Arabia's central bank advised banks in the kingdom not to trade with Qatari banks in Qatari riyals, the sources told Reuters. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment. One banker in Riyadh said that he had received a directive from the central bank that essentially banned further transactions with any Qatari institution, but that the document was ambiguous in some areas, such as how to handle existing syndicated loans, so he would seek clarification.  Qatar has dismissed the terrorism charge and welcomed a Kuwaiti mediation effort. Doha, the world's biggest liquefied natural gas exporter, says it has enough reserves to support its banks and its riyal currency, which is pegged to the dollar. Qatari banks have been borrowing abroad to fund their activities. Their foreign liabilities ballooned to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015, central bank data shows.  So any extended disruption to their ties with foreign banks could potentially threaten a funding crunch for some Qatari banks. Banks from the UAE, Europe and elsewhere have been lending to Qatari institutions. Bankers in the UAE and Bahrain said they were postponing deals until they received guidance from their central banks on how to handle Qatar. The UAE central bank is preparing such guidance and may announce it within a day, the sources said.  We will not take action without central bank guidance, but it is wise to evaluate what you give to Qatari clients and hold off until there is further clarity,  said a UAE banker, adding that trade finance had stalled for the time being. The sources said the Saudi, UAE and Bahraini central banks had all asked banks under their supervision to report their exposure to Qatari banks. Reserves With an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund and its gas exports earning billions of dollars every month, Qatar has enough financial power to protect its banks.  We are watching the financial sector very closely. If the market needs liquidity, the central bank will definitely provide liquidity,  a Qatari central bank official told Reuters. Nevertheless, losing some of their foreign business links could be uncomfortable for Qatari banks because they have been expanding their loans faster than other banks in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. To fund this, they have been seeking loans and deposits from the rest of the GCC. Among large banks, Doha Bank (DOBK.QA) and Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) QISB.QA are the most exposed to GCC deposits, with QIB obtaining a quarter of its deposits from the GCC, said Olivier Panis, analyst at Moody's Investors Service.   We need to look into the maturity of those deposits but if they're short-term deposits, this could expose the banks rapidly to reduced confidence from GCC institutions,  he said. Doha Bank and QIB did not respond to requests for comment. Because of such worries, the Qatari riyal fell in the spot market QAR= on Tuesday to 3.6470 against the U.S. dollar, its lowest level since June 2016, although it later rebounded to 3.6405, almost equal to its official peg of 3.64.  It also fell slightly in the one-year forwards market QAR1Y=, where traders bet on rates 12 months from now. The riyal's drop  is based on speculation , the Qatari central bank official said, adding Doha had a  huge cushion  of foreign currency to support the riyal if necessary. A commercial banker in fellow GCC state Kuwait, which did not sever diplomatic ties with Qatar, said on Tuesday that business with Qatari institutions was continuing as normal. But there were signs that Qatar's financial ties might be damaged well beyond the Gulf. Some Sri Lankan banks stopped buying Qatari riyals, saying counterpart banks in Singapore had advised them not to accept the currency. In Egypt, which also cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, some banks resumed dealing in Qatari riyals after halting trade on Monday, but others appeared to be continuing to limit transactions with Doha. Banks reducing their business with Qatar could lose out financially, but the damage looks likely to be relatively minor. Panis at Moody's estimated under 2 percent of Saudi banking sector assets were related to Qatar and the figure was around 5 percent for Bahrain, while the UAE's exposure was also small.

Egypt last year scrapped a ban on ergot in grain imports after it effectively halted purchase tenders because trading houses refused to participate, saying the ban was an impossible requirement. In its place, Egypt imposed a more internationally standard 0.05 percent tolerance threshold for ergot and restructured its food inspection system, transferring responsibility for strategic agricultural imports from the agriculture ministry's quarantine body, which favored the ban, to the trade ministry. A ruling scheduled for next week will scrap that new system, effectively reinstating the ergot ban, according to lawyers who were informed of the court's decision verbally on Tuesday. The verdict is expected to be formally announced on June 13 and is subject to appeal but must be implemented during the appeal process, said Khaled Ali, one of the lawyers on the case. An agriculture ministry spokesman told Reuters the inspection system for grain imports remained unchanged, as did the permitted level of ergot in wheat shipments - currently 0.05 percent. The trade ministry declined to comment. Return to Uncertainty The case was brought by a group of quarantine inspection employees in their capacity as citizens, not by the body itself, as well as several other parties, including some connected to the health ministry, which also takes part in inspections. The inspectors involved said the new system illegally stripped the quarantine body of its authority and handed it to a trade ministry body ill-equipped to oversee inspections, allowing imports to enter with hazardous contaminants harmful to plant and human health.  All that mattered to us in this, is that this decision, when it was issued, allowed for the entry of things at levels that would harm people – like ergot, ambrosia, and white mould,  said Mohamed Zaki, a quarantine inspector who raised one of the cases. Grains traders have said a zero tolerance ergot policy makes doing business with Egypt too risky given the costly possibility that their cargoes may be rejected upon arrival.   My worry is this decision could lead to a return to uncertainty and even a disruption of Egypt's wheat imports just as the situation has been returning to normal,  one German trader said, echoing the sentiment of several others. Egypt last month purchased about 500,000 tonnes of wheat in tenders held by its state-grain buyer GASC. Turnout among traders has returned to normal following several boycotts last year in response to the zero policy. The current system was imposed by a decree in November that named the General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), which is part of the trade ministry, as the body responsible for inspecting the imports.

The U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said on Tuesday it had launched an operation to capture Raqqa, in an assault that overlaps with the final stages of the U.S.-backed attack to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul.  So similar to Mosul,  Islamic State's capital in Iraq,  the Raqqa campaign is underway. These are critical elements in the ultimate defeat of Daesh but this will be a long term effort,  Brett McGurk said, referring to Islamic State.  They are down to their last neighborhood in Mosul and they already lost part of Raqqa, and the Raqqa campaign from here will only accelerate.

The board of Europe's largest retailer is slated to meet on Friday or Monday and an announcement could be made afterwards, one of the sources said. French newspaper Le Figaro had reported earlier on Wednesday that the Carrefour board could meet as early as Friday. Carrefour, the world's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart (WMT.N), has been searching since October for a successor to Georges Plassat, 68, whose mandate as chairman and chief executive expires in May 2018. Bompard, 44, has led Fnac - which sells books and music - since January 2011. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its stock market listing in 2013. Carrefour and its major shareholders could not be immediately reached for comment, while Fnac Darty declined to comment on the matter. Carrefour shares, which had fallen to 14 euros at the time of Plassat's appointment in June 2012, more than doubled to 32 euros in April 2015 but have since fallen back. Carrefour shares are up by around 1 percent so far in 2017, underperforming an 8 percent rise on France's benchmark CAC-40 index .FCHI. The stock fell 14 percent last year.

Steinhoff, which bought U.S.-based Mattress Firm and Britain's Poundland last year, said operating profit rose to 903 million euros ($1.02 billion) in the six months to the end of March, up from 797 million euros a year earlier. But diluted sustainable earnings per share (EPS) slipped 6 percent to 15.50 euro cents after the firm issued shares to finance the acquisitions, so issued shares rose 15 percent. Steinhoff's Johannesburg-listed shares dipped 2.8 percent to 67.53 rand by 0811 GMT, while its Frankfurt-listed shares fell 3.5 percent.  Excluding the recent strategic acquisitions, the company's retail business achieved total organic revenue of 7.2 billion euros amidst volatile markets and currencies, translating to 9 percent organic growth,  Steinhoff said in a statement. The South African group, which moved its primary listing to Frankfurt in 2015, focuses on thrifty furniture shoppers in developed markets such as Europe and the United States. It also sells clothing and mobile phone airtime in Africa. Geographical and product diversification in a resilient discount market led to solid revenue and operating margins, Chief Executive Markus Jooste said. U.S. bedding retail unit Mattress Firm, with 1,400 rebranded Sleepy's and Sleep Train stores, contributed 1.5 billion euros to revenue. Steinhoff, after phasing out Tempur-Sealy brands at its Mattress Firm stores, bought supplier Sherwood Bedding and announced a partnership with manufacturer Serta Simmons.  Although this creates short term disruption in our business we remain confident that, strategically, this is the best long term strategy for the business in the USA,  Steinhoff said. In Britain, discount chain Poundland was performing better than expected, recording positive like-for-like growth for the first time since December 2014, the company said.

The outburst of discontent in India's heartland farming states of Madhya Pradesh and neighboring Maharashtra poses a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years. Farmers' leaders say the six were shot dead by police during a protest in the central city of Mandsaur, a version questioned by the state government which has ordered an investigation.  We will continue our protest until the government accepts our demands,  said Sunil Gaur of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, or National Farm Workers' Union, which called Wednesday's state-wide shutdown.  The government has complicated the situation by killing six innocent farmers.  Farmers dumped vegetables and milk on the roads when the strike kicked off last week, demanding billions of dollars in debt forgiveness and better prices for their produce. Tension persisted in some parts of Madhya Pradesh, with a curfew imposed throughout the district of Mandsaur where the farmers died, a police officer said.  The curfew won't be lifted until the situation becomes normal,  said the officer, D. Kavita.      Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan appealed to farmers to keep the peace and accused the opposition Congress party of being behind violence that broke out at the protests.  The government is with the farmers,  he told television news agency ANI, a Reuters affiliate.  Some people want to ruin the atmosphere. Stay away from such people.  Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi was expected to visit Mandsaur on Wednesday.  This government is at war with the farmers of our country,  he said on social network Twitter. In the past, ruling parties have lost elections in the eastern state of West Bengal, western Maharashtra and the northern state of Uttar Pradesh after farmers died at the hands of security forces. The Maharashtra farmers' strike entered its seventh day, despite an assurance from Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis that the state would waive distressed farmers' debts before Oct. 31. The prices of fresh produce have more than doubled in cities such as Mumbai, India's main financial center and the capital of Maharashtra. Two-thirds of India's population of 1.3 billion depend on farming for their livelihood, but the sector makes up just 14 percent of gross domestic product, reflecting a growing divide between the countryside and increasingly well-off cities.

Were it the other way round, Britain’s election this Thursday would be even more difficult to call. Both the ruling Conservatives and the opposition Labour party offer businesses bad choices. On balance, capitalists may prefer the incumbent party – if only because it probably lacks the conviction to carry out many of its promises. Labour wants to impose direct costs on companies, while the Conservatives favour indirect ones. A Labour government would bring higher corporation tax, a levy on executives who earn more than 330,000 pounds a year, and a much higher wage bill. The Conservatives would keep their existing promise to cut corporation tax but impose extra red tape including intervention on corporate takeovers and share buybacks, a bigger role for workers in board decisions and more disclosure on the gender pay gap. Economically, there’s less in it. Labour will tax more but also spend more, including a 250 billion pound infrastructure programme that ought to add to growth and benefit companies selling diggers, concrete and construction services. Unless, that is, companies turn tail because of the extra tax and wage burden. Labour’s plan is also weakened by its leadership’s lack of experience in managing the economy. Both manifestos contain poison pills. Labour proposes a financial transaction tax that would crush London’s ability to survive as a financial trading centre. Plans to nationalise energy, rail and mail services smack more of Venezuela than western Europe. The Conservatives will once again try to reduce immigration to below 100,000 a year, while also cutting spending on schools in real terms per pupil, according to an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies – a recipe for worsening Britain’s talent shortage and its weak productivity. And neither party has given a clear sense of what would happen after Britain leaves the European Union. There’s some good. Both parties are proposing that companies be forced to consider stakeholders – such as employees and suppliers – as well as shareholders. The Liberal Democrats, who have almost no chance of winning, have some of the best ideas. They have proposed taxing corporate revenue rather than profit – an intriguing way to stop companies shifting their accounting profit to low-tax jurisdictions – and introducing a land value tax that would offset some of the undeserved and unequal gains of property ownership. As in other recent elections, free markets will be the losers. That’s no surprise. Pressure from shareholders hasn’t resolved issues over excessive pay, the lack of women in boardrooms, or the hardship and uncertainty faced by workers on zero-hours contracts. Assuming more intervention is unavoidable, businesses may prefer a Conservative victory – if only because the proposed meddling is so out of character and much of it will never see the light of day.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Raiffeisen has promised the Polish regulator KNF it will list 15 percent of shares in Raiffeisen Bank Polska, also known as Raiffeisen Polbank IPO-RBP.WA, on the Warsaw bourse by June 30.  But widening losses and a huge portfolio of unprofitable Swiss franc-denominated mortgages led the Austrian lender to delay the listing, sources have told Reuters.  RBI decided to suspend the prospectus proceedings. The investor's obligation to conduct the IPO of Raiffeisen Bank Polska by June 30, 2017, is still binding,  KNF said in a statement.   We are in discussions with the Polish regulator about the IPO,  an RBI spokeswoman said. She declined to provide further details. In late May Raiffeisen met with the regulator, but KNF said afterwards that the commitment regarding the timing of the IPO remained unchanged. Analysts said that the regulator could strip the main shareholder from voting rights in the bank or force it to sell it if it does not meet the IPO requirement.  Michal Sobolewski, an analyst with DM BOS brokerage, said that until now the regulator has not forced any companies to press ahead with an IPO if it would lead to a loss for the owner.  Maybe a solution would be to delay the IPO until authorities eventually resolve the problem of the Swiss francs,  he added. The KNF was not available to comment.

A national election in the UK, a policy meeting of the European Central Bank and a Senate testimony by former FBI director James Comey, due on Thursday, have the potential to boost the appeal of bullion.                 Gold is often used as an investment option during times of political and financial uncertainty.       With the degree of uncertainty around as we head into the latter half of the week, there would appear to be no reason for gold's march higher to peter out,  said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA.      Spot gold        fell 0.1 percent to $1,292.61 per ounce at 0757 GMT. On Tuesday, it rose 1.1 percent to hit its highest level since November last year at $1,295.97 an ounce.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery dipped 0.2 percent to $1,294.9 an ounce.      Some very modest profit-taking from fast money-type traders suppressed gold prices by a dollar or so in early trade, said Alex Thorndike, a trader at MKS PAMP Group.       A U.S. interest rate hike in mid-June should yield a more expensive greenback and pull gold prices lower, OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan said.       At $1,290, gold prices look too rich for our comfort. It has been rallying simply because of safe-haven demand,  Gan said.       Once this driver that underpins the strong gold price disappears, beyond Thursday and till the end of June, expect gold to lose its lustre.       Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, on Tuesday rose 0.49 percent to 855.16 tonnes.

Some 50,000 people have been arrested since the failed putsch in July and around 150,000 sacked or suspended, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Authorities detained the soldiers in raids focused on the central Turkish province of Konya and 32 other provinces, the Hurriyet daily said. Separately, the state-run Anadolu Agency said detention orders had been issued for 128 people with ties to the publishing company Kaynak Holding, which was linked to the Gulen movement before authorities seized it. Hundreds of firms like Kaynak, many of them smaller provincial businesses, were seized by authorities in the post-coup crackdown and are now run by government-appointed administrators. Of the 128 people being sought, Anadolu said 39 people had been detained so far in an operation carried out in Istanbul and seven other provinces. There was no official comment on the detentions. On Tuesday, authorities detained the local chair of Amnesty International and 22 other lawyers in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir for suspected links to Gulen's network, the rights group said. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it. The scope of the purges, which have also seen more than 130 media outlets shut down and some 150 journalists jailed, has unnerved rights groups and Turkey's Western allies, who fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent and purge opponents. Turkish officials, however, say the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt which killed 240 people on July 15.

The dollar has lost more than 1 percent versus the safe-haven Japanese currency so far this week, pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows amid a risk-averse mood, and as weak U.S. data has curtailed expectations for interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday the greenback fell 0.2 percent to 109.22 yen , its weakest since April 21.  Tomorrow’s what is being dubbed as 'Triple Threat Thursday',...an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel, in London. Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony is likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhauling the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year. In Britain, markets are worried that the ruling Conservative party might not get a majority of seats - an outcome seen strengthening Britain's hand in its exit talks with the European Union. Investors had been betting on a solid Conservative win until two weeks ago, when polls narrowed. And while the ECB is unlikely to start to wind back its expansive stimulus programme given waning global inflation pressures, investors will be keen to hear its stance on the euro zone economy. ECB President Mario Draghi said last week that while euro zone growth may be improving, inflation remains subdued and still requires substantial stimulus. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar steadied at 96.649, close to a seven-month low of 96.517 hit the previous day. The euro edged down 0.2 percent to $1.1256 after data showed German industrial orders dropped far more than expected in April. The single currency hit a seven-month high of $1.1285 last week.  Of the three big events on...Thursday, the ECB meeting could be the least disruptive as participants have already had time to curtail their previously hawkish expectations,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo. The Australian dollar added 0.6 percent to reach a one-month high of $0.7555 after data showed the resource-rich economy grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter, dousing fears that its record expansion may have ended. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2900.

Sales in May fell to 87,733 vehicles, while they fell 11 percent to 436,961 in the January-May period, the U.S. automaker said. Despite the weak May figures, Ford sales are  on track  to grow for the second-quarter overall, said Peter Fleet, Ford's Asia Pacific sales chief, in a written statement.  We've strengthened our marketing plan in China for the second quarter, with new and exciting customer promotions for Ford-branded vehicles,  Fleet said. The plan includes a  realigned Kuga (sport-utility vehicle) customer offer,  the statement said, without elaborating. In the automotive industry,  promotions  and  offers  generally indicate price discounting. China's auto market, the world's largest, faces slower growth this year as a tax incentive for small-engined cars is rolled back, with sales rising 4 percent for the market overall in the first four months of the year, according to the latest data available from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Sales at Ford's U.S. peer General Motors have also fallen this year, while Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp's sales growth has slowed. Fleet is set to become Asia-Pacific and China chief for Ford on July 1 in a global management shake-up after the dismissal of Chief Executive Mark Fields as the company's sales come under increasing pressure globally. James Hackett, a former office furniture executive heading Ford's self-driving car unit, was named CEO last month with a slate of other leadership posts also set to change hands. Several key models are reaching the end of their life cycles and dragging on sales, including the Kuga and EcoSport in China's fastest growing sport-utility segment as well as the Ford Focus sedan, said Yale Zhang, Shanghai-based managing director for consultancy Automotive Foresight. Sales of all three models have fallen by double-digits year-on-year for January to May.  From the second half and into next year they will launch some newer generation products and the situation will be better,  Zhang said. A new version of the Ford EcoSport will launch later this year in China, a Ford spokeswoman said.

Shares in the maker of acoustic components ended 13.6 percent higher, helping it make up some of the ground lost since little-known Gotham City Research first accused it of dubious accounting practices on May 11. Shenzhen-based AAC has said that the allegations are groundless. It received support from Anonymous Analytics, also known as a short-seller, which said in a report on Tuesday that Gotham's accusations against AAC were misleading and rated the supplier a  strong buy . Gotham issued a new note on AAC on Wednesday but did not address concerns raised by Anonymous Analytics. Gotham did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Qatar's stock index was roughly flat after plummeting 8.7 percent over the last two days when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties, accusing Doha of backing terrorism.  From a valuation perspective, there is now a good buying opportunity in some companies,  one regional brokerage firm told its clients. Reflecting the political tensions, it did not want to be publicly named. Telecommunications firm Ooredoo, for example, rose 0.9 percent to 95.40 riyals; the mean target price of 11 analysts is 114 riyals, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Tensions are still high and mediation efforts by fellow Gulf Cooperation Council state Kuwait have yet to lead to a concrete solution, so investors will likely remain on edge and the longer it takes for a resolution, the longer it will take for the (Qatari) market to heal,  said a Dubai-based trader. In Dubai, shares of the largest listed real estate developer Emaar Properties surged 6.4 percent after it said it plans to offer up to 30 percent of its United Arab Emirates real estate development business in an initial public offer. Subject to market conditions, funds raised through the IPO would be distributed to shareholders of Emaar. The company said the IPO would be Dubai's largest since its flotation of Emaar Malls, which raised 5.8 billion dirhams ($1.58 billion) in 2014 and was heavily oversubscribed. The Dubai stock index was up 1.3 percent. In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas was up 2.2 percent after the company said it had received $40 million from the Egyptian government towards its outstanding receivables; its current receivables balance in Egypt now stands at $187 million. Most banks were also up, with First Abu Dhabi Bank up 0.9 percent. Saudi Arabia's index barely moved with 29 shares rising and 28 falling in the first half-hour of trade.

Trump wrote on Twitter that his recent trip to the Middle East was  already paying off  and cast an anti-Islamist speech he made in Saudi Arabia as the inspiration for a decision by Arab powers to sever ties with Qatar in protest at what they say is the Gulf nation's support for terrorism.  So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!  Trump wrote on Twitter. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations. Trump later spoke by phone with Saudi King Salman and stressed the need for Gulf unity, a senior White House official said.  His (Trump's) message was that we need unity in the region to fight extremist ideology and terrorist financing. It's important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region,  the senior official told Reuters. U.S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Qatar in a coordinated move with Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), current and former officials in Washington told Reuters. [nL1N1J212U] The United States was not informed of the decision until just before it was announced, the State Department said. Even as Trump applauded the Arab countries' move, the Pentagon on Tuesday renewed praise of Qatar for hosting U.S. forces and its  enduring commitment to regional security.  [nL1N1J3148] Some 8,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed at al Udeid in Qatar, the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East and a staging ground for U.S.-led strikes on the Islamic State militant group that has seized parts of Syria and Iraq. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis spoke on Tuesday by phone with his Qatari counterpart, a Pentagon spokesman said, without disclosing the details of their discussion. [nL1N1J31XF] Trump's tweet appeared at odds with comments from U.S. officials who had said on Monday that the United States would quietly try to calm the waters between Saudi Arabia and Qatar because Qatar is too important to U.S. military and diplomatic interests to be isolated. Qatar has for years parlayed its enormous gas wealth and media strength into broad influence in the region. But Gulf Arab neighbours and Egypt have long been irked by its maverick stances and support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which they regard as a political enemy. Related CoverageHow Al Jazeera covered Arabs severing ties with its backerMorocco airline cancels flights via Doha to Arab states over Qatar disputePentagon says Mattis speaks to Qatar's defense ministerSaudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday that Qatar needed to take several steps, including ending its support of Palestinian militant group Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, to restore ties with other key Arab states, which also cut transport links. [nL8N1J3581]  We've decided to take steps to make clear that enough is enough,  Adel Al-Jubeir told journalists in Paris. He said the  fairly large cost  on Qatar's economy would convince it to change its policies.  The campaign to isolate Qatar disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepened fears of a possible shock to the global natural gas market, where it is a major player. [nL3N1J33A3] Qataris crowded into supermarkets to stock up on goods, fearing shortages. Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping line, said it was unable to transport goods in or out of Qatar because it could not take them through the UAE port of Jebel Ali. Jordan joined the pressure on Qatar, downgrading its diplomatic representation and revoking the license of Doha-based TV channel Al Jazeera. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers a speech during Arab-Islamic-American Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 21, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoMediation and Consequences White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the United States is communicating with all the parties in the Middle East  to resolve issues and restore cooperation  over the Qatar dispute.     The U.S. still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, in keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing and extremism.   Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah flew to Saudi Arabia for talks with King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi and Kuwaiti state media reported, but gave no details on the discussions.  Russian President Vladimir Putin told Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in a phone call that crisis situations should be solved by political and diplomatic means,  in dialogue , the Kremlin said. The rift has affected global oil prices, hit travel plans and sown confusion among businesses. Slideshow (9 Images)Saudi Arabia's central bank advised banks in the kingdom not to trade with Qatari banks in Qatari riyals, banking sources said. [nL8N1J30TV] Oil prices fell on concern that the rift would undermine efforts by OPEC to tighten output. [nL3N1J313I] Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV that Qatar would not retaliate, hoping Kuwait would help resolve the dispute.  We are willing to sit and talk,  he told CNN later, and said his country was  protecting the world from potential terrorists . A Qatari official said the rift was pushing Doha in the direction of leaving the six-state Gulf Cooperation Council,  with deep regret . The split among the Sunni Muslim states erupted last month after the summit of Muslim leaders in Saudi Arabia, where Trump denounced Shi'ite Muslim Iran's  destabilising interventions  in Arab lands, where Tehran is locked in a tussle with Riyadh for influence. Bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas. [nL8N1J23EL] [nL1N1J20M6] Traders on global markets worried that Riyadh's allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond. Saudi Arabia's aviation authority revoked the license of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to be closed within 48 hours. Qatar's stock market slid to its lowest close since January 2016 and the Qatari riyal came under pressure. [nL8N1J32DJ] Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said isolating Qatar, including the use of sanctions, would not resolve any problems. The Muslim Brotherhood has close ties with Turkey's ruling AK Party, which Erdogan co-founded. Late on Tuesday, the West African country of Mauritania, a member of the Arab League, severed ties with Qatar over allegations it  supports terrorists , the state news agency reported. [nL8N1J3646]  The state of Qatar has linked its policies ... in support of terrorist organisations and the propagation of extremist ideas , said the statement from the ministry of foreign affairs published in Arabic by the Mauritanian Information Agency.  This has resulted in heavy losses to human life in these Arab countries, in Europe and throughout the world .

Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly called the June 8 election seven weeks ago, seeking to boost her parliamentary majority ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations and to win more time to deal with the impact of the EU divorce. But the campaign has seen a number of unexpected twists, including the deadliest militant attack in Britain since 2005 and a sharp contraction in May's once commanding lead of over 20 percentage points in opinion polls. Attacks by Islamist militants in Manchester and London threw the spotlight on security, while May was forced to backtrack on a social care policy pledge in a move that pundits said was unprecedented in British election campaign history.  Give me your backing in the polling station tomorrow to battle for Britain in Brussels,  May said.  Get those negotiations wrong and the consequences will be dire.  May has repeatedly said only she can deliver the right deal for Britain and that opponents would lead its $2.5 trillion economy to ruin in the negotiations with the EU. Pollsters expect May to win a majority. But if she fails to beat handsomely the 12-seat majority her predecessor David Cameron won in 2015, her electoral gamble will have failed and her authority will be undermined both inside her Conservative Party and at talks with the 27 other EU leaders. When May stunned political opponents and financial markets by calling the snap election, her poll ratings indicated she could be on course to win a landslide majority on a par with the 1983 majority of 144 won by Margaret Thatcher. But May's poll lead has shrunk over the past three weeks. Latest polls put her party anywhere between 12 to 1 point ahead. One projection said she would win a majority of 64 seats. There are at least 5 opinion polls expected before polling stations open at 0600 GMT on Thursday. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a radical socialist once written off by many as a no-hoper leading his party to its worst election defeat, has run a strong campaign. May and her husband Philip were greeted with jeers of  Vote Labour  as they visited a London meat market on Wednesday. Shadow of Attacks The last week of campaigning has been held in the shadow of an attack by three Islamist militants who on Saturday drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before heading towards bars and restaurants, slitting throats and stabbing people, killing seven people and injuring dozens. Corbyn has put the Conservatives on the back foot over the issue of security, critcising May for a drop in police numbers in her time as interior minister. May hit back with a pledge to crack down on Islamist extremism and strengthen police powers.  If human rights laws get in the way of doing these things, we will change those laws to make sure we can do them,  May said in an interview with the Sun newspaper, which endorsed the Conservative Party. Two of the three London Bridge attackers were known to authorities before Saturday's attack. Italy said it had flagged Youssef Zaghba as a potential risk after he moved to England last year, while Khuram Butt was known to British security services. Police investigating the attack made an arrest in east London on Wednesday. Opponents accused May of undermining the rights of citizens for political gain.  Many people will see it for what it is, which is a rather crass last minute attempt to divert attention from the much more difficult questions around our anti-terrorism policy,  said former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, a Liberal Democrat.

The OPEC member over the years borrowed heavily from political allies including Russia and China, but is now struggling to pay back creditors including bondholders on Wall Street as its socialist economy collapses. The issue is likely to draw attention in Washington, where lawmakers have questioned Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA's [PDVSA.UL] use of a portion of its shares in U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for a loan from Russia because this could leave Moscow with indirect control over U.S. energy infrastructure. Russia's Audit Chamber, in a revision to the Russian state budgets for 2017-19, said Venezuela had not fulfilled its obligations under the Russia-Venezuela intergovernmental protocol from September 2016. That agreement was an amendment to a Russian loan granted in December 2011. The Audit Chamber is responsible for checking domestic state spending, and has published its review on the proposed changes to the state budget for 2017 and further into 2018-19. Venezuela owed Russia $2.84 billion as of September of that year, including missed payments on the debt and interest, according to the 2016 protocol, which was published separately earlier. Details of the loans and the consequences for not paying them on time were not immediately evident.  Venezuela's Oil Ministry and PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Russia's oil major Rosneft has lent its Venezuelan counterpart PDVSA between $4 billion and $5 billion in recent years, according to Reuters calculations. The firm has been gaining ground in Venezuela as the cash-strapped leftist government scrambles for cash.  In its most recent quarterly financial statement, Rosneft confirmed having provided $1.49 billion to PDVSA in 2016, secured by oil supply contracts. Rosneft's CEO, Igor Sechin, in May confirmed that the company received Citgo collateral. PDVSA has also fallen months behind on shipments of crude and fuels under oil-for-loan deals with Russia, as well as China, according to internal company documents seen by Reuters. Rosneft will get 70,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil this year under the most recent loan deal, Venezuela's oil minister Nelson Martinez said earlier this month, without providing further details on the type or time frame of the loan.

The unexpected closure of most surrounding airspace to Qatar's airline and restrictions on travel for its nationals left passengers stranded and forced its high-profile chief executive to bail out of a meeting of airline bosses in Mexico.  It completely surprised all of us,  Alexandre de Juniac, head of the International Air Transport Association, said after overseeing the meeting of around 200 airlines. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday over its alleged support for militants. Transport links closed.  Plunged into a diplomatic row for the second time in three years, Qatar Airways was forced to reroute dozen of flights through Iranian airspace as the world's second-richest nation per capita found itself almost boxed in by no-fly restrictions. It was a dramatic reversal for the once unstoppable carrier, which has splashed tens of billions of dollars on jetliners and clashed with U.S. rivals over its breakneck expansion.  The whole business model is based on being a hub. They have invested in the airport, invested in state-of-the-art aircraft. They are losing a key source of (traffic) feed from major local markets,  British aviation consultant John Strickland said.  With the overflight ban, it is not only a headache to reroute some of the operation, but it will make flights longer due to more circuitous routes. It adds time and cost and disrupts the schedule in terms of making connections.  Shift to Other Carriers  Some demand may shift to other carriers, he said. IATA delegates said European carriers and Turkish Airlines could benefit, as well as UAE heavyweights Emirates and Etihad. Disarray between Gulf allies left the region's wider aviation growth looking vulnerable in the eyes of some industry watchers and laid bare political complexities underpinning the diversification from oil into an East-West transit point.  It has been a reality that they have adapted to and lived with. That said, there has always been a significant concern that this (Gulf aviation) is, if not on a knife-edge, then on a fairly narrow plane,  said Peter Harbison, a former Australian aviation trade negotiator and chairman of consultancy CAPA.  It certainly does destabilize things that little bit further. Do you get to a tipping point? I don't think so.  IATA, whose members include national carriers of all the affected states, was reluctant to wade publicly into the row.  Nations all over the world can close their borders and close or open their (airspace). But we would like the normal connectivity to be re-established, the sooner the better,  de Juniac said. While air travel between nations is governed by bilateral pacts, the right to overfly another country for civil transport is enshrined in international law through a 1944 transit accord. However, Saudi Arabia is not a member of the treaty, which calls for disputes to be settled through negotiation before exercising the right to close airspace for limited reasons. Fragmented Airspace The decision to isolate Doha came as Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker mingled with IATA members late on Sunday in Cancun. He left overnight by business jet, delegates said. The move sent aviation officials from Montreal to Geneva and the Gulf scrambling to understand the ban and find routings through fragmented airspace, a step akin to threading a needle. IATA said last week Gulf airlines had already seen traffic curtailed in April by U.S. and UK bans on electronics in cabins of flights from some Middle East and North African nations.  I think one can read too much into a short-term event,  said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of Aercap (AER.N), one of the world's largest leasing companies and aircraft owners.  Global travel is resilient. We have been through so much in the last decade: Russia, Brazil, Eurozone crisis, Turkey.    Having said that, a lot of capacity has been going into the Gulf region. Some carriers in the Gulf recognized about a year and a half ago that there wasn't an endless growth model of 15 percent a year.  That could have consequences for the timing of deliveries of dozens of wide-body jets on order from Airbus and Boeing.      They will be deferred and the market will come back into balance,  Kelly predicted. Iran Joins Iata Board The row placed Qatar and its outspoken airline boss in the unusual position of responding to events outside his control. The region's shifting dynamics were also reflected by the election of the head of IranAir to IATA's board for the first time since at least before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Qatar has friendlier ties with Tehran than most neighbors including Saudi Arabia, where President Donald Trump last month called on Muslim states to stand united against Iran. The undercurrent of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has ordered 200 Western jets under a deal with major powers, is seen as key to the stability of the region and could spill over to air travel demand, aviation experts said.  For the first time, it's very clear Iran does have a chance to come back into the fold and that is part of the things that are creating new tension in the Middle East,  said Robert Martin, head of Singapore lesssor BOC Aviation 2588.HKX.

The developer, whose interests span hotels, entertainment and shopping mall operations, said the decision to list in Dubai would maximize value for shareholders, and is in line with its strategy to make its businesses separate listed companies. The company floated Emaar Malls in 2014, valuing the business at 37.7 billion dirhams ($10.27 billion).  As Emaar's other businesses have grown and expanded, we wanted to ensure that investors who value the UAE Real Estate Development business the most, the foundation of Emaar’s success, can do so directly,  Emaar's chairman Mohamed Alabbar said in a statement published on the Dubai bourse's website.    This will ensure that the value of this business is properly recognized.   If successful, the UAE real estate development business will be the DFM's first new listing in two and a half years. The last IPO on the DFM was by DXB Entertainments (DXBE.DU), which began trading in December 2014. The decision to hive off the unit came after an internal review of Emaar's asset values, Emaar said. Subject to market conditions, funds raised through the sale of equity would be distributed to shareholders of Emaar Properties, it added.  What he's trying to do is realize the future value of this company now,  said Mohammed Ali Yasin, CEO of Abu Dhabi's NBAD Securities.  What he is saying is that Emaar in parts is worth more than the sum of those parts in one share,  he added. Alabbar had promised shareholders  special dividends  in 2017 at Emaar's annual general meeting in April, Yasin said. The company said in April that its hospitality unit will be listed at an appropriate time depending on business requirements and market conditions.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is probing whether NSE employees gave some algorithmic and high-frequency traders preferential access to NSE servers. The investigation is delaying NSE's planned initial public offering, expected to be worth up to $1 billion, and the sources said the bourse wanted to settle the issue and move on. NSE disclosed in December it had hired a consultancy firm to look into the matter, but the consultants had been unable to prove collusion between brokers and NSE employees. Local media reported last week that the regulator had sent notifications to several NSE employees, requesting more information. SEBI has not publicly spoken about the case, leaving unclear where the probe stands. The sources said NSE officials were keen to move ahead with the IPO, and said the exchange would be willing to settle, without admitting wrong-doing, and accept a penalty. The exchange filed for the listing in December but has yet to gain the regulator's approval.  A mechanism is being worked out to reach a settlement with SEBI, but a penalty is inevitable,  said one of the sources. Both sources declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the talks. Emails to NSE and SEBI went unanswered. As part of its disclosure in December, NSE said it had set aside all revenue from the related servers for the past 2-1/2 years amounting to 13.1 billion rupees ($192 million), or close to 30 percent of its total revenues during that period. NSE's foreign shareholders, keen for an exit, have been pushing the bourse for a faster listing for more than a year and the timing of the IPO had caused friction in the past. The second source said top investors were looking for  certainty and clarity  on the issue and added that they understand that the matter is  not really under our control.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is under pressure to bolster regional gas supplies after barring all onshore gas drilling, as the southeast Australian state looks to save manufacturing jobs threatened by soaring energy prices.      LNG exports from northeastern Australia - particularly the Gladstone LNG plant run by Santos Ltd - have been pulling gas out of the domestic market, and the nation's energy market operator warned earlier this year that without new supply, the local market could face a shortfall by late 2018.  The two other export plants in northeastern Australia are Queensland Curtis LNG, run by Royal Dutch Shell, and Australia Pacific LNG, run by ConocoPhillips.  To help avert gas and power cuts, the state government said it is studying the development of an LNG import facility with AGL, most likely a floating terminal off the coast of Victoria.   An LNG terminal would allow the eastern market to bring in lower cost global gas or lower cost gas from WA (Western Australia),  the government said in an emailed statement.     The state said it would be cheaper to transport LNG by ship to a terminal near a major demand center like Melbourne than transporting it by pipeline from the Cooper Basin in South Australia or Queensland state further north.  Andrews plans to take the proposal to a meeting with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and state leaders on Friday.  AGL has said it aims to decide by June 2018 whether to go ahead with an LNG import terminal, which it has estimated would cost between A$200 million and A$300 million ($150 million and $230 million). An AGL spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the state's role in the project.

The developer, whose interests span hotels, entertainment and shopping mall operations, said the decision to list in Dubai would maximize value for shareholders, and is in line with its strategy to make its businesses separate listed companies. The company floated Emaar Malls in 2014, valuing the business at 37.7 billion dirhams ($10.27 billion).  As Emaar's other businesses have grown and expanded, we wanted to ensure that investors who value the UAE Real Estate Development business the most, the foundation of Emaar’s success, can do so directly,  Emaar's chairman Mohamed Alabbar said in a statement published on the Dubai bourse's website.    This will ensure that the value of this business is properly recognized.   If successful, the UAE real estate development business will be the DFM's first new listing in two and a half years. The last IPO on the DFM was by DXB Entertainments (DXBE.DU), which began trading in December 2014. The decision to hive off the unit came after an internal review of Emaar's asset values, Emaar said. Subject to market conditions, funds raised through the sale of equity would be distributed to shareholders of Emaar Properties, it added.  What he's trying to do is realize the future value of this company now,  said Mohammed Ali Yasin, CEO of Abu Dhabi's NBAD Securities.  What he is saying is that Emaar in parts is worth more than the sum of those parts in one share,  he added. Alabbar had promised shareholders  special dividends  in 2017 at Emaar's annual general meeting in April, Yasin said. The company said in April that its hospitality unit will be listed at an appropriate time depending on business requirements and market conditions.

The exit came shortly after Hyundai reported that its U.S. sales dropped 15.5 percent in May versus a 1 percent drop in the overall market, making it the worst performer among auto sellers in the United States.  Hyundai has struggled to maintain sales momentum in recent years, dogged by its heavy reliance on sedans, which have been losing ground to sport utility vehicles.    Hyundai's top U.S. executive Dave Zuchowski quit in December. Hyundai also replaced its sales chief in South Korea and its China head last year after the company, along with affiliate Kia Motors (000270.KS), posted its first annual global sales fall in nearly two decades.  Hyundai has still not named a successor to Zuchowski, with interim leader W. Gerald Flannery overseeing the automaker's operations in its second-biggest market after China.   Hyundai is struggling with sliding China sales as political tensions exacerbated its image in the world's top market.   The automaker said on Wednesday that it will boost technology partnerships with China's internet giant Baidu (BIDU.O) in connected cars, a day after it announced the hiring of former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) executive Simon Loasby as its China design head.

Shares in PPC have fallen more than 26 percent since May 2016, when S&P; cut the company's long- and short-term South African national scale corporate credit ratings to zaBB- and zaB respectively and placed all credit ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications.  PPC endured a challenging financial year, while still delivering on a number of key initiatives and projects during the year. Our results were impacted by a liquidity crisis precipitated by an unexpected S&P; debt downgrade,  said chief executive Darryll Castle. The downgrade resulted in a higher interest charge and tax rate as well as  abnormal  finance costs related to a liquidity guarantee facility. PPC, which is negotiating a possible merger with rival Afrisam, said headline earnings per share fell to 7 cents from 107 cents in the comparable period the year before. Shares in PPC were down 2.9 percent to 5.43 rand at 0719 GMT. Group revenue rose 5 percent to 9.6 billion rand ($748 million), supported by the  rest of Africa  cement business, while the group's core profit or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization decreased 13 percent. PPC, which makes 70 percent of its revenue from South Africa, said sales volumes rose by 2 percent in its local market. In a challenging financial year, PPC completed a number of its projects as it looks to diversify its portfolio. The company, which has pushed deeper into the rest of Africa as profit has slumped in its domestic market, said the commissioning of a Zimbabwe mill and projects in Ethiopia and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) increased its cement capacity by 33 percent to 11.4 million tonnes per annum.  I believe we have reached the bottom of the pricing cycle in South Africa and am looking forward to the ramp up of our new operations in the DRC, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe which will grow our operating base and further diversify our earnings,  Castle said. PPC said the group and Afrisam were currently  conducting due diligence work related to a possible merger of the two entities  and no definitive conclusions had been reached. $1 = 12.8423 rand Reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Sunil Nair and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ppc-results-idUSL8N1J40KE"},

The exit came shortly after Hyundai reported that its U.S. sales dropped 15.5 percent in May versus a 1 percent drop in the overall market, making it the worst performer among auto sellers in the United States.  Hyundai has struggled to maintain sales momentum in recent years, dogged by its heavy reliance on sedans, which have been losing ground to sport utility vehicles.    Hyundai's top U.S. executive Dave Zuchowski quit in December.

China on Tuesday rejected a call from the U.S. State Department for the release of the activists saying they were being investigated on suspicion of interfering with a company's  normal operation and production activities  and the illegal use of  professional surveillance equipment . The Paper, a Shanghai city government-backed newspaper, reported that police had found that the three got into  a certain factory  in Ganzhou city by applying for jobs there, after  receiving another person's prompting .  They used specially bought hidden camera watches, professionally gathered internal documents on the factories' production, hiring and salary standards as well as other industrial secrets, furthermore supplying these to relevant overseas organizations, with the purpose of obtaining funding support,  the Paper cited police as saying. Neither the newspaper nor the foreign ministry identified the factory, nor did they mention any link to the Ivanka Trump brand, but the U.S.-based China Labor Watch organization said the three - Li Zhao, Su Heng and Hua Haifeng - had been looking into conditions at factories that produce shoes for the daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump and other Western brands. The newspaper said Su and others had admitted to using job applications to  infiltrate  factories across the country to provide pictures of production to foreign organizations since 2010. Authorities have not announced what charges the three might face but the newspaper said they were being held on the charge of illegally using hidden recording and filming devices. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday the case would be handled in accordance with the law and no country had the right to interfere in the judicial process. On Monday, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department said labor activists have helped U.S. companies understand conditions in their China supply chains,  which can be essential in fulfilling their own responsibilities and holding Chinese manufacturers accountable under Chinese labor laws . A man who answered the telephone at the Ganzhou city police department declined to comment, saying he was not familiar with the case. Hua's lawyer, Wen Yu, also declined to comment. Deng Guilian, Hua's wife, told Reuters she was not aware of the specifics of the case, though said her husband had told her he was not being mistreated. China Labor Watch said Hua and Li had worked covertly at a shoe factory owned by the Huajian Group in the city of Dongguan. Su had worked at a related factory in Ganzhou, the group said. Both factories produced Ivanka Trump-branded shoes, China Labor Watch said. The investigators had discovered evidence that workers' rights had been violated, it said.

The British firm, which is betting on new drugs for cancer and other diseases to revive its fortunes, has sold or licensed out a raft of aging products recently. Some analysts have criticized the trend for unduly propping up its earnings. Grunenthal will acquire global rights to Zomig in all markets outside Japan, paying AstraZeneca $200 million upon completion of the deal. AstraZeneca will also receive up to $102 million in future milestone payments.  In 2016, AstraZeneca's revenue from Zomig outside Japan was $96 million. The two companies added that Impax Pharmaceuticals, which had previously licensed rights to the drug in the United States, would  continue to sell Zomig in that market. For Grunenthal - best-known as the company that initially developed thalidomide as a morning sickness drug - the acquisition builds up its growing business in pain products. Chief Executive Gabriel Baertschi said it was an important step in reaching the group's ambition to become a company with 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) of sales by 2022. Sales in 2016 totaled around 1.4 billion euros.

Indonesia and the Philippines are ramping up shipments of nickel ore after Indonesia relaxed an ore export ban earlier this year and a hardline Filipino environmentalist was ousted from the country's mining ministry. Nickel ore is popular as a cheaper alternative to refined metal for China's vast steel mills, which use the metal to add strength to stainless steel. The renewed supply comes as the market is already struggling with softening demand and high stocks, leading a slew of banks to slash their forecasts despite prices having already fallen 60 percent since mid-2014 80 percent from their 2007 peak. Citi recently told clients that for the first time in 10 years it saw little chance of a rally in the short, medium or long term.      Miners have been holding on as long as they can. They will be close to running out of wiggle room in terms of cutting costs,  said Mark Pervan at consultancy AME Group in Sydney.   We need to see some reasonably sized refined capacity cutbacks to restore prices and confidence back to the market.  Consultant Wood Mackenzie estimates that more than half of the world's nickel industry is running at a loss. High cost mines include those in the Dominican Republic, Greece, Cuba, Western Australia and New Caledonia, analysts said. Brazil's Vale has already said that it plans to suspend two of its older high-cost Canadian mines this year.  Prices have persisted for some time now and our focus throughout this period has been on reducing costs and improving performance throughout our operations globally,  Vale spokesman Cory McPhee said. New Caledonia, home to three of the world's top-10 projects, is one of the highest cost producers.  Christel Bories, CEO of France's Eramet said recently that losses at its Societe Le Nickel (SLN) operations were  not sustainable , while Vale NC, a branch of Brazil's Vale, said its Q1 cost of production stood at $11,232, well above the LME nickel price around $8,890. The French government, however, has supported both mines with state loans, aimed at protecting jobs. Some mines, such as the Falcondo ferronickel plant in the Dominican Republic, exited the market when prices last dipped.  That mine since returned under new ownership. Mines built during periods of high prices could be the first on the chopping block, while some operations could be wound down ahead of their expected closure dates, said analysts. However, an impediment to closure was that many mines are run by diversified mining companies that derive most of their revenue from other minerals.  In Australia we see the likes of Leinster and Long coming to end of mine life, in 2017 and 2018 respectively, so operations like these could close earlier,  Wood Mackenzie analyst Angela Durrant said. Both BHP's Leinster mine, part of its Nickel West operations, and Independence Group's Long mine are situated in Western Australia. Independence Group, which also mines gold and copper, was not available for comment but has said previously it wants to expand its Long project.        BHP has said Nickel West is not part of its core portfolio, but chief commercial officer, Arnoud Balhuizen, said this month the miner was still running the Nickel West business for value.

According to two of the people, The Temer administration ordered management at Caixa not to refinance existing credit lines to J&F; Investimentos SA, a holding company controlled by Brazil's Batista family. Members of the Batista family offered prosecutors proof last month that Temer allegedly worked to obstruct a major corruption probe. One of the unnamed sources, who is a senior Temer government official, said under the condition of anonymity that ordering Caixa to stop doing business with J&F; was in retaliation for accusations that Joesley Batista, a family member and then J&F;'s chairman, made against Temer. Joesley Batista secretly taped a conversation in which Temer appeared to condone bribing a potential witness. J&F; controls JBS SA, the world's No. 1 meatpacker, and several companies in the fashion, dairy, pulp and banking industries. Caixa is J&F;'s largest creditor with outstanding loans worth 9.7 billion reais ($3 billion), a third person said. Caixa has set aside extra capital to reclassify some of the loans to J&F;, after deeming them riskier than before, the same person said. The extra provisioning came after Caixa asserted control of unspecified collateral put forth by J&F; for a merger financing loan it took two years ago, the person added. The situation underscores the discretionary way in which state lenders are run in Brazil, and how borrowers are exposed to retaliation if they fall out of grace with the government. Caixa was used as a policy tool by Temer's predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, sparking heavy loan losses because of reckless lending and risk-taking decisions. Caixa said it made extra provisions related to J&F;, but did not elaborate on the reasons for the move. J&F; declined to comment.  Temer's office said in an emailed statement to Reuters that  state banks take actions based exclusively on technical criteria,  noting that  decisions based on other criteria than that count with no authorization from the president's office.  Brazil's Federal Supreme Court released plea bargain testimony on May 19 accusing Temer and his two predecessors of receiving bribes, the most damaging development yet in the nation's biggest ever corruption probe. Surprising Move At the core of the decision to restrict Caixa's business with J&F; is a 2.7 billion-real loan that the Batista family took late in 2015 to buy a controlling stake in apparel and fashion branding firm Alpargatas SA (ALPA4.SA), the people said.  Losing Caixa as a key creditor means the Batistas will have to resort to other lenders or sell assets to raise cash for a heavy repayment calendar over the next year. One of the people said that companies controlled by J&F;, excluding JBS, have about 14 billion reais of debt maturing over the next 12 months. Analysts including JPMorgan Securities's Natalia Corfield have said that recent political and economic turmoil in Brazil risks slowing Caixa's efforts to reduce defaults and provisions. Caixa's surprising move also set off warning signs among other banks that are also lenders to J&F;, one of the people said. By winning control of more guarantees, Caixa raced ahead of other lenders and has a smaller chance of undertaking loan losses if J&F; defaults, the same person added.  In a statement, J&F; said it  does maintain long-term relationships with financial institutions,  refraining from commenting further. J&F;, which stands for the initials of Joesley's parents José and Flora, agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion-real fine for engaging in bribery, graft and other crimes. Joesley Batista's plea deal has sent shockwaves across Brazil's political and business establishments, and risks accelerating Temer's ouster from office, analysts said. Most of the fine J&F; will pay, or the equivalent of 8 billion reais, will be divided among Caixa, Brazil's development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL], a state-controlled severance fund known as FGTS as well as two pension funds for employees of state-controlled companies. Reuters reported on May 22 that BNDES decided not to extend any new loans to JBS (JBSS3.SA) or J&F; Investimentos until they signed a leniency agreement with federal prosecutors.  Pension funds and state-run banks invested in or extended loans to J&F; companies in return for bribes paid by the Batista brothers, according to plea deal testimony.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.2 percent, to 3,533.87 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index also advanced 1.2 percent to 3,140.32 points. Hopes that MSCI will include China's A shares in its indexes later this month also whetted investors' appetite for big-cap stocks, with more investment banks predicting a good chance of such a move. Over the past week, controlling shareholders of over a dozen listed companies have called on employees to buy the companies' shares, while promising to absorb any losses incurred if they hold the shares for at least 12 months. Shares in those companies have jumped in response, and the optimism appears to be spreading as investors bet more companies would issue similar statements. Markets watchers said it was not clear if the calls to buy shares were linked to broader efforts by authorities to stabilise money and currency markets in recent weeks. But investors drew some solace from signs that the central bank is moving to ease worries of liquidity stress later this month as banks brace the central bank's quarterly health check. On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China injected 180 billion yuan ($26.49 billion) into the interbank market via open market operations, after providing capital support via one-year Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) loans in the previous session. In addition, an increasing number of institutions are now betting China's A shares will be included in the MSCI's benchmark index. That decision will be made on June 20.  MSCI inclusion is now a real likelihood,  asset manager Robeco said in a report this week.  We think this time there is a real chance of success. With the improving fundamentals and attractive valuation, we are positive on the market outlook.  Stocks rose across the board, with consumer and material stocks leading the rise.

Cano lined a three-run homer over the right field wall in the first inning, his 11th of the season, sparking the Seattle Mariners to a 12-3 victory against the Minnesota Twins at Safeco Field. Kyle Seager also hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs, and Danny Valencia had a three-run double for the Mariners, who won their fourth consecutive game and their eighth out of nine. The Twins, who lead the American League Central, lost for just the seventh time in 24 road games this season.  It felt really good,  said Cano, who was just 3-for-18 in the first five games of the Mariners' current 11-game homestand despite hitting the ball hard several times. On Sunday, Cano hit what appeared to be a two-run double down the right field line against Tampa Bay. However, the ball hit the umpire and rolled back toward the first baseman, who stepped on the bag for the out.  That's how you know you're not going good,  Cano admitted.  But even with those things, I never let my confidence get down.  Related CoveragePreview: Twins at MarinersSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchSaid Mariners manager Scott Servais:  (Cano) probably should have had five or six hits the last series, he was just hitting them right at people. You hit it over the fence, they can't get it.  Seattle left-hander James Paxton (5-0), making his second start since a stint on the disabled list caused by a left forearm strain, allowed three runs on five hits in five innings. He walked three and struck out four. Paxton, who hadn't allowed a run in five of his previous seven starts this season, faced the minimum number of batters through the first three innings, thanks to a double-play ball in the third. Staked to a five-run lead, Paxton ran into a bit of trouble in the fourth. Brian Dozier led off the inning with a sky-high homer down the left field line that just cleared the fence. It was his ninth home run of the season. An out later, Miguel Sano lined a double into the right-center-field gap. Sano moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on a fielder's choice to make it 5-2. Paxton admitted he might have gotten out of sync with the Mariners' offense spending so much time at the plate.  The guys were swinging it great, and we had some big innings there,  he said.  I just burned myself out mentally trying to stay up (between innings). It's something to learn from.  The Mariners pulled away with a seven-run fifth -- with all the runs scoring before the Twins could record an out. Valencia lined a bases-loaded double into the left-center-field gap off Randy Rosario, and Seager hit his sixth homer of the season to right off Alex Wimmers to make it 12-2. Seager had a chance to add to his big night in the eighth when he faced Minnesota catcher Chris Gimenez, a former Mariners teammate, who made his fourth mop-up appearance of the season. Gimenez got Seager to fly out to the warning track in center field as part of a 1-2-3 inning.  He gassed up on me, bumped like 6 mph on his fastball,  Seager said.  He's legit. A two-way guy.  Twins starter Hector Santiago (4-6) allowed just three hits over 2 2/3 innings, but he struggled with his control. The left-hander issued four walks and gave up five runs.  He walked four guys the first three innings, and they all scored,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  That just puts you in a bad spot.  I thought we tried to hang in there a little bit, we made (Paxton) work and got him up close to 100 pitches in five innings, but we just couldn't keep it close enough to make it a very good ballgame after that.  Mariners designated hitter Nelson Cruz left in the fourth inning after hitting a run-scoring single. Servais said the move was precautionary, as Cruz is nursing a tight calf. NOTES: Multiple reports have the Mariners and injured SS Jean Segura close to an agreement on a multiyear contract extension. A report from the Dominican Republic, Segura's homeland, puts the extension at $70 million over five years. Segura, who leads the American League with a .341 average despite being on the disabled list with a right high ankle sprain, is making $6.2 million this year and will become a free agent after the 2018 season. ... Twins SS Jorge Polanco was scratched from the lineup Tuesday and headed home to the Dominican Republic after the death of his grandfather. ... Mariners RHP Felix Hernandez and OF Mitch Haniger both started for Triple-A Tacoma on Tuesday while on rehabilitation assignments. Hernandez allowed five runs on four hits in two innings, and Haniger was 1-for-4 and scored a run against Reno.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED675XUUG9"},

The Nationals right-hander struck out a season-high 14, and Washington defeated the Dodgers 2-1 at Dodger Stadium. Scherzer, the 2016 National League Cy Young winner, gave up an unearned run in the first inning and allowed three hits with two walks in seven innings. Strikeouts accounted for nine of the initial 10 outs he recorded, and he retired the final 10 batters he faced. Scherzer (7-3) threw 105 pitches, 73 strikes. Yasmani Grandal and Cody Bellinger each whiffed three times against him.  Tonight, I had a real good feel for my slider,  said Scherzer, who registered his fifth career game with 14 or more strikeouts and no earned runs allowed, the fifth most all time behind Randy Johnson (19), Nolan Ryan (16), Pedro Martinez (eight) and Roger Clemens (seven).  I was able to throw it exactly where I wanted to, in the zone, out of the zone, flatten it out against the lefties.  It gave (catcher Matt) Wieters back there a lot of options of calling a (pitch). He was calling a great game. We were working with a fastball, changeup off that. And when he gets hot with his fingers, man, it's great to be back there pitching.  Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at DodgersWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchIt marked the 55th time Scherzer has fanned at least 10 batters in a game, the most among active pitchers. He has six such outings this season.  He struggled some early and then he found his control in the middle innings,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.  Boy, he was great. It was a great game to watch, and you know whoever was pitching against him was going to pitch their best game. But Max wasn't going to give up.  Washington reliever Oliver Perez worked a 1-2-3 eighth before rookie closer Koda Glover sealed the deal with a scoreless ninth for his eighth save. After Glover fanned Yasiel Puig for the final out, the two players exchanged words, causing both benches to clear without much of an incident.  Tempers flared a little bit,  Glover said.  It is what it is. I don't have any hard feelings toward him. He was staring at me, and I didn't like it.  Puig wasn't available for comment. A sacrifice fly by Daniel Murphy in the fourth inning was the difference for the Nationals (37-20), who have captured three consecutive wins and are 7-1 during their current nine-game road trip. The Nationals go for a sweep of the Dodgers on Wednesday when right-hander Stephen Strasburg (7-1, 2.91 ERA) opposes Los Angeles ace Clayton Kershaw (7-2, 2.28). Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy delivered a solid effort Tuesday but came up short. McCarthy (5-3) allowed two runs on three hits with four strikeouts and two walks in seven innings.  I'm still really frustrated about the run in the first and making some really bad mental errors there and letting that run score, but from that point on, I felt like the quality was pretty good and I made the pitches I needed to make,  said McCarthy, who is 3-1 with a 2.83 ERA at home this season. The Dodgers (35-25) lost their third in a row.  It was very fun baseball game to watch, two guys going at it and pitching really well,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.  Scherzer is one of the best in the game.  In the first inning, Washington's Trea Turner led off with an infield single and stole second and third. Turner scored on a sacrifice fly by Bryce Harper to give the Nationals a 1-0 lead. In the bottom of the inning, Adrian Gonzalez singled home Chase Utley, who reached on a base hit and advanced to second on a Murphy error. NOTES: Dodgers 3B Justin Turner (strained right hamstring) will participate in a simulated game Wednesday. Turner, who hit in the cage and performed fielding drills before Tuesday's contest, will be re-evaluated following the session and considered for reinstatement from the disabled list Friday. ... Nationals 3B Anthony Rendon, who went 1-for-3 with a walk, has hit safely in 11 of the past 13 games, batting .380 during that stretch. ... The Dodgers struck out a season-high 17 times, the most they have fanned since Sept. 9, 2016, against the Miami Marlins. ... Washington is 21-11 on the road this season, the second-best mark in the National League, trailing the Colorado Rockies (21-10). ...

The British firm, which is betting on new drugs for cancer and other diseases to revive its fortunes, has sold or licensed out a raft of aging products recently. Some analysts have criticized the trend for unduly propping up its earnings. Grunenthal will acquire global rights to Zomig in all markets outside Japan, paying AstraZeneca $200 million upon completion of the deal. AstraZeneca will also receive up to $102 million in future milestone payments.  In 2016, AstraZeneca's revenue from Zomig outside Japan was $96 million. The two companies added that Impax Pharmaceuticals, which had previously licensed rights to the drug in the United States, would  continue to sell Zomig in that market. For Grunenthal - best-known as the company that initially developed thalidomide as a morning sickness drug - the acquisition builds up its growing business in pain products. Chief Executive Gabriel Baertschi said it was an important step in reaching the group's ambition to become a company with 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) of sales by 2022. Sales in 2016 totaled around 1.4 billion euros. Like other recent drug divestments, the Zomig agreement does not impact AstraZeneca's financial guidance for 2017.  Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by Jason Neely","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/astrazeneca-migraine-grunenthal-idUSL8N1J40TS"},

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards trading at 152.90/95 per dollar, compared with Tuesday's close of 152.88/93.  The (importer dollar) demand is there today. There was demand to pay some gas and oil bills, and there aren't much exporters in the market,  a currency dealer said, asking not to be named. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Tuesday. Foreign investors bought a net 740 million rupees ($4.86 million) worth of government securities in the week ended May 31. They have sold a net 41.33 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trade was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. The hospitality and manufacturing sectors are likely to be the worst hit, analysts said. However, dealers said there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance, which could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. Dealers said the aid inflows could help the rupee, but the central bank will have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending, dealers said.

Factories saw their orders slump by 2.1 percent in April after contracts for  Made in Germany  goods rose in the previous two months, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That undershot by a long stretch the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.4 percent drop but followed a slightly upwardly revised increase of 1.1 percent in March.  At first glance, these disappointing April data seem to be at odds with buoyant confidence indicators and are anything but a good start to the second quarter,  said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. But he said the timing of Easter - which fell in April this year - was likely to blame and in the past the sector had ultimately recovered from delays caused by holidays.  Order books are still richly filled to ensure good production data in the months ahead,  Brzeski said. The Economy Ministry said the number of large-scale contracts was below average for April. Adjusted to take account of that, orders overall were unchanged on the month. A breakdown of the April data showed domestic demand decreased by 0.2 percent and foreign orders slumped by 3.4 percent. Demand from non-euro zone countries plunged by 4.8 percent while euro zone countries put in 1.4 percent fewer orders. On the less volatile two-month comparison, orders increased by 1.8 percent but the level of contracts placed in April was 0.2 percent below the average level seen in the first quarter, the ministry said. The data comes after a survey showed factory activity helped push Germany's private sector growth to a six-year-high in May as demand from both domestic and foreign clients, especially in Asia, picked up. The German economy expanded by 1.9 percent last year, the strongest rate in half a decade, as private consumption, state spending and construction increased. That momentum continued into early 2017, with the economy growing by 0.6 percent in the January-March period, helped by higher exports.

Hahn looked toward the scoreboard down the left field line to check on his fastball velocity and saw 93 mph.  That was encouraging,  Hahn said.  I had to peek up there just to see where it was. Once you see that, it's kind of a relief, and it's back to square one and getting guys out.  Hahn came off the disabled list and pitched six strong innings, leading the Athletics to a 4-1 victory against the Blue Jays at the Oakland Coliseum. The A's beat Toronto for the second straight night and will go for a three-game series sweep on Wednesday afternoon. Hahn (2-4) ended his career-high-tying, three-game losing streak and won for the first time since April 19 against the Texas Rangers. He allowed one unearned run on seven hits with two strikeouts and one walk. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at AthleticsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchHe left his previous start on May 23 against the Miami Marlins in the third inning with a strained right triceps that led to a significant drop in velocity. However, after 10 days on the DL and one rehab start, Hahn saw his low-to-mid-90s velocity return, and he got back on track.  Really, really good,  A's catcher Stephen Vogt said of Hahn's performance.  He came out right away locating. Good movement on the sinker today, and his curveball was as good as I think it's been all year tonight. There were some good sliders, too, and he got some ground balls on the changeup as well.  All four pitches working really well for the first time. I was thankful he's back and healthy and feeling good. That's the No. 1 thing.  Khris Davis went 1-for-3 with a double, two RBIs and a run for the A's. Jed Lowrie had two hits and scored a run, Ryon Healy had an RBI double. Rajai Davis and Mark Canha each had a double and scored once. Blue Jays right-hander Marco Estrada (4-4) allowed four runs on seven hits over 5 2/3 innings. He struck out eight, walked one and lost a second consecutive decision for the first time this season. In his previous start, Estrada gave up seven runs on nine hits -- both season highs -- in 3 2/3 innings in a 12-2 loss to the New York Yankees.  Obviously I didn't give the team a chance to win, that's basically it, and not being able to go deep into the game,  Estrada said.  I felt pretty good today, just that last inning kind of got away. It's unfortunate, I was making pretty decent pitches early on. I got a little aggressive the last inning and I didn't make pitches, they hit some hard-hit balls and scored some runs.  The Blue Jays scored three or fewer runs for the fourth straight game and for the fifth time in their past six games. They ended their franchise-record streak of 34 straight at-bats without a hit with runners in scoring position on Josh Donaldson's infield singled in the third, but Ryan Goins was thrown out at the plate by first baseman Yonder Alonso trying to score from second. Donaldson and Troy Tulowitzki each had two hits.  I thought we had some good approaches,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  We couldn't get that big double with someone on base, something like that.  The A's gave up an unearned run in the fourth, but Hahn escaped a bases-loaded jam by getting Goins to ground into a double play. Hahn received plenty of defensive help throughout the game. In the third, Donaldson beat shortstop Adam Rosales' throw to first for a single, but when Goins rounded third and tried to score, Alonso threw him out. Then in the fifth, A's right fielder Chad Pinder -- making his third career start in the outfield -- gunned down Pillar at second base when Pillar tried to stretch a single into a double.  Chad Pinder, I thought that was the turning point in the game,  Hahn said.  I was hoping Pillar was going to run to second because I thought he had a really good shot at him. And then Yonder on another great heads-up play to throw the runner out at home was huge for us.  The A's led 2-1 through five innings and extended their lead to 4-1 in the sixth. Lowrie hit a leadoff single, and Khris Davis doubled him home. Then with two outs, Healy lined an RBI double. After Hahn exited, relievers Daniel Coulombe, Ryan Madson and Santiago Casilla combined to blank Toronto the final three innings. Casilla pitched the ninth, striking out two, for his 10th save. NOTES: Blue Jays 2B Devon Travis was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a bone bruise and cartilage damage in his right knee. He will undergo further testing. He also is dealing with a left hand contusion after being hit by a pitch Sunday. ... Blue Jays RHP Dominic Leone was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo. The reliever began his third stint of the season with Toronto and pitched a scoreless inning. ... Oakland 1B/OF Matt Olson was optioned to Triple-A Nashville. ... A's LHP Sean Doolittle (strained left shoulder) will make his third rehab appearance Wednesday, this one for Triple-A Nashville after two games with Class A Stockton. If all goes well, Doolittle will be activated during the Athletics' upcoming road trip, which begins Friday at Tampa Bay. ...

The board of Europe's largest retailer is slated to meet on Friday or Monday and an announcement could be made afterwards, one of the sources said. French newspaper Le Figaro had reported earlier on Wednesday that the Carrefour board could meet as early as Friday. Carrefour, the world's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart (WMT.N), has been searching since October for a successor to Georges Plassat, 68, whose mandate as chairman and chief executive expires in May 2018. Bompard, 44, has led Fnac - which sells books and music - since January 2011. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its stock market listing in 2013. Carrefour and its major shareholders could not be immediately reached for comment, while Fnac Darty declined to comment on the matter. Carrefour shares, which had fallen to 14 euros at the time of Plassat's appointment in June 2012, more than doubled to 32 euros in April 2015 but have since fallen back. Carrefour shares are up by around 1 percent so far in 2017, underperforming an 8 percent rise on France's benchmark CAC-40 index .FCHI. The stock fell 14 percent last year.

The struggling Asian commodity trader desperately needs to extend a $2 billion credit line this month. But credit and equity investors are betting the company's debts are probably unmanageable, and a bankruptcy filing or some similarly painful fix is likely. Financial institutions have hired lawyers to assess the case for extending the facility to year-end, and consultants to assess collateral values, the Financial Times reported on June 6, citing sources with knowledge of the discussions. The banks have lent using a secured “borrowing base facility”, which offers both cash and the ability to fund trade by issuing letters of credit. Moody’s estimates Noble’s liquidity headroom, of cash and undrawn debt, at $1.2 billion. That would more than cover the $620 million in cash that S&P; says was drawn down. But yet more debts come due next year. And losing the facility would be a serious operational blow – credit is the lifeblood of commodity trading. Noble’s long-running problems began with critical reports by a short-seller and deepened as commodity prices fell. Natural resources prices perked up over the last year, which helped Noble raise fresh debt and equity. But the recovery petered out, after ructions in coal triggered a surprise quarterly loss, and departing Chairman Richard Elman warned it might not be profitable again until at least 2018. Stock and bond investors took the warning. The five-year bonds Noble issued in March are now bid at less than 36 percent of face value and credit default swap prices have soared. Its stock market value has crashed to $300 million, down from a peak of $11 billion in 2011.  That leaves the company's lenders. Some of them are also exposed via a $1.1 billion revolving credit line due in May. They might suffer more by choking Noble’s access to credit now. But if they are to be lenient, they will need to believe last quarter’s slip-up was an aberration and Noble can start generating cash. They will also need to believe new Chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring veteran, can steady the ship quickly, either by bringing in a new investor, or selling off more assets, where previous efforts have fallen short.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Working fast, that's something new, and Ray believes it has a lot to do with his remarkable recent run. Ray gave up one run in 6 2/3 innings, the first run he surrendered in four starts, and with help from Jake Lamb and Chris Owings, led the D-backs to a 10-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday at Chase Field.  I guess it's my tempo and my fastball command,  said Ray whose fastball averages 94-plus mph.  I'm working quicker than I have. I'm not getting stuck in my delivery. Everything is feeling really good. It's almost just get the ball back and whatever (sign) they throw down, I'm comfortable with it.  Ray (6-3) allowed three hits, struck out 11 and walked two. The first of Padres right fielder Hunter Renfroe's two bases-empty homers ended Ray's scoreless streak at 27 2/3 innings, the third-longest streak in franchise history. Ray has given up one earned run and 11 hits while striking out 36 in 30 1/3 innings during a stretch that started with a victory at San Diego on May 20.  It's as good as I've seen, and I've been around some pretty outstanding pitchers,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  When you are doing something for that long a period of time, it is starting become more of a tendency. You are starting to establish yourself at a different level.  Related CoveragePreview: Padres at DiamondbacksLamb added,  He's a stud, man.  Lamb hit a two-run double in the first inning and a two-run single in the second. Owings capped the second-inning rally with a three-run homer for a 7-0 lead. Owings' home run was his career-high seventh, and it helped the D-backs (35-25) break a three-game losing streak.  The big three-run homer was the dagger,  Lovullo said. Lamb has 50 RBIs, second in the National League. Colorado's Mark Reynolds has 51. Gregor Blanco had two doubles, scored three runs and stole a base for Arizona.  To me there is more angles on righties now than there used to be,  Padres manager Andy Green said of Ray's pitching.  He used to work away to righties. Everything is coming in with aggression.  Renfroe's second homer, his 13th of the season, came in the ninth inning. He leads NL rookies in homers and is second with 29 RBIs.  Just really getting regular at-bats and getting up there and seeing pitches and battling,  Renfroe said.  The rhythm has been good, and working hard in the cage, and it is all coming together right now.  Blanco doubled to open the first inning, and Paul Goldschmidt was hit by a pitch before Lamb's two-run double made it 2-0 off Dinelson Lamet, who was making his third major league start. Chris Herrmann walked and Blanco doubled again to start the second inning. Goldschmidt walked with two outs before Lamb singled to center to drive in two, and Owings followed with his homer. Daniel Descalso had a two-run single for a 10-1 lead in the fourth inning, a rally that included three walks and an infield error. Lamet (2-1) was charged with nine runs (seven earned) on five hits and five walks in three-plus innings. NOTES: Arizona C Chris Herrmann left the game in the fifth inning due to right hand soreness. It is not believed to be serious. ... Arizona recalled RHP Zack Godley and OF Jeremy Hazelbaker from Triple-A Reno when OF Yasmany Tomas (tendinitis) was placed on the 10-day disabled list and RHP Braden Shipley was returned to Reno. Godley will start Saturday, manager Torey Lovullo said. Godley was optioned Wednesday, but he is eligible to return because he is replacing an injured player. ... San Diego RHP Jarred Cosart (elbow) was placed on the disabled list after undergoing an MRI on Monday. The Padres recalled INF/OF Jose Pirela to fill the roster spot. ...

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan crept up 0.1 percent, with Hong Kong and mainland China stocks leading the region higher. European stocks are set to mirror the cautious tone with major index stock futures suggesting a tepid start. Japanese stocks were the main laggards as investors lightened holdings after the key index hit a near-two year high last Friday in thin trading. Hong Kong, however, benefited from sustained buying by mainland Chinese investors. All the events scheduled for Thursday are fraught with risk for investors, but testimony by former FBI chief James Comey posed a potential danger to Trump's economic agenda, and perhaps even his presidency.  The market is especially focused on Comey's testimony,  said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. Reports suggest Comey plans to reveal conversations in which Trump allegedly pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Risk-off sentiment pushed government bond prices up and yields lower, while propping up gold and the Japanese yen. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields briefly fell to seven-month lows of 2.129 percent, the lowest since Nov. 10, before recovering to 2.16 percent. The shrinking U.S. bond yields further weakened a dollar, already handicapped by heightened political uncertainty. The dollar wallowed near a six-week low against the safe-haven yen, quoted around 109.44 yen. Sterling firmed to 1.2905 per dollar, but held in a tight trading range ahead of Thursday's vote. Earlier opinion polls suggested the opposition Labour Party were virtually neck-and-neck with the ruling Conservatives, but a poll released on Tuesday put Prime Minister Theresa May on course to increase her parliamentary majority. The euro also held firm at $1.12665 against the dollar. The ECB policy meeting could lead to some discussion of dropping some of the central bank's pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, four people with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters last week. In this high risk environment, gold was in favour, quoted around the $1,294 per ounce. It has gained nearly 7 percent in the past month. The Australian dollar strengthened to a one-month high of $0.7540 after first-quarter growth numbers forced short covering by those investors who had expected a weaker performance. Oil prices remained weak, with Brent crude futures struggling around $50 per barrel, despite tensions between Gulf Arab producers and falling U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures were trading at $50.06 per barrel down 0.1 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $48.12 per barrel, down 0.1 percent.

Russia will showcase four of its 12 World Cup venues, including the scandal-plagued St Petersburg Stadium, in a two-week tournament kicking off June 17 that will feature world champions Germany, the various regional champions and the host country. Russia, now a record low 63rd in FIFA world rankings, have experienced upheaval with three managers in the last two years. But the country hopes to present itself as an able host in a far-flung tournament that will test the security and logistics of its soccer infrastructure. The tournament, held in Moscow, St Petersburg, Sochi and Kazan, is also meant to ensure the 2018 World Cup in President Vladimir Putin's Russia runs smoothly as he faces political isolation over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.  Since clashes between Russian and English fans tarnished the European championship in France last year, Putin has approved legislation that toughens punishments for violence at sporting events as part of a broader crackdown on hooliganism. The authorities say the Confederations Cup's ticketing system, which requires ticket holders to apply for a personalized fan-ID, will ensure that fans are screened and hooligans kept away.   Citizens who have committed gross legal violations during sporting events, demonstrated racism, set off fireworks, broken furniture, tried to start fights, are under our unwinking, constant stare,” Anton Gusev, deputy head of the interior ministry department overseeing security at sports venues, told reporters on Tuesday.  This also pertains to foreign soccer hooligans.  The ministry has blacklisted 191 fans, including 54 spectators involved in a pitch invasion at the Russia Cup final in Sochi, an incident that revived concerns about the readiness of Russian soccer venues to handle crowds. A bombing in the St Petersburg metro that left 16 dead in April also sparked fears that a similar attack could hit Russia during the tournament. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) tried to assuage concerns on Tuesday, saying terrorism did not pose a threat to Confederations Cup participants and spectators. Thwarting Protests A decree signed by Putin last month sparked outrage among Kremlin critics after it imposed tighter restrictions on public gatherings and limited the use of air space and waterways over a 42-day period covering the Confederations Cup. The decree also requires that foreigners be registered with Russian authorities within one day of their arrival in the country.  The limits on public gatherings, which will also be in force during the World Cup, mean that all rallies, pickets and protests unrelated to soccer in the host cities' regions can take place only at times and locations approved by the authorities.  Activists have decried the fact these restrictions will be in place during nationwide anti-corruption protests on June 12 called by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, after a first round of demonstrations in March saw thousands take to the streets. A protester holding a sign that read,  I don't care about soccer, I picket where I want,  was detained last week outside Moscow's Luzhniki stadium, which will host the World Cup's opening match and final, local human rights group OVD-Info said. Pitch Troubles Russia could run into trouble with its venue in St Petersburg, where construction has taken a decade and been marred by delays, corruption allegations and reports of human rights violations. A new pitch had to be laid at the 68,000-seat stadium less than a month before it hosts the Confederations Cup's opening match between Russia and New Zealand, after uprooted chunks of grass spoiled the first match at the new venue.  Even before problems with the grass surfaced, issues with the stadium's retractable pitch technology saw the playing surface vibrate and made it unfit for matches. The authorities have downplayed the lingering issues at one of Russia's most prized venues, assuring that it would be in pristine condition for the Confederations Cup.

The Reserve Bank of India is likely to strike a less hawkish tone while leaving interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting later in the day, according to analysts, as inflation is running well below forecasts and the economy has slowed more than expected.

The benchmark BSE index was 0.41 percent higher at 31,317.09, driven by gains in consumer stocks. Both indexes were headed for a third session of gains in four. The Nifty Pharma index, which had fallen nearly 11 percent this year as of Tuesday's close, gained as much as 1.6 percent to its highest in nearly three weeks. Cadila Healthcare jumped as much as 9.9 percent to a record high after Zydus Cadila got the final approval from the U.S. drug regulator for mesalamine delayed-release tablets.

Wholesalers, housewives and businessmen arrive on motorcycles, weaving their way through blood and feathers to pick up freshly killed chickens. Officers from Indonesia's Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health Services, sporting masks, gloves and aprons with hair tucked under plastic caps, are on their weekly visit to take samples to test for avian influenza, known as bird flu.  As the largest poultry market in Yogyakarta on Indonesia's Java island, selling 30,000 chickens and ducks each day, Terban is a hot spot for bird flu, which spreads through flocks via direct contact with infected birds.  Such markets, together with high population density, massive commercial poultry production and cultural practices such as backyard chicken-rearing, have also made Indonesia a global epicenter for human transmission of the H5N1 strain of bird flu.  Since 2003, this strain has infected 859 people and killed 453 in 16 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam have borne the brunt, with Indonesia suffering the largest death toll, at 167 people.  Scarred by the lives and assets lost in the 2003 outbreak, Indonesia is now relying on local-level monitoring and testing to keep pandemics at bay, working with international agencies including the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  The Southeast Asian country is  endemic  for the H5N1 virus, and outbreaks are still occurring, said James McGrane, team leader of the FAO's Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases in Indonesia.  The bird flu viruses are notoriously unstable, he added.   They change all the time. So we need to ensure that we're tracking the viruses in order that locally produced vaccines are protecting flocks,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The H5N1 virus mostly affects birds, but experts fear it could mutate and spread rapidly between people, triggering a pandemic that could possibly kill millions.  The highly pathogenic virus jumped into humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and re-emerged in 2003-2004, spreading from Asia to Europe and Africa.  New Strains Experts say there are more bird flu strains now, including H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8 and H7N9. Cases involving these strains have been detected in Bangladesh, Britain, China, Hungary, Italy, Kuwait, Russia, Taiwan and the United States.  Indonesia has found no new human cases or fatalities since 2015, but there is no room for complacency, say poultry farmers and experts who witnessed the 2003 epidemic.  Robby Susanto's chickens escaped unscathed but his neighbor's - a mere 4 meters (13 ft) away - were not so lucky. Susanto later found out his chickens were spared because he had used the right amount of disinfectant. Since then, he has received FAO training on keeping his farm clean and protected.   As a farmer I can't speak from a scientific point of view, but that feeling of fear and worry is still there,  he said.  For Bambamg Sutrisno, tragedy struck twice. In 2003, he had to cull 11,000 out of his 30,000 chickens due to H5N1. Then in 2009, he lost more than half of his 60,000 chickens to bird flu and two other diseases.  He has now implemented measures used by Susanto, such as dividing the farm into zones according to bio-security risks, and enforcing strict access and hygiene standards in chicken enclosures.   I used to have outbreaks every two or three years but after 2009, I started getting them every year,  he said.  Since implementing these steps, I haven't had any outbreaks in 18 months.  Twenty cases of H5N1 virus in poultry were detected between January and mid-May this year, said Sri Handayani Irianingsih, a virologist at the government's Disease Investigation Center (DIC) in Wates, where samples from Terban market are tested.  The number of cases usually goes up as the dry season shifts into the monsoon, she added.  Indonesia's eight DICs use an online system to monitor different strains of influenza virus circulating in the country, and advise the government on appropriate strains to use for producing local poultry vaccines. Drug-Resistance  According to the FAO, nearly 20 percent of Indonesian households own livestock, including poultry.  This has given rise to concerns over antimicrobial resistance (AMR), caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which are given to treat livestock more than for human health. In Indonesia, most antibiotics for animals are supplied without veterinary prescription, noted Luuk Schoonman, chief technical advisor for the FAO's avian influenza work in the country.   The World Bank calls AMR  a threat to the global economy , warning it could cost the world up to 3.8 percent of annual gross domestic product by 2050.  The International Livestock Research Institute identified Indonesia, besides Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru and Vietnam, as future hot spots for AMR based on livestock intensification patterns.  By 2030, Indonesia will have increased its use of antimicrobial drugs by 200 percent as poultry production rises, said Schoonman.  In Indonesia, antibiotics are also used in aquaculture, putting it at high risk of AMR, as is the case in Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India and Chile.  Yet most countries are not well-prepared for disease pandemics and are failing to invest enough in preparedness, warned a World Bank report last month.  One key solution is to invest in community health workers. As local eyes and ears, they can facilitate early detection and response to outbreaks, said Tim Evans, the World Bank's senior director for health, nutrition and population.  But not everyone is worried about the threat.  Tulus Riyadi Wardoyo, 60, has been a poultry trader since he was 16, and has never experienced or heard of bird flu cases in poultry or humans.   Since I was a kid, my neighbors raised backyard chickens - I grew up with them. I'm immune,  he said.   This is very good business. It's where the money is,  he laughed, pointing at the chickens outside Terban's abattoirs.

Five-year CDS were at 75.3 points, the highest level since mid-February, compared to 72.4 late on Tuesday and 65.5 at the end of last week, before Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism. Investors are concerned about the possible disruption to Qatar's banking system, which has depended on Gulf loans and deposits to support its rapid growth. However, CDS levels suggest oil and gas prices are in the long run a much bigger factor for confidence in Qatar, the world's biggest liquefied natural gas exporter. Qatari CDS hit a peak of 137 in February 2016, when oil prices were slumping. Qatari CDS imply a default probability of 5.1 percent in the next five years. They are still substantially lower than Saudi Arabian CDS, which are at 90.2. (Reporting by Andrew Torchia)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar-cds-idUSL8N1J40OF"},

But not everyone is worried about the threat.  Tulus Riyadi Wardoyo, 60, has been a poultry trader since he was 16, and has never experienced or heard of bird flu cases in poultry or humans.   Since I was a kid, my neighbors raised backyard chickens - I grew up with them. I'm immune,  he said.   This is very good business. It's where the money is,  he laughed, pointing at the chickens outside Terban's abattoirs.

Qatar's stock index has now plummeted 8.7 percent to 9,059 points, its lowest close since January 2016, since Monday when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties, accusing Doha of backing terrorism.  From a vaulation perspective, there is now a good buying opporunity in some companies,  one regional brokerage firm told its clients. Since the start of the crisis, non-Qatari Gulf shareholders - who often make up between 5 and 10 percent of the market's turnover - and foreigners have have been exiting positions faster than usual, according to Qatar bourse data. Qatar's huge financial reserves mean it can probably avoid a crippling crisis, but many parts of its economy, from tourism to merchandise trade and banks which obtain funding from elsewhere in the Gulf, may be hit. The Saudi Arabian, UAE and Bahraini central banks have not yet clarified how they want commercial banks in their countries to handle business ties with Qatar, which involve substantial cross-border lending, deposits and syndicated loans. If the commercial banks are advised to get rid of their Qatari assets in a short timeframe, or if authorities act against Qatari banking assets in their jurisdictions, that could provoke retaliation by Doha and turmoil in the Gulf banking and money markets. In the meantime, fund managers said that Qatari government- related entities may step in to support the market. Many Qatari companies - especially banks including Qatar National Bank and Doha Bank - are consituents of several emerging market benchmarks, so many foreign investors cannot ignore them. “Overall, it still boils down for investors (abroad) that it is still an oil story – with oil at $45-50, most of the countries will be able to muddle through, and I think another collapse below $40 would raise risks more,  said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. Other stock markets in the Gulf may trade sideways on Wednesday as Brent oil prices have flattened out near $50 a barrel and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has crept up 0.1 percent. Some buying of Saudi stocks, in anticipation of a decision by MSCI on June 20 to begin reviewing Riyadh for possible inclusion in its emerging market index, may continue.

The two-year JGB yield rose 2.5 basis points to minus 0.120 percent, its highest since mid-November. The two-year JGBs have faced headwinds as the Bank of Japan has recently been trimming its buying of bills and shorter-dated debt at regular JGB-buying operations in an attempt to improve market liquidity, which had practically dried up under its extensive easing scheme. Selling by participants making room for Thursday's 2.2 trillion yen  ($20.09 billion) five-year JGB auction also weighed on shorter-dated debt. The five-year yield rose 1 basis point to minus 0.100 percent, its highest since late February. Long-end JGBs, on the other hand, took immediate cues from U.S. Treasuries, which saw their benchmark yield fall to seven-month lows overnight ahead of Thursday's general election in Britain, the European Central Bank's policy meeting, and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel. JGBs further out on the curve were also supported as the Bank of Japan conducted a regular debt-buying operation on Wednesday.

Senzatela (8-2) threw 6 1/3 innings, allowing three runs on six hits. He also slugged his way into franchise history, joining Willie Blair in 1993 and Jorge De La Rosa in 2010 as the only Rockies pitchers to hit a three-run double. It was the first extra-base hit of his career, gave him one more RBI than he had in his first 21 career at-bats and came after the Indians issued an intentional two-out walk to face him in the second. The hit gave the Rockies a 3-0 jump start on their romp.  I looking for a fastball,  Senzatela said.  I just swung, and I got the pitch. That's good.  Reynolds hit two homers, giving him 24 career multi-homer games and his first this year. He drove in a career-high-tying five runs, giving him 51 RBIs. He hit a three-run shot in the fifth that built the Rockies' lead to 8-1 and belted a two-run homer, his 15th of the season, in the seventh to make it 10-3. Related CoveragePreview: Indians at RockiesThe Rockies gave out Mark Reynolds T-shirts to 800 fans clustered in a section in left-center. Reynolds struck out on his first two at-bats, giving him nine strikeouts in five games, before he belted Mike Clevinger's 3-2 pitch into the right-field stands.  A lot of times guys throw hard, you swing underneath it,  Reynolds said.  So I was really concentrating on getting on top of the ball. Plus, I was thinking in my head, too, 'Hey, it's my T-shirt night. I can't punch out three times.  Carlos Gonzalez hit a two-run homer in the third for the Rockies (37-23), who are a season-high-tying 14 games above .500 and 14-6 in series openers. They improved to 9-3 in games started by Senzatela, a 22-year-old who had never pitched above the Double-A level before making Colorado's Opening Day rotation. He walked one, struck out four and faced one batter with a runner in scoring position -- Francisco Lindor, who flied out to end the third with runners on first and second. Senzatela gave up a homer to Lonnie Chisenhall in the fifth and a two-run shot to Bradley Zimmer in the seventh that trimmed the Rockies' lead to 8-3. When Yan Gomes followed with a single, Senzatela's outing ended at and 98 pitches and 68 strikes. He threw 69 fastballs, 23 sliders and six changeups.  The use of his secondary pitches and the mixing of those were probably just as important as the fastball,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  I think he threw more changeups tonight than in any other game. I think the breaking ball was in play, also.  Indians starter Mike Clevinger (2-3) gave up five runs and four hits in four innings.  Early in the game I couldn't find the zone,  he said.  By the time I found it, it was a little bit too late.  The Indians intentionally walked Tony Wolters to get to Senzatela, who lined Clevinger's first-pitch fastball into the gap in right-center.  That was a tough pill to swallow,  Clevinger said.  I don't have many words for that. I just left a fastball over the plate and the pitcher got three RBI.  Indians manager Terry Francona said,  When that happens, I'm kicking myself. I would have probably kicked myself more if Wolters throws a base hit into left and we have the pitcher sitting on deck. Those are things that kind of make you stay up at night.  His eighth win moved Senzatela ahead of Washington's Stephen Strasburg, Arizona's Zack Greinke and Los Angeles' Clayton Kershaw for the NL lead.  That's really good for me and really good for the team,  Senzatela said.  I got a really good team behind me. They play good defense, and they hitting really good. That's nice.

Mike Moustakas went 4-for-5 with a two-run ninth-inning walk-off homer as the Kansas City Royals rallied to beat the Astros 9-7 on Tuesday night.  We never feel like we're out of a game, dating back to three or four years ago,  Moustakas said.  Just doing what we can, keeping the line moving and we were able to do that tonight.  Moustakas hit his team-leading 15th home run with two out off Ken Giles (0-1) after Salvador Perez singled.  We didn't stop and feel like we were out of the game,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.   Guys were continuing to battle. Guys were continuing to compete offensively. You just had a good feeling about it.  Whit Merrifield, who had his 19-game hitting streak snapped Monday, hit a bases-clearing double with two out in the eighth to tie the score at 7 off Giles. Moustakas' single scored Perez for the first Kansas City run of the inning. The Royals trailed 7-1 entering the bottom of the fourth. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at RoyalsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch It's really frustrating,  Giles said.  I didn't make my pitches when I needed to. I let my team down. It's all on me. With my failures it's my fault. I need to do better. I need to make pitches when I need to. They did great. They had a great game. It was just one flaw from me.  The slider wasn't working today. I had great fastball command. I threw the fastball where I needed to. I couldn't put them away with my slider. No excuses.  The Astros had not blown more than a two-run lead in a loss this season prior to the Royals' comeback. Mike Minor (2-1), the fourth Kansas City pitcher, worked a perfect ninth to pick up the victory. Royals relievers Kevin McCarthy, Travis Wood and Minor worked 5 1/3 scoreless innings after rookie Jakob Junis was pulled. On the other end of the spectrum, Astros relievers Reymin Guduan, James Hoyt and Giles allowed seven runs while retiring only five of the 12 hitters they faced in the eighth and ninth innings.  He's thrown a lot of (sliders),  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Giles.  I think any time you show a hitter four or five of them, in an at-bat it's going to educate him a little. It looked like the one that Merrifield hit kind of sat up, backed up a little bit on him. He put a good swing on it. We've seen him put away guys with a lot of sliders in a row. Tonight wasn't his night.  Astros starter David Paulino allowed three runs on eight hits over 5 2/3 innings. Eric Hosmer doubled to open the sixth and scored on a Moustakas single. Yuli Gurriel, who hit a three-run ninth-inning homer Monday, stroked a two-run single in a three-run third. Gurriel laced a single to left, scoring Carlos Beltran and Evan Gattis. George Springer opened the inning with a double to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, advanced to third on Josh Reddick's bunt single and scored on Jose Altuve's sacrifice fly to Lorenzo Cain. The Astros tacked on four more runs in the fourth. Reddick's double scored Springer with the first run of the inning. Reddick scored from second on Carlos Correa's infield single. Beltran's eighth home run with Correa aboard capped off the inning and finished the night for Junis.  There was no doubt,  Beltran said that the Astros would win.  It seems like every time we get ahead in the game we win those ballgames.  Junis permitted seven runs on nine hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings before being replaced by Kevin McCarthy. Alex Gordon homered for the Royals in the third off Paulino, who was making his third big league start. It was Gordon's first home run of the season. The Royals got another run in the fourth on back-to-back doubles by Hosmer and Perez. NOTES: The Royals optioned RHP Seth Maness to Triple-A Omaha to make roster space for RHP Jakob Junis. Maness was 1-0 with a 3.72 ERA in eight relief appearances. ... Astros 3B Marvin Gonzalez will likely miss a couple of games with a bruised left hand.

The front-runner in the Democratic primary, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive and one-time diplomat Phil Murphy, declared victory about 90 minutes after polls closed. Unofficial results posted on NJSpotlight.com showed him with more than twice as many votes as his nearest rival, former U.S. Treasury Department official Jim Johnson, in a six-way race.  I humbly accept your nomination to be the Democratic candidate for governor of the great state of New Jersey,  Murphy said on Twitter.  Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the Republican favorite to succeed Christie, also held a strong lead over four rivals in her party's primary, earning nearly half of the votes cast. Election results showed Guadagno with 47 percent of the Republican vote, followed by state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli in second place with 31 percent. The two primary victors will face off in the general election in November to succeed Christie, a once-rising Republican star whose popularity has plunged in recent years. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding gubernatorial elections this year. Earlier indications were that voter interest in the New Jersey gubernatorial primaries was low.  Murphy, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, significantly out-spent his opponents, loaning $15 million to his own campaign. He was also endorsed by former Vice President Joe Biden and the state's Democratic Party. With Christie frequently out on the stump for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, Guadagno has spent months as acting governor. But she has also had to distance herself from the unpopular Republican incumbent and has sparred with Ciattarelli over her plan to raise taxes on millionaires. While Christie was re-elected with 60 percent of the vote in 2013, his recent approval rating dropped to 20 percent following his frequent absences, the state's 11 credit-rating downgrades and transportation problems.  Christie has also been tarnished by the scandal in which two former aides were convicted for scheming to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 to punish a mayor for failing to endorse Christie's re-election campaign.

South Sudan's civil war, which erupted in late 2013, has uprooted a quarter of the population, shattered families and left thousands of orphans, abandoned children and runaways to fend for themselves in the city. With few options, sex work has become a form of survival for many girls and young women. While there are no accurate figures to gauge the extent of child prostitution in the scrappy, low-rise city, the steady deterioration of South Sudan's security and economy has undoubtedly exacerbated the problem, say humanitarian workers.  Women and girls may resort to exchanging sex for food, shelter, or money to meet their daily living needs for themselves and their families in order to survive another day,  said Jennifer Melton of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF.  South Sudan descended into civil war after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy, unleashing a conflict that has spawned armed factions often following ethnic lines. The United Nations has warned of a possible genocide, millions face famine and an estimated 3.5 million have fled their homes, 2 million of them children.  In December, a U.N. independent commission said sexual violence had reached  epic proportions  in South Sudan and that 70 percent of women in Juba had suffered some form of sexual assault since the end of 2013.   During conflict, parents are unable to protect or care for their children, they get separated and children on their own despair and do not hesitate to use the only asset they have, which is selling their body to survive,  said Cathy Groenendijk of Confident Children out of Conflict (CCC), an organization caring for vulnerable children like Stacey. Groenendijk and her team of social workers, psychologists and nurses have been running a children's shelter in Juba for a decade: a cluster of small buildings behind a barbed wire wall and big metal gate.  Inside the tiny oasis, clothes hang to dry and energetic children play on swings, while older residents ready the younger ones for dinner. The children attend school in Juba and return to the shelter to sleep, eat and socialize.  Stacey, the daughter of an absent father and alcoholic mother moved from her hometown of Terekeka to the capital with her mother and sisters when she was about eight years old.  Life in the village was dangerous and my mother and father were not good because he had two (more) wives,  said Stacey, who did not want to give her full name.  But city life proved even more dangerous.  It was worse, because there are many boys and men who like to do bad things to girls, we were not safe,  said Stacey, who recalls fending off an intruder who broke into her home and tried to rape her sister as she slept. Red Light District Living in poverty with a drunken mother in an unsafe neighborhood, Stacey could have followed other girls in her area and turned to prostitution for a steady income.  Many in the area where I was living (did this),  she said.  Young girls - 12 or 14.  Most of her friends were either forced to marry young or moved to the squalid district of Gumbo, west of the Nile river, where women and girls sell sex to businessmen, traders and foreigners inside dingy metal shacks. Fifteen-year-old Jenna is one of more than 200 women and girls – according to CCC – who live and work in Gumbo's warren of crowded, unpaved streets.  They were forced into prostitution and they know no other life. Their parents died during the war,  said Groenendijk.   The conflict makes it difficult to bring stability to the girls' lives. Mothers often see (prostitution) as a last resort to provide for their children.  Jenna came to Juba in search of a better life after her parents were killed in an attack on their village. Unlike Stacey, she was unable to escape a life of  survival sex .  When my parents died, I ended up all by myself. It took me several days to get to Juba, and once I was here, I didn't know where to go,  she said. For some time Jenna - who did not want to give her real name – slept under market stalls at night, until a group of men attacked her.  They ripped off my skirt and assaulted me ... I can't describe what they did to me, it was humiliating and has altered my life forever,  she said. After that night, the men kept returning.  They gave me glue and said I would feel much better if I inhaled it. They also continued to rape me,  said Jenna, shoeless and wearing a denim skirt. Soon after the attack Jenna was diagnosed with HIV.  I felt as if I had been punished. I was homeless and knew that I could never afford the medication,  she said.  Jenna now lives in a room in Gumbo furnished with a single metal bed and earns less than $1 per client.   I wanted to give up many times, but I have to believe that I can leave all this behind one day. It's what keeps me going,  she said. Safe Place CCC offers some healthcare to Jenna and girls like her and the chance to learn skills like basket-weaving and jewelry-making. But it is not enough to keep them from selling sex.  Some of these young women have died or moved to other places. Few of them ... have been able to claw their way out of a life of prostitution,  said CCC psychologist Lisette Suarez. Far from the scorching alleys of Gumbo, Stacey is finishing her homework in a purpose-built classroom inside the shelter, while a gaggle of children play in the dusty courtyard. She is set to finish middle school in a few months.  She still sees her old friends - many of whom are surviving by selling sex.  Sometimes I talk to them but they don't listen,  she said.  I tell them: you can see my life and yours, there is a big difference, you are not happy and I am happy. You are not in a safe place, but I live in a safe place.

British Prime Minister Theresa May looks on course to increase her parliamentary majority in Thursday's election, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday.      Separately, a Reuters poll showed last week that Wall Street's top banks believe that the Fed will raise U.S interest rates.     Asian stocks meanwhile inched higher, but investors remained noticeably risk averse ahead of several major political and economic events later this week.          I think investors have already priced in that Theresa May is going to win the general election  and rates will be raised at next week's Federal Reserve meeting, said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with Manila-based AB Capital Securities.      Philippine stocks led regional markets higher, rising as much as 0.8 percent as industrial and real estate stocks climbed.     Ayala Land jumped as much as 3 percent to its highest in nearly 10 months, while SM Investment Corp gained 2.4 percent.        We (the Philippine market) have been rallying on the back of news that the tax-reform program might be passed sooner than expected,  said Felix, referring to a much-anticipated tax reform bill that now requires Senate approval.     Foreign investors have been net buyers of equities for nearly a month-and-a-half and that has also been pushing the markets higher, Felix said.     Indonesia climbed as much as 0.5 percent, its biggest gain in one week, with Bank Central Asia and Bank Rakyat Indonesia rising more than 1.4 percent each.     Singapore shares hit their highest in more than three weeks, boosted by financials and consumer stocks.      United Overseas Bank rose as much as 1.3 percent, while Genting Singapore added 1.7 percent.     Malaysia was down marginally after three sessions of gains.

Hopes that MSCI will include China's A shares in its indexes later this month also whetted investors' appetite for big-cap stocks, with more investment banks predicting a good chance of such a move. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.1 percent to 3,529.53 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent to 3,131.00. Over the past week, controlling shareholders of over a dozen listed companies have called on employees to buy the companies' shares, while promising to take any losses incurred if they hold the shares for at least 12 months. The firms include Shenzhen Fengda Technology Co, Eastern Gold Jade Co and Great Wall International ACG. Shares in those companies have jumped in response, and the optimism appears to be spreading as investors bet more companies would issue similar statements. Unlike in the mid-2015 market crash, when a slew of state firms made buybacks, the calls this time are coming from private major shareholders of smaller companies. Markets watchers said it was not clear if the calls to buy shares were linked to broader efforts by authorities to stabilise money and currency markets in recent weeks. But investors drew some solace from signs that the central bank is moving to ease worries of liquidity stress later this month as banks face the central bank's quarterly health check. On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China injected 180 billion yuan ($26.50 billion) into the interbank market via open market operations, after in the previous session providing capital support via one-year Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) loans. In addition, an increasing number of institutions are now betting China's A shares will be included in the MSCI's benchmark index. The decision will be made on June 20.  MSCI inclusion now a real likelihood,  asset manager Robeco said in a report this week.  We think this time there is a real chance of success. With the improving fundamentals and attractive valuation, we are positive on the market outlook.  Stocks rose across the board in China, with consumer and healthcare stocks leading the rise. Hong Kong stocks were roughly flat. The Hang Seng index was unchanged at 25,988.32, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 0.4 percent, to 10,649.08.

Rizzo's three-run homer in the fifth inning -- his 13th -- gave the Cubs the lead, but Chicago also broke out of an over reliance on homers with seven runs coming via singles and doubles.  Just to really have some balls on the grass and score runs that way that was kind of nice to do,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  Up and down the lineup we swung the bats well.  Rizzo went 2-for-5 with four RBIs while starting pitcher Jake Arrieta turned in his sixth quality start.  We kept the line moving there and drove the ball all over the place,  Rizzo said.  You can't ever hit too many home runs, but we knew it was a solid week when someone didn't drive a run in via the long ball.  Arrieta (6-4) allowed two hits, his fewest of the season, two runs (one earned), walked three and struck out five. He retired 16 straight batters for his first victory since May 21. The Cubs (30-27), winners of five straight, go for their second straight series sweep in Wednesday's series finale. The Marlins (24-33) suffered their second consecutive loss. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at CubsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchRizzo homer keyed a four-run fifth as the Cubs erased an early Marlins advantage. The Marlins got one run back in the seventh when Arrieta gave up a leadoff triple to J.T. Realmuto, who scored on shortstop Addison Russell's error on JT Riddle's grounder. The Cubs added six more runs in their half of the seventh, all eventually charged to Marlins reliever Brian Ellington. Kris Bryant opened the inning with a double to left and scored on Rizzo's single to right-center. Jason Heyward, who went 3-for-5, had a one-out double to drive in Rizzo for a 6-2 lead. After an Albert Almora Jr. single, Javier Baez plated Heyward and Almora with a one-out double. Ellington walked pinch hitter Ian Happ and departed. Jon Jay greeted reliever Dustin McGowan with a sharp single to left to bring in Jay and Happ to make it 10-2. Marlins left-hander Jeff Locke (0-1) took the loss after working 4 2/3 innings. Miami's Giancarlo Stanton singled to center with one out in the first and reached third after back-to-back walks to Christian Yelich and Marcell Ozuma. Stanton scored on Realmuto's fielder's choice grounder to short.  At that point I wanted to use the sinker as much as possible, have a few quick innings and get to the seventh like I was able to,  Arrieta said.  I was relying pretty much exclusively on the sinker because it was really good tonight and just pitching to conditions.  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said at least the start was encouraging.  The first inning was really good as far as working (Arrieta) over,  Mattingly said.  We were able to nick him for one and had good at-bats from the standpoint of running his pitch count up. And them from there he was able to settle in and find the strike zone more.  In the fifth, Rizzo slammed a 1-0 pitch off Locke to the right field bleachers for a 3-1 lead. He drove in Jay and Bryant after they walked with two out. Willson Contreras reached base on an error by shortstop Riddle and Heyward delivered his second hit of the night -- a double to deep right center -- to drive in Contreras and make it 4-1. That was it for Locke, who threw 89 pitches and was replaced by right-handed reliever Brad Ziegler. Locke allowed four runs (three earned), four hits, four walks and struck out three in 4 2/3 innings.  It's unacceptable of course on my part,  Locke said.  We're here in Chicago playing a really good team and playing well right now. Arrieta's on the mound and you know he's not going to give you a whole lot. So you've just got to do a better job making pitches when you have to make them.

He may be gone again. The heart and soul of the Texas Rangers left Tuesday night after spraining his ankle, casting a pall over a 10-8 win over the New York Mets that snapped a four-game losing streak.  To miss 50-something games and finally come back and play six games and this happens,  Beltre said.  What are you gonna do?  Beltre jammed his left ankle in the first inning running to first, but didn't leave the game until the sixth as the injury continued to worsen. Wearing a protective boot after the game, he said X-rays were negative. Beltre, who missed the first 51 games of the season with a hamstring injury, doesn't expect to play in Wednesday's finale of the two-game interleague series.  Obviously when your best player is banged up, there is concern,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  We'll know more in the morning.  The Rangers (27-31) scored seven unanswered runs after falling behind 4-3 early. Joey Gallo blasted his team-leading 17th home run and Nomar Mazara tied a career high with four hits. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at RangersTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchTexas pieced together a strong showing from its first two relievers out of the bullpen after spot starter Dillon Gee couldn't get out of the fourth inning. The combination of Austin Bibens-Dirkx and Alex Claudio gave up a run over 4 2/3 innings. Bibens-Dirkx (1-0) picked up his first major league victory. Matt Bush was touched for three runs in the ninth inning on homers from Curtis Granderson and Travis d'Arnaud. The Mets had two men on base when Jay Bruce grounded into a game-ending double play.  With the guys we had coming up, I sure liked our opportunities,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  They were all good fastball hitters against Matt, and I thought they had a chance.  The Mets' offense gave starter Jacob deGrom plenty of run support early, with Juan Lagares, Asdrubal Cabrera and Neil Walker each hitting home runs as New York scored in each of the first three innings. Lagares tied his career high with four of New York's 17 hits. The power display didn't hold up as deGrom (4-3) was rocked in his first career outing against Texas. The right-hander allowed eight runs on 10 hits through four innings.  You tell me that Jake deGrom's going to start a game and we're going to score eight runs, I'd figure the game's over,  Collins said.  We're winning that game.  Gee didn't fare much better in his first start against the club with which he broke into the majors. The right-hander, who went 40-37 with Mets from 2010-15, lasted 3 1/3 innings and allowed four runs on eight hits. Texas finished with 16 hits and scored its most runs since beating San Diego 11-0 on May 9. Jared Hoying had had three hits, with Shin-Soo Choo and Delino DeShields each had two. New York (24-32) has dropped five of its last six games. The Mets tagged Gee with three home runs in the first three innings. Luckily for the Rangers, each came with no one on base. Juan Lagares went yard in the second, with Asdrubal Cabrera and Neil Walker each rounding the bases in the following frame. Walker's shot to straight-away center put the visitors up 4-3. Texas, though, was still leading 5-4 after three frames. The Rangers scored twice in both the second and third, the latter coming on Gallo's two-run blast to right that just inched over the glove of Bruce. Gee was done after leaving runners at the corners with one out in the fourth. Bibens-Dirkx got Texas out of the jam unscathed.  The biggest thing, coming in, you want to minimize damage,  Bibens-Dirkx said.  Obviously, inherited runners are a big thing for a reliever and you really don't want any of them to score. I was lucky enough I made some quality pitches to do that.  The Rangers followed with three runs in the bottom of the inning, including Mazara's seventh homer, to open up an 8-4 edge on deGrom. NOTES: The Rangers traded RHP Sam Dyson, along with cash considerations, to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Dyson came into the season as the closer before losing his job. He was designated for assignment on June 2 after posting a 1-6 record over 17 relief appearances, including 0 for 4 in save chances. ... Texas 1B Mike Napoli was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 4, with a lower back strain. The Rangers activated LHP pitcher Dario Alvarez from the 10-day DL. ... Mets manager Terry Collins is considering going to a six-man rotation with the imminent returns of LHP Steven Matz and RHP Seth Lugo to the rotation.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED675S47DP"},

Two innings later, it was the same scenario. Each time, the Boston Red Sox prevailed, as Joe Kelly and Craig Kimbrel recorded inning-ending strikeouts of slugger Aaron Judge to preserve a 5-4 victory over the New York Yankees on Tuesday. Kelly faced Judge with Brett Gardner on first and two outs in the seventh of a 5-3 game. He threw one pitch to Judge clocked at 103 mph on the scoreboard, and Judge fouled off three of the four pitches that were more than 100 mph.  Power versus power,  Boston center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. said.  I was actually surprised at some of the balls he was catching up with at the top of the zone. My gosh, how is he getting to that ball? It was amazing.  On the sixth pitch, Kelly deviated from fastballs and threw a hard slider that resulted in a swinging strikeout of the top home run hitter in the majors.  That was a good battle right there,  Kelly said.  Obviously one of the best hitters in the league right now, especially in a tight game like that. You got to be very cautious with a guy who's hitting the ball and seeing the ball that well.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at YankeesNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchBoston manager John Farrell said,  I think any time Aaron Judge walks to the plate, all eyes go to it because of the way he's been swinging the bat, but Joe with just some big-time velocity finishes him off with a powerful slider. A classic matchup inside of an otherwise well-played game all around.  Kimbrel replaced Matt Barnes in a two-run game in the eighth with Matt Holliday at third. He struck out Didi Gregorius on a swinging strike in the dirt, but the breaking ball went by catcher Christian Vazquez for a wild pitch as Holliday scored. Kimbrel made it more interesting by walking Chase Headley on a full count. He then fanned Chris Carter with a full-count 99 mph fastball that was well out of the strike zone, ending the inning. The Boston closer fanned Brett Gardner and Gary Sanchez to open the ninth, setting up the confrontation with Judge. It took just three pitches to end it, and Kimbrel notched his 17th save by fanning Judge on a 99 mph fastball. Kimbrel tied a season high with five strikeouts and also recorded a multi-inning save for the third time in four chances.  Kimbrel's awesome,  Kelly said. Kimbrel's last save was a 33-pitch, four-out appearance Saturday in Baltimore, but he had two days in between outings, which factored in how Farrell used him.  With the tying run at the plate and then the following inning in the heart of their order, once again he's come up big for us,  Farrell said.  He was extended in the eighth inning here a little bit tonight but was able to get through the ninth inning unscathed and very powerful.  Before improving to 24-1 when Kimbrel pitches, the Red Sox used a power display against struggling Masahiro Tanaka (5-6) and built a 5-1 lead through five innings. The Red Sox slugged three homers for the fifth time all season, upping their total to 56. Mitch Moreland and Hanley Ramirez went back-to-back in the fourth, and Andrew Benintendi slugged a solo shot into the second deck in right in the fifth. Drew Pomeranz (6-3) made the homers stand up despite a laborious five innings. He threw 123 pitches but allowed only two runs (one earned) and six hits. Xander Bogaerts drove in the other run for the Red Sox, who are 11-4 in their last 15 games. Judge reached base in his first three plate appearances. The right fielder also robbed Bradley of an extra-base hit with a diving catch in the second. Judge's inability to catch up to pitches from Kelly and Kimbrel occurred after Tanaka allowed five runs and five hits in five innings. He is 0-5 with a 10.50 ERA in his last five starts and allowed multiple homers for the fifth time this season.  It's the same issue,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  Nothing's really changed. It's the inconsistencies in the pitches.  Carter homered and Aaron Hicks scored on a throwing error by Mookie Betts on a single by Gregorius as the Yankees lost for the fifth time in eight games. NOTES: Boston 2B Dustin Pedroia (sprained left wrist) took batting practice before the game and remains on track to be activated from the disabled list on Friday. ... New York 1B Greg Bird (bruised right ankle) went 1-for-4 in his seventh rehab game for Class A Tampa. He will next be moved to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Thursday. ...

Some 2,000 items will hit the auction block in a series of sales slated for spring of 2018, and proceeds will benefit a dozen charities in accordance with his pledge to direct the majority of his wealth to cultural, educational, medical and environmental causes.  We are proud to fulfill my father's wish to share with the world the art and objects he and my mother collected over a lifetime together and use them as means to continue the long legacy of Rockefeller family philanthropy first established by John D. Rockefeller,  David Rockefeller Jr. said in a statement. Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan Corp, was patriarch of one of the most famous and influential American families. He was a noted collector along with his wife, Peggy, who pre-deceased him. In 2007, a Mark Rothko painting he bought in 1960 for less than $10,000 was auctioned for more than $72 million. Many other works in their world-class collection were handed down over generations. The collection comprises impressionist, post-impressionist and modern works of art, as well as American paintings, English and European furniture, Asian art, European ceramics and Chinese  porcelain, silver, and American decorative arts and furniture. Beneficiaries of the proceeds include Harvard University, the Museum of Modern Art, the Council on Foreign Relations, the   American Farmland Trust, the Maine Coast Heritage Trust and the  Mount Desert Land and Garden Preserve.

That proved to be a wise assessment once again. Mark Trumbo hit the game-winning RBI single off Wade LeBlanc in the 10th inning, leading Baltimore past the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-5 in the opener of their two-game series Tuesday night.  We didn't have much going,  Trumbo said.  It happened pretty quick and when you get against these top relievers it's rare. We just did a really nice job tonight.  Jonathan Schoop tied the game for Baltimore with a two-run homer off Pirates closer Tony Watson in the ninth. It was Schoop's second home run of the game and 10th of the season. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at Orioles Jon watches how people are pitching him and what he's (doing) wrong and he makes adjustments to patterns and what they're doing,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  It's one of the challenges of playing a team you see hardly ever.  Adam Jones singled with one out in the 10th and took second on a long fly out by Manny Machado. Trumbo then delivered a liner to center field off LeBlanc (3-1). Brad Brach (1-1) threw a scoreless inning to pick up the win. The Orioles improved to 8-1 in extra innings.  They just beat us,  Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.  We went with our strengths and they came back and won late.  Pittsburgh starter Ivan Nova was cruising until the seventh inning, when he allowed back-to-back homers to Chris Davis and Schoop that pulled the Orioles to within 4-3. Nova was forced to leave the game with left knee inflammation and is listed as day-to-day. Nova allowed three runs on five hits with four strikeouts and a walk in six-plus innings. He has gone at least six innings in each of his 12 starts this season. Nova said the knee injury was not the reason for the home runs.  They have a really heavy hitting lineup, especially with the big right handers,  Nova said.  You have to be really careful with them. The first homer, I just stayed up in the zone. I thought it was a good pitch. The other was a high curve and he still hit it out. You have to be careful with those guys.  David Freese got his sixth homer of the season for the Pirates to provide an early 4-1 lead. The Orioles' Kevin Gausman struggled with his command early but managed to throw 6 2/3 innings. He allowed four runs on eight hits with four strikeouts and a walk on 113 pitches.  I think that's a theme for me, really, this whole season is giving up way too many two-strike hits,  Gausman said.  I threw some great pitches to get to that point, but obviously, they also did a really good job with some fastballs up and just kind of didn't hit them hard, but just kind of hit them where guys weren't.  One of the keys for Pittsburgh this series is keeping the ball in Camden Yards. The Orioles entered the game sixth in the American League with 76 home runs, but 12th in runs scored with 244. That became troublesome when Seth Smith drove Nova's third pitch of the game over the center field fence. The Pirates responded with four consecutive hits off Gausman in the second and took a 2-1 lead on a single by Andrew McCutchen and a double by John Jaso. A fielder's choice by Jordy Mercer provided a two-run cushion later that inning. NOTES: The Orioles purchased the contract of INF Ruben Tejada from Triple-A Norfolk. Over 616 major league games, Tejada has hit .252 with 104, doubles, 10 homers and 253 RBIs. INF Paul Janish was designated for assignment. ...

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Chicago White Sox ended their five-game losing streak Tuesday night, getting a phantom home run to open the game and edging the Tampa Bay Rays 4-2 at Tropicana Field. The Rays (29-31) dropped their fourth straight and fell two games under .500 for the first time in two weeks. Yolmer Sanchez led off the game for the White Sox (25-31) with a shot to center field that landed in the field of play but was called a home run and upheld upon review. Sanchez's line drive looked to be headed to right-center, and center fielder Kevin Kiermaier misread it as the ball dropped behind him in straightaway center field. Sanchez stopped at third base but was waved home as if the ball had hit one of the catwalks above the field. Replays seemed to show it didn't hit anything, but the call was upheld and Sanchez got his third home run and a 1-0 lead.  I saw a routine fly ball that didn't even get to the warning track. Definitely the shortest home run probably in major league history,  said Rays starter Chris Archer, still upset about the call and the lack of a reversal on review.  For us to have a rule to have replay and not get the call right, and put the team behind the 8-ball is a bit ridiculous for me in my opinion. ...  I'm not a firm believer in statcast, but it said the apex of the ball was 63 feet off the ground. We don't have anything in Tropicana Field that's 63 feet off the ground. There's just a lot wrong with it.  Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RaysTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchWhite Sox manager Rick Renteria said he thought it was clear something had shifted the path of the ball, taking no issue with the call that gave his team its only run for the first six innings.  It hit and it deviated ... It clearly hit something in that general area,  Renteria said.  They had ruled it as a home run ... it hit what it needed to hit for us to get the call.  Chicago's Todd Frazier led off the ninth with his ninth home run after the Rays pulled within a run on a night when the Tampa Bay bullpen again struggled to get out of inning unscathed. David Robertson pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his ninth save. The Rays had plenty of chances, loading the bases in the fifth, sixth and eighth innings, but came away with only one run. Jesus Sucre, who grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded in the sixth, got a sacrifice fly in the eighth to cut the deficit to 3-2. That brought Steven Souza Jr. to the plate with runners at second and third, but he struck out to end the inning. The Rays left 11 runners on base. Tampa Bay's bats couldn't do much to help Archer (4-4). He struck out 11 and held the White Sox to five hits and two runs in seven innings.  We got the guys on base, we just didn't capitalize on the opportunities that were presented,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Their pitchers made some big pitches, and sometimes that's the way it goes.  Avisail Garcia led off the seventh inning with a solo home run to left field, his ninth on the season, for a 2-1 lead off Archer. The White Sox added an insurance run in the eighth after No. 9 hitter Leury Garcia walked, then advanced to third when Tommy Hunter's pickoff attempt wound up in right field. Leury Garcia scored on Jose Abreu's two-out RBI single to right field to make it 3-1. The Rays had the chance to break the tie in the sixth, with a leadoff walk by Tim Beckham and a single by Kiermaier. A wild pitch put runners at second and third with no outs. After Rickie Weeks struck out, the White Sox went to reliever Chris Beck (1-0) and intentionally walked pinch hitter Brad Miller to load the bases. Sucre had a 3-0 count, but he grounded into a double play to end the inning with the score still tied. Chicago's Jose Quintana and Archer kept opposing bats in check early, taking a 1-1 tie into the sixth inning after each gave up a run in the first inning.  Awesome,  Renteria said of Quintana's outing.  Did what he needed to do, get the outs ... I thought he did a great job. He turned it up a notch.  Tampa Bay tied the game when Corey Dickerson doubled and scored on an RBI bloop single to right field by Evan Longoria. NOTES: The Rays will call up RHP Jacob Faria to make his major league debut as the Wednesday starter against the White Sox. Faria, 23, is the seventh Rays player to make his major league debut this season. The only team with more this year is Cincinnati, with eight. Faria was 6-1 at Triple-A Durham with a 3.07 ERA this season, leading the International League with 84 strikeouts in 58 2/3 innings. ... White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon began a rehab assignment Tuesday with Class A Winston-Salem. Rodon pitched 3 1/3 innings and gave up five runs on four hits, striking out six and walking two. He has been on the disabled list all season with left biceps bursitis ... White Sox RHP James Shields (right lat strain) reported no issues after his rehab appearance Saturday with Triple-A Charlotte.

Their message was simple: Pitch better. Nola got his chance on Tuesday and responded with his best game of the season. The right-hander allowed one run over eight innings to help the Phillies win their fourth straight game, a 3-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday. It was Philadelphia's fifth straight win against Atlanta.  Boy did Nola rise to the challenge,  Mackanin said.  He was outstanding.  Nola (3-3) gave up five hits and one walk and struck out six. His eight innings of work matched his career high. He improved his career record against Atlanta to 4-1 with a 2.08 ERA. He retired eight consecutive batters after giving up a first-inning run and retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced. Nola became the first Philadelphia starter to throw a pitch in the eighth inning of a game since Jeremy Hellickson pitched a complete-game shutout against the Marlins on Sept. 17, 2016. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BravesPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch Eick and I know what we need to do,  Nola said.  We just need to execute our plan. Of course, it worked out tonight.  Mackanin even considered letting Nola try to finish the game. He had only thrown 97 pitches and Nola said he lobbied hard for a chance to pitch the ninth.  It was great to see somebody go eight innings,  Mackanin said.  He begged me to go out in the ninth. I decided against it at the last minute. Managerial decision. The last two hitters in that eighth inning hit the ball hard and I didn't want him to face the middle of the lineup for a fourth time.  The Braves tried to rally in the ninth inning against the Phillies' bullpen. Matt Kemp and Matt Adams had back-to-back singles with one out against Hector Neris. That was enough to convince Mackanin to lift Neris in favor of sidearm pitcher Pat Neshek, who struck out Adonis Garcia and got Kurt Suzuki to pop out to end the game. Neshek earned his first save. Mackanin wouldn't say if he would make Neshek the new closer, but said he was concerned with the lack of effectiveness that Neris has had with his split-finger pitch.  When he's got that real good split, he's unhittable,  Mackanin said.  He doesn't have that right now.  Howie Kendrick was 3-for-4 and Freddy Galvis had two hits for the Phillies. The Phillies took a 3-1 lead when they scored twice in the sixth inning. Cesar Hernandez and Odubel Herrera opened the inning with back-to-back doubles. Herrera went to third on Kendrick's single and scored when Jaime Garcia was called for a balk on a pickoff play to first. Garcia contested the balk, the second straight game he's been tagged for one.  I didn't agree with it,  he said.  He made the call and it is what it is. They called a balk on my last game and I'm just trying to be smart right there. I don't agree.  Garcia (2-4) pitched 7 2/3 innings, the third time in four starts that he's pitched at least seven innings. He allowed three runs on eight hits and no walks with four strikeouts.  Great job. He was really good again,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  He's been on the attack, in the zone. He's been nails. He gets in the eighth inning. That's outstanding.  The Braves jumped on Nola for a run in the first. Brandon Phillips doubled and scored on an opposite-field single by Nick Markakis. Garcia retired the first 11 Philadelphia batters, a streak that ended when Kendrick hit a long solo homer to left, his third of the season, to tie the game at 1. It was the first home run and the first earned run allowed by Garcia since May 21. Garcia continued to get little offensive support. The Braves average just 2.4 runs when Garcia pitches.  I pretty much just try to master the things I can control,  he said.  Things I can control are my work ethic, my attitude and continue to compete and keep us in the ball game.  NOTES: Philadelphia won consecutive road games for the first time since Sept. 5-6. ... Atlanta placed RHP Bartolo Colon (2-7, 7.78 ERA) on the 10-day disabled list with a left oblique strain. He was replaced on the roster by RHP Jason Hursh, who was 2-1 with a 3.09 ERA in 20 combined relief appearances with Triple-A Gwinnett and Double-A Mississippi. A replacement for Colon in the starting rotation is expected to be announced in a couple of days, manager Brian Snitker said. ... Philadelphia 1B Tommy Joseph is the franchise's fourth player to hit 30-plus homers in his first 162 games. ... Philadelphia great Mike Schmidt apologized to Odubel Herrera for saying the club could not build around the outfielder because of a language barrier. In a statement, Schmidt said his comments were  disrespectful to Hererra and Latin players in general. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED675PFIA5"},

The Wall Street bank's consumer arm, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, plans on Wednesday to raise the rate it offers customers on deposits to 1.2 percent, slightly higher than rivals Synchrony Bank, CIT Bank and New York Community Bank's My Banking Direct. FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016.David Gray/File PhotoGoldman had previously offered savers 1.05 percent. The average national rate for savings accounts is currently 0.06 percent, according to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The move makes Goldman the highest interest paying bank, according to personal finance website Bankrate.com. The firm is aggressively trying to boost its deposit base and attract Main Street clients.  Goldman's online deposits from individuals total $12 billion, a small but growing fraction of the $128 billion in overall deposits on the firm's overall balance sheet. Still, that is far less than large commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co with $1.4 trillion in deposits. Goldman hopes increasing its deposit base will help it boost profits if it can find ways to lend them profitably. The bank is looking to make further inroads into lending broadly across wealth management and investment banking, as businesses like trading struggle to generate the type of returns they once did. Deposits also represent a more stable type of funding and are less likely to disappear during times of stress than other funding sources. Regulators may have been pushing banks to rely more on deposits since the 2008 financial crisis.  Last year, the bank launched Marcus, its first major foray into consumer lending. It also acquired Honest Dollar, an online retirement savings platform for small businesses and startups.
