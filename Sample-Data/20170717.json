The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index dithered on either side of flat but was up 2.08 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,767.2 by 0311 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Friday. Three of the 'Big Four' banks dragged most on the financial sector, falling 0.4 to 0.5 percent, followed by insurers Medibank Private Ltd and Insurance Australia Group .  Financials are struggling to get into positive territory and investors will continue to look out for the APRA announcement on what's happening with the banks capital requirements,  said Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities. Local media is speculating the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) will announce new capital rules this week for major banks. The government is looking at expanding the powers of the country's prudential regulator to include non-bank lenders amid worry of financial stability in the economy. Giving into pressure from regulators, major banks have cut back on home loans and institutional lending to real estate investors in recent months, giving non-bank lenders an opportunity to expand their loan books. This development has stoked concerns as the country's sky-high household debt and accelerating property prices prevail while wage growth has been slow. Financial stocks were also depressed by subdued rate hike prospects in the United States following weak retail sales data. Telstra sagged 1.2 percent, on track for its fifth day in the red, on the prospects it may slash dividends. Investors are awaiting such a move as the telecom giant faces growing competition and a pressure on its earnings, according to the Australian Financial Review. [bit.ly/2vsrxy9 ] Meanwhile, the materials sector led by diversified miner South32 Ltd rising more than 2.9 percent, provided some cheer. Aluminium prices notched their best single-day rise on Friday while oil and copper prices remained upbeat. Index heavyweights Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group edged up as much as 1 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index gained 0.4 percent, touching at one point its highest intraday level on record, led by industrial and healthcare sectors. The country's net foreign liabilities are at their lowest as a percentage of gross domestic product since the late 1980's, making the country less vulnerable to shocks, according to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand. Retirement village operators Summerset Holdings and Metlife Care were the biggest gainers in the benchmark, up 2.3 percent and 1.8 percent.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said state and territory police forces would remain as the first response to such incidents, but the military would offer support to enhance their capabilities. Under the proposed law changes, state and territory governments would be able to call for military help at any time after a  terror incident  has been declared. Previously, the military could only be called upon once police concluded they could no longer deal with an incident. Turnbull said future attacks would likely remain the responsibility of the police but the military could also assist in incidents such as a central Sydney cafe siege in December 2014 in which two hostages were killed. A coronial inquiry found in May that police failed to respond quickly enough to end the 16-hour siege, which has been described as Australia's deadliest incident inspired by Islamic State extremists. The gunman, who was killed by police, had no direct ties to the militant group.  In the current threat environment, it is most likely that a terrorist attack will use simple methodologies, a knife, a gun, a vehicle, and the attack itself could be over in minutes,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull talks with Special Operations Command soldiers during a visit to the Australian Army's Holsworthy Barracks located in western Sydney, Australia, July 17, 2017.    AAP/Brendan Esposito/via REUTERS In worse case scenarios, the ADF (Australian Defence Force) has a range of specialist capabilities to resolve complex terrorist incidents, especially protracted sieges or hostage situations,  he said. The Sydney cafe siege and a series of other  lone wolf  attacks have thrown police tactics, and Australia's overall response to potential security incidents, into sharp focus. Australian police have since changed tactics to become ready to end cases of potential hostage-taking more quickly, and to shoot suspects in  terrorist-related  incidents. In June, police also began installing concrete bollards in pedestrian thoroughfares in Australia's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, to guard against possible vehicle attacks such as those seen recently in Europe and the United States.  The key thing we need is the most flexible possible arrangements - the threat's changed very significantly,  Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday. Australia is a staunch U.S. ally and has sent troops to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has also been on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East.

The incomparable Swiss turned his 11th Wimbledon final into a procession as tearful seventh seed Cilic, battling his nerves and a bloody blister, suffered a torrid afternoon. Federer described Cilic's predicament as  cruel  after ending his torment with an ace after one hour 41 minutes -- but there was no hint of sympathy as, 23 days before his 36th birthday, he became the oldest Wimbledon men's singles champion. That attitude from the third seed, who last triumphed at the All England Club five years ago, was not surprising since Federer's dream of title number eight had been shattered by Novak Djokovic in the 2014 and 2015 finals. His take on Cilic's injury spoke volumes for the killer instinct that has earned him a record-extending 19 majors and taken him past American Pete Sampras's record of seven men's singles titles at Wimbledon in the modern era.  I couldn't tell what it was,  Federer said.  But if I saw him limping around, or if I saw him pull up hurt, I would start to think, maybe I'll throw in a dropshot to really check him out, then one more, because that's what you do.  You need to hurt him where it hurts already.  It was not really necessary as Federer enjoyed one of his easiest title victories. Related CoverageFederer offers no guarantees he will be back at WimbledonFactbox: List of Wimbledon men's singles championsHaving reached the final without dropping a set, he was braced for Cilic's power tools but, apart from the first four games, resistance from the Croat was about as daunting as a man brandishing a stick of celery. In winning the tournament without the loss of a set, Federer matched the 1976 feat of Swede Bjorn Borg and his own run 10 years ago at the Australian Open. Latest Milestone His latest milestone continued a remarkable resurgence for Federer, who took six months off last year before returning to win the Australian Open -- ending a five-year wait for an 18th grand slam many thought would remain elusive.  I've got to take more time off, I don't know!  said Federer, whose family has doubled with the addition of twins Leo and Lennart to go with twin girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva since his 2012 title -- all of whom were watching on Sunday. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 16, 2017   Switzerland’s Roger Federer celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against Croatia’s Marin CilicToby Melville It is very special. Wimbledon was always my favorite tournament, will always be my favorite tournament. My heroes walked the grounds here.  For Cilic, who beat Federer in the U.S. Open semi-finals before going on to claim his sole major in 2014, his first final at the citadel of tennis, was a living nightmare. In pain from a blister, his legs appearing tied together and his mind in turmoil, Cilic seemed on the verge of quitting as the tears flowed and the crowd murmured in embarrassment.  I got a really bad blister,  Cilic said, explaining his mid-match meltdown that had fans nonplussed.  It didn't hurt so much that it was putting me in tears. It was just that feeling that I wasn't able to give the best.  Slideshow (19 Images)Shaky Start Nerves were apparent for both men as Cilic opened the 131st men's final with a shaky service game. Federer, who lost serve only four times in the fortnight, saved a break point at 1-2 and in the next game. At 2-2 Cilic took a tumble to the turf trying to reach a Federer dropshot and followed that with two lame backhands to hand master front-runner Federer control. Scenting blood, Federer polished off the first set before breaking Cilic to lead 3-0 in the second. Cilic slumped to his chair, sobbing, as the physio and doctor stood by and for a moment it looked as though the final might end in a retirement for the first time since 1911. Cheered on by the crowd, Cilic returned to the fray but any sense of a real match had vanished as Federer raced through the rest of the second set. After treatment on his stinging feet, Cilic at least showed some spirit to detain Federer for 40 minutes in the third set. But the outcome was never in doubt as the Swiss, eyes narrowing for another batch of records, broke in the seventh game before wrapping up the match with his eighth ace.

American McCarron closed with a six-under-par 66 to claim one of the majors on the Champions Tour by one stroke over Langer, the dominant player on the tour, and Brandt Jobe. The winning total was 18-under 270 at Caves Valley Golf Club. Langer ended up with an uncharacteristic one-over 73. His chance to force a playoff on the 18th hole vanished when his six-foot birdie putt circled the cup but would not drop. The 59-year-old German started the day in the lead and opened a three-shot margin after birdies on two of the first five holes. However, he bogeyed the 13th hole -- his first bogey in 31 holes -- and double-bogeyed the 17th after hitting his tee shot into the water on the par-three hole.  I thought I hit a really good putt,  Langer said.  Hit a good chunk of the hole, too. But the big issue was 17, hitting a horrible shot there and then missing a six-or-seven footer for bogey. That was the killer.  The major championship was the first for the 52-year-old McCarron.   I thought it was a very difficult task to catch him or pass him,  McCarron said of Langer,  but I thought if I go out there and have a good stretch on the front nine and maybe put a little pressure on these guys, that you never know what happens, it's golf.  McCarron entered the final round six shots out of the lead. That tied the largest deficit the winner has overcome in Senior Players Championship history.  To come from that far behind, especially with Bernhard Langer, is really something special,  McCarron said. Langer was bidding for his 10th major title on the Champions Tour and could have become the first player in 90 years to win the same major four consecutive years. He previously won two majors this year.  I played the same way I played the last few days, pretty aggressive, smart, whatever,  Langer said.  You know, I lost it. It's very simple.  This is going to hurt for a little while because it was within my grasp to win the championship. All I had to do was come home in even par more or less. Twenty under would have done it. But it's easier said than done.” Editing by Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-senior-players-idUSKBN1A2066"}

The 23-year-old Park, runaway favorite to win LPGA Rookie of the Year honors, birdied the par-five 15th to forge ahead and, after co-leader amateur Choi Hye-jin double-bogeyed the 16th, added a six-foot birdie at the 17th for some cushion. Park, who won seven times on the Korean LPGA Tour in 2016, saved par at the par-five 18th with a superb chip from a tight lie behind the green to post a five-under-par 67. As the poker-faced Park made her way from the 18th green to the scoring tent, she paused to wave and bow towards U.S. President Donald Trump, who looked down from his bullet-proof, glass-enclosed private box.  To be honest I still cannot believe this is actually happening. It's almost like I'm floating on a cloud in the sky,  Park said through an interpreter after signing for 11-under 277.

Choi was beaming with pride with a runner-up medal hanging around her neck.  This tournament for me, even if I could just come and play, that alone would be an honor, but on top of that ...

Mandatory Credit: Eric Sucar-USA TODAY SportsKorean Dominance The Korean dominance of women’s golf, providing seven of the last 10 U.S. Women's Open winners, was evident with the nation providing eight of the top 10 finishers, including the two new faces at the top who could further extend that domination. Shanshan Feng of China, a seven-time LPGA Tour winner who had led since the opening round, hung in with a chance, needing to hole out from the fairway with her third shot for an eagle at the 18th to tie Park. Slideshow (17 Images)But after her shot bounded beyond the green, the 27-year-old Feng duffed her first chip and went on to card a triple-bogey for 75, finishing equal fifth at six-under. World number one Ryu So-yeon of South Korea (70) and compatriot Hur Mi-jung (68) shared third on seven-under. For Park, it was a sweet bounce-back from last year's U.S. Women's Open at CordeValle in California. Park, the 36-hole leader, finished 74-74 there, losing a chance at the title when she hit into a water hazard on the 72nd hole and ended up third, two shots out of a playoff. She timed her run better this time, carding 73 and 70 in the first two rounds and began the final day three strokes back before posting her second successive 67. Choi narrowly missed becoming the second amateur in 72 years of the event to win and first since 22-year-old Catherine Lacoste of France hoisted the trophy 50 years ago at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia.

Sentiment got an added boost after Chinese economic data handily topped forecasts with second-quarter gross domestic product rising 6.9 percent on the year. Strength in retail sale and industrial output helped offset a weak start for Shanghai stocks which may have been linked to talk of tighter financial regulations.  It is encouraging for global growth as well because China is the second largest economy on the planet,  said Craig James, chief econOmist at fund manager CommSec in Sydney.  Based on this data, there is no need for easing and no need really for tightening either because inflationary pressures are very much contained,  he added.  So I think the central bank just continues to be watchful.  Currency charts were already crowded with milestones with the euro near ground last trod in May 2016 and sterling at its highest since September. The pound's 1.2 percent jump on Friday was the largest in three months and left it at $1.3106. The was hovering at $1.1448 and not far off major resistance at $1.1489. The U.S. dollar index was at 95.177 having touched its lowest since September. The dollar did regain a little ground on the yen to 112.61 , having shed a big figure on Friday when U.S. data showed surprisingly soft readings for consumer prices and retail sales. The repeated disappointment on prices cast a question mark over the Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation would soon rebound. Slow Motion  It is a mixed picture that is likely to leave the Fed cautious, and it is little wonder markets have lowered the odds of further rate hikes this year,  said ANZ economist David Plank.  Whether it also delays the start of balance sheet normalisation remains to be seen, but we suspect the Fed will want to push on with that for now.  Fed funds futures imply around a 50-50 chance of another hike by December, and have less than two moves priced in for all of next year. Fed policymakers have pencilled in one more rise this year and a further four in 2018. The prospect of a slow-motion Fed dragged Wall Street's favoured gauge of fear, the CBOE Volatility index, to its lowest since December 1993. Periods of market calm favour carry trades since they lessen the risk of sharp and sudden reversals that would stop investors out of their leveraged positions. That encouraged flows into higher-yielding currencies, ranging from the Australian dollar to the Mexican peso and South African rand, and into emerging markets stocks. The Aussie shot to a two-year high and breached major chart resistance in the process in the $0.7700/7778 range. The Aussie was last at $0.7820 with bulls targetting the 200-week moving average around $0.8026.

Choi, the world number two amateur who has a win on the Korean LPGA Tour and a top-10 finish on the LPGA Tour this season, battled fellow South Korean winner Park Sung-hyun to the wire before finishing two shots back.  Well, I mean it will be nice if I could get the money but I think my primary goal was to come here and compete so, to me, getting this second place as runner-up actually means more to me and it's a greater honor for me,  Choi said through an interpreter.  This tournament for me, even if I could just come and play, that alone would be an honor, but on top of that ... I get the runner-up and it is unbelievably joyous thing for me.  Last year Choi was the low amateur, finishing 38th at CordeValle in California. Her performance over the four days at Trump National suggests she will flourish as a professional when she makes the switch. Choi showed her mettle by making birdie at the par-five 15th after a brilliant pitch from deep rough short of the green set up an eight-foot putt. Then, after the crushing disappointment of dunking her tee shot into the water at the par-three 16th led to double-bogey, Choi made birdie at the last to finish a one-under 71 for a nine-under-par total that put her two clear of world number one Ryu So-yeon and another South Korean, Hur Mi-jung. Choi fell just short of becoming only the second amateur to win the championship in its 72 years of existence following then 22-year-old Catherine Lacoste of France, who hoisted the trophy 50 years ago.

DeChambeau, a former amateur champion, sank a 14-foot birdie putt at the final hole to clinch his first PGA Tour victory in style. He stormed home with six back-nine birdies to card 65 and finish at 18-under-par 266 at TPC Deere Run, one stroke ahead of fellow American Patrick Rodgers, who bogeyed the par-five 17th. DeChambeau, 23, is known for his revolutionary approach to the game. He plays with all of his irons the same length, which he believes is a mechanically superior approach. “I’ve been working so hard my whole life to try to do this. To have it happen at the John Deere is incredible,” he told CBS television, tears in his eyes as the emotions spilled out. DeChambeau felt the victory justified his decision to eschew tradition with his scientific approach to the game. “I think that’s the true meaning behind what I try and do,” he said. “I show everybody there’s plenty of ways to do it and I like doing it my way and I feel comfortable doing it my way. Whatever way you want to do it out there, you can do it.” He was thrilled that his victory includes an invitation to the British Open, which starts on Thursday. “I can’t believe it,” he said. Chambeau was an after-thought for most of the final round, timing his run perfectly, an excellent two-putt birdie at the par-five 17th bringing him within one stroke of the lead. He then rifled his approach shot to the par-four 18th, his ball landing just short of the hole before trickling beyond, not as close as he would have liked but not bad under the circumstances. His putt appeared to be sliding off to the right, but it caught the edge of the hole and toppled in, prompting a Tiger Woods-like series of fist pumps as the large gallery went wild. The birdie gave DeChambeau a share of the lead with Rodgers, who minutes later bogeyed the penultimate hole after his approach shot found the green but forced him to chip over a bunker blocking the line to the hole. Rodgers, like DeChambeau, was playing for a spot in the British Open, with the top finisher not already exempt earning a ticket to Royal Birkdale. Rodgers parred the last and had to settle for second place after a round of 70.

Twelve Englishmen currently occupy a place in the top 100 of the world rankings, led by former U.S. Open champion Justin Rose at number 12, the in-form Tommy Fleetwood at 14 and the Arizona-based Paul Casey at 16. Tyrrell Hatton has made rapid recent progress and occupies 23rd spot while Matthew Fitzpatrick is 38th, last year's U.S. Masters winner Danny Willett is 40th and Ross Fisher 46th. Luke Donald (90) failed to qualify but Lee Westwood (57), Chris Wood (63), Andy Sullivan (70) and Ian Poulter (85) go into the third major championship of the year trying to become the first English winner of the Open since Nick Faldo in 1992.  We've never had it so good in England,  Jacklin told Reuters in an interview, repeating a statement made by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan that painted a rosy picture of Britain's economy in 1957.  We've got as big a chance of pulling it off this year as we've ever had. We've got so many world-class players.  Related CoverageRahm raid won't work at Birkdale, says JacklinTony Jacklin's five players to watch at BirkdaleFaldo won each of his three Opens in Scotland and Jacklin was the last Englishman to triumph on home soil when he defeated New Zealander Bob Charles by two strokes at Royal Lytham and St Annes in 1969.  Justin will obviously be our trump card,  said Jacklin,  but I can also see the likes of Fitzpatrick and Sullivan doing well. Steady Players  Those two are the sort of steady players who could thrive on a par-70 course like Birkdale where you need to plot your way around and display plenty of patience.  The last Englishman to win golf's oldest major on home soil before Jacklin was Reg Whitcombe at Royal St George's in 1938. Jacklin, who also lifted the U.S. Open title in 1970 and is Europe's most successful Ryder Cup captain of all time after leading the team to two victories and one tie in four matches between 1983-89, said Birkdale was one of his favorite courses.  It brings back such great memories for me,  said the 73-year-old.  I have a special feeling for Birkdale because I was named Most Valuable Player at the 1969 Ryder Cup there.  I won the most points that week and, of course, it became famous for Jack Nicklaus's last-green concession in his halved singles with me that led to the match finishing in a 16-16 tie.  I also remember producing one of the best putting displays of my career when I finished third as Lee Trevino won the 1971 Open at Birkdale.  Jacklin forged a close relationship with Spain's late, great Seve Ballesteros during his time as Ryder Cup captain. Going back to Birkdale as a spectator next week will also remind the Englishman of the player he referred to as his  one-man army  in the matches against the Americans.  Birkdale was where Seve introduced himself to world golf when he finished joint second with Jack Nicklaus in 1976 behind American Johnny Miller,  said Jacklin, ambassador for the Farmfoods British Par 3 Championship from Aug. 8-11 (britishpar3.com).

Age: 23 World ranking: Three Major wins: 2015 U.S. Masters, 2015 U.S. Open  Birkdale should suit Jordan down to the ground. He is someone who thinks his way around a course and when distance doesn't count, it changes everything for him, because he is a great, great putter.  Those par-70 links are not about strength and power. The total yardage may only be 7,156, not overly long by modern-day standards, but it's a true test of golf.  MATTHEW FITZPATRICK (England) Age 22 World ranking: 38     Major wins: None  Matt is just the sort of player who could do well... He is someone who may just come to the fore.  He is solid off the tee with his driver, is a good putter and has got a calm, steady head. The longer courses they have these days don't really suit his game.  Matt has plenty of top-level experience now and his exposure to pressure when he made his Ryder Cup debut in Minnesota last year will be another asset.  Dustin Johnson (u.s.) Age: 33 World ranking: One Major wins: 2016 U.S. Open  Dustin is a unique talent. He hits the ball vast distances and is so exciting to watch.  If he turns up at Birkdale with his 'A game' then everybody else is playing for second place but I don't think his length off the tee is going to help him much.  Instead of hitting a three-wood, he would be better served taking a four-iron off some tees. It will be interesting to see how he adjusts.  JON RAHM (Spain) Age: 22 World ranking: Eight Major wins: None  Jon may have charged to a six-shot victory at the Irish Open ... but if you play Birkdale the way he played Portstewart, you won't get round it.  The rough there is proper stuff. He hardly found a fairway in the final round but still managed to hit a closing 65.  That's not going to happen at Birkdale. It's too difficult a course. It's not about brute force and power, it's a thinker's course.  JUSTIN ROSE (England) Age: 36 World ranking: 12 Major wins: 2013 U.S. Open  Justin has all the experience in the world and is another of those steady players who is well suited to plotting his way round at Birkdale, avoiding the fairway traps and the knee-high rough, which is a key factor at any British Open.  It was there, of course, where he burst on to the scene in 1998, finishing tied fourth at the age of 17 behind American winner Mark O'Meara. I remember people saying at the time that it was the best result by a British amateur since 1921.       - - - - -  Tony Jacklin is an ambassador for the Farmfoods British Par 3 Championship at Nailcote Hall in Coventry from Aug. 8-11 (britishpar3.com) Editing by Rex Gowar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-open-five-idUSKBN1A204U"}

Rahm, 22, triumphed at Portstewart despite having an unreliable driver and if he is equally as unpredictable off the tee at Royal Birkdale, Jacklin said he will find it tough to stay out of the long rough and the fiendish fairway bunkers.  I love watching guys like Jon,  the 1969 British Open and 1970 U.S. Open champion told Reuters in an interview.  He's a great putter but he won't be able to hit it off the tee and perform like he did last week.  He hardly found a fairway in the final round at Portstewart. He won't be able to find his ball in the rough if he does the same at Birkdale.  Despite being less than impressed with Rahm's long game last Sunday, Jacklin likens the burly 6-foot-2 Spaniard's core strength to that of 18-times major winner Jack Nicklaus.  Rahm is clearly a prodigious talent,  said the 73-year-old Englishman,  and he's got this fiery Latino temperament.  He kicks tee boxes at times but that's about him and a perceived lack of discipline. He's pushing himself to the limit which is marvelous.   His lower body and his hips are reminiscent of Nicklaus at his best, that's where real power comes from, and a three-quarter backswing.  Jacklin said that five-times Open winner Peter Thomson  provided a perfect example of how to tackle the stiff challenge that the par-70 Birkdale layout provides when the Australian won at the Southport links in 1954 and 1965.  I played in that tournament in 1965 and Thomson didn't hit his driver off the tee, he used a three-wood,  he explained.  No one had more patience than he had. Thinker's Course  All he wanted was to get the ball in play. Birkdale is a thinker's course, the sort of layout that the great South African Bobby Locke enjoyed,  added Jacklin referring to the 1949, 1950, 1952 and 1957 Open winner.  It may only be 7,156 yards long but, like all great links courses, you have to stay out of the bunkers and you have to plan your way around.  I don't agree with this modern-day fixation that the authorities have for making courses longer and longer. It's completely insane,  added Jacklin. The last seven majors have all been won by first-time winners -- Jason Day, Danny Willett, Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Jimmy Walker, Sergio Garcia and Brooks Koepka -- and Jacklin believes there is every chance that sequence can be extended to eight.  There is just so much talent around these days,  he said.  It's driven by different factors, all the players now work out at the gym and they all hit it 300 yards plus.  It's a bit foreign to me and my era but the modern clubs and shafts are so good now and all the players benefit from that.  Birkdale, though, is a great, great test of championship golf and it's one of my favorite Open venues,  said Jacklin.  It is steeped in tradition and really tests a player's patience.  The weather, of course, can always vary enormously during an English summer. If you don't get any wind the players can tear it apart but you certainly don't need length at Birkdale.

The emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, had been quoted in May as praising Hamas and saying that Iran was an  Islamic power,  the Post reported. In response, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar said in late May that hackers had posted fake remarks by the emir, an explanation rejected by Gulf states.     The Post reported that U.S. intelligence officials learned last week of newly analyzed information that showed that top UAE government officials discussed the planned hacks on May 23, the day before they occurred.  The officials said it was unclear if the UAE hacked the websites or paid for them to be carried out, the newspaper reported. The Post did not identify the intelligence officials it spoke to for the report. UAE Ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba denied the report in a statement, saying it was  false,  the Post said.  What is true is Qatar’s behavior. Funding, supporting, and enabling extremists from the Taliban to Hamas and Qadafi. Inciting violence, encouraging radicalization, and undermining the stability of its neighbors,  the statement said. The U.S. State Department declined comment in response to a Reuters query. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was previously known to be working with Qatar to probe the hacking.

However, medium- to long-term market development depends on battery technology advancement and charging infrastructure build up. Fitch expects China's e-car penetration to steadily increase from 1.4% in 2016, underpinned by rising retail demand in Tier 1 and large Tier 2 cities, which have license-plate restrictions on internal combustion engine vehicles. These cities contributed around 75% of the e-cars sold in 2016. E-car demand in lower-tier cities should also increase due to tighter regulations on low-speed electric vehicles and greater offerings of cheap, low-end e-cars. Economically developed coastal regions have accounted for a majority share of China's NEV sales due to local governments' deeper pockets for subsidies and more developed charging infrastructure. China's NEV sales volume surged by more than 18-fold from 2013 to 2015, as generous government subsidies fuelled consumer demand and NEV production. However, volume growth fell sharply to around 50% yoy in 2016 after a government crackdown on subsidy fraud. Authorities published an amended NEV subsidy scheme for 2017 to 2020 that includes a subsidy reduction in phases, tighter technical requirements and an extended subsidy collection period. Fitch expects manufacturers to lower vehicle selling prices - gross of subsidies - to partially compensate consumers for the lower subsidies. Headroom for price cuts is sufficient given sound after-subsidy profitability of certain NEVs - especially e-buses - and potential cost savings through economies of scale and battery technology improvement. Fitch expects the number of e-car models made in China to more than double by 2019 and for market competition to intensify. Local and foreign automakers are required to produce NEVs to meet Chinese regulators' stringent fuel-economy targets and passenger vehicle manufacturers will also have to achieve a NEV credit target to avoid financial penalties from 2018 or 2019. The top-10 local manufacturers accounted for more than 96% of 2016 e-car sales volume in China. Sino-foreign joint-venture brands have lagged, but should increase NEV investments in the next five years. China has the world's largest NEV market, accounting for 45% of e-cars and almost all e-buses sold worldwide in 2016. The Shenzhen-based BYD Auto., Ltd. overtook California-based Tesla, Inc. as the world's largest e-car maker by sales volume in 2015. Nine Chinese EV brands ranked among the world's top-20 EV manufacturers by volume in 2016.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued Notice 652 on July 10, which will require DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank to maintain a net stable funding ratio of 100 percent from January 1, 2018. The NSFR, a key reform announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in January 2014, measures a bank's long-term resources over 12 months of liquidity requirements. The aim is to ensure banks can continue to operate when wholesale funding markets are closed for an extended period. During the financial crisis, many global banks struggled to access external funding, severely stressing the banking system. Singapore's three domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) will have to maintain a net stable funding ratio of 100 percent by January 1. Other D-SIBs in Singapore with headquarters offshore will have to meet a minimum NSFR of 50 percent. The city's top banks said they already met the MAS's ratio requirements. “We have adequate stable funds as prescribed by the NSFR standards, and are already holding a comfortable buffer above the regulatory requirements,” said Darren Tan, chief financial officer for OCBC Bank. A DBS Bank spokesperson told IFR the bank's NSFR was above the regulatory requirement for 2018, while an industry source said UOB had been tracking its NSFR for a long time and that the ratio was now well above 100 percent. “Last year, many of the banks were preparing for Basel III in terms of capital and liquidity and with their bond issuances, so a lot has been done to prepare for NSFR,” said Simon Chen, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. “Going forward, further fundraising will be incremental as and when they need it.” Attracting more deposits is one way to beef up NSFRs. Singapore banks' loan-to-deposit ratios range between 84 percent and 87 percent, which is better than Australian banks which average over 100 percent as well as most European names, said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at OCBC. Primary Markets Debt bankers also see opportunities for banks to issue more long-term funding from the market. “It is positive news for the primary bond market,” said one Singapore-based debt capital markets head. “The NSFR rules also allow banks to hold a percentage of corporate bonds as high-quality liquidity assets, which means the banks will provide a larger investor pool.” Taking on corporate debt, however, may have a negative impact in the future. The Basel Committee is now exploring standards under the re-calibrated Basel III standards, dubbed the Basel IV regime by the financial industry. Under those proposed standards, banks holding loans to large corporates may have to allocate more capital. “This is another consideration that is important as it relates to how much capital a bank has to allocate against large loans,” said Eugene Tarzimanov, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s. “The Basel Committee has not finalised work on this yet, but if implemented it will make it more difficult for banks to provide long-term large loans to corporate clients.” The NSFR will complement the Basel Committee's liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which measures a bank's ability to survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 days.

The all-business Park plays with a poker-face intensity and crushes the ball with a flowing power swing that takes dead aim at her target. She goes by the nickname,  Dak Gong,  coined by Korean fans that translates into  just shut your mouth and attack,  she explained through an interpreter after starting the final round three back and winning her first major by two shots.  (Compared) to a lot of Korean female players, I guess I am more aggressive in my play,  said 23-year-old Park.  So fans gave me that nickname last year that I just focus on attack and aggressiveness. And I'm happy for it.  LPGA Tour rookie Park finished with pair of five-under-par rounds of 67 to claim the $900,000 first prize and finish what she started at last year's U.S. Women's Open at CordeValle in California. There she was the 36-hole leader but posted 74-74 in the last two rounds and splashed in the water on the 72nd hole to end up third, two shots from a playoff.  I think compared to last year, I could say that I played probably a little bit more relaxed,  said Park.  Based on that good experience that I had last year, I think I was able to garner the championship this year.  Park's triumph at Trump National Golf Club may have surprised some at the course owned by U.S. President Donald Trump, but would have been no surprise to fans back home. She won seven times on the Korean LPGA (KLPGA) tour last year and this year is the runaway favorite to win LPGA Rookie of the Year honors with four top-10 finishes and a world ranking of 11 coming into the third major of the season. Park's ability to maintain focus is a weapon that matches her obvious talent swinging the clubs.  I think one of the most difficult things is to stay focused and keep that concentration level up because I know firsthand that once you lose it, your play is going to just go sideways.  Park's play was a one-way express lane to victory on Sunday, where she paused only to give a wave and a bow toward Trump on her way from the 18th to the scoring tent.  I did have many winnings in other tournaments, but winning here at the U.S. Open means so much more and for that I am grateful and extremely happy,  said Park, breaking into a rare smile.

When the A's arrived at their clubhouse Sunday morning, they learned that veteran relievers Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson had been traded to the Washington Nationals.  Just seeing that news kind of put a little fire under everybody,  Athletics left-hander Sean Manaea said.  I think they were some of our best relievers.  Manaea (8-5) pitched seven strong innings, allowing two runs and five hits while striking out eight and walking three. He improved to 3-0 in his career against the Indians and beat them for the second time this year. In the three wins, he allowed a combined three runs and 11 hits in 21 innings.  Today was the best game I've had with my slider,  Manaea said.  I'm finally starting to feel comfortable with it, being able to throw it for strikes, being able to throw it 3-2, getting swinging strikes on it. I don't know if they don't see the ball well or what. It's fun going against a really good team and being able to have some success.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at AthleticsCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchJed Lowrie hit his 10th home run of the season for the A's, a solo homer in the third inning. A's rookie Matt Chapman, who hit his first two career major league homers on Saturday night, went 1-for-3 with a double that hit high off the left-center field wall. He also walked and scored a run. Ryon Healy, rookie Jacob Brugman and Matt Joyce each drove in two runs. Indians right-hander Trevor Bauer (7-8) gave up four runs and four hits in two-thirds of an inning, matching his shortest career start. He struck out two, walked three and threw 43 pitches. When Bauer faced the A's on May 30 at Progressive Field, he struck out a career-high 14 in seven innings of a 9-4 victory.  I had no feel for anything I was throwing, no feel for how my body was moving, where the ball was going,  Bauer said. Francisco Lindor went 4-for-4 with three doubles and scored a run for the Indians. Abraham Almonte hit a solo home run in the ninth, his second of the season. The A's sent nine batters to the plate in the first inning as they built a 4-0 lead.  I think the runs early were big for us,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Whenever you say goodbye to a couple of guys like that, there's certainly some sentiment that runs through the clubhouse, so I think that runs early on in the game were really important for us.  Joyce opened the first with a single, and Bauer walked Marcus Semien. With one out, Bauer walked Khris Davis to load the bases. Bauer struck out Lowrie, but Healy lined a two-run single to right. Bauer walked Chapman, reloading the bases, and Brugman lined an opposite-field, two-run single to left.  Oh, boy, you walk three, and six of the eight hitters he faced get on base,  Cleveland manager Terry Francona said of Bauer.  It was a shame because he got to two outs and an 0-2, but he just wasn't locating, he didn't know where he was throwing his fastball, and the 0-2, throwing it pretty much down the middle, and then at 40-something pitches you really start to worry that that's too much.  Lowrie made it 5-0 in the third when he launched a leadoff home run into the right field seats off reliever Dan Otero. Cleveland cut Oakland's lead to 5-2 in the fourth. Brandon Guyer led off with a walk and moved to third on Lindor's double to right center. Michael Brantley followed with a two-run single to center. In the top of the seventh, the Indians had runners on first and third with two outs, but Melvin left Manaea in the game and he struck out Guyer for the second straight time with his season-high 115th pitch.  We leaned on him a little bit harder, which we probably will with some of our starters,  Melvin said.  He's a guy that's up for that now and has matured into that role where even though it's the tying run and he's got 113 or whatever it is pitches. At that point in time, that was his game. I think he takes away a lot from that, too. He knows we have that kind of confidence in him.  NOTES: The A's traded LHP Sean Doolittle and RHP Ryan Madson to the Washington Nationals as they continued what executive vice president for baseball operations Billy Beane called a complete  rebuild.  The A's received RHP Blake Treinen and two highly touted minor-league prospects, SS/3B Sheldon Neuse and LHP Jesus Luzardo. Treinen is expected to report to Oakland on Monday. ... The A's selected RHP Simon Castro from Triple-A Nashville, and he allowed one run and two hits with three strikeouts in the ninth inning. ... A's RHP Jharel Cotton (right thumb blister) will make a rehab appearance Wednesday for Triple-A Nashville. He has been on the disabled list since July 4 but threw a bullpen session with no issues. RHP Chris Smith will fill in again for Cotton on Tuesday against Tampa Bay. ... Indians RHP Danny Salazar (right shoulder soreness) pitched six scoreless innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Columbus. He allowed three hits, struck out nine and walked three. ... Indians OF Austin Jackson (strained left quad) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus.

A draft legislation released by the government on Monday, if passed, will help the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) dial down some of the risky lending in the A$1.7 trillion ($1.33 trillion) mortgage market, the size of the country's economic output.  Australia's four biggest banks have already cut back on home loans in recent months and pulled away from institutional lending to real estate developers, as regulators force them to keep aside more capital and slow lending to speculative property investors. Non-bank lenders have been quick to pick up the slack, with their loan-books expanding at a much faster clip than the banking sector's 6.5 percent overall credit growth. This development is stoking concerns for authorities as a combination of record-high property prices and stratospheric household debt sit uncomfortably with slow wages growth.  APRA does not have powers over the lending activities of non-bank lenders, even where they materially contribute to financial stability risks,  Treasurer Scott Morrison and financial services minister Kelly O'Dwyer said in a joint statement.  Today, the government is releasing draft legislation for public consultation that will provide APRA with new powers. These new powers will allow APRA to manage the financial stability risks posed by the activities of non-bank lenders, complementing APRA's current powers.  The consultation of the draft bill will close on Aug.14. To be sure, the size of Australia's shadow banking sector is puny, at around 6 percent of financial system assets, and is relatively smaller than in a number of large economies.  Non-banks account for about 1 percent of Australian mortgage lending which is dominated by the so called  Big Four  - Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ Banking Group. The quartet together control more than 80 percent of the country's lending and deposits.  In a separate statement on Monday, Morrison and O'Dwyer said the government was also seeking to lift the prohibition on the use of the word 'bank', in a bid to make the sector more competitive.  New entrants to the Australian banking market face a simple but significant obstacle – the prohibition on the use of the word 'bank',  they said.  This acts to discourage innovative new players from entering the market.  Separately, local media is speculating the APRA will announce new capital rules for major banks this week as it moves to make them  unquestionably strong  in the event of another global financial crisis.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $49.08 per barrel at 0126 GMT, up 17 cents, or 0.35 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.70 per barrel, up 16 cents, or 0.34 percent. Both crudes extended gains from a strong previous week. Traders and analysts said the rising prices were a result of strong demand as well as signs that a relentless climb in U.S. oil production was slowing down.  Last week's strong draw on U.S. oil inventories was supported by comments from the IEA that demand is growing stronger than they had initially estimated ...

I owe the Giants a lot,  the 27-year-old said Sunday. Well, he has a strange way of showing it. Sanchez rocketed a three-run homer off Jeff Samardzija in the bottom of the first inning Sunday to propel the Padres to a 7-1 victory over the Giants in the rubber match of a three-game series at Petco Park. The 421-foot rocket to right on a one-ball changeup came 12 1/2 hours after Sanchez broke up a 3-3 tie with a two-run, walk-off homer in the bottom of the ninth inning. That blast landed on the third balcony of the Western Metal Supply Co. building.  It's kind of fun,  Sanchez said of his back-to-back decisive blasts.  I like the opportunity. I'm just trying to do my best.  Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PadresSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchHis best comes out against his former team. Since he departed the Bay Area, Sanchez is 8-for-16 against the Giants with four homers and 11 RBIs. Three of his five homers this season have come against San Francisco -- the first of which tied a game the Padres eventually won, and the last two qualifying as game-winners. Sanchez, who started the past two games because Austin Hedges was woozy after taking a foul tip off the mask Friday night, is 4-for-11 with three homers and eight RBIs against the Giants this season. Against anyone else, he is 5-for-35 with two homers and five RBIs. When asked what he liked about Sanchez's at-bats the last two games against the Giants, Padres manager Andy Green replied:  Home runs.  Sanchez was far from the Padres' only standout Sunday as they ran their record to 14-5 against San Francisco after losing the first nine meetings with the Giants to start the 2016 season. Cory Spangenberg also hit a three-run homer in the third inning off Samardzija (4-11). The Giants right-hander was ahead 0-and-2 in the count after Spangenberg fouled off the previous pitch on a safety squeeze. Spangenberg then drove a fastball 410 feet, easily clearing the fence in straightaway center.  This has got to stop,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of opposing teams' success on 0-and-2 pitches.  I don't know if I need to pitch out every time on 0-and-2 or what. This is happening too many times.  They're trying to get one run in and get away with getting a three-run homer after that failed. It seems like the more we make it an issue, the more mistakes we make. We've talked about it. We've done fines. I'm sure it is a pitch he'd like to have back.  Samardzija said of his 0-and-2 mistake,  I watched Spangenberg chase a bunch of balls up in the series, so I was going for the strikeout there just because you know, one out, you can try to go for the double play. But I thought if I can get the strikeout there ... that's a frustrating pitch. ... Get it up another six inches and it's an out.  Samardzija finished strong. After Spangenberg's homer, he retired 10 of the last 11 Padres he faced, but the score was already 7-1. He wound up charged with seven runs on nine hits and no walks in six innings. Samardzija struck out eight. Padres starter Trevor Cahill (4-3) held the Giants to one run on eight hits and a walk over 6 2/3 innings. He also fanned eight.  My stuff stayed the same throughout the game,  Cahill said.  My last pitch was as good as my first pitch. Getting the four-run lead in the first was huge. And they were aggressive, I didn't have many deep counts.  The Padres scored four in the first against Samardzija, who entered the game with a 2.04 career ERA at Petco Park. With one out, Samardzija hit Carlos Asuaje with a pitch. Wil Myers followed with a single, ending a 2-for-14 slump. Sanchez then drove the second pitch he saw from Samardzija into the right field seats. After Samardzija struck out Jabari Blash, Spangenberg tripled to right-center and scored on Erick Aybar's single into the right field corner. The Giants pulled to within 4-1 when Posey and Brandon Crawford opened the top of the second with back-to-back doubles. However, Cahill avoided further damage in the inning by striking out Nick Hundley and Joe Panik before retiring Samardzija on a comebacker. Myers and Sanchez opened the Padres' third with back-to-back singles. After Samardzija again struck out Blash, Spangenberg connected on his sixth homer of the season to make it 7-1. NOTES: Giants 1B Brandon Belt was a late scratch from the lineup due to a sprained left wrist. Belt injured the wrist Saturday night on a checked swing. He is listed as day-to-day. Buster Posey moved to first base Sunday, and Nick Hundley caught. ... Padres C Austin Hedges missed a second consecutive game after taking a foul tip on the face of his mask Friday night. Padres manager Andy Green said team doctors described the injury as  sub-concussive  and said he expects Hedges to be back in the lineup Monday as San Diego opens a three-game series in Colorado. ... The Giants return home to face the Cleveland Indians on Monday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-giants-padres-writethru-idUSMTZED7H7IW5YD"}

Viewpoint  seeks to provide a single source of all non-rating action commentary for investors interested in the current themes and market activity surrounding rated entities in APAC. In this edition, Fitch published a total of 31 topical comments on various sectors across APAC, with 17 focusing on China. Major highlights on China include our view that the housing market is likely to cool in light of the increasing curbs on home purchases; that a growing reliance on puttable bonds could place pressure on the corporate sector over the next few years; that the recovery in retail sales is encouraging but uncertainties prevail; and that an oversupply in the steel and coal sectors is likely to persist in the medium term. Specifically in China's energy & utilities sector, we commented that the State Council's efforts to manage coal prices and electricity tariffs could benefit independent power producers and coal mines; that a fall in hydrocarbon production is not likely to reverse in 2017 despite the Chinese national oil companies' higher 2017 capex budgets; and that the city-gas operators are likely to continue growing with strong fundamentals. In India, a key highlight is our view that the Indian steel producers' profitability is likely to be enhanced by the government's support measures. In Indonesia, we highlight that overcapacity will continue to restrain growth in cement producers' profitability, notwithstanding a recovery in cement sales thanks to stronger investment in infrastructure projects.

Landau died at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles on Saturday from unexpected complications during a short hospitalization for an undisclosed illness, publicist Dick Guttman said in a statement on Sunday.   His long career had remarkable ups and downs. He delivered acclaimed performances in movies by top directors including Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen and Tim Burton, was nominated three times for Oscars, and co-starred in the spy series  Mission: Impossible  in the 1960s alongside then-wife Barbara Bain.  But during career doldrums, the New York-born Landau languished in third-rate projects such as the laughable 1981 TV movie  The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island  and the dispensable 1983 mutant monster movie  The Being.   You know, I've always felt, pound for pound, I'm one of the best guys around; but you get stuck in people's eyes in a certain way, and it takes an imaginative director who will look at you and realize you can play different kinds of parts because you are an actor,  Landau told the New York Times in 1988.  I don't like to sound immodest but I believe in what I can do.  Landau was named best supporting actor for his portrayal in  Ed Wood  of the fading, morphine-addicted Hungarian horrormeister Lugosi, star of  Dracula.  The quirky cast in Burton's homage to fabled bad-movie director Wood included Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker and wrestler George  The Animal  Steele.  It's impossible to overestimate the job that Landau does here as this sepulchral Hungarian,  Washington Post critic Hal Hinson wrote in his review of the 1994 film.  Both vocally and physically, he's simply astounding.  After winning the Oscar in March 1995, Landau gushed:  My God! What a night. What a life. What a moment. What everything!  FILE PHOTO -  Actor Martin Landau smiles as he arrives at the 2012 Vanity Fair Oscar party in West Hollywood, California February 26, 2012.Danny Moloshok/File PhotoThe tall, lanky Landau also was nominated for Oscars as best supporting actor for his role as a visionary carmaker's partner in Coppola's 1988  Tucker: The Man and His Dream  - the role that revived his career - and as a man who kills his mistress in Allen's 1989  Crimes and Misdemeanors.  Not Mr. Spock Slideshow (8 Images)Landau also is remembered for a role he did not get. He was  Star Trek  creator Gene Roddenberry's first pick to portray pointy-eared Vulcan Mr. Spock, an iconic role that eventually went to Leonard Nimoy. Nimoy then replaced Landau on  Mission: Impossible  when he left in a salary dispute. Landau was friends in the 1950s with screen legends James Dean and Steve McQueen and studied under famed  method acting  proponent Lee Strasberg. His career included diverse roles in films, television and stage and was still going strong in the 2010s.  Early in his career, he made an impression with a villainous turn in director Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1959 thriller  North by Northwest.  His character, a henchman who menaces star Cary Grant, meets his demise beneath the Mount Rushmore busts of U.S. presidents. It was the role of master of disguise Rollin Hand on  Mission: Impossible  that propelled Landau to stardom. He was married to co-star Bain from 1957 until their divorce in 1993. In 1968, Landau took the Golden Globe award as best male television star. He also co-starred with Bain in the 1970s sci-fi series  Space: 1999  and appeared in Rod Serling's acclaimed series  The Twilight Zone.  In 2011, he lent his voice to an episode of the venerable animated series  The Simpsons.

The views expressed are his own) Saudi Arabia is trying to support oil prices by reducing its crude shipments to the United States in a bid to cut the amount of oil in commercial storage. U.S. crude imports from Saudi Arabia averaged less than 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the four weeks ending on July 7, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia are running at the slowest rate since 2015, and the slowest for the time of year for over five years (tmsnrt.rs/2tM4mAO and tmsnrt.rs/2thOpza). Imports from Saudi Arabia will fall even further to less than 800,000 bpd in August, according to a Saudi industry source familiar with the kingdom's oil policy.  Saudi Arabia is keen to see an improvement in the oil market and accelerate the balancing process,  the source told Reuters on Wednesday ( Saudis to cut August oil exports to lowest level this year , Reuters, July 12). Saudi Arabia is cutting exports to all destinations but reducing shipments to the United States is especially important because U.S. stocks are the most visible and have the biggest impact on prices. The United States accounts for more than 40 percent of the commercial crude and product stocks held in the OECD and its stocks are reported weekly rather than monthly as in most other countries. U.S. crude and product stocks therefore receive disproportionate attention from oil traders and analysts, and can have a major impact on global oil prices. Changes in U.S. crude and products stocks are often (misleadingly) interpreted to reflect changes in the global supply-demand balance. Saudi Arabia is the largest supplier of crude oil to the United States after Canada, providing an average of 1.1 million bpd to U.S. refiners in 2016. By restricting shipments, Saudi Arabia hopes to reduce U.S. stocks and demonstrate to skeptical traders that the long-awaited rebalancing of the global market is finally underway. The strategy seems to have had some early success with U.S. crude stocks falling earlier and faster than normal so far in the second and third quarters of 2017. U.S. crude stocks have fallen by 40 million barrels since the end of March, compared with a drawdown of just 8 million barrels over the same period in 2016. U.S. crude stocks are now just 3 million barrels higher than at the same point in 2016, compared with 35 million barrels higher at the end of March. Most of the drawdown in crude stocks is attributable to record refinery runs but slower imports likely played an important supporting role. Senior officials from Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC are hoping U.S. stocks will continue to decline rapidly through the rest of the summer driving season. Saudi Arabia plans to use big stock draws to convince the oil market that rebalancing is happening and oil prices and calendar spreads need to rise. The strategy has a fair chance of success but it could be threatened by rising U.S. imports from other OPEC and non-OPEC members or a diversion of Saudi shipments from the United States to other markets. While Saudi Arabia's crude shipments to the United States have fallen, Iraq's shipments have risen to their highest seasonal level in almost five years (tmsnrt.rs/2thBJYM). The International Energy Agency reports compliance with OPEC's production agreement declined sharply in June to its lowest level in six months ( Oil Market Report , IEA, July 2017). OPEC output rose from Nigeria and Libya, which are not capped by the agreement, and as a result of weakening compliance among other members. Some of this extra crude could end up refilling U.S. storage tanks, which would undercut Saudi efforts to drain them. Oil traders will also be alert for any signs crude shipments are being diverted causing stocks to grow in other less visible locations. Beyond August, there are questions about what happens to shipments and stocks when the U.S. driving season finishes and Saudi Arabia and Iraq start burning less crude as the summer air-conditioning season winds down. For now, though, OPEC hopes traders will interpret a sustained draw in U.S. crude stocks as a sign the market is rebalancing and that prices need to move higher.

The Warrick smelter in Indiana has annual capacity of 269,000 tonnes, its own coal-based power source and is integrated with a rolling mill.  None of which saved it from Alcoa's scramble down the cost curve in the face of falling prices, culminating in its permanent closure in January 2016.  That's different from what the industry calls a  curtailment , a temporary idling for possible restart.  But now, miraculously, Warrick is back and Alcoa will fire up three of the plant's five production lines, with capacity of 161,400 tonnes of aluminum. The other two will be classified as  curtailed . The timing of this resurrection is politically charged.  The Trump administration is determined to curb imports of aluminum, along with steel, with the aid of some heavy national security artillery. The results of both so-called Section 232 investigations are pending. And Alcoa, for one,  appreciates the actions the Trump administration has taken to address the challenges faced by the U.S. aluminum industry, including Chinese overcapacity .  The United States had 23 operating plants in 1998. It now has five, soon to be become six. There is a little more than a million tonnes of capacity lying idled, ready for restart if the conditions are right.  However, most of the lost smelters are long past the point of resurrection, with plants dismantled and sites reclaimed. China, with its massive aluminum sector and equally massive exports, stands accused, but the real smelter killers were much closer to home.   Price and Power Alcoa's change of mind is in part down to the aluminum price, which has risen from below $1,500 a tonne in January 2016 to more than $1,900 today. It has done so, ironically, on the promise of Chinese capacity cuts.  But there is also a power supply dimension, Alcoa noting an agreement with local utility Vectren to operate one of the four on-site power generation units through 2023.  This, Alcoa says,  provides important clarity for the power portfolio at Warrick , albeit without providing a lot of clarity for the rest of us.  The key point, however, is that there is always a power dimension in the mix when aluminum smelters close or restart. They use a lot of it and profitability is determined primarily by the interaction of power and aluminum prices.  West Coast Killer It was the breakdown in that relationship in 2000-01 that dealt the killer blow for the 10 smelters feeding off the power generated by hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  One of the more interesting submissions to the Section 232 hearings on aluminum imports came from Tim Belden of EnergyGPS Consulting. Belden used the events of 2000-01 to underline the importance of power availability and price in determining smelter viability.  Those were the years now known as the Western U.S. Energy Crisis, when California was hit by blackouts and wholesale power prices went supernova. The price rises, Belden says, were  of a magnitude and duration that had never been seen before or since in any North American power market . All ten aluminum smelters closed. Five never restarted. Two tried and failed. Only one, Alcoa's Intalco plant in Washington, is currently producing aluminum, albeit after multiple near-death experiences.  The West Coast power crisis was caused by a toxic combination of too little generation capacity, a chaotic pricing model and the machinations of traders who manipulated the flawed system.  So, if you want to know who killed the northwest aluminum smelters, it was Enron.  That flawed company was at the front of the line for official sanction. In June 2003 it was stripped by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of some of its power and gas trading rights for its role in the crisis.  Financial Killer While Enron killed the West Coast smelters in 2000, bankers killed another batch a decade later. The global financial crisis brought a collapse in aluminum demand as the U.S. automotive industry went into meltdown. Prices slumped and London-traded aluminum hit a low of $1,279 a tonne early in 2009.  By the end of that year another four plants had halted production: Alcoa's smelters in Texas and Tennessee, Century Aluminum's Ravenswood smelter in West Virginia and Glencore's Columbia Falls smelter in Montana. The latter was a survivor of the earlier power crisis.  Another, Ormet's Hannibal plant in Ohio, limped on but never fully recovered and gave up the ghost in 2012. Made in the u.s., Powered in the u.s.  It's the remaining nine plants, three of them still inactive, that are now fighting for survival against what is the relatively new threat of Chinese overproduction.  While China doesn't export aluminum in commodity form, it ships out a lot of semi-manufactured products, which displace demand for the rest of the world's producers, not least in the United States.  That could change if the Section 232 investigation results in import quotas or tariffs.  How much of the battered U.S. smelter sector could be brought out of mothballs?  Alcoa and Century between them are running only two of their combined five operating smelters at capacity. Including the two lines on standby at Warrick, idled capacity at active plants is about 420,000 tonnes.  There is another 640,000 tonnes of capacity at three inactive plants.  The New Madrid smelter in Missouri was last year bought out of bankruptcy by Swiss-based ARG International AG, led by former Glencore trader Matt Lucke, with the aim of restarting the 263,000 tonne a year plant.  Alcoa has idled capacity at Wenatchee in Washington, another  Enron survivor , and at Rockdale in Texas. Yes, the same Texas smelter that shut up shop in 2008. Alcoa closed permanently two of its six lines in 2012 but four, with capacity of 191,000 tonnes, are still primed for restart.  Old smelters, it seems, can sleep for a long time. But to awaken, they need the right power price as much as the right aluminum price.  And it is  competitive power  that will determine the extent of any U.S. aluminum smelter revival.  That is why Alcoa has been able to bring back Warrick.   We were pleased to play an important role in helping make this a reality,  said Carl Chapman, chairman, president and CEO of power utility Vectren. It will likely determine ARG's success in bringing back to life what has been renamed that Magnitude 7 Metals smelter.  Missouri lawmakers passed a bill in May, freeing up utilities to enter longer-term, lower-priced supply contracts, offering the plant a potential lifeline.  The Trump administration wants more aluminum to be made in the United States, and import tariffs would tilt the playing field in that direction.  But when it comes to aluminum,  made in the America  needs to be powered in America -- and that's down to local utilities, not national policy.

The views expressed are his own.) U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies are paying more to hire drilling rigs as the number of rigs still idle after the slump declines. Drilling costs were up by 8 percent in June 2017 compared with their recent low in November 2016, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published on Thursday. The rise in drilling costs has barely started to reverse the previous 34 percent decline reported between March 2014 and November 2016, but it does mark an important turning point in the oilfield services costs cycle. Drilling costs have been rising year-on-year since March and in June were almost 3 percent higher than in the corresponding month a year earlier (tmsnrt.rs/2uqzdEI). Services costs are cyclical and follow changes in the rig count with a lag of a few months, but so far cost increases have been very modest compared with the resurgence in drilling activity (tmsnrt.rs/2uqx9wG). The number of active rigs has more than doubled over the last year, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes, while costs have risen by less than 3 percent. Drilling costs have remained low as rig owners have engaged in deep discounting to win contracts following the worst slump for more than a generation. In the early summer of 2016, there were 2,100 rigs available for use in the United States, but just 455 were operating, according to an annual census conducted by National Oilwell Varco (NOV)(tmsnrt.rs/2uZgrBz). NOV defines a rig as  available  as one that is currently active or ready to drill without significant capital expenditure ( 63rd Annual Rig Census , NOV, 2016). The utilization rate of 22 percent was the lowest in over six decades, and down from 51 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2tQrBtT). To be considered still available, a land rig must not have been idle for more than three years, or five in the case of offshore units. Badly damaged rigs, those which have been cannibalized for spare parts, and any in long-term storage are excluded. The large number of idled rigs last year sparked fierce competition among operators and intense discounting to secure contracts. As a result, exploration and production companies were able to lock in very favorable drilling rates for 2017 in the second half of 2016. But the drilling boom has significantly reduced the number of idle rigs and given rig contractors more pricing power. The number of active rigs has climbed from a cycle low of just 404 at the end of May 2016 to 952 in early July 2017. The utilization rate is now well over 40 percent, which is still low by historic standards, but no longer at emergency levels. The rigs which are still idle are mostly older, less powerful, less sophisticated and likely less productive. As the rig count continues to increase, and contracts negotiated during 2016 expire, drilling firms are likely to push for significant price increases. Oilfield services costs are therefore set to rise in the second half of 2017 and especially in 2018 unless the drilling boom slows.

The LBMA said it expected IBA to take over the LBMA Silver Price in autumn this year, confirming a Reuters report. A race to provide the auction process that sets the benchmark, for which the LBMA owns the intellectual property rights, narrowed to two potential providers, ICE and the London Metal Exchange, earlier this year.  ICE is the operator of the LBMA Gold Price benchmark, which is set via an electronic auction. The exchange introduced clearing of business transacted during the auction in April. For silver, ICE offered a model with clearing, while the LME proposed a flexible auction process.  Our centrally cleared model has already enabled broader participation and we continue to expand the gold auction. We anticipate this will support expanded participation in silver as well,  IBA President Finbarr Hutcheson said in a statement.  Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion dealer Sharps Pixley, described IBA as  a solid and safe choice .  They've demonstrated that they can manage the job well,  Norman said. The LBMA said in March that the current incumbents, CME Group and Thomson Reuters, were stepping down from providing the auction process less than three years after they successfully bid to provide it.  The benchmark is used by silver producers and consumers globally to price contracts. Its previous incarnation, the 117-year-old London silver  fix , ended in 2014 after its operators said they would stop running the telephone-based auction.  The new electronic benchmark has been plagued in the past by big swings away from the underlying spot price, which traders have attributed to a lack of liquidity and an unwillingness on the part of the banks taking part in the auction to adjust orders once the process has started. The gold benchmark also experienced large, unpredictable fluctuations after some banks left the auction in April following the introduction of clearing.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2uqzdEI * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2uqx9wG * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2uZgrBz * Chart 4: tmsnrt.rs/2tQrBtT By John Kemp LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies are paying more to hire drilling rigs as the number of rigs still idle after the slump declines. Drilling costs were up by 8 percent in June 2017 compared with their recent low in November 2016, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published on Thursday. The rise in drilling costs has barely started to reverse the previous 34 percent decline reported between March 2014 and November 2016, but it does mark an important turning point in the oilfield services costs cycle. Drilling costs have been rising year-on-year since March and in June were almost 3 percent higher than in the corresponding month a year earlier (tmsnrt.rs/2uqzdEI). Services costs are cyclical and follow changes in the rig count with a lag of a few months, but so far cost increases have been very modest compared with the resurgence in drilling activity (tmsnrt.rs/2uqx9wG). The number of active rigs has more than doubled over the last year, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes, while costs have risen by less than 3 percent. Drilling costs have remained low as rig owners have engaged in deep discounting to win contracts following the worst slump for more than a generation. In the early summer of 2016, there were 2,100 rigs available for use in the United States, but just 455 were operating, according to an annual census conducted by National Oilwell Varco (NOV)(tmsnrt.rs/2uZgrBz). NOV defines a rig as  available  as one that is currently active or ready to drill without significant capital expenditure ( 63rd Annual Rig Census , NOV, 2016). The utilisation rate of 22 percent was the lowest in over six decades, and down from 51 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2tQrBtT). To be considered still available, a land rig must not have been idle for more than three years, or five in the case of offshore units. Badly damaged rigs, those which have been cannibalized for spare parts, and any in long-term storage are excluded. The large number of idled rigs last year sparked fierce competition among operators and intense discounting to secure contracts. As a result, exploration and production companies were able to lock in very favourable drilling rates for 2017 in the second half of 2016. But the drilling boom has significantly reduced the number of idle rigs and given rig contractors more pricing power. The number of active rigs has climbed from a cycle low of just 404 at the end of May 2016 to 952 in early July 2017. The utilisation rate is now well over 40 percent, which is still low by historic standards, but no longer at emergency levels. The rigs which are still idle are mostly older, less powerful, less sophisticated and likely less productive. As the rig count continues to increase, and contracts negotiated during 2016 expire, drilling firms are likely to push for significant price increases. Oilfield services costs are therefore set to rise in the second half of 2017 and especially in 2018 unless the drilling boom slows.

Cron has spent almost as much time in Salt Lake City as he has Anaheim in 2017. He was sent down to the Los Angeles Angels' Triple-A affiliate at the end of April after driving in only three runs in 16 starts. He was recalled in May, got six starts and was sent out again. He was recalled in June, went 6-for-36 and was handed another boarding pass to the minors. Now he hopes he's back to stay. Cron hit a pinch-hit, two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning Sunday, the first pinch-hit home run by the Angels in 2017, to give them a 4-3 win to salvage the last game of a series with the Tampa Bay Rays. Cron hit the first pitch he saw from Rays left-handed reliever Adam Kolarek, a line drive down the right-field line that was caught by a fan in the first row of seats. It was only his fifth at-bat since being recalled July 9. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AngelsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch It's been awhile since I had an at-bat, so I wanted to be aggressive when I got a chance,  Cron, a first-round pick in 2011, said.  It's good to help the team win a game. It makes you feel like you are part of the team.  The win was just the third in nine games for the Angels but their first in the second half of the season at a time when they were in danger of falling five games below .500 for the first time this year. The right-handed-hitting Cron batted .278 with 16 home runs and 69 RBI last season, but his slow start forced the Angels to consider other options. For now, he's in a platoon with left-handed hitter Luis Valbuena.  It's tough for any guy, young or old, when you get in maybe two games a week,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He made the most of his opportunity today. We've been looking for any kind of contribution from first base this season.  Cron's home run was the key moment, but the Angels had several on a day with a must-win feel. Rookie Parker Bridwell, who has also been on the Salt Lake-Anaheim shuttle this season, went 6 1/3 innings, allowing six hits, one of them a two-run homer by Logan Morrison (his 26th). He struck out a career-high eight before leaving the game. Bridwell has held the opponent to two runs or less in five of his six starts this season and looks like he's locked in a spot in the rotation.  This was the kind of effort I think I can repeat,  he said,  keep the hitters off-balance and throw my off-speed and fastballs for strikes.  Albert Pujols had a two-out RBI single, the first hit with a runner in scoring position by an Angel in their last 16 opportunities. They're hitting .099 with runners in scoring position in their last 15 games. Catcher Martin Maldonado also dropped a successful squeeze bunt that scored the second run. The Rays scored a run and had the bases loaded in the ninth against closer Bud Norris when shortstop Andrelton Simmons made a nice pickup and relay of a hard-hit grounder by Tim Beckham for a game-ending double play. Simmons also had three hits. The loss snapped Tampa Bay's four-game winning streak, but manager Kevin Cash still felt good after winning the series.  We lost, which stinks, but it happens,  he said.  I just liked the way we responded in the ninth. I tip my cap to Simmons on that double play.  Rays starter Chris Archer had an uncharacteristic day, walking three batters in the first two innings and five total in his six innings. It was the most walks he has allowed in a game since Cleveland had six on May 15. He has allowed three walks or less in 17 of his 20 starts this season.  He didn't have his usual command, obviously, but I thought he did a nice job battling,  Cash said.  He made several big pitches when he needed. I can't complain about two runs in six innings.  Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria had three hits to extend his hitting streak to nine. Morrison and Steve Souza Jr. had two each, with Souza extending his hitting streak to 12. The Rays used three hits in the ninth against closer Bud Norris to trim the margin to a run on a Longoria double and singles by Morrison and Souza. Norris walked Brad Miller to load the bases but induced Beckham to hit into a game-ending double play. NOTES: Angels RHP Parker Bridwell was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City to start. His demotion was a personnel maneuver to work around the All-Star break and he didn't make an appearance with the Bees. ... The Angels designated 2B Danny Espinosa for assignment. Acquired from Washington in an offseason trade, Espinosa hit .162 in 77 games with six home runs, 29 RBIs and 91 strikeouts in 228 at-bats. The Angeles will platoon Nick Franklin and Cliff Pennington at second base. ... Rays C Wilson Ramos sat out his second game after suffering a slight strain in his hamstring in Friday's win over the Angels. ... INF Tim Beckham returned to the starting lineup after being activated from the DL. He was 1-for-4 with two strikeouts and is hitting .205 in his last 10 games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED7H7HJTW7"}

It is slow, hot, often frustrating work, ranging from overseeing basic infantry training to trying to create modern logistics systems for an army in which many soldiers cannot read or write.      There are enormous challenges ahead,  said Brig. Gen. Roger Turner, who led a task force in Helmand five years ago and who has returned as commander of around 300 Marines training and advising the Afghan army and police. When the Marines left Helmand in 2014, they did not expect to return, but building the Afghan army has been slower than anticipated. Many issues trainers focus on, such as improving army leadership or getting troops off vulnerable checkpoints, are ones American advisers have recommended for years. Insurgents control five of Helmand's 14 districts and contest the others, threatening the capital Lashkar Gah, where they have a strong foothold just outside the city center. Afghan forces are suffering thousands of casualties and without near-daily air strikes by U.S. fighters and helicopters, said Colonel Asmatullah Gharwal, intelligence officer for the Afghan army 215th Corps,  we would probably not be able to defend Helmand province.   With U.S. commanders declaring that Afghanistan faces  stalemate , the Pentagon is expected to add between 3,000-5,000 troops to more than 13,000 coalition forces already there though there are no signs it plans to send them into combat. That would leave the task essentially unchanged - not to defeat the Taliban but to get Afghan forces to a point where they can fight alone and force the insurgents to negotiate. For Turner, the key is improving army leadership, an issue U.S. advisers have stressed constantly but with mixed success since the NATO-led coalition ended combat operations in 2014. For years, the government's hold on Helmand, one of the world's major opium-producing regions, has been undermined by corruption reaching to the senior ranks of the military. The last commander of the 215th Corps, appointed to clean up the unit last year, was arrested after stealing his own soldiers' food and firewood. But the Americans have been impressed by his successor, General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, a former commando who has replaced about 50 senior officers. Turner said the government in Kabul was now more serious about replacing ineffective leaders.   When we were here before, you could have a completely ineffective leader in position and you'd pretty much just have to deal with it.    Doing Their Job  Camp Bastion, the dusty patch of tents, containers and barbed wire where the Marines are based, is a shadow of the sprawling complex coalition troops occupied at the height of the war when more than 100,000 of them fought the Taliban. Instead of conducting combat patrols, as many did on previous deployments, Turner's Marines work with Afghans, training soldiers and helping plan and carry out missions to defend the province.  The first thing, as with anything, is re-establishing security,  said Col. Matthew Reid, Turner's second-in-command, adding that while Lashkar Gah had been held,  the outlying districts have been more at risk than anticipated.  Although they are no longer normally in combat, so-called  green-on-blue  insider attacks by Afghan soldiers remain a threat. U.S. advisers were also closely involved in recent Afghan reinforcement and resupply operations in the heavily contested towns of Sangin and Marjah, scene of one of the biggest battles the Marines fought in Afghanistan, when they were there in 2010. Both operations were judged by the advisers as big successes, involving considerable planning and preparation and clearing dozens of roadside bombs. For the Marines, such successes should encourage local forces to get off checkpoints and onto the offensive, where they generally suffer far fewer casualties, although many in the Afghan army would clearly welcome more support.  We lost five districts to the Taliban,  said Col. Gharwal of the 215th Corps.  If we have ground forces with us from the Marine Corps to clear these districts, then I am sure we will have very good security.  That is unlikely to happen without a major strategic shift from Washington. Meanwhile, the Marines work with Afghan instructors, teaching everything from clearing mines to coordinating mortar fire.  I was excited to come back to Helmand,  said Staff Sergeant George Caldwell, as he watched soldiers practising raiding a house.  The way they conduct operations now is completely different. I can see the improvement from five years ago.  Many questions remain about whether Afghanistan's mix of corruption and political dysfunction will outweigh any progress made and whether after 16 years of American presence in Afghanistan, a new approach is needed. But in Helmand, the Marines leave those questions for others.  I'm a big believer in everyone doing their job as well as they can,  Turner said.  That's how I reconcile this stuff and make sure we don't lose focus on issues beyond our control.

It was Hamlin's third win at NHMS.  It's great. Definitely a team effort,  Hamlin said.  This is a -- I put us behind on Friday with the backup car getting in a wreck, but this -- I really wish we would race that car that was in the hauler, but this one, they did a great job getting it as close as they could working on the balance, getting it good yesterday and team effort. This is a total team effort all around.  Kyle Larson closed on Hamlin in the closing laps but was unable to catch him. Martin Truex Jr. finished third, Matt Kenseth was fourth and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top five.  They've (Larson and the No. 42 team) just been so fast this year and we, honestly, haven't been able to keep up, and so for us to be able to get the lead there, stretch it out, I knew it was going to be important for me to stretch out the lead as far as I could,  Hamlin said.  That way I could pace myself at the end of the race and it was just enough.  Hamlin took his first lead of the race by getting off pit road first during a caution at the start of stage three and the second half of the race. Previous race dominators Truex and Kyle Busch waged a three-wide battle with Hamlin for the lead for several laps before Truex took the top spot. Truex gave up the lead to pit with a flat right-front tire on lap 218 of the 301-lap race, but others followed suit, kicking off a cycle of green-flag pit stops. Busch inherited the lead with Truex pitted, but Busch was nabbed for speeding on pit road when he made his stop. Truex reclaimed the lead at the end of the cycle. Kenseth, on newer tires than Truex, took the lead on lap 261, just before the yellow flag waved for the seventh and final time. Dale Earnhardt Jr. restarted with the lead after staying out, with Kenseth alongside in second with two new tires. Truex and Hamlin restarted in the second row, each with four new tires. Kenseth, and later Hamlin, took the lead, but Truex dropped back several positions on the restart. Larson eventually got up to second and Truex to third, as Hamlin continued to lead late in the race. After starting on the pole, Truex led the entire first 75 laps of the race and claimed his 14th stage win of the season. He gave up the lead, though, to pit during the caution between stages and, as a result, restarted 24th due to varying pit strategies. In addition to the traditional caution between the first two stages, the red flag was displayed for track repair, specifically for the patching of a four-by-eight-inch hole in the track. Most of the race field pitted when the yellow flag waved on lap 68 for a Cole Whitt blown engine. Truex and a few other front-runners, including Kenseth, Larson and Jamie McMurray, stayed out. Busch was the first off pit road among drivers who pitted and restarted in the back of the top 10. Truex, Kenseth, Larson and McMurray maintained their positions for the two green-flag laps that remained in the opening stage, but they pitted when the stage ended. Those who pitted during the lap 38 caution stayed out, and Busch and Ryan Blaney restarted on the front row. Larson was outside the top 20 again for the start of stage two as a result of his end-of-stage-one pit strategy. He had already raced from the back of the front, starting the race in the back and getting up to seventh by a lap 35 caution. He was up to fourth by lap 50.  It's a little frustrating what we have had to go through the last couple of weeks, but it's pretty awesome to be able to run as fast as we have and finish second the last two weeks from dead last,  Larson said.  I'm proud of our team, proud of everybody at our race shop. I can't thank my sponsors Target, Credit One Bank, and all of our other supporters enough for what they do for our team. It's been a lot of fun these last couple of weeks to be as fast as we have been, so keep working hard at it and maybe we can get some more wins.  Jimmie Johnson fell to the back at the start of the race when he was penalized for jumping the start. Unlike Larson, he had trouble getting up through the field. Partly through his early race pit strategy, though, Johnson began the second stage in the fourth position.  I guess I just got it wrong at the start,  Johnson said.  I went off the flag and forgot that the pole-sitter has to be the first one to the stripe, so I'll take the responsibility on that one. And then we had an OK finish. We had decent short run speed. We would just fall off too hard. I really thought we were going to be in a position for a top five, but we ended up 10th.  By lap 100, Truex was back inside the top 10 and Larson inside the top 15. Busch remained up front for the duration of the second stage, pulling away from the rest of the field to claim the stage two win, his fifth stage victory of the season. Truex was back inside the top 10 shortly after a lap 92 restart. He finished the second stage just outside the top five in sixth. Hamlin, Busch's Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, was second at the end of stage two, followed by Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Harvick and Kurt Busch. Johnson was fifth. NOTES: Kyle Larson was fastest in Friday's opening practice and in qualifying on Friday, but his car failed post-qualifying inspection. As a result, he started in the back for the second race in a row, both times because of an inspection issue. ... Four Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series regulars -- Kyle Busch, Larson, Brad Keselowski and Ty Dillon -- competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway on Saturday. Busch won and Keselowski led 102 of the 200-lap race. All four drivers finished in the top 10. ...

Then Cain recalled how difficult the sun was on a hot Sunday afternoon at Kauffman Stadium. Cain's sun-aided single drove in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning as the Kansas City Royals topped the Texas Rangers 4-3. Rangers right-fielder Shin-Soo Choo had trouble picking up Cain's hit in the sun, although he was donning sunglasses. The ball glanced off his glove near the right-field line as Alex Gordon scored the winning run.  It was tough,  said Cain, who fought the sun in center to make catches.  Once the ball gets in the sun, it's almost impossible to catch. I was able to make a few plays. One of them very lucky, I didn't really see it. I just saw a black dot and put my glove there and it went it.  Rangers manager Jeff Banister knew the bright sun could play havoc with the outfielders.  Obviously, it was a tough sky with the sun, and Choo really battling,  Banister said.  You could see that he was grinding to try to get to it. Obviously, he got there and it looked like it went off his glove. Tough sky, tough sun.  The way this ballpark's set up for day games, it's one of those plays that if it gets made everybody''s happy on our side. They made the sun balls. We just had a situation where we didn't complete the play.  Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at RoyalsTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchChoo said he saw the ball early.  The ball just kept going to right field and then I lost the ball,  Choo said. Jason Grilli (2-5), who was making his third Rangers appearance since being acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays, took the loss. He retired only two of the six batters he faced.  You live and die by the sword,  Grilli said.  I felt like I had good stuff. Anything and everything that could have happened, happened. But we played a good series. It would have been nice to sweep, but we're on a good start to the second half.  Kelvin Herrera (2-2) picked up the victory, working a 1-2-3 ninth.  When you go up against the sun, the sun wins most of the time,  Royals second baseman Whit Merrifield said Drew Butera scored an unearned run in the seventh inning as Kansas City took a short-lived 3-2 lead. After Butera singled with two outs, Merrifield doubled to left, and when Nomar Mazara had trouble picking up the ball, third base coach Mike Jirschele waved Butera home. Texas tied it in the eighth off Joakim Soria, who blew his seventh save in eight opportunities. Elvis Andrus doubled with two outs and scored on Mazara's single. The Royals scored a run in the first but could have had more. Merrifield led off with a high chopper for an infield single and advanced to third on Jorge Bonifacio's single to right. Merrfield scored and Bonifacio went to second on Yu Darvish's wild pitch with Cain at the plate. With one out, Darvish made a throwing error on a pickoff attempt of Bonifacio at second. Bonifacio advanced to third on the error. Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas, the Royals' cleanup and No. 5 hitters, failed to get him in. Hosmer popped up foul to third baseman Drew Robinson and Moustakas flied out to Mazara in left. The Rangers tied it in the third on Robinson's home run to right with one out. Robinson drove a full-count Ian Kennedy pitch out to right. The Royals regained the lead in the bottom of the inning when Moustakas' two-out double scored Hosmer. Mike Napoli homered in the seventh off Kennedy to tie it at 2. Napoli took a 1-1 offering out to center for his 20th home run of the season. Kennedy was removed a batter later after Jonathan Lucroy singled. Peter Moylan retired Carlos Gomez on a fielder's choice grounder to end the inning. Kennedy permitted two runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out six, walked one and hit a batter, throwing 99 pitches. Darvish allowed three runs (two earned) and eight hits while striking out six and walking one.  It's always better to get a win in any games,  Darvish said through a translator.  Today we had a sweep, but at the same time we won the first two games, so we won the series. That's what we need to keep focusing on, to win every series on the next road trip and just do what we can do.  NOTES: Rangers 1B Joey Gallo, who has struck out seven times in as many at-bats vs. Royals RHP Ian Kennedy, was held out of the lineup. ...

I don't think I had a lot of success against him last year, but I remember I faced him this year,  said Williams, referring to their time in the minor leagues earlier this season.  He threw me a first-pitch slider and I hit a homer. I remembered that.  When the two met again Sunday, the pitch and result were exactly the same except this time both were in the big leagues and the home run was a grand slam, the first of Williams' career. It proved to be the difference in the Philadelphia Phillies' 5-2 victory over the Brewers at Miller Park.  It was a good win for us,  said Phillies manager Pete Mackanin, whose team avoided a three-game sweep at the hands of the National League Central-leading Brewers. The slider was the first pitch that Webb had thrown since joining the Brewers during the All-Star break after a trade with the New York Yankees. It was an inauspicious debut for Webb, who was added to bolster Milwaukee's bullpen for a potential playoff run. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BrewersPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch It was a good matchup for him,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  He threw a breaking ball in the strike zone and the guy put a good swing on it.  Rob Scahill (1-3) got off to a rough start in the sixth, allowing three straight singles to load the bases. Counsell then turned to Webb to face the left-handed-hitting Williams, who singled earlier in the game.  It just wasn't a good enough pitch,  Webb said.  Especially with runners in scoring position like that, you have to have all of your pitches working the right way. Unfortunately, I didn't and they came out on top.  The sixth-inning meltdown spoiled an effective five-inning effort from Brewers starter Matt Garza, who was charged with just one run, three hits and three walks with a strikeout. The only blemish on his line was a ground-rule RBI double by Odubel Herrera that gave Philadelphia a 1-0 lead in the third. He had only thrown 71 pitches, but when Orlando Arcia reached on a two-out single in the bottom of the inning, Counsell opted to pinch-hit Brett Phillips.  It's tough to come out of a game, but it's not my call,  Garza said.  You try and do your part and keep your team in a position to strike. I would have liked to stay out there, but it was the right call.  Counsell's gamble paid off, as the rookie launched his first career home run to right, putting the Brewers ahead 2-1.  The home run was fun and exciting,  said Phillips, who received a standing ovation and a curtain call from the crowd of 29,532.  But a win would have been a lot cooler to go along with it.  The two-run shot would be the only runs allowed by Philadelphia starter Jeremy Hellickson. Hellickson (6-5) picked up his first victory since May 19 by holding Milwaukee to two runs, four hits and a walk while striking out seven, but he gave way after five innings because of cramping in his right calf.  It was just like a tight cramp for a second,  Hellickson said.  Just really tight. It was bothering me a little when I pushed off. It felt fine walking around and stuff like that. Just pushing off.  With Hellickson out, Philadelphia's bullpen stepped up and provided four scoreless innings. Milwaukee brought the tying run to the plate in the eighth but came up empty. The Brewers threatened again in the ninth as Hector Neris allowed the first two batters to reach before he retired the next three in a row for his eighth save of the season. NOTES: With OF Aaron Altherr sidelined for a second straight game with a strained right hamstring, Phillies manager Pete Mackanin moved CF Odubel Herrera into the leadoff spot. ... Phillies RHP Pat Neshek worked a scoreless seventh inning. Neshek, a likely trade candidate as the deadline nears, has not allowed a run in his last five appearances and in 39 of his 40 outings this season. ... The Brewers have hit four pinch-hit home runs this season. ... Milwaukee's loss, paired with a third consecutive victory by the Chicago Cubs on Sunday, trimmed the Brewers' lead over the National League Central to 4 1/2 games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED7G7E2T6E"}

Now they'll see where they'll go. Nelson Cruz homered in the 10th inning and the Mariners held off the Chicago White Sox 7-6 on Sunday to claim their first sweep of at least three games in Chicago since 2003.  You obviously want to win series and sweeps are definitely a bonus,  said Mariners first baseman Danny Valencia, who hit a three-run home run to tie the game in the fifth inning.  It's crunch time for us. These next couple weeks will be very telling to see the direction this club decides to go in. We believe in each other here, we have a really good team in here, and everybody's expecting us to have a good second half and make the playoffs.  Cruz homered for the second straight game and the fifth time in eight games. His 19th homer came off Chris Beck (1-1).  We just take one game at a time,  Cruz said.  We don't think about the series. We're thinking of what we can do to win today. So far we get good results.  Kyle Seager also hit a home run for the Mariners (46-47), who extended their winning streak to four. Avisail Garcia smacked two home runs for the White Sox (38-52), who relinquished a five-run lead. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at White SoxSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchThe Mariners had scored the go-ahead run on Anthony Swarzak's bases-loaded wild pitch in the sixth. Jose Abreu tied the score on an RBI double after Alen Hanson doubled and advanced on a sacrifice in the seventh. Garcia homered on the first pitch to put the White Sox ahead in the second inning. It was his first home run at Guaranteed Rate Field since May 13.  The All-Star break might have given him a little charge, made him feel a little better,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said of Garcia, the team's All-Star.  We're glad his knee is feeling good and his hand is feeling good, that he's continuing to put together some obviously very good at-bats.  Omar Narvaez added a two-run shot, his first of the season and second of his career, in the second inning to make it 3-0. Garcia hit a two-run drive in the third inning, giving him six career multi-home run games and 13 home runs this season, matching a career high. Seager hit his 12th home run, a solo shot, in the fourth inning, to start Seattle's comeback. Shortstop Tim Anderson's major league-leading 21st error allowed the Mariners to load the bases with no outs in the fifth. Jean Segura delivered a sacrifice fly before Valencia's three-run homer tied the score.  It's no secret that we have a lot of confidence in our offense to score a lot of runs and it was still early in the game,  Valencia said.  We knew we weren't going to get shut out, so if we have good at-bats, we'll get runners on base and fortunately for me I got up there with a couple men on base and got a good pitch to hit and put it out of the ballpark.  Nick Vincent (3-1) threw a scoreless inning for the win. Edwin Diaz nailed down his 16th save. In his fourth major league start and first on the road, Mariners starter Andrew Moore allowed five runs, including three home runs, in three innings. The rebuilding White Sox have lost four straight, fell a season-high 14 games below .500, and have the worst record in the American League. The Mariners won their first series in Chicago since 2007. White Sox starter Derek Holland gave up six runs (five earned) in 5 2/3 innings.  He threw better than the numbers might show,  Renteria said.  He left the one pitch up to Valencia, the breaking ball that he was able to put a charge into. We made him throw a few more pitches -- there were a few miscues out there. But he was attacking the strike zone, he was working in, he was using his breaking ball, keeping it down.  Holland made a flashy defensive play in the fourth when he snagged a comebacker behind his back. The ball got caught in his glove's webbing, so Holland tossed his mitt to first baseman Abreu for the out.  It's cool to get a nice play like that, especially against a guy like (Robinson) Cano -- sorry, buddy -- but the main thing is we want to get the wins,  Holland said.  And today was just not one of those days.  Jose Quintana was originally scheduled to start Sunday for the White Sox but he was traded to the Chicago Cubs on Thursday. NOTES: Mariners DH Nelson Cruz is dealing with a sore right knee but remains in the lineup. His 73 RBIs lead the majors. ... Mariners RF Mitch Haniger jammed a thumb on a bunt attempt Saturday. Ben Gamel instead started in right field. Haniger was available to pinch run. ... The Mariners will likely need a fifth starter Tuesday at Houston.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar on June 5, cutting diplomatic and transport ties with the tiny Gulf monarchy, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with Gulf Arab states arch-foe Iran. Doha denies the accusations.  We need a regional solution and international monitoring,  said Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, in prepared remarks he was scheduled to deliver on Monday in London.   We need to be certain that Qatar, a state with $300 billion in reserves, is no longer an official or unofficial sponsor of jihadist and terrorist causes,  he said, giving no further detail on the proposed monitoring.  Gargash said the memorandum of understanding signed by the United States and Qatar on Tuesday on the financing of terrorism was a positive development.  Washington and Doha signed the agreement as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Qatar on a three-day tour of Gulf-Arab countries to try to end a month-long rift between Western-allied Arab states. Still, the four Arab powers have said the memorandum fell short of allaying their concerns, that their sanctions would remain in place until Doha meets their demands and that they would keep a close eye on Qatar's efforts to fight terrorism funding.  We do see signs now, however, that our pressure is working,  Gargash said.  We are ready for this process to take a long time.

The women are among tens of thousands of workers in Tamil Nadu state - the largest hub in India's $40 billion-a-year textile and garment industry - who are seeking millions of dollars in compensation following a landmark court ruling last year that declared they had long been grossly underpaid. The Madras High Court ordered that the garment workers should receive a pay rise of up to 30 percent - the first minimum wage hike for 12 years - and that they could claim arrears going back to 2014.  But 12 months on, many factory bosses have failed to pay up.  Squeezed into a corner at the back of the stuffy Chennai courtroom, a middle-aged woman leans against the blue walls, clutching polythene bags full of documents to prove her claim. Normally she spends her days hunched over a sewing machine, stitching skirts, shirts and dresses destined for high streets around the world. But for months she has been taking days off work to attend court.  I forgo a day's salary to come for these hearings. It may not seem like a big amount, but for us it is hard earned money,  said the 48-year-old seamstress, who did not wish to be identified fearing it would impact her case.   I am only asking for what is rightfully mine. And they won't even tell me how they are calculating my dues.  More than 150 claims have been filed against tailoring and export garment manufacturing units in the Chennai region alone, according to data requested by the Thomson Reuters Foundation under the Right to Information Act. The claims, which would benefit at least 80,000 workers at factories around the port city, add up to more than 490 million Indian rupees ($7.6 million). But workers' unions say these claims are probably the tip of the iceberg as they only represent cases filed by government labor inspectors. Salary Cuts Under the 2016 Madras court ruling, Tamil Nadu's garment and textile workers should see their pay rise from a monthly average of 4,500 to 6,500 rupees - which campaigners say is comparable to wages for textile jobs in most other states.  But workers say managers have defaulted or delayed on payments since the ruling, with some even introducing pay cuts. Despite the state's minimum wage laws, salaries continue to be  grossly low  for thousands of workers who are still not given pay slips or are often hired only as apprentices, campaigners say.  Instead of paying workers their correct salaries, companies are finding ways to surreptitiously squash their rights,  said Selvi Palani, a lawyer helping workers' unions fight their cases.  There is a court order but the money is not on the table. Workers continue to be underpaid.  Sujata Mody of Penn Thozhilalargal Sangam, a women workers' union, said some companies that had raised wages were now docking pay for sick days, and for factory meals and shuttle buses which were previously free, meaning many workers had seen little or no change in pay. Some factories were also firing more expensive workers on trivial grounds, she added.  The workers are struggling to be heard and the managements are coming up with new forms to deduct their income,  Mody said. Repeated Delays Under the 1948 Minimum Wages Act, state governments are required to increase the basic minimum wage every five years to protect workers against exploitation, but textile manufacturers have repeatedly challenged pay rises in Tamil Nadu. The state's labor commissioner, Ka Balachandran, said inspectors were verifying every company's records to check that wages were now in line with last year's ruling.  We are doing everything to ensure workers get fair wages, and get it quickly,  he added. But manufacturers in Tamil Nadu say the hike is too high, putting them at a disadvantage to competitors in other states. Some say they are already paying workers more than the minimum wage.  The new norms are not distinguishing clearly between skilled and non-skilled workers,  said S Shaktivel of the Tirupur Exporters' Association. He said some companies had launched an appeal against the order at the Madras High Court. In the Chennai labor court, case numbers are called out in quick succession. The seamstress, who is expecting arrears of up to 5,000 rupees, strains to listen over the slow whirring of the ceiling fan.  My financial situation is not very good,  she whispers.  My husband had surgery a few months back, we have a loan to pay back and a house to run. The company owes me arrears for almost one year. I need that income desperately.  Her case is called. The lawyer representing the company asks for more time. Another date is set, with the judge warning against further delays.  I hope I get a good settlement,  the seamstress said as she left court.  After all these years, I would like to stop working, but that looks unlikely. At least if they paid me properly, I would feel a little better.  Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Emma Batha.

But he didn't mind the twist of fate Sunday afternoon. DJ LeMahieu and Mark Reynolds each collected four hits and three runs as the Rockies set season highs for runs and hits in support of Hoffman, who tossed six solid innings as the Rockies routed the New York Mets 13-4 at Citi Field. Pitching less than three hours south of his hometown, Hoffman said he was as nervous as he's ever been for a start, but the Rockies helped settle him down by batting around and scoring four runs in a first inning that ended with Hoffman striking out.  Definitely didn't expect to hit in the first inning, but sometimes that happens, especially with an offense like this,  Hoffman said with a grin. The Rockies, who were outscored 23-5 in losing the first two games of the three-game series, nearly batted around again in the second, when they scored three more runs to chase another local product, Mets starter and Long Island native Steven Matz.  It was nice to see -- the guys have been done for a while, so to get off to that kind of start was really nice to see,  Hoffman said.  It was a kind of a relief. I just went out and threw strikes and tried to attack the zone.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at MetsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchHoffman, a native of Latham, N.Y., who was pitching in front of more than 30 family members and friends, allowed four runs, seven hits and one walk while striking out three in six innings. He threw 91 pitches, 60 for strikes. Hoffman (6-1) didn't have a 1-2-3 inning but wriggled out of trouble in each of the first three frames, when New York put the leadoff runner on each time yet didn't score.  Every start he makes, it's a learning experience,  Rockies manager Bud Black said of Hoffman, who was making his 16th career start.  Pitching in front of a lot of family and friends, that's different when it's a big league game. And he can check that box, that he's done that. And he'll be -- I don't want to say better-prepared, but he'll understand what that's all about next time he comes back to New York.  LeMahieu singled and Reynolds doubled during a four-run first inning that featured a two-run single by Ian Desmond, who was activated from the disabled list prior to the game, and a two-run double by Trevor Story. Matz (2-3) was chased after allowing the first four batters he faced to reach base in the second, when LeMahieu singled immediately before Nolan Arenado launched a three-run homer. Reynolds then singled to finally end the shortest start of Matz's career and the shortest start by a Mets starter this season. Matz was charged with the seven runs on nine hits and one walk while striking out two.  I feel like I wasn't really sharp today,  Matz said.  I was leaving balls right over the middle of the plate and they were hitting it.  The Rockies extended their lead to 9-0 in the fourth, when LeMahieu laced a leadoff double and scored on Reynolds' one-out single. Reynolds scored on a sacrifice fly by Gerardo Parra. LeMahieu capped his fourth four-hit game of the season with a double leading off the sixth. The Mets pulled within 9-3 on a solo homer by Lucas Duda in the fourth inning, a two-run blast by Asdrubal Cabrera in the fifth and a sacrifice fly in the sixth by Jose Reyes. The Rockies answered with a pair of two-run homers by Charlie Blackmon in the seventh and Gerardo Parra in the eighth. Reynolds collected a fourth hit for the second time this season and the fifth time in his career in the eighth when he singled two batters before Parra's blast. Blackmon, Arenado, Desmond, Parra and Story all had two hits apiece for the Rockies (53-41), who finished with 18 hits, including 10 for extra bases. Colorado, which has won just six of its last 21 games, is 5 1/2 games ahead of the Chicago Cubs in the race for the National League's second wild card.  I thought our at-bats today were really sound,  Black said.  Really well-played game by us.  Jay Bruce had two hits for the Mets (41-48), who fell 9 1/2 games behind the Rockies.  It's always good when you win the series,  Cabrera said.  You have to come and start (to) win series and play good baseball.  NOTES: To make room on the 25-man roster for IF/OF Ian Desmond, the Rockies placed RHP Tyler Chatwood (right calf strain) on the 10-day disabled list. Chatwood started Saturday but got just one out while battling an injury he suffered while warming up in the bullpen. ... Rockies CF Charlie Blackmon extended his hitting streak to 11 games. ...

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar on June 5, cutting diplomatic and transport ties with the tiny Gulf monarchy, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with Gulf Arab states arch-foe Iran. Doha denies the accusations.  We need a regional solution and international monitoring,  said Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, in prepared remarks he was scheduled to deliver on Monday in London.   We need to be certain that Qatar, a state with $300 billion in reserves, is no longer an official or unofficial sponsor of jihadist and terrorist causes,  he said, giving no further detail on the proposed monitoring.  Gargash said the memorandum of understanding signed by the United States and Qatar on Tuesday on the financing of terrorism was a positive development.  Washington and Doha signed the agreement as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Qatar on a three-day tour of Gulf-Arab countries to try to end a month-long rift between Western-allied Arab states. Still, the four Arab powers have said the memorandum fell short of allaying their concerns, that their sanctions would remain in place until Doha meets their demands and that they would keep a close eye on Qatar's efforts to fight terrorism funding.  We do see signs now, however, that our pressure is working,  Gargash said.  We are ready for this process to take a long time.

Appearances like Sunday. The Houston right-hander produced a strong start and the Astros parlayed aggressive baserunning into two late insurance runs in their 5-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Minute Maid Park. Fiers (6-4) surrendered his 21st and 22nd home runs but was otherwise marvelous in seven innings, allowing four hits while getting a season-high 11 strikeouts. He did not walk a batter. After yielding a homer to Twins shortstop Ehire Adrianza with one out in the third inning, Fiers allowed just two additional hits, both singles, and faced the minimum in his last four innings. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at AstrosMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatchFiers' pickoff of Adrianza at first base capped the fifth and helped preserve the Astros' 3-2 lead.  The curveball, I felt like I could throw it any time,  Fiers said.  I was throwing it for a strike and trying to expand it for two strikes and they start swinging once you show you can command it in the zone and then they just try to put it in play.  The Astros (62-30) tacked on two runs in the seventh. Jake Marisnick chased Twins right-hander Kyle Gibson (5-8) with a leadoff walk and, after stealing second base, took third on a groundout to the left side of the infield. Twins first baseman Kennys Vargas attempted to erase Marisnick as he slid into the bag, but his errant toss enabled the Astros to up their lead to 4-2. Jose Altuve followed with a double off Twins reliever Trevor Hildenberger plus a steal of third base before coming home on a pitch in the dirt after a strikeout of Josh Reddick. Altuve darted toward the plate as Twins catcher Chris Gimenez threw to Vargas to complete the out at first base, and he just beat the throw home from Vargas with a slide behind Gimenez.  We wanted to put pressure on their defense,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  When Jake Marisnick and Jose Altuve are on the bases, they're always a threat to create some havoc.  It's a little bit of the strength of those players and also the situation where we could play it with a little bit of freedom. We had the lead, we're trying to extend the lead, we had some matchup stuff that we liked to take advantage of. It was just a really good job of playing loose baseball.  Gibson allowed four runs, six hits and four walks with six strikeouts in six innings for the Twins (46-45), who lost five of six games against the Astros this season. Gibson did not surrender a hit after the fourth when Astros left fielder Norichika Aoki produced a two-run double that gave Houston a 3-2 lead. Two of the four batters that Gibson walked eventually scored.  I was appreciative that he let me go back out there in the seventh,  Gibson said of Twins manager Paul Molitor.  I felt really good and was glad I was able to get that ground ball from Aoki in the sixth, and I was just glad that he sent me back out there and gave me a chance to compete.  Vargas blasted a 452-foot shot into the upper deck in right field for his eighth home run in the second inning. That highlight was just one of two for Minnesota with Fiers on the mound.  We battled,  Molitor said.  Fiers obviously had a good day and had us guessing.  NOTES: Slumping Twins SS Jorge Polanco was benched and replaced by Ehire Adrianza, who homered in his first at-bat. Polanco owns a .317 OPS this month with just one multi-hit game in July. Since posting consecutive multi-hit games on June 22-23, Polanco is batting .123 with 17 strikeouts in 70 plate appearances and 18 games. ... Astros manager A.J. Hinch displayed his commitment to resting starters, giving All-Star SS Carlos Correa the day off while giving another All-Star, George Springer, a half-day by utilizing him as the designated hitter. Utility player Marwin Gonzalez started in place of Correa at shortstop. ... With a day game after a night game, Twins 1B Joe Mauer was held out of the starting lineup. Mauer missed six games with a lower back strain before his reinstatement from the 10-day disabled list on Saturday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED7G7CYR2U"}

Charts were crowded with milestones with the euro near ground last trod in May 2016 and sterling at its highest since September. The pound's 1.2 percent jump on Friday was the largest in three months and left it at $1.3107. The was hovering at $1.1471 and just short of major resistance at $1.1489. The U.S. dollar index was at its lowest since September at 95.089, while the greenback bought 112.49 yen having shed a big figure on Friday. A holiday in Japan kept trade thin ahead of a deluge of economic news from China, which includes gross domestic product, retail sales and industrial output. Forecasts are for economic growth of 6.8 percent in the second quarter, a healthy result which would not ruffle too many feathers in the region. That would be a contrast to Friday's U.S. data which showed surprisingly soft reading for consumer prices and retail sales, bringing into question the Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation would soon rebound.  It is a mixed picture that is likely to leave the Fed cautious, and it is little wonder markets have lowered the odds of further rate hikes this year,  said ANZ economist David Plank.  Whether it also delays the start of balance sheet normalisation remains to be seen, but we suspect the Fed will want to push on with that for now.  Fed funds futures imply around a 50-50 chance of another hike by December, and have less than two moves priced in for all of next year. Fed policymakers have pencilled in one more rise this year and a further four in 2018. The prospect of a slow-motion Fed dragged Wall Street's favoured gauge of fear, the CBOE Volatility index, to its lowest since December 1993. Periods of market calm favour carry trades since they lessen the risk of sharp and sudden reversals that would stop investors out of their leveraged positions. That encouraged flows into higher-yielding currencies, ranging from the Australian dollar to the Mexican peso and South African rand, and into emerging markets stocks. The Aussie shot to a two-year high and breached major chart resistance in the process in the $0.7700/7778 range. The Aussie was last at $0.7824 with bulls targetting the 200-week moving average around $0.8026.

All told, more than 40 people were shot in Chicago from Friday to Sunday morning, including Willie Cooper, 58, who ran a South Side community center, according to police. No arrests had been made. Cooper was gunned down on Saturday afternoon by the occupants of a dark-colored car that had stopped as the activist walked near the nonprofit where he worked, law enforcement and local media said. “Willie is preventing violence, trying to find jobs for ex-offenders, working in this community. I almost want to name him the Mayor of 95th Street,” one of his friends, Bamani Obadele, told WLS-TV. Chicago has become the focus of renewed national concern over gun crime in the United States, fueled by the perception of a spike in shootings in recent months, mostly related to gangs.  Over the Independence Day weekend, 101 people were shot in the city of 2.7 million, leaving at least 14 dead. In 2013, the last time the Fourth of July weekend spanned four days, 74 people were shot, according to the Chicago Tribune.  That said, data issued last week by the Chicago Police Department showed that less than 2,000 people have been shot through July 9 this year, down about 10 percent from a year earlier. Homicides numbered 353, in line with 350 deaths a year earlier. Another victim of the weekend violence was Gustavo Garcia, 9, who was shot and killed while riding in an SUV on the South Side late on Friday, police spokeswoman Brandi Wright said. A 31-year-old man in the SUV was wounded, she said. No one was in custody yet. Garcia was the 14th person aged 12 or under to be shot in Chicago this year, and the fourth to be killed, the Chicago Tribune reported. The violence came a month after President Donald Trump tweeted that gun crime in Chicago had reached  epidemic proportions  and that he would be  sending in Federal help.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions later clarified that federal assistance will come in the form of a strike force that included local and federal law enforcement officers. Chicago's ongoing struggles with violence continue after a federal investigation found police routinely violated civil rights, and used excessive force and discriminatory conduct.

Demonstrators, mostly young and dressed in the green color of the country's environmental movement, overflowed across a six-lane thoroughfare in Santo Domingo, waving the red, blue and white Dominican flag as they chanted demands for the president and other top officials to resign. The protest was the biggest of seven demonstrations since January that followed an investigation revealing executives from Brazilian engineering company Odebrecht paid $92 million in bribes to officials from the poor country that shares a Caribbean island with the even more impoverished Haiti.  The people have no legal recourse, we have no one to represent us. But the government can't repress them,  said businessman Ivan Veloz Cabral, a 69-year-old owner of a small sportswear factory. Odebrecht has paid $184 million in damages related to the bribery charges and 14 top officials and businessmen have been indicted in the case that has stirred up deep-seated anger over decades of suspected government corruption.

We can't afford to have the same people in power again,  said protester Juan Santos. Sunday's march dwarfed relatively large protests over education spending in 2011. Organizers said Dominican immigrants marched in protests in other cities such as Miami, New York and Madrid as part of the so-called Marcha Verde, or Green March, movement that has staged demonstrations since January. Demonstrations on Sunday were largely peaceful, but previous protests saw clashes with police. Protesters have accused authorities of several beatings and illegal detentions of demonstrators, and a video caught several officers planting drugs in a car of one activist.

Miguel Cabrera drew a bases-loaded walk with two outs in the 11th inning, giving the Tigers a 6-5 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays at Comerica Park. Lucas Harrell's 3-2 pitch was wide, allowing Alex Avila to score. The Tigers had three walks during the inning.  That's where experience really comes into play, Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.  Early in careers, you want to be the hero so badly that as soon as you see the white of the ball you're swinging, and you end up chasing pitches out of the zone.  When you have guys who have been in the situation before, it's much easier to calm the nerves and just take what the pitcher is giving you.  Avila drew a leadoff walk against Jeff Beliveau (1-1). He battled back from an 0-2 count. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at TigersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch At times, especially in extra innings, you have a tendency to try to do too much,  Avila said.  At that point, guys realize, hey, just get the ball over the middle of the plate and then try to do damage. We had the right guys up there.  An error by Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson extended the inning, making the run unearned. Warwick Saupold (2-1) picked up the win with an inning of scoreless relief for Detroit (41-49). J.D. Martinez, who drove in two runs, tied the score with a solo homer in the eighth. Martinez left the game in the 10th inning for a pinch runner after stealing second base and tweaking an ankle. Justin Upton and James McCann supplied run-scoring doubles. Tigers starter Anibal Sanchez gave up five runs and nine hits in six innings. Detroit is 2-0 since holding a team meeting.  We've got to chip away,  Ausmus said.  When I said we needed (to make) a run, two wasn't what I was thinking about. It's a start. You've got to get two (wins) to get to three.  Justin Smoak and Jose Bautista hit two-run homers and Kendrys Morales added a solo shot for Toronto (42-49). Toronto starter Marco Estrada gave up four runs and five hits in 3 2/3 innings.  That was there for the taking,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  We didn't play good enough ball. That's the bottom line.  The Blue Jays put on a power display with two outs in the first. Donaldson doubled before Smoak's home run. Morales then followed with his 17th long ball of the season to make it 3-0. Estrada gave all those runs back in the bottom of the inning. Upton doubled with runners on the corners to bring home the first run. Cabrera and Martinez followed with sacrifice flies. A miscommunication in the outfield allowed Detroit to grab a 4-3 advantage in the fourth. Alex Presley led off with a fly ball to right center. Both center fielder Kevin Pillar and Bautista in right backed off from it, gifting a double to Presley. McCann's long fly ball to left popped out of left fielder Ezequiel Carrera's glove as he jumped near the wall, allowing Presley to score. Toronto regained the lead in the next inning at 5-4 on Bautista's two-run line shot over the left field wall, his 16th homer of the year. Martinez knotted the score leading off the eighth with his 16th homer off Danny Barnes. The ball just snuck over the right-field wall and was initially ruled a double before a review.  We got the early lead and gave it right back,  Gibbons said.  Took the lead back again, but it's tough to ask your bullpen to go five clean innings there at the end. ... Tough one today, tough long one.  NOTES: Blue Jays LHP Francisco Liriano was still feeling soreness on the right side of his neck and back after his abbreviated start on Saturday. Liriano lasted just two innings and was charged with five earned runs before he departed with neck tightness. It is uncertain if he will make his scheduled start on Thursday, but he did not require an MRI. ... Toronto has not been better than tied for fourth in the American League East standings all season. ... The Blue Jays continue a 10-game road trip in Boston on Monday. Detroit begins a seven-game trek in Kansas City. ... Tigers OF Alex Presley made his 16th start in center field. He is one of five players who have started at least 15 games in center this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-bluejays-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED7G7EJH71"}

Beijing is trying to defuse property bubbles and curb a debt build-up amid fears such risks could derail the world's second-largest economy if not handled well, but policymakers look to be treading warily ahead of a key party meeting later this year. Authorities' restrictive measures on the property sector have slowed investment, while a regulatory crackdown on unscrupulous lending and a modest shift to tighter monetary conditions have started to drive up funding costs for banks and companies. Most economists polled by Reuters expected China's second-quarter gross domestic product growth to slow from a stronger than expected 6.9 percent rise in the first quarter, which was the fastest expansion in six quarters.  China GDP surprised on the upside last quarter. The key driving force came from the industrial sectors but the momentum does not seem to be lasting long. Investment was the reason behind such rapid growth but it's now slowing down,  analysts at Natixis said in a research note.  The good thing is that trade and consumption are still holding up but not enough to fully offset the slowdown in investment.  A surprisingly upbeat reading would likely lift stocks and global commodity prices, but a weak outcome could boost bearish bets on the yuan CNY=CFXS, which has gained about 2 percent against the dollar so far this year. Economists in the poll estimated GDP grew 1.7 percent quarter-on-quarter, versus the first quarter's 1.3 percent pace. Gradual Slowdown Expected An upturn in global demand for Chinese products could be a boon for the country's leaders as they seek to contain a dangerous build-up in debt that has ballooned to 277 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, authorities have been pushing forward supply-side reforms to cut excess capacity in steel and coal sectors. Data on Thursday showed both China's exports and imports rose faster-than-expected in June from a year earlier, which could offset weakness in other parts of economy in the second quarter. Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating in May, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. On Friday, Fitch Ratings affirmed its A+ rating for China but flagged rising debt levels as a risk. Beijing has set a slightly more modest growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2017, theoretically offering more wiggle room for reforms after the economy grew 6.7 percent in 2016 - the weakest pace in 26 years. China's economic growth is expected to cool further to 6.6 percent in 2017, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, with the pace of expansion slowing steadily in the third- and fourth-quarter. The People's Bank of China shifted to a modest tightening bias at the start of this year, guiding market interest rates higher during the first quarter, including immediately after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates in March. But the central bank injected substantial liquidity last month to help avoid an end-quarter cash crunch as Beijing tightened regulations to force banks to deleverage. For now, China's economy may have to rely on new credit to generate growth as productivity slows, despite worries about debt risks, analysts said. Data on Wednesday showed Chinese lenders extended more credit than expected in June, as home lending stayed buoyant while a clampdown on shadow financing activities forced banks to shift more loans onto their books.

Romero, creator of the zombie film genre with  Night of the Living Dead  and a series of sequels that left a lasting impact on horror movies, died of lung cancer in a Toronto hospital on Sunday, his business partner said. He was 77. Romero wrote and directed the 1968 classic, in which the dead come back to life and eat the flesh of the living, and five sequels including the 1978 box office hit  Dawn of the Dead.   A true legend,  actor Kumail Nanjiani said on Twitter.  Started a new genre on his own. Who else can claim that?  Besides the horror of flesh-eating zombies, the  Dead  films featured the theme of people who panic while under siege, turning on each other instead of uniting against their common enemy. Romero, who was born in the Bronx borough of New York, was drawn to telling stories about monsters that are familiar to the people they terrorize, said his business partner, Peter Grunwald.  They're not crazy, fantastical monsters. They're our neighbors, our relatives, our friends. They're kind of scarier for that, scarier than big, special effects, sci-fi monsters,  Grunwald said. Romero influenced a generation of filmmakers including Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez and the late Wes Craven, according to Grunwald. FILE PHOTO:      Director George A. Romero poses for photographers before the screening of the film  Survival of the Dead  at the 66th Venice Film Festival September 9, 2009.Tony Gentile/File PhotoRomero owned a small commercial production company when he convinced nine others to put up a small amount of money to finance  Night of the Living Dead,  Grunwald said. Originally called  Night of the Flesh Eaters,  the title was changed by the film's distributor, Walter Reade. Somehow, no copyright protection was filed after the name change, putting  Night of the Living Dead  into the public domain and allowing anyone to distribute it for free. Slideshow (3 Images)Romero told The New York Times in 2016 that many more people saw the movie as result,  keeping the film alive.  Made for an estimated $114,000, the black-and-white film has grossed some $30 million worldwide, according to the internet movie database site IMDb.com.  Dawn of the Dead  grossed $55 million worldwide, the website said.  Commercial success  allowed him to make movies on his own terms,  Grunwald said. Other sequels included  Day of the Dead  in 1985,  Land of the Dead  in 2005,  Diary of the Dead  in 2007 and  Survival of the Dead  in 2009, all which Romero directed. He also directed the vampire movie  Martin  in 1978 and collaborated with Stephen King on the 1982 film  Creepshow  and directed  The Dark Half,  based on a King novel, in 1993.

The figures were based on property advertised between June 11 and July 8, covering the weeks after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her majority in parliament, creating uncertainty for investors who were already on edge about Britain's exit from the European Union. Rightmove said average asking prices for property sold on its website increased by a monthly 0.1 percent in July, a month that usually sees slight falls in prices. In annual terms, prices were up 2.8 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise in June. Other house price measures have shown a slowdown in growth this year, mirroring a weakening of the economy as consumers feel the pinch of rising inflation. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said the market remained very price sensitive with some properties hitting a price ceiling. He also said that an eventual rise in mortgage costs would be a shock to buyers.  The Bank of England has is considering when to raise interest rates although most of its top officials have suggested now is not the time.  Price rises are muted despite high housing demand, indicating we have left the stage of the cycle where price rises exceed the rate of inflation,  Shipside said. A jump in inflation to nearly 3 percent has hurt the spending power of many people in Britain, contributing to a slowdown in the economy and in house price rises. Rightmove said asking prices in most of England fell, but the overall average inched up due to gains in London contrasting with a sharp fall in June in the capital. Rightmove says more than 90 percent of British estate agents use its website to advertise property.   Separately, a survey showed British consumer confidence suffered its biggest fall in more than two years in the second quarter of 2017, mirroring other recent measures of consumer sentiment. Accountancy firm Deloitte, which published the survey on Monday, linked the fall to the squeeze on living standards.

The women are among tens of thousands of workers in Tamil Nadu state - the largest hub in India's $40 billion-a-year textile and garment industry - who are seeking millions of dollars in compensation following a landmark court ruling last year that declared they had long been grossly underpaid. The Madras High Court ordered that the garment workers should receive a pay rise of up to 30 percent - the first minimum wage hike for 12 years - and that they could claim arrears going back to 2014.  But 12 months on, many factory bosses have failed to pay up.  Squeezed into a corner at the back of the stuffy Chennai courtroom, a middle-aged woman leans against the blue walls, clutching polythene bags full of documents to prove her claim. Normally she spends her days hunched over a sewing machine, stitching skirts, shirts and dresses destined for high streets around the world. But for months she has been taking days off work to attend court.  I forgo a day's salary to come for these hearings. It may not seem like a big amount, but for us it is hard earned money,  said the 48-year-old seamstress, who did not wish to be identified fearing it would impact her case.   I am only asking for what is rightfully mine. And they won't even tell me how they are calculating my dues.  More than 150 claims have been filed against tailoring and export garment manufacturing units in the Chennai region alone, according to data requested by the Thomson Reuters Foundation under the Right to Information Act. The claims, which would benefit at least 80,000 workers at factories around the port city, add up to more than 490 million Indian rupees ($7.6 million). But workers' unions say these claims are probably the tip of the iceberg as they only represent cases filed by government labor inspectors. Salary Cuts Under the 2016 Madras court ruling, Tamil Nadu's garment and textile workers should see their pay rise from a monthly average of 4,500 to 6,500 rupees - which campaigners say is comparable to wages for textile jobs in most other states.  But workers say managers have defaulted or delayed on payments since the ruling, with some even introducing pay cuts. Despite the state's minimum wage laws, salaries continue to be  grossly low  for thousands of workers who are still not given pay slips or are often hired only as apprentices, campaigners say.  Instead of paying workers their correct salaries, companies are finding ways to surreptitiously squash their rights,  said Selvi Palani, a lawyer helping workers' unions fight their cases.  There is a court order but the money is not on the table. Workers continue to be underpaid.  Sujata Mody of Penn Thozhilalargal Sangam, a women workers' union, said some companies that had raised wages were now docking pay for sick days, and for factory meals and shuttle buses which were previously free, meaning many workers had seen little or no change in pay. Some factories were also firing more expensive workers on trivial grounds, she added.  The workers are struggling to be heard and the managements are coming up with new forms to deduct their income,  Mody said. Repeated Delays Under the 1948 Minimum Wages Act, state governments are required to increase the basic minimum wage every five years to protect workers against exploitation, but textile manufacturers have repeatedly challenged pay rises in Tamil Nadu. The state's labor commissioner, Ka Balachandran, said inspectors were verifying every company's records to check that wages were now in line with last year's ruling.  We are doing everything to ensure workers get fair wages, and get it quickly,  he added. But manufacturers in Tamil Nadu say the hike is too high, putting them at a disadvantage to competitors in other states. Some say they are already paying workers more than the minimum wage.  The new norms are not distinguishing clearly between skilled and non-skilled workers,  said S Shaktivel of the Tirupur Exporters' Association. He said some companies had launched an appeal against the order at the Madras High Court. In the Chennai labor court, case numbers are called out in quick succession. The seamstress, who is expecting arrears of up to 5,000 rupees, strains to listen over the slow whirring of the ceiling fan.  My financial situation is not very good,  she whispers.  My husband had surgery a few months back, we have a loan to pay back and a house to run. The company owes me arrears for almost one year. I need that income desperately.  Her case is called. The lawyer representing the company asks for more time. Another date is set, with the judge warning against further delays.  I hope I get a good settlement,  the seamstress said as she left court.  After all these years, I would like to stop working, but that looks unlikely. At least if they paid me properly, I would feel a little better.  Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Emma Batha.

Justin Turner homered and drove in two runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers hung on for a tight 3-2 win over the Miami Marlins on Sunday afternoon at Marlins Park. With the victory, the Dodgers (64-29), who have the best record in the majors, have won 29 of their past 33 games, including nine in a row. They also swept this three-game series against the Marlins (41-49). Turner, who is hitting .374 and is a candidate to become the Dodgers' first batting champ since Tommy Davis in 1963, said Los Angeles would have done much more damage had it not been for the deep fences at Marlins Park.  If we were at Dodger Stadium, we might have hit 20 homers this series (instead of six),  Turner said.   This place is enormous, and they have athletic outfielders who cover a lot of ground.  One of those outfielders is Stanton, who had another adventurous, aggressive and violent day on defense. In the fourth inning, he raced back to try to catch what became a triple by Chris Taylor. Stanton crashed into the wall and his glove came off his left hand and fell over the fence. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at MarlinsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch I hit my wrist at the top of the fence,  Stanton said,  and my glove popped off.  A ball boy ran on the field to give Stanton a new glove. Stanton said he ultimately got his original glove back. Also, it was the second game in a row in which Taylor tripled to right, and Stanton crashed into the wall on both occasions. Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill (6-4) got the win, allowing five hits, no walks and one run in five innings. It was the first time he had faced Miami since Sept. 9 when he pitched seven perfect innings. Kenley Jansen earned a four-out save. It was his 23rd consecutive save this season, and he has pitched scoreless ball in 20 of his past 21 appearances. Left-hander Chris O'Grady (1-1), who was signed by the Marlins as a minor-league free agent on May 4 and promoted to the majors on July 8, took the loss. He allowed five hits, two walks and three runs in five innings. The Dodgers raced to an early lead. After Turner's first two RBIs -- his 11th homer of the season in the first inning and a sacrifice fly in the third -- Los Angeles made it 3-0 when Taylor tripled and scored on a single by Austin Barnes. Miami cut its deficit to 3-1 in the fifth. Backup catcher A.J. Ellis doubled and scored from third on pinch hitter Ichiro Suzuki's infield single. Ellis, who started the day with just one extra-base hit this season, doubled twice on Sunday. The Dodgers nearly scored another run in the sixth, but Marcell Ozuna got his glove over the seven-foot fence in left to steal a home run from Enrique Hernandez, an ex-Marlins infielder.  As I was running back, I said, 'This is an opportunity to make a good play,'  Ozuna said.  You make a catch like that, and you feel great. You feel happy.  Los Angeles blew a chance to add to its lead in the seventh. After loading the bases with two outs against reliever Kyle Barraclough, Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager was picked off second base. The Dodgers loaded the bases again in the eighth, but Stanton ended the threat when he raced to the right-field corner and caught a long drive by pinch hitter Chase Utley. Seager made another mistake in the eighth, bobbling a ground ball by Dee Gordon. The error was changed to a hit. Either way, though, it led to a run charged to the ledger of reliever Brandon Morrow. The run scored when Christian Yelich, facing Jansen, grounded a single to center. Jansen ended that two-on threat by striking out pinch-hitter Justin Bour on three pitches, and the closer had a 1-2-3 ninth, extending his National League-best consecutive-save streak.  We've been pretty good all year,  Turner said.  To say it's just a five-week thing ... I don't think that's fair to our team.

I really believe if we play with that kind of internal fire and energy, we are going to win a lot of games in the second half. That's the difference for me. It's just how we feel about ourselves.  Quintana, the first left-hander and just the third pitcher overall to make starts for the Cubs and White Sox in the same season, provided a huge boost right from his first pitch Sunday. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at OriolesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchHe struck out Adams Jones to start his day and worked three perfect innings with five strikeouts before allowing a hit. Jones got him for a ground-rule double to start the fourth inning for the Orioles' first hit, but he was stranded on third after Quintana got Manny Machado to ground out meekly to first base and then struck out Jonathan Schoop and Mark Trumbo. After struggling in six previous starts against the Orioles, including one on May 7 with the White Sox, Quintana only surrendered three hits.  Listen, he was obviously really good,  Maddon said.  I really liked his routine on the mound. Did you notice the big breath? Then, the delivery begins after that. Tremendous focus per pitch. That's what I took away from it.  The Cubs earned their first interleague sweep on the road since August of 2016 and just their second road sweep over an American League East opponent with a big assist from their newly acquired pitcher. Catcher Willson Contreras, batting cleanup, recorded the first four-hit game of his career, while Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant each homered for the defending World Series champions, who jumped all over maligned Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez. The Cubs opened the second inning with three straight doubles to grab the early lead. A two-out single to center by leadoff man Ben Zobrist in the second made it 4-0 and marked the 10th two-out run the Cubs scored over the last two games. Bryant extended the lead to 6-0 in the fourth by ripping a 1-0 pitch from Jimenez into the left-field stands for his 19th home run of the season. Later, with no outs in the ninth inning, Rizzo belted his 22nd homer into the center-field seats off of reliever Darren O'Day.  It's a good team,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  They are not going to let you get away with those mistakes.  Quintana matched the Cubs' record for the most strikeouts in a debut. It marked the third time this season that the left-hander has struck out 10 or more batters and the 10th time of his career. His career high for strikeouts in a game is 13. He came into the game with a 1-4 record against the Orioles and a 4.29 ERA. In his last start against them on May 7, he allowed four runs on nine hits over five innings in a losing effort. But he showed Sunday why he could be such a valuable addition for the Cubs during the second half of the season.  That's why you have to give up four players for a guy like him,  Showalter said.  We knew he'd be having a lot of adrenaline flowing for him today, new teammates, trying to make a mark and prove himself a little bit.  Jimenez, on the other hand, was not nearly as good. He lasted just 3 2/3 innings, allowing six earned runs on 11 hits. He hasn't made it out of the fourth inning in six of his 14 starts this season. He hasn't gotten past the fifth inning in 10 of those starts.  I was able to get ahead but couldn't put it away,  Jimenez said.  They were having too good of an approach, taking the ball to the opposite field. And by the time we figured it out, it was too late. They already scored three, four runs.  The Orioles fell to a season-worst seven games below .500 at 42-49. They are 3-9 in July and 1-7 in their last eight games at Camden Yards. NOTES: After losing six consecutive road series, the Cubs are now unbeaten in four of their last five. ... Cubs C Willson Contreras has now hit safely in 10 of his last 11 games. ... Orioles RHP Ubaldo Jimenez suffered his first home loss of the season in seven starts. He fell to 8-4 in 15 interleague starts and 15-11 in 33 starts overall against the opposing league. ...

The best part is that you don't have to go to extra innings and you win the game,  Frazier said Sunday after his RBI single gave the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4-3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at PNC Park.  To get it done right there is pretty big. I'm pretty excited to come through for the team right there.  Pittsburgh scored twice in the ninth inning on an RBI double by Jordy Mercer and Frazier's RBI single to center, both against reliever Brett Cecil (1-3) after St. Louis twice erased one-run deficits. Pittsburgh (44-48), fourth in the National League Central, won the series with two walk-off victories during the weekend and moved within a half-game of third-place St. Louis (44-47).  We hung around,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  We gave up two leads (Sunday), battled back and had a nice strong ninth inning with some good at-bats.  I'm proud of the men, and I'm proud of the fight. A good series to start the second half.  The ninth opened with Pittsburgh trailing 3-2. Francisco Cervelli got an infield single when shortstop Paul DeLong could not come up with a sharp shot, giving the Pirates hope. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PiratesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatch Paul even said, 'Hey, I'm sorry I didn't make that play,'  Cecil said.  I said, 'You don't need to make the play. It's going to be a tough play regardless. It's just unlucky.'  I told him I could have made better pitches, too. It's just one of those things. If he makes it, it's a great play. Just unlucky.  Josh Harrison, pinch-running for Cervelli, went to second on Gregory Polanco's groundout and scored on Mercer's double to the corner in left. After pinch-hitter Jose Osuna grounded out and pinch-hitter David Freese was intentionally walked, Frazier drove in the winner.  The only pitch I really wish I could have back is, obviously, that last pitch, a curveball that just kind of hung out over the plate,  Cecil said. The pitch was half the equation.  It's a good swing,  Hurdle said.  It's left on left. He let the ball travel. It's hard back up the middle.  Wade LeBlanc (4-2) pitched the ninth for Pittsburgh for the win. Magneuris Sierra was 4-for-4 with an RBI for St. Louis, with his speed helping him notch three infield singles.  I'm definitely aware that my speed can cause the other team some damage and help my team,  said Sierra, who was recalled Saturday and started Sunday.  As soon as I make contact, I really take advantage of the opportunity to get on base.  His four were among 13 hits for the Cardinals. Trevor Williams, making his first career start against the Cardinals, allowed two runs and 10 hits in 5 2/3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. He just missed his fourth quality start in his past five outings. Cardinals starter Carlos Martinez made his 13th quality start, allowing two runs and five hits in seven innings. Andrew McCutchen's 1,400th career hit gave the Pirates a 1-0 lead in the first inning. His one-out single up the middle drove home Frazier, who led off with a bloop single and stole second. St. Louis tied it in the fifth when Sierra reached on an infield single, advanced on Martinez's bunt and scored on Matt Carpenter's double to the corner in right. Light-hitting Max Moroff sent Martinez's first pitch of the fifth off the foul pole in left for his first major league homer and a 2-1 Pittsburgh lead.  That's the beautiful part about the game,  Hurdle said.  You just find ways to give men opportunities from time to time. You see what they can do with them.  It just shows that if he's up there, he's going to fight. He put a real good swing on a good pitch.  St. Louis tied it again in the sixth on Kolten Wong's one-out single, Sierra's infield single an out later and Martinez's RBI base hit up the middle. That chased Williams. Yadier Molina's home run to left in the eighth gave the Cardinals their first lead at 3-2. It was the first homer of the season given up by Pittsburgh reliever Juan Nicasio. NOTES: RF Magneuris Sierra's infield single in the second inning gave him the distinction of being the first St. Louis player to hit safely in his first nine major league games. He was recalled Saturday from Double-A Springfield. ... Pittsburgh RHP and starter Trevor Williams' single to right field in the third inning was his first major league hit after starting his career 0-for-22. ... 2B Josh Harrison, the Pirates' representative at the All-Star Game last week, and 3B David Freese were given the day off from the starting lineup.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-pirates-writethru-idUSMTZED7G7BY40I"}

Daniel Murphy homered twice and had five RBIs, Adam Lind and Jose Lobaton hit two-run homers, and Anthony Rendon added a solo shot to lift the Nationals to a 14-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park.  If you're on my team, everybody plays,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.  We expect them to do the job. We had a big offensive production today. Had some home runs in a home-run park.  Washington (55-36) scored more than 10 runs for the 17th time this season to maintain its 9 1/2-game lead in the National League East over second-place Atlanta. The Nationals played 28 of 30 days heading into the All-Star break and say they've benefited from the rest.  We played a lot of baseball heading into the break,  Murphy said.  I think we appreciated the rest. We're playing with a lot of energy.  The Nationals have outscored the Reds 29-11 in the first three games of the series. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at RedsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch These games are going to happen but not with this frequency,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  It's deflating, but it doesn't mean we'll deflate. They did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things wrong.  Rendon, who had two home runs including a grand slam and six RBIs on Saturday, hit his 19th home run in the seventh inning off former Nationals pitcher Drew Storen. Lobaton also homered off Storen in the seventh. Tanner Roark (7-6) allowed three unearned runs and four hits in six innings to snap his four-game losing streak.  My two-seamer was moving,  Roark said.  Felt like I could throw any pitch any time. I was able to relax, get some confidence and go right at them.  Before making his season debut on June 24, Reds right-hander Homer Bailey had made just eight starts the past two years because of multiple elbow surgeries. He allowed 14 earned runs in his first 4 2/3 innings back but gave up just one run through 6 2/3 innings in his last start at Arizona. However, Sunday was a step back for Bailey. With two outs in the first inning, Murphy hit his 15th home run of the season, a two-run shot off Bailey to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. Murphy then doubled leading off the second and scored on Chris Heisey's double to make the score 3-0.  It's a testament to our offense grinding out at-bats,  Murphy said.  I felt like we didn't give away a lot of pitches.  Two defensive miscues led to two Cincinnati runs in the third inning. Bailey appeared to strike out swinging to begin the inning but reached first when Lobaton didn't throw to first assuming he'd caught the low pitch cleanly before it hit the dirt. The Reds loaded the bases and scored runs on a groundout and fielding error to cut the Nationals' deficit to 4-2. Bailey then walked two to begin the fifth and Murphy launched his 1-2 pitch on to the bullpen netting in right field. It was his fourth multi-home run game but the first this season. Lind's two-run homer later in the fifth, his seventh of the season off Ariel Hernandez, made the score 9-2. Bailey (2-3) allowed eight earned runs and eight hits in four-plus innings.  We lost this game because I didn't pitch well,  Bailey said.  No excuses. I need to be more consistent. I would throw a good pitch, then two bad ones. It's simple. If you make a bad pitch it is going to get hit.

It was his fourth win in a row at Silverstone and fifth in total at the circuit. He now has 57 wins and 67 poles, one short of Michael Schumacher's all-time record. It was also his fourth win of the season and he is one point off Sebastian Vettel's lead. Bottas went from ninth to second to complete the team's second one-two of the year. It was the 70th Mercedes win in Formula One. - FERRARI (Kimi Raikkonen 3, Sebastian Vettel 7) Both drivers endured late tyre drama and had to make pitstops, Vettel on the penultimate lap and Raikkonen earlier. The problem cost Vettel a place on the podium and saw Mercedes surge 55 points clear in the constructors' standings. Vettel had smoking brakes at the start. - RED BULL (Max Verstappen 4, Daniel Ricciardo 5) Ricciardo's run of five successive podiums came to an end but he still excelled in racing from 19th at the start to fifth. Verstappen started fourth, passed Vettel at the start and duelled with the German. He pitted as a precaution after Vettel's problem. It was his first finish since Monaco in May, ending a run of three retirements.      - FORCE INDIA (Esteban Ocon 8, Sergio Perez 9) Force India opened further distance between them and Williams with their eighth double points finish in 10 races. The pair raced each other for most of the afternoon. Perez made a poor start with Ocon getting ahead. Both drivers made one stop. - WILLIAMS (Felipe Massa 10, Lance Stroll 16)     Stroll suffered some bodywork damage to his car, which affected his race and degraded the rear tyres. Massa started 14th and was happy to get a point, although he could not pass the Force Indias. - TORO ROSSO (Daniil Kvyat 15, Carlos Sainz retired)  Kvyat and Sainz collided on the opening lap, putting the Spaniard out of the race and bringing out the safety car. Kvyat, who ran off track at Becketts and collected Sainz as he rejoined, damaged his car's floor and picked up a drive-through penalty for the second race in a row. The Russian now has nine points on his license.        - HAAS (Kevin Magnussen 12, Romain Grosjean 13) Both drivers did a one stop strategy. Grosjean had to make an unscheduled pitstop on lap 43 after contact with Marcus Ericsson's Sauber damaged the right rear tyre. Magnussen had contact with a Toro Rosso at the start. - RENAULT (Nico Hulkenberg 6, Jolyon Palmer did not start) Hulkenberg scored Renault's first points since Canada, on the team's 40th anniversary weekend. The German started fifth. Palmer's car lost hydraulic pressure on the formation lap.     - SAUBER (Marcus Ericsson 14, Pascal Wehrlein 17) Wehrlein made three stops, changing to medium tyres when the safety car came out. He then changed to softs a lap later. They then lost grip and he had to change to supersofts. - MCLAREN (Stoffel Vandoorne 11, Fernando Alonso retired) Vandoorne came close to taking his first point of the campaign, after running as high as seventh. A delayed pitstop let Massa get ahead after they came out side-by-side. Alonso started last, with a 30-place grid drop, and retired on lap 35 with a fuel pressure problem.

Leonetti,Matt Reeves,Schmidt's","sector":"Subjects","content":"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) -  War for the Planet of the Apes  is officially the box office champ, during a weekend that demands a close look. Fox and Chernin Entertainment's latest  Apes  movie is coming in on the low end of expectations with $56.5 million from 4,022 locations. It was pegged at $60 million-$65 million earlier in the week, but is ending up about the same as 2011's  Rise of the Planet of the Apes,  which kicked off the modern trilogy with $54.8 million during its opening weekend. 2014's  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes  was a bigger hit with a $72.6 million domestic opening, when it hit theaters against the third weekend of  Transformers: Age of Extinction.  One way  War for the Planet of the Apes  stands out from other big-budget studio films is its rave reviews -- it currently has a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, which depicts the titular war between apes and humans, is directed by Matt Reeves, who joined the franchise when he stepped in on  Dawn.  Much has been made of the noticeable updates in technology that have gone into bring Andy Serkis' character Caesar, the lead ape, to life. Woody Harrelson, in human form, joins the franchise as the villain, while Steve Zahn, as a chimp, offers comic relief.  First and foremost the movie came in right where we expected it to,  said Fox's distribution chief Chris Aronson, who pointed to a potentially  soft  next few weeks that could give  Apes  a long runway.  We're going to play for quite some time,  he said. Actress Amiah Miller is seen on the red carpet at a screening of  War for the Planet of the Apes  in Manhattan, New York, U.S., July 10, 2017.Bria Webb Spider Man: Homecoming,  meanwhile, is landing in second with about $45.2 million. That's a 61% drop from last weekend's heroic opening, which is probably a steeper falloff than Sony would have liked to see. That said, the movie's total domestic gross in two weekend -- $208.3 million -- is already higher than the entire run of  The Amazing Spider-Man 2.   Homecoming  is a hit with critics and audiences (93% on Rotten Tomatoes; A CinemaScore), and dominated social media chatter for weeks leading up to its release. Tom Holland is the teen in the red suit, who first joined the Marvel universe in  Captain America: Civil War.  The weekend's other major release apart from  Apes  is the horror flick  Wish Upon  from Broad Green Pictures and Orion Pictures. The movie is entering the box office with a whisper, about $5.6 million from 2,250 locations. The fright-fest is directed by John R. Leonetti based on a script by Barbara Marshall. Its primarily young cast, led by Joey King, includes two Netflix alums in  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's  Ki Hong Lee (aka Dong), and  Stranger Things'  beloved Barb, Shannon Purser. The movie was largely panned by critics, with a 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it also carries a lackluster audience appeal with a C CinemaScore. Slideshow (2 Images)Universal's  Despicable Me 3  is showing in third place for the weekend, expecting to earn an additional $19 million from 4,155 locations. And Sony's  Baby Driver  stays in the conversation with a strong 32% hold that should land it in fourth. Edgar Wright's latest is racing to $8.8 million from 3,043 locations. Rounding out the top five is the indie darling  The Big Sick  from comedian Kumail Nanjiani. The movie expanded to wide release (2,597 spots) during its fourth weekend in theaters, and should earn $7.6 million.  It's amazing that this independent film has found its footing as a family movie among all the summer blockbusters,  said Amazon Studios' marketing and distribution chief Bob Berney in a statement.  The comedy and universal themes are connecting with audiences across the country.  Finally, keep an eye on  Wonder Woman,  which is finishing in sixth this weekend with $6.7 million, and closing in on several benchmarks. By Monday, it's expected to cross $381 million domestically, which would put it past  Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows Part 2  to become the third highest Warner Bros. movie ever. It's also only a few million shy of passing  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,  which with $386.2 million is currently the highest grossing movie of the summer so far.  Wonder Woman  has already blown past the domestic totals of fellow DC Comics movies  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  and  Suicide Squad.

Late on Friday the country's parliament, where the Law and Justice (PiS) party has a majority, passed a bill giving parliament a greater say in appointing judges, which critics say violates the constitutional separation of powers. The conservative, eurosceptic PiS has also introduced draft legislation in the past week that would replace all Supreme Court judges except those chosen by the justice minister.  Shame, shame  chanted protesters gathered in Warsaw under Polish and European Union flags, and calling Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of PiS and the country's de facto leader, a  dictator . PiS says the party has a democratic mandate to make the judiciary more efficient and accountable to the public. Since winning the 2015 election the party has overhauled the constitutional court and given the Justice Ministry control over the prosecutor general's office.  Threatening to take Poland to court, the European Union executive has said these measures undermine democratic checks and balances, a charge PiS denies. On Sunday opposition leaders urged the protesters to remain in front of the parliament until Tuesday when lawmakers are to debate the Supreme Court bill. Parliamentary opposition leaders vowed they would not allow for the debate to take place. Protesters hold candles during a candlelight rally to protest against judicial reforms in front of the Supreme Court in Warsaw, Poland, July 16, 2017. Agencja Gazeta/Franciszek Mazur via REUTERSThe country's fragmented opposition also promised to be more united against PiS.   Today we know that a great fight has begun and we know we must be together, we know we must fight against them together,  Grzegorz Schetyna, leader of the largest political grouping, the Civic Platform, told the crowd.  Slideshow (6 Images)Poland's TVP television, controlled by the state, said the protests and calls to block Tuesday's debate were  an attempt to organize a coup against a democratically elected power.   In December Poland saw its biggest political stand-off in years when opposition leaders blocked the parliament's plenary hall podium ahead of a budget vote, after objecting to plans by PiS to curb media access to parliament.  Protesters on Sunday were cordoned off from the main entrance to the parliament by barricades erected ahead of the demonstrations.

Matt Kemp and Matt Adams homered, Brandon Phillips had three doubles and the Braves won 7-1 as left-hander Jaime Garcia ended his four-game losing streak.  That's a good team we swept,  Kemp said.  We've just got to keep going, but it's a step in the right direction. This month is going to decide us going forward and where we stand.  Garcia, who hadn't won since May 26 in San Francisco, allowed four hits in seven innings as the Diamondbacks (53-39) lost their fifth straight game. Acquired from St. Louis during the winter, Garcia (3-7) improved to 6-1 against Arizona in his career. He struck out seven and walked three.  That was a big start by Jaime,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  That was a shot in the arm.  Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at BravesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchGarcia said,  It was good to do it against a good lineup. I'm not going to lie. The 'W' felt good.  The Braves (45-45) have won 16 of their last 24 games to get to .500 after April for the first time since July 7, 2015.  We went into the break off a pretty good series in Washington and you can't say enough about what they just did,  Snitker said of his team.  Getting to .500 is a hurdle. It's nice to get there. But the way we've played, I feel we should be about five over instead of at .500.  Arizona, which hadn't dropped more than three games in a row until this series, has lost 10 of 13 games.  We played pretty good the first half. Obviously being swept two of the past three series is a big deal,  Diamondbacks catcher Jeff Mathis said.  We're just not clicking on all cylinders at this moment.  Diamondbacks starter Zack Godley (3-4) came in with a 2.58 ERA but allowed seven runs (six earned) in six innings. Although the right-hander struck out a career-high nine, six of the eight hits he allowed went for extra bases. Ender Inciarte had a single and double for the Braves, scoring twice and finishing the series 7-for-13. Phillips had his second straight three-hit game, driving in two runs and scoring once. The veteran second baseman was in an 8-for-53 slump before getting three hits, including a homer and double, in Saturday's 8-5 victory by the Braves. Phillips' first RBI double gave the Braves the lead after three pitches and they added an unearned run in the second before turning to the long ball in the third. Kemp picked on a first-pitch fastball with two on for his 13th homer, breaking a drought of nearly a month, and Adams followed an out later by turning on a 1-2 breaking ball for his 15th blast of the season.  Guys have been giving me a hard time about not hitting the ball out of the ballpark, so it felt good to get that one,  said Kemp, who had last homered on June 21. It was the first time the Braves had hit two homers in an inning since pinch-hitter Lane Adams and Phillips went deep in an eight-run fifth inning against San Francisco on June 22. Paul Goldschmidt singled in a run for the Diamondbacks in the fourth, but Phillips produced another RBI double in the bottom of the inning.  This is a very resilient group. They have been all year,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  They should be proud of where they're at. We know we've hit a little stumbling block and that's part of the season, part of every baseball season.  NOTES: The Diamondbacks placed RHP Randall Delgado on the 10-day disabled list with right elbow inflammation after he gave up four sixth-inning runs while getting two outs in a loss Saturday. ... RHP J.J. Hoover was activated by Arizona after being on the DL since June 23 because of right shoulder inflammation. Atlanta bench coach Terry Pendleton, the National League MVP in 1991, turned 57 Sunday. ... The Braves open a three-game home series against the Chicago Cubs on Monday with RHP Julio Teheran (7-6, 4.79 ERA) facing LHP Jon Lester (5-6, 4.25). ...

The Olympic silver medalist stormed home in 20.03 seconds ahead of American Ameer Webb (20.18) and Britain's Zharnel Hughes (20.22). Like many of the athletes on show, De Grasse was using the event as a warm-up for the world championships in London from Aug. 4-13. He was pleased with his run, but has yet to go under 20 seconds this season.   “It was a good race and a good performance,” De Grasse said. “I was pushed in the bend, but I wanted to finish strong today and to stay relaxed. This was a race to tune-up for the world championships and it went pretty well.”   Jamaican sprinter Elaine Thompson picked up her 14th victory in a row in the 100 meters, edging Ivorian Marie-Josee Ta Lou. Thompson's time of 10.87 was an improvement on her run in London last weekend by 0.07, and more success for the double Olympic champion, who has focused only on this distance in 2017.  I'm pleased with my race,  Thompson said.  I'm in the shape that I want to be in and I'm looking forward to the world championships in London.

Miller-Uib coasted home in 49.80, but Semenya was well back in seventh in a time of 51.53, though that was her best run of the Diamond League series. American Ryan Crouser claimed a 10th straight win in the shot put with 22.47 meters, while Colombia’s Olympic champion Caterine Ibarguen returned to winning ways in the triple jump with 14.51 meters after defeat by Yulimar Rojas in Rome.

Stephen DeNichilo, portfolio manager of the Federated Kaufmann Large Cap fund, notes that Whirlpool has doubled sales to $21 billion since 2000 while reducing its cost base by $4.7 billion since purchasing Maytag in 2006. The stock has gained about 90 percent since the end of 2012, but it remains a bargain, Barron's said. At $192, it trades for just under 13 times the 2017 estimated adjusted earnings figure and has risen just 6 percent in 2017, versus 9 percent for the overall market. Rival Electrolux (ELUXb.ST), which owns Frigidaire, is up 24 percent this year.  Whirlpool gets no credit for fantastic execution since housing began to turn around in 2011,  DeNichilo said in the report. If Whirlpool hits consensus 2018 earnings estimate of $17.40 a share and can trade at a 15 times multiple, the company's stock price could move to $260, as investors appreciate its strengths, DeNichilo said.  Zachary Mannes, lead analyst at Stock Waves, part of ElliottWaveTrader.net, a technical-analysis trading community, said that based on investor sentiment, Whirlpool will turn sharply higher if it can break through $203 per share. If that happens, Mannes told Barron's, the next stop would be in  the $350 region.  However, Whirlpool does have critics, many of whom target the entire home appliance industry. In fact, 6.4 percent of Whirlpool's shares have been sold short. One major argument is that the North American replacement cycle for large appliances has peaked and is heading down. Bearish investors see this as worrisome for Whirlpool, which holds a leading 40 percent share in such markets, Barron's noted.

O'Neil is cutting back the fund's exposure to risky assets overall, reducing his position across virtually every fixed-income category and adding exposure to U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasuries now make up 32 percent of assets, more than double what it was a year ago, according to Barron's.  “The risk assets we purchased are priced for perfection,” he said in the report. “There isn’t a lot of value and very little margin for error.” He has also increased his exposure to inflation-protected Treasuries, bringing the fund's position in TIPS to more than 6 percent of total assets, with a focus on intermediate and longer-term bonds. Ford believes interest rates are likely to rise modestly as inflation edges up, but strong demand for fixed income from retiring baby boomers and overseas investors should have a stabilizing effect. Despite disappointing numbers recently he expects wage growth to pick up soon, driving inflation.  “If we’re right, there is going to be a larger total return for those [longer duration] securities,” he says. The fund’s overall duration, recently 5.4 years, is slightly less than the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate. The report also noted that O'Neil has been adding to handpicked names in the energy space in both investment grade and high yield, including Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N) and emerging market plays including Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and Mexico's state oil company Pemex PEMX.UL. However, the fund has reduced its high-yield and emerging market ownership to just 7.3 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. It has also trimmed some 10 percentage points from its corporate investment-grade position to 23.3 percent of assets and cut agency mortgage-backed securities to 18 percent of assets, compared to more than 28 percent for the benchmark.

AG2R-La Mondiale accelerated suddenly at the front of the peloton with some 45-km left and Froome and some of his team mates were trapped at the wrong end of the split. A spoke on Froome's rear wheel broke and he was assisted by team mate Michal Kwiatkowski. Slideshow (18 Images)Team Sky's Mikel Nieve and Vasil Kiryienka then pulled Froome along in their wake as they trailed Bardet's group, which contained Aru and Rigoberto Uran, by 45 seconds. The Briton made up the time on the ascent of the Col de Peyra Taillade, an 8.3-km climb at an average gradient of 7.4 percent, with the help of team mate Mikel Landa, who briefly dropped out of the Bardet group to tow his leader back. “Never a dull moment in this year’s Tour, that’s for sure,  said Froome.  Just coming into the main climb of the day I had a bit of a mechanical problem, I had to change the back wheel, and it couldn’t have happened at a worse time really. It was all hands on deck. I think I'll pass out tonight. I'm knackered.  Bardet and Aru, who opted to stay in the wheels of the Frenchman's team mates in the punishing ascent instead of upping the pace to finish Froome off, jumped away on the final climb but were easily reined in.

With improvised polling stations in more than 80 countries, the Venezuelan diaspora was seeking to delegitimize Maduro's plans to rewrite the constitution after three months of anti-government protests that have led to nearly 100 deaths.  Lines snaked around blocks at some polling stations in expatriate hubs like Miami, Madrid, and Bogota, where Venezuelans draped themselves in flags and shouted,  We want freedom!        With this vote we want to say to Maduro that Venezuela can't wait. We want elections now. The people want him out,  said Audrey Lopez, 49, who was among volunteers staffing a polling station in the Spanish capital.      I haven't been back to Venezuela in four years. What I save on the journey I send to my family in food, medicine or hygiene products because they are either very expensive or non-existent there,  she added.     Mitzy Capriles, wife of former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma who is currently in prison on charges of conspiracy, also voted in Madrid, while the father of prominent opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez cast his ballot in Rome.  Today we are gathering peacefully to send a clear message that (the Venezuelan government) needs to listen ... and to open its eyes and see what is happening and what the people of Venezuela want,  the elder Leopoldo Lopez told reporters.  In Latin America, where ranks of Venezuelan migrants have been swelling, voters participated from Andean capital Quito to beachside Rio de Janeiro.

Sociologist Tomas Paez estimates some 2 million have emigrated since the late Hugo Chavez took office in 1999 and that the pace has picked up under Maduro, though government supporters dispute those figures as overblown. Caracas-based Paez has published papers and books on migration. Nicknamed 'Saudi Venezuela' in the booming 1970s and once a magnet for European migrants, the OPEC nation is now brimming with goodbye parties and queues for passports or visas outside embassies in the capital Caracas. Officials often ridicule Venezuelans abroad as histrionic elitists made in the same mould as the traditionally right-wing Cuban exiles in Florida.

Expatriates have mobilized en masse in past presidential elections, even traveling by bus from Miami to New Orleans to cast ballots against the ruling movement known as  Chavismo,  named after the charismatic former leader who died in 2013. But they have faced bitter setbacks time after time.   Ever since we left Venezuela in 2002, I knew the country would get worse with this regime, and time has proven us right, but I'm upbeat about change coming to Venezuela,  said engineer Juan Sansiviero, 41 a former employee of state oil company PDVSA, voting in Katy, Texas.

O'Neil is cutting back the fund's exposure to risky assets overall, reducing his position across virtually every fixed-income category and adding exposure to U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasuries now make up 32 percent of assets, more than double what it was a year ago, according to Barron's.  “The risk assets we purchased are priced for perfection,” he said in the report. “There isn’t a lot of value and very little margin for error.” He has also increased his exposure to inflation-protected Treasuries, bringing the fund's position in TIPS to more than 6 percent of total assets, with a focus on intermediate and longer-term bonds. Ford believes interest rates are likely to rise modestly as inflation edges up, but strong demand for fixed income from retiring baby boomers and overseas investors should have a stabilizing effect. Despite disappointing numbers recently he expects wage growth to pick up soon, driving inflation.  “If we’re right, there is going to be a larger total return for those [longer duration] securities,” he says. The fund’s overall duration, recently 5.4 years, is slightly less than the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate. The report also noted that O'Neil has been adding to handpicked names in the energy space in both investment grade and high yield, including Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N) and emerging market plays including Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and Mexico's state oil company Pemex PEMX.UL. However, the fund has reduced its high-yield and emerging market ownership to just 7.3 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. It has also trimmed some 10 percentage points from its corporate investment-grade position to 23.3 percent of assets and cut agency mortgage-backed securities to 18 percent of assets, compared to more than 28 percent for the benchmark.

Froome suffered a mechanical problem when Romain Bardet's AG2R-La Mondiale were going full out and had split the bunch before the key climb of the day. But the Frenchman, instead of making a big effort himself, along with Italian Fabio Aru and Colombian Rigoberto Uran, stayed in his team mates' wheels, eventually allowing Froome to come back.

Fourteen years after a pony-tailed Swiss starlet first soared into the tennis ether at The All England Club, Federer returned on Sunday as a 35-year-old veteran to confirm his place as the greatest man ever to play the grasscourt slam with a record eighth title. The 6-3 6-1 6-4 victory over Marin Cilic was a brutal demolition job, as the Croat's blistered feet rendered him easy pickings.  Yet, having delivered a 19th major title for his army of fans on Centre Court, Federer admitted that his advancing age and last year's injury issues meant he could not say for certain that he would be back to defend his crown next year.      I hope that I'm back, but there's never a guarantee, especially not at 35,  he told reporters.  Federer's resurgence to the game's summit will go down as one of sport's most remarkable comeback tales. When he exited Wimbledon last year, he spent six months out of tennis through injury. Even the great man himself had doubts as to whether he could ever rekindle the magic that had delivered his last major title in 2012.  However, after the doubts were swept away by a sensational victory at the Australian Open in January, Federer made a game-changing career move to skip the claycourt season and focus on his favorite surface.  And few calls have ever been vindicated with such a resounding affirmation.   I guess you would have laughed if I told you I was going to win two slams this year,  he said.  I also didn't believe that I was going to win two.  But, it's incredible. I don't know how much longer it's going to last... But I have just got to always remind myself that health comes first at this point. If I do that, maybe things are actually possible I didn't think were.  A lot has changed in the years since Federer clinched his first grand slam trophy at Wimbledon.  The long hair has gone and the fresh face that snatched the title in 2003 has been replaced by the filled-out features of a tour veteran. Yet, as he marched to this year's crown without dropping a set, it was clear that the dazzling array of shots and sheer, balletic brilliance of tennis's greatest male player are all still in evidence. Having surpassed Pete Sampras and William Renshaw, who both had seven titles, Federer has earned his place in the record books at a tournament whose history is so important to him.   Wimbledon was always my favorite tournament, will always be my favorite tournament,  he said.  My heroes walked the grounds here and walked the courts here. Because of them, I think I became a better player.  To make history here at Wimbledon really means a lot to me just because of all of that really. It's that simple.

The $4 billion contribution is the result of 25 years of revenue sharing during which Foxwoods has brought 340 million guests and reinvested nearly $100 million of annual tourism revenue into Connecticut, representatives for the Mashantucket Pequot said in a statement on Saturday. The announcement comes as the state, the wealthiest in the nation, remains embroiled in a budget dispute with lawmakers attempting to tackle a $450 million revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year. The state is facing estimated deficits of $5 billion for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years combined, according to The Connecticut Business & Industry Association. Connecticut has a per capita income of $71,033, far above the national average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. No other state has a per-capita income above $70,000, though Washington D.C.'s per capita income in $75,569. Connecticut House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz said Friday that the state's general assembly will not be voting on a 2018 budget next week, according to reports, despite an already passed June 30 deadline to do so. Lawmakers were aiming for a budget vote on Tuesday, one day after unionized state employees were expected to vote on the two-year, $1.57 billion concession package.

For all the admiration for Roger Federer's record eighth title and the appreciation of the exciting promise of women's winner Garbine Muguruza, two one-sided finals were not what fans wanted to see. Those finals did, however, typify a tournament that promised so much yet ultimately, for all its usual elegance and charm, failed to deliver the excitement and drama that sports fans expect. Ticket prices of 155 pounds ($203.08) for the women's final and 190 pounds ($248.94) for the men's final can certainly be justified in the current entertainment market but the matches hardly brought bang for the buck. In the showpiece men's game on Sunday, Federer's opponent, Croatian Marin Cilic slumped to a 6-3 6-1 6-4 loss, twice receiving attention from medical staff and afterwards saying he had been hampered by a blister. A day earlier Venus Williams, searching for a sixth singles title at Wimbledon, lost in straight sets to Muguruza, meekly surrendering 6-0 in the second set. The impression was that Williams had run out of steam - even if she admirably refused to make excuses or take credit away from the victor - and that was disappointing for those who had hoped to see the 37-year-old go to the wire against one of the sport's brightest young talents. The local fans had enjoyed a British victory last year with Andy Murray winning his second title but there was no 'Murray Mania' this year - with wear and tear also to blame for his demise. The Briton came into the tournament under a cloud, facing questions about his fitness after a first-round exit at the grasscourt warm-up event at Queen's. Murray battled on but in his quarter-final defeat by American Sam Querrey he was clearly in pain and lost the final two sets in less than 47 minutes. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 15, 2017   Spain’s Garbine Muguruza poses with the trophy as she celebrates winning the final against Venus Williams of the U.S.Matthew ChildsPerhaps the dominance of an older generation, with a record seven men over 30 in the second week, came at a price with the aches and pains of a grueling tour hampering too many. Another of the 'Big Four', Serbian Novak Djokovic, also had injury, not a thrilling upset, to blame for his last eight exit as he retired, a set and break down in the second, with an elbow injury while facing Czech Tomas Berdych. Genuine Upset Those fans who opted for Rafa Nadal's fourth round match with Gilles Muller were at least treated to a genuine upset with the Spaniard beaten by the inspired journeyman from Luxembourg in a five-set classic. The women's tournament brought many better contests - home favorite Johanna Konta's second round battle with Croatian Donna Vekic was gripping, as was her quarter-final win against Simona Halep.  Muguruza's comeback win over world number one Angelique Kerber in the fourth round, was a high quality encounter and set the tone for her run to glory. But the Spaniard had it too easy in the semi against stage-struck Slovak Magdalena Rybarikova while Konta couldn't mount a major obstacle to Williams. The women's doubles final was another disappointment though - Russians Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina cruising to a 6-0 6-0 victory over the pairing of Taiwan's Hao-Ching Chan and Romanian Monica Niculescu in a championship match that lasted 54 minutes. Doubles fans did, however, get plenty of value for money with the men's final which lasted four hours and 39 minutes as Poland's Lukasz Kubot and Brazil's Marcelo Melo beat Austrian Oliver Marach and Croat Mate Pavic in five sets, the decider being clinched 13-11 in an epic test of endurance. They showed the staying power that, for one reason or another, too many lacked at this tournament.

The draft law faced opposition from politicians including members of a small centrist group which supports Gentiloni's Democratic Party's (PD) slim majority in the upper house Senate. A government source said earlier this month the measure would be put to a confidence vote, which speeds up passage of legislation but obliges the government to resign if it loses. The premier squashed that possibility on Sunday.  Given the urgent deadlines in the Senate calendar and the difficulties that have emerged in some parts of the majority, I don't think the conditions are right to approve the draft law on citizenship for foreign minors born in Italy before the summer break,  Gentiloni said in a statement. Under the proposed law, children born in Italy to non-Italians, or who arrive before their 12th birthdays and spend at least five years in formal education, could be declared citizens. Immigration is one of the thorniest issues facing Italian politicians, who have had to deal with the arrival of more than half a million mainly sub-Saharan Africans by boat from Libya over the last three years.  Opponents proposed some 48,000 amendments to the citizenship law by the time it reached the Senate for discussion in June, more than 1-1/2 years after it was approved in the lower house. A scuffle broke out and two senators were slightly injured. Gentiloni said the law, which would require one or both parents to have a long-term residence permit before they could apply for citizenship, was  just .  I remain personally committed, as does the government, to approving it in the autumn,  he said.

The German, who felt lucky to see the chequered flag after a penultimate lap puncture at the British Grand Prix, finished seventh with Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton triumphant in front of his home crowd.  The car is great, it has been fantastic in the race again today,  Vettel told reporters.  So there is no reason to panic or to worry. But we need to be aware that they (Mercedes) are very quick and there are a couple of advantages that we need to work on. Then it could be a different picture.   Vettel said the puncture had happened out of the blue.  It was very sudden,  he said, explaining that he had already dropped the pace and was nursing the car home in third place before the blowout.  The tyres were going down but nothing out of the ordinary, so it was quite sudden when the tyre decided not to take me to the end of the race,  he added.

It could have been a lot worse, however, with Vettel looking at one point like failing to score -- an outcome that would have sent Hamilton into the overall lead.

The Senate, which is delaying its consideration of the bill while Arizona Republican Senator John McCain recuperates from surgery to remove a blood clot, will take it up as soon as all senators are available, Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican senator, said. McCain's absence casts doubt on whether the Senate would be able to pass legislation to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. Collins is one of two Republican senators who have already said that they would not even vote to open debate on the latest version of the bill released on Thursday, meaning one more defection from the Republican ranks could kill it.. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin. With the Democrats solidly opposed to the legislation, the Republicans can only pass the bill if all their other members back it and if Republican Vice President Mike Pence casts his tie-breaking vote in favor. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Sunday showed Americans preferred Obamacare by a 2-1 margin. Approaching six months in office, Trump’s overall approval rating has dropped to 36 percent from 42 percent in April.  While Collins said that she did not know if the legislation would ultimately pass, she said as many as 10 Republicans have doubts about it. Bad Strategy  There are about eight to 10 Republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill,  Collins told CNN's  State of the Union  program, faulting the bill for its major cuts to the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor, which she said would harm rural hospitals and nursing homes.  I don't know whether it will pass, but I do know this, we should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that's been on the books for 50 years - the Medicaid program - without having a single hearing to evaluate what the consequences are going to be,  she added. Republican Senator Rand Paul also reiterated his opposition to the bill, which he described as  terrible  because it retained many of the Obamacare taxes and subsidies.  The current system is terrible,  Paul said on Fox News Sunday.  I don't think Republicans should put their name on this. It is a bad political strategy and it will not fix the problem.  The bill unwinds Obamacare's Medicaid expansion over three years, from 2021 to 2024. But it goes beyond repealing Obamacare by imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid that deepen in 2025. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cut Medicaid by nearly $800 billion by 2026, and would cut Medicaid 35 percent come 2036.

The death of the Tehran-born Mirzakhani, who specialized in theoretical mathematics, came three years after she received the Fields Medal at an event in Seoul. The prize is handed out every four years to honor mathematicians under 40 who make major contributions. Mirzakhani was 37 when in 2014 she became the first woman to win the prize, which was established in 1936 and is equivalent to the Nobel Prize for mathematics.  The mathematician received the medal for her work in understanding the symmetry of curved surfaces, Stanford officials said in 2014. Mirzakhani at the time said she had dreamed of becoming a writer when she was young, before taking an interest in mathematical problems.  It is fun; it's like solving a puzzle or connecting the dots in a detective case,  she said in 2014. Growing up in Iran, she attended an all-girls high school and gained recognition as a teenager in the 1994 and 1995 competitions of the International Mathematical Olympiad. She later graduated from Sharif University in Tehran and then headed to Harvard University in Massachusetts, to obtain her doctorate in mathematics. Mirzakhani joined the faculty at Stanford in the San Francisco Bay area in 2008. In recent years, she worked with Alex Eskin at the University of Chicago to investigate the trajectory of a billiard ball as it bounces around a polygonal table. The complexities in the ball's movement have long bedeviled physicists. Mirzakhani, while solving mathematical problems, often drew on large sheets of paper while scribbling formulas on the edges, an approach that her young daughter believed to be a form of painting, according to Stanford. Mirzakhani is survived by her husband, Jan Vondrák, and a daughter, Anahita. A Stanford spokesman said he did not have any information on where Mirzakhani died.

Leonetti,Matt Reeves,Schmidt's","sector":"Subjects","content":"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) -  War for the Planet of the Apes  is officially the box office champ, during a weekend that demands a close look. Fox and Chernin Entertainment's latest  Apes  movie is coming in on the low end of expectations with $56.5 million from 4,022 locations. It was pegged at $60 million-$65 million earlier in the week, but is ending up about the same as 2011's  Rise of the Planet of the Apes,  which kicked off the modern trilogy with $54.8 million during its opening weekend. 2014's  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes  was a bigger hit with a $72.6 million domestic opening, when it hit theaters against the third weekend of  Transformers: Age of Extinction.  One way  War for the Planet of the Apes  stands out from other big-budget studio films is its rave reviews -- it currently has a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, which depicts the titular war between apes and humans, is directed by Matt Reeves, who joined the franchise when he stepped in on  Dawn.  Much has been made of the noticeable updates in technology that have gone into bring Andy Serkis' character Caesar, the lead ape, to life. Woody Harrelson, in human form, joins the franchise as the villain, while Steve Zahn, as a chimp, offers comic relief.  First and foremost the movie came in right where we expected it to,  said Fox's distribution chief Chris Aronson, who pointed to a potentially  soft  next few weeks that could give  Apes  a long runway.  We're going to play for quite some time,  he said. Actress Amiah Miller is seen on the red carpet at a screening of  War for the Planet of the Apes  in Manhattan, New York, U.S., July 10, 2017.Bria Webb Spider Man: Homecoming,  meanwhile, is landing in second with about $45.2 million. That's a 61% drop from last weekend's heroic opening, which is probably a steeper falloff than Sony would have liked to see. That said, the movie's total domestic gross in two weekend -- $208.3 million -- is already higher than the entire run of  The Amazing Spider-Man 2.   Homecoming  is a hit with critics and audiences (93% on Rotten Tomatoes; A CinemaScore), and dominated social media chatter for weeks leading up to its release. Tom Holland is the teen in the red suit, who first joined the Marvel universe in  Captain America: Civil War.  The weekend's other major release apart from  Apes  is the horror flick  Wish Upon  from Broad Green Pictures and Orion Pictures. The movie is entering the box office with a whisper, about $5.6 million from 2,250 locations. The fright-fest is directed by John R. Leonetti based on a script by Barbara Marshall. Its primarily young cast, led by Joey King, includes two Netflix alums in  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's  Ki Hong Lee (aka Dong), and  Stranger Things'  beloved Barb, Shannon Purser. The movie was largely panned by critics, with a 20% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it also carries a lackluster audience appeal with a C CinemaScore. Slideshow (2 Images)Universal's  Despicable Me 3  is showing in third place for the weekend, expecting to earn an additional $19 million from 4,155 locations. And Sony's  Baby Driver  stays in the conversation with a strong 32% hold that should land it in fourth. Edgar Wright's latest is racing to $8.8 million from 3,043 locations. Rounding out the top five is the indie darling  The Big Sick  from comedian Kumail Nanjiani. The movie expanded to wide release (2,597 spots) during its fourth weekend in theaters, and should earn $7.6 million.  It's amazing that this independent film has found its footing as a family movie among all the summer blockbusters,  said Amazon Studios' marketing and distribution chief Bob Berney in a statement.  The comedy and universal themes are connecting with audiences across the country.  Finally, keep an eye on  Wonder Woman,  which is finishing in sixth this weekend with $6.7 million, and closing in on several benchmarks. By Monday, it's expected to cross $381 million domestically, which would put it past  Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows Part 2  to become the third highest Warner Bros. movie ever. It's also only a few million shy of passing  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,  which with $386.2 million is currently the highest grossing movie of the summer so far.  Wonder Woman  has already blown past the domestic totals of fellow DC Comics movies  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  and  Suicide Squad.

(Reuters) - Disney princesses wearing sweat pants and discussing their flaws in a scene from upcoming animated movie  Wreck-It Ralph 2  became the most talked-about moment on Friday at Disney's annual D23 convention.  The clip from the film, a sequel to 2012's  Wreck-It Ralph  about retro arcade video game characters, sees Ralph and the mischievous Vanellope enter the world of Internet. They land in a Disney website that resembles a virtual Disney theme park and Vanellope interrupts a gathering of Disney princesses from past and present.   Seeing all the princesses together, we wanted them to actually have a nice moment with Vanellope ... she recognizes (them) being real and that does break down the stereotypes,  said John Lasseter, chief creative officer of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios.  Disney's princess tales have been criticized by some for portraying female leads as helpless and in need of rescuing by a man, such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Films such as  Brave  and  Moana  have seen young princesses breaking free of tradition to carve their own fate.  In the scene, the princesses - including Snow White, Jasmine, Tiana, Rapunzel, Elsa and Moana - determine if Vanellope is a princess by asking her if she has been enslaved or if she has daddy issues. When she says no to the latter, the princesses chime  neither do we!   They then swap their gowns for t-shirts and sweat pants and discuss the challenges of being perfect - Snow White shows off her thick glasses and Princess Jasmine reveals she's allergic to cats despite having a pet tiger.   These characters are really strong, they're really amazing characters and we love to think of them way beyond just the movie that was made,  Lasseter said.   Wreck-It Ralph 2  was part of a presentation of Disney's upcoming films at D23, a gathering for Disney fans in Southern California.  Fans were shown concepts and rough scenes for sequels to Scandinavian princess tale  Frozen 2,  the adventures of a superhero family in  Incredibles 2  and Pixar's upcoming  Coco,  inspired by the Mexican Day of the Dead festivities.  Actor Josh Gad, who plays  Frozen  snowman Olaf, sang one of the four new songs from the upcoming 21-minute short film  Olaf's Frozen Adventure,  debuting alongside  Coco  in November.  New films include the fourth  Toy Story  and an untitled suburban fantasy tale of two brothers on a quest to spend one last day with their late father.

SPD leader Martin Schulz has accused Merkel of making empty promises about Germany's economic and political future as the former president of the European Parliament set out his own plans to boost investment and enhance European unity. The exchange comes 10 weeks before the federal election in which Merkel seeks a fourth term and follows a repeated call on Berlin by the International Monetary Fund to increase investment as a way to boost imports, support the recovery in other countries and reduce its record trade surplus. Asked in a television interview by ARD public broadcaster about her investment plans and Schulz's criticism, Merkel said:  We currently cannot spend the money that we have.  She pointed to planning and capacity bottlenecks in the construction industry as well as at the level of regional authorities. Germany has earmarked billions of euros in investments for schools, nurseries, hospitals and housing, but local authorities have so far spent only a fraction of that windfall due to planning bottlenecks. Merkel said the federal government had put aside additional money for more investment in its mid-term budget plans, adding:  We still have a lot to do in this regard.  Merkel said Germany had to increase investment in high-speed internet broadband connections.  We say, for example, that we have to use at least one third of the additional tax revenues for investment. It can also be more,  she said.

Kuczynski's approval rating fell to 34 percent in July from 39 percent in June, while his disapproval rating rose to 58 percent from 51 percent last month, the monthly poll conducted by Ipsos Peru and published in local newspaper El Comercio showed.  In late June, Congress - dominated by defeated right-wing presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori's Popular Force party - forced Economy Minister Alberto Thorne to resign over allegations he improperly interfered in an airport contract, dealing a blow to Kuczynski's business-friendly administration. Thorne has denied any wrongdoing.

Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker who took office almost one year ago, has seen his approval rating decline from a peak of 63 percent in September amid a graft probe related to Brazilian builder Odebrecht and concerns over the airport contract. Last week, Kuczynski met with Fujimori - the daughter of jailed former President Alberto Fujimori - to try to smooth over differences. Some 72 percent of respondents thought the meeting between the two leaders was positive for the country.

He has reached safely in 14 of his last 24 plate appearances, but his consecutive game streak of drawing a walk ended at seven. 2B Devon Travis, on the disabled list following knee surgery, took infield before Saturday's game at Comerica Park. He was able to field some ground balls and play catch with teammates. Though he is ahead of schedule following the mid-June surgery, Travis is still weeks away from being ready to return to game action.  I was surprised to see him out there,  Gibbons said. DH Kendrys Morales had one of Toronto's two hits in Saturday's loss to the Detroit, a second-inning single, and has hit safely in seven of the last nine games. Nine of his 16 home runs this season have either tied the game or given the Blue Jays the lead and Morales leads the majors with six homers in close or late situations. RHP Francisco Liriano left Saturday's game in the third inning with neck tightness. Liriano walked the bases loaded to open the inning and was behind J.D.

LHP Chris Sale tied a season high with 13 strikeouts and pitched 7 2/3 scoreless innings in Saturday's no-decision vs. the Yankees. Sale (11-4, 2.59 ERA) allowed just three hits and walked two before being relieved by closer Craig Kimbrel in the eighth. Sale became the first Red Sox pitcher since Pedro Martinez in 2003 with multiple 10-plus strikeout games against the Yankees in a single season.  I like attacking hitters. I don't giving people free stuff,  Sale said afterwards. RHP Joe Kelly was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a left hamstring strain. Kelly's injury was somewhat of a surprise as it was announced shortly before Saturday's game against the Yankees. Kelly (3-1, 1.49 ERA) last pitched July 9 vs. the host Rays, blowing a save and taking his only loss after allowing two runs on one hit, a home run, and a walk in 1 2/3 innings. RHP Brandon Workman was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket to take the place of injured RHP Joe Kelly on Saturday. Workman (0-0, 3.38 REA) was scheduled to be the 26th man for the second game of the Red Sox's doubleheader against the Yankees on Sunday before Kelly's injury.

RHP Rick Porcello looks to put a poor first half behind him when he faces the Yankees in game one of Sunday's doubleheader. Porcello (4-11, 4.75 ERA) tossed eight one-run innings in a hard-luck loss vs. the Rays in his last start before the All-Star break on July 8, giving up six hits and no walks with seven strikeouts. Porcello is 7-7 with a 3.47 ERA in 16 career starts vs. the Yankees. Jacoby Ellsbury has hit him well, going 12-for-34 (.353) with four solo homers lifetime opposite Porcello.

Schugel shut down St. Louis in order in the eighth and ninth innings, striking out two. It was his second appearance since he was called up from Triple-A Indianapolis July 7 for the second time this season. Sunday, he won his season debut pitching in relief against the Cubs. He did not appear in a game in a callup earlier this season. RHP Jameson Taillon (5-3) gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings, with five strikeouts and no walks. He was pitching for the first time since July 4, thanks to the All-Star break and being a late scratch from his scheduled start Sunday against the Cubs in Chicago because of food poisoning. Manager Clint Hurdle thought the long layoff affected Taillon.  It's a challenge. Eleven days off. I don't think he's ever experienced anything like that.  Hurdle said.  There's a lot of good to hunt out of it. I just think there was just a little too much rust to knock off.  Taillon had not surrendered a run in his previous two starts, and St. Louis' first run, in the fourth, ended a career-high streak of 18 2/3 scoreless innings.  As a starting pitcher, you always want to go deep into games,  said Taillon.  Going five just sounds gross. Anytime a starting pitcher goes five, it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth.  Taillon did not agree with Hurdle that the layoff was to blame.  I felt pretty fresh,  he said.  I don't think being wild was a problem, which is usually what I do when I'm rusty.  RF Gregory Polanco was 1-for-4 with a double and has a hit in all 10 of his starts this month (16-for-39). In the outfield, he made a sharp play. In the fourth, after St. Louis had taken a 1-0 lead on Jedd Gyorko's RBI single, Polanco doubled Gyorko off first on Yadier Molina's line drive to end the inning. C Francisco Cervelli was 2-for-4 with a double, the only Pittsburgh player with multiple hits.

Blackmon flew out in the first, popped out in the third and grounded out in the sixth before tripling in the seventh, He is batting .390 during the streak to lift his overall batting average from .311 to .320. It is the third hitting streak of at least 10 games this season for Blackmon, who tied a career-high with a 14-game hitting streak from April 14-29 and had a 10-game streak from June 2-12. Overall this season, Blackmon has 20 home runs, 62 RBIs and a major league-leading 11 triples. 3B Nolan Arenado returned to the lineup Saturday night, when he went 2-for-4 with a run scored in the Rockies' 8-3 loss to the Mets. Arenado left in the fifth inning Friday, when he slipped and fell on his hip while rounding first base in the first inning. Manager Bud Black termed the early exit precautionary and said Saturday that Arenado felt fine. Arenado is batting .304 with 17 home runs and a team-high 70 RBIs in 91 games this season. LF David Dahl (stress reaction in rib cage) played in his fourth rehab game Saturday night, when he went 2-for-6 with an RBI for Triple-A Albuquerque. It was the second game Dahl has played for Albuquerque after he opened his rehab assignment with two games at Class-A Lancaster. Dahl, who has been out all season with an injury suffered in February, is 3-for-10 with two RBIs for Albuquerque and is batting .261 with one home run and five RBIs in the four rehab games overall. He will likely need several more games before the Rockies consider activating him. Dahl batted .315 with seven homers and 24 RBIs in 63 games as a rookie last season. RHP Jeff Hoffman will look to author a successful homecoming Sunday afternoon when he takes the mound for the Rockies in the finale of a three-game series against the New York Mets at Citi Field. Hoffman grew up in Latham, N.Y., located less than three hours north of Citi Field. This will be his first start in the state of New York. Hoffman didn't factor into the decision in his most recent start July 8, when he allowed four runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out two over seven innings as the Rockies fell to the Chicago White Sox, 5-4. He has pitched into the seventh inning in three straight starts and six times in nine starts overall this season. Hoffman has never faced the Mets. 1B/LF Ian Desmond (strained right calf) worked out during batting practice Saturday and could return to the Rockies' active roster Sunday. Manager Bud Black initially hoped Desmond could return Saturday but said the rainy conditions at Citi Field on Friday afternoon made it impossible to put Desmond through a full workout. Desmond has been on the disabled list since July 3. He is batting .283 with five home runs, 26 RBIs and 10 stolen bases in 57 games this season. RHP Tyler Chatwood (calf strain) recorded just one out in his start Saturday night, when he exited because of injury and was eventually saddled with the loss as the Rockies fell to the Mets 8-3. Chatwood, who said he hurt the calf during his warmup in the bullpen, was charged with four runs on one hit and three walks while striking out none. He opened the game by issuing consecutive walks -- on just nine pitches -- to CF Michael Conforto and 2B Asdrubal Cabrera before retiring LF Yoenis Cespedes on a flyout. But RF Jay Bruce followed with a three-run homer, after which Chatwood walked 3B T.J. Rivera on four pitches. Rockies manager Bud Black and a trainer visited Chatwood at the mound and Chatwood exited after tossing a handful of warmup pitches. Chatwood said the injury made it hard to finish his pitches and left him throwing with mostly his arm. While Chatwood said he would like to make his next start, Black was more cautious and noted calf injuries can linger. Chatwood is 6-11 with a 4.74 ERA in 19 starts this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7G70LPK1"}

Castro had not played since June 27, missing 13 games with a strained right hamstring. SS Didi Gregorius ripped a go-ahead RBI single to highlight a three-run ninth in Saturday's 16-inning win vs. the Red Sox. Chase Headley's bloop single to center field put runners on first and third to set up Gregorius' big hit to center.  It's a good feeling,  manager Joe Girardi said of watching Gregorius' timely hit. Gregorius, who entered as a pinch hitter in the ninth, finished 1-for-4 with an RBI and a strikeout. RHP Masahiro Tanaka starts the nightcap of Sunday's doubleheader against the Red Sox.

Holliday, who was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts before his big hit, crushed a 1-1 pitch from Kimbrel approximately 443 feet over the Green Monster in left field.  Just trying to stay on the fastball and put a good swing on the fastball and caught it luckily,  Holliday said. He finished 1-for-6 with a walk and two strikeouts in his second game back from the disabled list. LHP CC Sabathia gets the nod in the game one of the doubleheader Sunday.

The five runs were three less than Matz allowed in his first five starts of the season combined, while the Cardinals' first-inning run snapped his streak of 17 straight scoreless innings stretching back to June 22. It was just the third time in 34 career starts Matz has failed to pitch at least five innings.

Reyes, who ranks second among active players in steals, swiped stole third base in the third inning. With his next steal, he will become the 39th player in history to collect 500 thefts. The steal highlighted an impressive night for Reyes, who finished 2-for-4 with a solo homer. Reyes is batting .404 with three home runs and seven RBIs in his last 13 games to raise his overall average from .191 to .225. Reyes has nine home runs, 31 RBIs and a team-high 11 stolen bases in 85 games.

A 20-year veteran, Colon owns a 235-170 record with a 4.02 ERA and 2,407 strikeouts over 522 career outings (513 starts). 1B Joe Mauer was activated from the 10-day disabled list by the Minnesota Twins on Saturday. Mauer, who had been sidelined since July 7 with a strained lower back, was expected to bat third in the lineup against the Houston Astros on Saturday. The 34-year-old is batting .286 with five homers and 34 RBIs in 75 games this season. 1B Joe Mauer was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and finished 1-for-5 with three strikeouts. Mauer missed six games with a lower back strain. Mauer filled the roster spot vacated by CF Byron Buxton going on the DL. RHP Ervin Santana limited the Astros to two runs over six innings and posted his 11th win, which is tied for second in the American League. It marked his AL-leading 13th start this season of six innings pitched with two or fewer runs allowed, and Santana improved to 4-0 with a 2.16 ERA in six career starts against the Astros.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7G70LPJG"}

I always knew I wanted the Thirteenth Doctor to be a woman and we're thrilled to have secured our number one choice. Her audition for The Doctor simply blew us all away.

Germany has refused to extradite asylum seekers Turkey says were involved in a coup attempt last year, Berlin is demanding the release of a Turkish-German journalist, and Ankara has refused to let German lawmakers visit soldiers at two air bases. German soldiers contribute to a NATO air surveillance mission at Konya, 250 km (150 miles) south of the Turkish capital Ankara, and its troops stationed at another air base, in Incirlik, have already been moved to Jordan.  NATO said Jens Stoltenberg had called Sigmar Gabriel and Mevlut Cavusoglu on Friday to ask them to settle the dispute.  We hope that Germany and Turkey are able to find a mutually acceptable date for a visit,  a NATO spokesman said.  Germany's armed forces are under parliamentary control and Berlin says the lawmakers must have access to its soldiers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted in a television interview on Sunday that German lawmakers should be allowed to visit the Bundeswehr soldiers at the NATO air base in Konya.  This whole issue is unfortunate, very unfortunate,  Merkel told public broadcaster ARD, adding that more talks were needed to find a solution, also with the help of NATO. On whether Ankara had asked Berlin to extradite asylum seekers in exchange for granting lawmakers access to the air base, Merkel said she was not aware of any such a request.  If this was the case..., we would reject this entirely,  Merkel said. There could be no negotiations with Ankara about the extradition of Turkish asylum seekers and granting German lawmakers access to the soldiers at Konya air base because both issues were completely unrelated, she added.

India's ministry of defense Lieutenant Colonel Rajesh Kalia said he had no knowledge of the incident. India and Pakistan have been in confrontation for decades across the LoC. The old ceasefire line runs through a region that both countries claim in full but rule in part.  Growing exchanges of fire in past months have frayed a 2003 truce.  Indian troops targeted an army vehicle moving along LoC  ... The vehicle fell into the river and four soldiers have drowned,  Pakistan's military said in a statement.   One body has been recovered from the Neelum River and a search is underway for the remaining three, the military said.  In November a civilian bus was hit by Indian firing in the same region, killing 12 people. Pakistan's military said it had responded to the ceasefire violation by firing at Indian soldiers. In May India accused Pakistani forces of killing two soldiers patrolling the LoC and mutilating their bodies. Pakistan's military denied the allegations and said it had not committed ceasefire violations. Both sides have previously accused each of violating the ceasefire and of beheading soldiers in the past. India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist militants and encouraging them to attack Indian forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir and, occasionally, in other parts of India.

The Senate, which is delaying its consideration of the bill while Arizona Republican Senator John McCain recuperates from surgery to remove a blood clot, will take it up as soon as all senators are available, Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican senator, said. McCain's absence cast doubt on whether the Senate would be able to pass legislation to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. Collins is one of two Republican senators who have already said that they would not even vote to open debate on the latest version of the bill released on Thursday, meaning one more defection from the Republican ranks could kill it.. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin. With the Democrats solidly opposed to the legislation, the Republicans can only pass the bill if all their other members back it and if Republican Vice President casts his tie-breaking vote in favor. While Collins said that she did not know if the legislation would ultimately pass, she said as many as 10 Republicans have doubts about it.  There are about eight to 10 Republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill,  Collins told CNN's  State of the Union  program, faulting the bill for its major cuts to the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor.  I don't know whether it will pass, but I do know this, we should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that's been on the books for 50 years - the Medicaid program - without having a single hearing to evaluate what the consequences are going to be,  she added. The bill unwinds Obamacare's Medicaid expansion over three years, from 2021 to 2024. But it goes beyond repealing Obamacare by imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid that deepen in 2025. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cut Medicaid by nearly $800 billion by 2026, and would cut Medicaid 35 percent come 2036. McCain, who plans to stay in Arizona this week after a procedure to remove a 2-inch (5-cm) blood clot from above his left eye, has expressed concern about the healthcare bill but has not said how he would vote.  We need Senator McCain in more ways than one. As soon as we have a full contingent of senators we will have that vote,  Cornyn, of Texas, told NBC's  Meet the Press  program.

Ramachandran said. BPCL is the second Indian refiner to buy U.S. Gulf crude after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington last month when President Donald Trump said the United States looked forward to exporting more energy products to the world's third-biggest oil buyer. BPCL has bought a cargo containing 500,000 barrels each of Mars and Poseidon for delivery from Sept. 26 to Oct. 10.  Ramachandran said the landed price of the American oil cargo would be  reasonably competitive  to the delivered price of the high sulfur oil from the Middle East. Earlier this month Indian Oil Corp, the nation's top refiner, bought 1.6 million barrels of Mars. A trade source said BPCL has bought the cargo from Shell. Refiners in India, the world's third biggest oil consumer, are diversifying crude imports as cheaper alternatives have emerged due to a global supply glut despite OPEC and some non-OPEC producers cutting output to jack up prices. Share of Middle Eastern crude in India's imports shrank in June to the smallest since October 2015, while that from south America, Africa and Central Asia including Russia rose. Current market dynamics are also helping India's plan to deepen energy ties with the United States. West Texas Intermediate oil prices are depressed relative to Middle East benchmark Dubai because of rising U.S. shale oil production and as the OPEC cuts have reduced the amount of Middle East medium, sour crude. Global oil output in June is 1.2 million barrels per day above a year ago, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday in its latest monthly report.  We are also looking at buying low sulfur oil from America if priced competitively. Our refineries need both low sulfur and high sulfur oil,  he said, adding the latest purchase was a trial cargo. BPCL aims to operate its Kochi refinery in Southern India at expanded capacity of 310,000 barrels per day (bpd) from September, he added. India is the latest Asian country to buy U.S. crude after South Korea, Japan, China, Thailand, Australia and Taiwan after the OPEC cuts drove up prices of Middle East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulfur content.

Requests to qualify for the 400 megawatt (MW) wind project in the north of the kingdom will close on Aug. 10, and proposals will be received from Aug. 29. Bidding closes in January next year, the ministry's Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO) said. The ministry had earlier said the Sakaka 300 MW solar PV plant and a 400 MW wind project in Midyan were part of the first round of projects.  However, Dumat al-Jandal replaced Midyan as pre-development work is still being carried out there, Turki al-Shehri, head of the REPDO told Reuters in an interview.  What is coming out today, Dumat al-Jandal is basically the replacement of Midyan. Pre-developed work needs to be done on that side, hopefully it (Midyan) will come out soon,  Shehri said. He added that other companies can take part in the bidding since all the pre-qualified bidders for Midyan will be now automatically qualified for the replacing plant. In April, Saudi Arabia kicked off the massive renewable program in Riyadh by announcing the beginning of the bidding process for the Sakaka project, which is expected to come online by 2018-2019. Shehri said the Sakaka project is estimated to cost around $300 million. Winning bidders will build, own and operate the power plants in partnership with the government; the Dumat al-Jandal project will be backed by a 20-year power purchase agreement and Sakaka, by a 25-year agreement.  Shehri said Dumat al-Jandal cost could be $500 million to $700 million adding that estimates he gave for both plants were the developer's cost, which would depend on how good they were in getting low financing and providing the best technology. Developing renewable energy is key to displace high value oil it would rather export. It will also help the kingdom boost local manufacturing and create jobs. Saudi Arabia aims to generate 9.5 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from renewable energy annually by 2023 involving 60 projects. The renewables initiative involves investment estimated between $30 billion and $50 billion. Shehri said he expects solar projects to be dominant in the near future. The ministry has said the first round will be to generate 700 MW of renewable energy followed by 1.02 GW in the second round which will be split into 620 MW solar and 400 MW wind whose bidding could happen between the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of 2018. The 620 MW Shehri said will not be one site. It could be broken down into 2-3 projects. Outstanding Feedback The ministry has been receiving  outstanding feedback  from companies, Shehri said declining to give the number of companies which had expressed interest in Sakaka to keep the process competitive. He played down any concerns over financing.  The interest is there, we are very confident of developers finding funds and low finance opportunities we see that part of the equation is actually the easy part, the rest is just ensuring we get the projects out there.  Asked about the incentives the Saudi government is offering to developers to invest, Shehri said:  So the biggest incentive we are giving is the land is for free,  in addition to pre-development work including studies.

Pakistan has long denied Islamic State has a foothold inside the nuclear-armed nation despite a series of attacks claimed by the group over the past two years, including a bombing in the northern town of Parachinar last month that killed 75. Military spokesman Lieutenant General Asif Ghafoor said Islamic State - also known as Daesh - was growing in strength inside Afghanistan, prompting Pakistan to launch an operation in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  This operation was necessary because Daesh is getting established there and we have to stop the influence of Daesh spreading into Pakistani territory through the Rajgal valley,  Ghafoor said, referring to a valley surrounded by mountains reaching up to 14,000 feet. He said that the  Khyber 4  operation, which would include the Pakistan air force, would focus on the border areas inside the Khyber Agency area, which is part of FATA. Ghafoor said across the Khyber border there are safe havens for multiple  terrorist  organizations that are linked to recent attacks in Pakistan, including the Parachinar assault.  Northwestern Pakistan's ethnic Pashtun lands are awash with weapons and the area remains the most volatile region in the country despite the military's success in driving out many al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban militants. Fighting had subsided in FATA in recent years and many internally displaced people have been sent back to villages reduced to rubble due to military operations against the Islamists over the past 15 years.  Once this operation is completed, we will first secure the international border on our side and eliminate the hideouts of various terrorist groups,  Ghafoor added.  Islamic State has had more success in neighboring Afghanistan, where it controls small chunks of land, but has also faced tough resistance from the U.S.-backed government in Kabul and local Afghan Taliban militants. Pakistan is seeking support from Afghanistan to control the border but Ghafoor made it clear that it will not allow  foreign boots on the ground  in its territory.  Pakistan's military began building a fence along the 2,611 kilometer border with Afghanistan in May as part of its security program.

On Friday, three Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli policemen on the outskirts of the holy site, holy to Muslims and Jews, and were then killed by security forces. It was one of the most serious attacks in the area in years.  Israeli authorities then closed the compound, citing security concerns, hours before Muslim Friday prayers. That move prompted anger among Muslim worshippers and was condemned by Palestinian religious and political leaders, Jordan and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Two of the nine gates to the site, known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount, were back in operation in what Israel described as a gradual reopening. Leaders of the Muslim religious trust that runs the site urged worshippers not to pass through the metal detectors, describing them as a violation of a delicate status quo with Israel and held a prayer service next to the devices. Palestinians pray as Israeli police officers look on by newly installed metal detectors at an entrance to the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City July 16, 2017.Ammar AwadSeveral Palestinians ignored the call, while at the second entrance more people headed into the compound, Reuters photographers said. Police said 200 people had entered some 90 minutes after the reopening. Flashpoint Slideshow (9 Images)The area, in the eastern part of Jerusalem captured by Israel in a 1967 Middle East war, houses the Aqsa Mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock. It is adjacent to the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray. The site has proved a tinder-box in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the past. Under the status quo agreement, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged late on Saturday to continue to uphold, Jews are allowed to enter the compound under close supervision, but only Muslims are permitted to worship there. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital, a claim that has not won international recognition. In a move promoted by an ultranationalist political party, an Israeli cabinet forum on Sunday approved a bill that would require any territorial handovers in East Jerusalem to be ratified by at least 80 of parliament's 120 members. Legal analysts noted, however, that if the law is adopted by parliament - where it now goes for a series of votes - it can be overturned in the future by a majority of 61 legislators.

Yeliz Koray, editor of the Kocaeli Koz newspaper in the northwestern province of Izmit, was detained at her home late on Saturday, the newspaper said.  Certain groups were bothered by the piece and made Koray a target. They wanted to lynch Koray for her writing, which is part of the right of freedom of expression,  the newspaper said on its website on Sunday. In a column entitled  I'll Eat Your Epic , Koray criticised the government for what she said was an overemphasis on the events of July 15 last year, saying it paled in significance next to World War I and major battles in Turkish history. She said the government had not done enough to expose what happened on the night, when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and planes in an attempt to topple Erdogan. Some 250 people were killed, many of them unarmed civilians. No one was immediately available for comment at the paper or at the local prosecutor's office. Hundreds of thousands of Turks rallied to mark the anniversary of last year's failed coup in an outpouring of mass support for President Tayyip Erdogan that lay bare the divisions of a society riven by widespread purges. In the aftermath of the putsch, some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 were detained for alleged links to the putsch, including local members of rights groups such as Amnesty International. The purge, which has led to the detention of many journalists and caused the closure of some 130 media outlets, has alarmed Turkey's Western allies and rights groups, who say Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists calls Turkey the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with some 160 detained. The government says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it faces.

At the opening ceremony of a memorial dedicated to the roughly 250 people who died in last year's failed coup, Erdogan accused Brussels of  messing about  with Turkey's decades-long bid to join the bloc. The speech in the early hours of Sunday wound up a marathon session of public appearances by Erdogan in both the capital and Istanbul overnight to mark the anniversary of last year's defeated coup.  The stance of the European Union is clear to see ... 54 years have passed and they are still messing us about,  he said, citing what he said was Brussels' failure to keep promises on everything from a visa deal to aid for Syrian migrants.  We will sort things out for ourselves. There's no other option.  Ties with the West were strained when European governments voiced alarm at the scale of the crackdown that followed the coup. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and more than 50,000 detained on suspicion of links with the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for the attempted putsch. Erdogan also said he would approve,  without hesitation  the death penalty, if parliament voted to restore it -- a move that would effectively end Turkey's bid to join the EU.  I don't look at what Hans and George say. I look at what Ahmet, Mehmet, Hasan, Huseyin, Ayse, Fatma and Hatice say,  he said, to cheers from a flag-waving crowd.

The coup's defeat has likely ended decades of military interference in Turkish politics. But the purges have sharpened the divide between Erdogan's supporters and Western-facing Turks who want closer ties with Europe.   'Slam the Door' Critics say Erdogan is using a state of emergency introduced after the coup to target opposition figures including rights activists, politicians and journalists.

Leftist, pro-Kurdish and opposition media outlets have also been shut. Authorities on Saturday detained the editor of a local newspaper over a column criticizing the aftermath of the failed coup, her newspaper said. In the run-up to the anniversary, Turkish media has been saturated by coverage from the coup attempt, with some channels showing almost constant footage from last year of young men and headscarved mothers facing down armed soldiers and tanks. Slideshow (18 Images)On Saturday, mobile phone networks played a 13-second pre-recorded message from Erdogan before connecting calls. In the message he honored the  martyrs  who died during the coup attempt and those  veterans  who took to the streets. 'Rip the Heads Off' European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU remained committed to dialogue with Turkey and called on Ankara to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. He also warned against reinstating the death penalty.  One year after the attempted coup, Europe's hand remains outstretched,  Juncker wrote in Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper.  If Turkey were to introduce the death penalty, the Turkish government would finally slam the door to EU membership.  Addressing a crowd of hundreds of thousands in Istanbul on Saturday evening, Erdogan threatened to wreak violent retribution on Turkey's enemies, including FETO - his term for Gulen's network - and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).  We know who is behind FETO, the PKK and all of them,  he said.  We cannot defeat the queen, king, or sheikhs without defeating the pawns, knights and castles. Firstly, we will rip the heads off of these traitors.

It is our job to say: 'Beware, the party does not have to last forever,  he said in an interview to be published on Monday at the Tyden weekly magazine. The central bank has been pushing for a bill giving it more powers regarding mortgages as it has said repeatedly that property prices seem to be overvalued and it has recommended banks adjust their lending policies accordingly.  We are afraid that currently, when the economy is riding on the wave of optimistic expectations, the party might get out of hand,  Hampl said in the interview.  It is not about extinguishing a fire, because there is none, but about a mere prevention,  he said. The government launched a bill in January that would allow the central bank to cap loans according to debt-to-income (DTI), debt servicing-to-income (DSTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. However, lawmakers eyeing an October election have not approved the bill in the lower house before its summer recess, making it all but certain that it will fall through and only the new house may pick it up. Since April the bank has recommended that mortgages should not exceed 90 percent of property values (LTV) and that no more than 15 percent of customers should be given loans worth more than 80 percent of a property's value.  The further our recommendations go, the less and the later they are respected,  Hampl said.

One has asked a cousin volunteering at a poll station to let him jump the queue. And another plans to dress up as a woman to vote. Venezuela's state workers are cooking up creative ways to participate in Sunday's opposition plebiscite without being spotted by colleagues or Socialist Party members, which could compromise their jobs in Venezuela's vengeful political climate. (Graphic: here) The opposition is holding an unofficial vote to let Venezuelans have their say about unpopular President Nicolas Maduro's plan to elect a new legislative body with powers to rewrite the constitution and supersede other institutions.  They say Maduro is seeking to consolidate a dictatorship in the oil-rich nation and must be stopped before critical food and medicine shortages worsen. Maduro, however, says his July 30 vote for the controversial constituent assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela after three months of violent anti-government protests.  He has ordered that the country's roughly 2.8 million state employees, a sizeable part of the population of around 30 million, vote for the constituent assembly. Many state workers remain fierce supporters of his  21st century socialism,  but others have turned on the government due to salaries that have plummeted to a few dozen U.S. dollars a month, corruption scandals and inefficiencies in state-owned companies. Some workers stay on because of health insurance, subsidized food or lack of other opportunities in a country submerged in a fourth straight year of recession. But about 20 workers interviewed by Reuters said discontent was growing, and many were planning to vote on Sunday.  I supported the 'revolution,' but it's over now, and what Maduro's people are doing doesn't work at all,  said a worker at state oil company PDVSA.  So I'm going to be active this Sunday. I'm even offering my car to shuttle people around. Only people close to me, of course, because I don't want to be seen.  Their fear has historical roots.  In 2004, during the campaign for a referendum against late President Hugo Chavez, government lawmaker Luis Tascon published a list of more than 2.4 million Venezuelans who signed in favor of a referendum. Many lost jobs and were marginalized from state services and the  Tascon List  became notorious. Venezuela's Information Ministry and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] did not respond to a request for comment. Generating Trust The opposition, hoping to attract big numbers at the polls, has tried to make it easier for Venezuelans to vote in secret. Voters can cast their ballot from any polling station, and voting papers will be destroyed.  We have to generate total trust so that dissident 'Chavistas' vote,  said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado, expressing optimism that they would.  The 1999 constitution (created under Chavez) unites 'Chavismo' as much as it does the opposition.  Some angry state workers are organizing themselves via secret groups on the Telegram messaging app, convincing reluctant family members to vote or feigning shopping trips and holidays to cast their ballots away from prying eyes. Still, some efforts may be thwarted by the government's decision to hold a practice of the July 30 constituent assembly vote on Sunday. Most of the workers interviewed said they were being required to attend the simulation - with one employee of aluminum smelter Venalum adding bosses were even offering overtime pay. In the once thriving industrial heartland of Puerto Ordaz, where steel output has almost ground to a halt nine years after steelmaker Sidor was taken over by the government, union leaders expect a strong turnout for the opposition all the same.  Out of 10 workers, nine support this plebiscite,  said union leader Leonel Grisett, who said he was fired a few weeks ago for coming out against Maduro's plans to overhaul the constitution. Still, many state workers are nervous about losing their source of income, however meager, in a country where many cannot afford to eat three times a day and falling ill can turn into a death sentence due to lack of medicines and deteriorating hospitals.  I'm 100 percent with the opposition, but voting on Sunday exposes me too much. I swear they're going to get their hands on those ID numbers. It's an unnecessary risk, especially because I'm not voting in the constituent assembly,  said another PDVSA worker.

The future of Gibraltar, a rocky enclave on the southern tip of Spain captured by Britain in 1704, and its 30,000 inhabitants is set to be a major point of contention in Brexit negotiations. The EU annoyed Britain and Gibraltar in April by offering Spain a right of veto over the territory's post-Brexit relationship with the bloc.  Gibraltar, which Spain wants back, voted strongly in favor of remaining in the EU at last year's referendum but is committed to staying part of Britain. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo told Sky News he had had  cast iron assurances  from Britain's Brexit minister David Davis that the government would not do a trade deal with the EU if it did not include Gibraltar.  I'm the backbone of this negotiation for Gibraltar and the backbone is made of limestone rock, it's not going to be easy to buckle on that. We can have the War of the Summer, the War of the Autumn or the War of the Winter, if you like, on that, Gibraltar is not going to change its position,  he said.  It's our obligation now to energetically and enthusiastically pursue the result of the referendum and deliver a successful Brexit. We're not going to get in the way of Brexit but we're not going to be the victims of Brexit.  During a state visit to Britain this week, Spain's King Felipe said he was confident an acceptable arrangement could be worked out with Britain over the future of Gibraltar, but Prime Minister Theresa May's spokeswoman said the topic had not come up during their bilateral meeting.  There is not going to be any new arrangements in relation to the sovereignty of Gibraltar, that is going to remain 100 percent British,  Picardo said.

The refinancing, coordinated by Doha-based investment bank QInvest, was marketed earlier this year to both Qatari and regional banks, including institutions in the United Arab Emirates. It was to have been larger in size than the original loan - perhaps around $1.2 billion, bankers said. But Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, and the proposed deal has been put on hold, the sources said. Two Qatari bankers involved in the deal told Reuters that the diplomatic crisis was the main reason for the deal being postponed, as it had reduced banks' appetite for the transaction. The sanctions against Qatar meant non-Qatari banks would not participate, a senior banker in Doha said.  Originally, the refinancing included some of the original lenders plus big banks from the UAE.

In a second estimate last month, the Central Bureau of Statistics had said gross domestic product ILGDP=ECI grew 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, down from a preliminary 1.4 percent rise -- well below a Reuters forecast of 3.7 percent. It was the slowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2015. On a per capita basis, GDP in the quarter fell an annualized 0.5 percent. Fourth-quarter growth was revised to an annualized 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent, the bureau said on Sunday. Growth in the final three months of 2016 had been boosted by one-off factors including a spike in sales of vehicles that occurred before the tax hike -- which ties the tax payable at purchase to the car's carbon emissions -- at the start of 2017. This also negatively impacted the first three months of 2017. Analysts said given the distortions, a more accurate figure was GDP excluding net taxes on import -- which eliminates much of the one-time auto effect. It rose an annualized 3.3 percent in the first quarter, revised up from a previous 3.1 percent. Citing expectations that exports look to improve as global trade strengthens, the Bank of Israel last week raised its economic growth estimate for 2017 to 3.4 percent from a previous 2.8 percent and left its 2018 forecast unchanged at 3.3 percent. Growth was 4 percent in 2016. In the first quarter, exports - which comprise more than 30 percent of Israeli economic activity - grew 8.7 percent compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the prior estimate. Private spending dipped 1.1 percent versus a 1.7 percent drop, while investment in fixed assets fell by 3.4 percent. Imports shed 9.3 percent and government spending was up 2.6 percent.   The data comes after the bureau said that Israel's annual inflation rate fell 0.2 percent in June from a 0.8 percent rise in May.

After yet another historical night Saturday, Bellinger and the Dodgers will attempt to win their ninth straight game one day later when they wrap up a three-game set in Miami against the Marlins. Bellinger, who turned 22 two days after becoming the youngest All-Star position player in team history, continued his dream season in Saturday's 7-1 win when he joined Wes Parker (1970) and Orlando Hudson (2009) as the only Dodgers to hit for the cycle since the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958. The cycle - the first by a rookie in club history - powered the Dodgers (63-29) to their 28th win in 32 games and enabled the team with the best record in the majors to improve to 54-18 since his promotion on April 25. After taking six of seven a season ago from Los Angeles, the Marlins have dropped five of the first six meetings this season despite entering the All-Star break having won five of six overall. Amid trade rumors, Miami outfielder Christian Yelich is on a tear with five multi-hit efforts over his last six games - a stretch during which he is batting .444 after going 3-for-4 on Saturday.

The Boston native settled for a no-decision July 6 against Arizona despite giving up only a solo homer among the two hits he allowed while fanning nine, increasing his strikeout total to 27 over his torrid stretch. Hill was sensational in his only career appearance at Marlins Park last September, striking out nine over seven no-hit innings in a win. O'Grady, who will start in place of the injured Edinson Volquez, enjoyed a successful big-league debut in San Francisco on July 8, picking up the victory after yielding three runs across 5 1/3 innings. The 27-year-old George Mason product earned his promotion earlier this month after going 3-5 with a 3.29 ERA in 12 appearances (nine starts) at Triple-A New Orleans while allowing hitters to bat .219 against him. O'Grady gave up a total of five earned runs over his final 30 innings with the Zephyrs. Walk-Offs 1. Bellinger, who is tied for the National League lead with 26 homers, became the sixth-youngest player to hit for the cycle since at least 1920. 2. After batting .332 and clubbing 14 home runs over their last eight contests heading into the Midsummer Classic, the Marlins are hitting .239 with no homers through two games in this series. 3. The Dodgers have won 28 of 32 only one other time in their franchise history, going 32-4-1 during a 37-game stretch in 1899 when they were known as the Brooklyn Superbas.

Now we have a legitimate chance to do that.” The Angels were hoping Trout would provide an immediate boost to their inconsistent offense, but they’ve scored a total of four runs in their last two contests while dropping four games under .500.

He has not surrendered more than three runs in any start this season. Godley made one start against Atlanta in 2016, giving up seven runs in five innings of a no-decision.

The 25-year-old Dominican has allowed five runs and seven hits in five innings in each of his last two starts, taking the loss in both. Martinez is 4-5 with a 3.59 ERA in 18 games (nine starts) against the Pirates. Williams hasn’t won since June 4, a span of six starts in which he has received only one decision. The 25-year-old had recorded three straight quality starts before an early hook July 7 against the Chicago Cubs, as he allowed three runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings and suffered his first loss since May 19.

New York will attempt to complete its first three-game home sweep of the season Sunday when it looks to finish off the struggling Colorado Rockies. The Mets came out of the All-Star break trailing the Rockies by 10 1/2 games for the second wild-card spot in the National League, but New York has been the far superior team this weekend - outscoring Colorado 23-5 through two games. T.J.

Hoffman has been sensational away from Coors Field entering his first career start against the Mets, posting a 3-0 record and 1.67 ERA in four outings (2-1, 6.44 in six home appearances). Matz entered his final start prior to the All-Star break riding 17-inning scoreless streak before getting pummeled for a season-high five runs on seven hits - including two homers - over a season-low 4 1/3 innings at St. Louis last Sunday. The 26-year-old has only pitched at Citi Field once this season, taking the loss against Washington after yielding four runs across seven frames. Matz was saddled with the loss in his only previous start against the Rockies last July after he allowed two runs over six innings. Walk-Offs 1.

Muguruza beat five-times champion Venus Williams in straight sets on Saturday to win her second major tournament after her triumph at the French Open in 2016. The Spaniard went into Wimbledon ranked 15th in the world and her victory at the All England Club will push her up to fifth in the WTA Rankings when they are published on Monday. The 23-year-old says she cares little for the ranking number next to her name, however.  I  think unless you are number one, because that is incredible... I have been number two, I have been three and failed to win a Grand Slam and there is no comparison,  she told a small group of international reporters.  It is just having the trophy, having to have played all the matches. You have to play seven matches and you can face the one, the three, everyone.   It is a different feeling. I don’t know what it feels like to be number one; hopefully one day I can be and I can compare but for now I’d rather be 10 and win Grand Slams than be number one,  said Muguruza, who beat Williams 7-5 6-0.

Slideshow (3 Images) My motivation is just to be able to be a good tennis player and come to the Grand Slams and be a threat. The ranking is temporary but it is really to be a good player and always have a chance to win a trophy.   That is what I train for, in the gym and so on; on the days you don’t want to move, you remember, if I work hard then I might have a chance to be in a final and so then you are strong,  she said. Muruguza's form dipped after her first Grand Slam event victory and she hopes that this time she will be able to manage her expectations better, although she acknowledges that her attacking style can make consistency hard to achieve.  It is difficult to deal with success. You have all these expectations. Hopefully I can just be humble, keep working and don’t expect to perform incredible every match because it is not the case. I have a very aggressive game which means that one day I can be more up or more down. Hopefully I keep it the same way.

The hard work starts now,  European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday, again sounding a note of alarm that London has yet to provide detailed proposals on a range of key issues, with barely a year left for bargaining. A year after the referendum vote to leave, Prime Minister Theresa May still faces a complex task in finding consensus at home on what kind of Brexit Britain wants. That job was made all the harder by losing her parliamentary majority last month. Her Brexit minister, veteran anti-EU campaigner David Davis, will meet Barnier, a French former cabinet minister, at the European Commission's Berlaymont headquarters at 9:15 a.m. (0715 GMT) on Monday for a brief public handshake before formal business begins. Their teams will spend most of the next four days in smaller working groups, trying to identify areas of accord and discord on a set of issues agreed on during an initial day of talks on June 19. On Thursday afternoon, Davis and Barnier should hold a news conference, to fix publicly what has been agreed so far.  The priorities, notably rights for expatriate citizens, how much Britain may owe to the EU budget and how to manage the new EU-UK border, especially with Ireland, are ones both sides want to settle in a withdrawal treaty. Barnier says this must be ready by about October next year if it is to be ratified on both sides of the Channel before Britain leaves in March 2019.  The clock is ticking,  he said on Wednesday, displaying a degree of impatience with British ministers who continue to dismiss EU demands that they first must agree in principle that London will owe the Union a hefty amount -- probably in the tens of billions of euros -- to cover its existing commitments.  The first serious test of the negotiations will be them agreeing to pay the bill,  a senior EU official said -- the coming week is a vital moment to establish rapport among the senior civil servants who will handle what is arguably the most convoluted and far-reaching diplomatic deal of modern times. Progress Required Without  significant progress  on all three priorities in the divorce, Barnier warns, EU leaders will not let Davis open talks on a free trade relationship, which May and much of British business want to have ready by the time Britain leaves. For now, the EU says May's offer to guarantee the rights of 3 million Europeans in Britain falls short. It is also unhappy at Britain's refusal to accept EU judges as ultimate arbiters of disputes -- an issue that could get an early airing as London seeks a quick fix to prevent its withdrawal from the Euratom pact disrupting its nuclear industry and medical imaging. EU leaders unanimously speak of rare harmony among them on how to deal with Britain so that Brexit does not unravel the EU further. Electoral setbacks for anti-EU parties and the arrival of the Europhile Emmanuel Macron as French president have lifted their mood. But British diplomats will try to exploit divergent interests among the 27, using Britain's hefty economic clout. A quarterly EU summit in mid-October could see leaders tell  Barnier to prepare trade negotiations; but that will require good progress this week and in three further rounds of talks. On that timetable, Barnier reckons, a broad political deal on the outlines of a new, open trading relationship could be in place by late next year, allowing for a transitional phase of up to a few years after Brexit to negotiate all the details. Brussels has assumed for the past year that Britain needs a transitional period to avoid a  cliff edge  loss of EU access.  But in a mark of the cross-Channel gulf in perceptions, many in London have questioned the need for a transition, during which Britain would have to follow EU rules and pay into the Brussels budget. On Sunday, finance minister Philip Hammond, an advocate for a transition to Brexit, said most ministers now agreed with him:  Five weeks ago the idea of a transition period was quite a new concept. I think now you would find that pretty much everybody around the cabinet table accepts that there will be some kind of transition,  he said, saying it would be at least two years.

Fayez Seraj, prime minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA), also called for a national ceasefire and the gradual merging of rival parliamentary bodies based in Tripoli and eastern Libya in a speech released late on Saturday. Seraj said he was putting forward the roadmap because of his  determination to escape the current crisis and unify Libyans .       I am confident that the national spirit will overcome the narrow personal interests, and invite everyone to offer compromise even if it's painful to do so,  he said.  Agreeing on an election plan and holding nationwide polls would be a major challenge due to Libya's political divisions, continuing insecurity and bouts of fighting, and deteriorating infrastructure.     Libya slid into conflict after the uprising that toppled long-time Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi six years ago. The country's previous elections, in 2014, led to the formation of rival governments and parliaments in Tripoli and the east, both backed by loose alliances of armed groups. The GNA is the result of a U.N.-brokered deal to stabilize and unite the country that was signed in late 2015 with only partial support from political and armed factions. It has limited authority, and has been rejected by eastern-based factions aligned with military commander Khalifa Haftar. Since arriving in Tripoli in March last year, Seraj has struggled to form a functioning government or tame powerful militias. A severe liquidity crisis, frequent power and water cuts, and failing public services have worsened living conditions for most.

Financial security is a vital part of national security, Xi said at the fifth National Financial Work Conference, adding that China will strengthen the Communist Party's leadership in the financial sector.  A Financial Stability and Development Committee will also be set up under the State Council, or cabinet, state media cited Xi as saying.   No details were given on the committee and on how the role of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will be strengthened.  Regulators oversee different parts of China's complex financial sector, and no singular regulator has a complete picture of capital movements in the system.  That complicates the job of authorities to catch market manipulators who secretly divert funds to risky financial products as they chase higher returns. Authorities also worry about  giant crocodiles , a term regulators have started using to describe law-breaking tycoons who circumvent regulations to grab control of other companies.  Earlier this year, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) banned the chairman of Foresea Life from the insurance business for 10 years, citing violations of rules in the firm's use of insurance funds. CIRC separately also restricted Evergrande Life's (3333.HK) stock trading activities for one year, after accusing the insurance firm of engaging in irregular investment activities. Xi also said China will push forward with deleveraging in its economy, and that lowering debt ratios among state-owned enterprises is the most pressing issue.  Beijing will also strictly control new local government debt and strengthen oversight of internet financing, he said. Blood and Pulse Finance is the  blood and pulse  of the economy, and it is the sector's  divine vocation  to serve the real economy, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Xi as saying.  Xi called for greater accountability for financial regulators at the meeting, saying it would be  negligence of duty  if regulators fail to identify risks in time, and it would be  malfeasance  if they fail to report and contain the identified risks. The main financial regulators include the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and CIRC. In 2015, a poorly coordinated response to a stock market crash in China spurred scrutiny on the government's response. Premier Li Keqiang openly criticized financial regulators as not responding sufficiently.  Xi said on Saturday that regulators must share industry data within their jurisdictions and coordinate their financial regulations. The financial work conference comes ahead of a once-in-five-year congress of the Communist Party in the autumn, where Xi is expected to further consolidate his hold on power.  Traditionally the (financial) conference is presided by the premier, but this time, not only was the big boss (Xi) there, people from the anti-corruption watchdog and the parliament advisory body were there too,  said a person who follows Chinese regulatory developments. At the conference, Premier Li said China will maintain prudent monetary policy and an appropriate credit growth rate while keeping liquidity basically stable.      China's plans to ameliorate systemic risk, while laudable, are also significantly driven by the desire for an unblemished 19th Party Congress,  said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.  Regulators have yet to announce detailed steps, and probably won't do so prior to the Congress,  he said.

American firms have also been given access to some parts of China's financial services sector.    More details on the 100-day plan are expected to be announced in the coming week as senior U.S. and Chinese officials gather in Washington for annual bilateral economic talks, rebranded this year as the  U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.   We hope to report further progress on the 100-day deliverables next week,  a U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said on Saturday.  That will be the basis for judging the extent of progress.  The spokesman declined to discuss potential areas for new agreements since a May 11 announcement on beef, chicken, financial services and LNG. Earlier in April, when Chinese President Xi Jinping met U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time at his Florida resort, Xi agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and trimming the U.S. trade deficit with China.  The U.S. goods trade deficit with China reached $347 billion last year. The gap in the first five months of 2017 widened about 5.3 percent from a year earlier, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.   It is an excellent momentum builder, but much more needs to be done for U.S.-China commercial negotiations to be considered a success,  said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) in Beijing. There has been little sign of progress in soothing the biggest trade irritants, such as U.S. demands that China cut excess capacity in steel and aluminum production, lack of access for U.S. firms to China's services market, and U.S. national security curbs on high-tech exports to China.  The Trump administration is considering broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum on national security grounds, partly in response to what it views as a glut of Chinese production that is flooding international markets and driving down prices. North Korea has cast a long shadow over the relationship, after Pyongyang tested what some experts have described as an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.  Trump has linked progress in trade to China's ability to rein in North Korea, which counts on Beijing as its chief friend and ally.   Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!  Trump said on Twitter after the North Korean missile test.  Trading Meat  American beef is now available in Chinese shops for the first time since a 2003 U.S. case of  mad cow  disease, giving U.S. ranchers access to a rapidly growing market worth around $2.6 billion last year. More beef deals were signed during an overseas buying mission by the Chinese last week.  There are hopes there will be even more concrete results,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing on Friday. He did not elaborate. Critics of the 100-day process said China had already agreed to lift its ban on U.S. beef last September, with officials just needing to finalize details on quarantine requirements. China, meanwhile, has delivered its first batch of cooked chicken to U.S. ports after years of negotiating for access to the market.  But unlike the rush by Chinese consumers for a first taste of American beef, Chinese poultry processors have not had a flurry of orders for cooked chicken.  Demand should improve once China is allowed to ship Chinese grown, processed and cooked chicken to the United States, said Li Wei, export manager at Qingdao Nine Alliance Group, China's top exporter of processed poultry.  Biotech Crops     Other sectors in China under U.S. pressure to open up have moved more slowly.   Beijing had only approved two of the eight biotech crops waiting for import approval, despite gathering experts to review the crops on two occasions in a six-week period.  U.S. industry officials had signalled they were expecting more approvals. U.S. executives say the review process still lacks transparency. Financial services is another area where little progress has been made, U.S. officials say. USCBC's Parker said it is unclear how long it will take for foreign credit rating agencies to be approved, or whether U.S.-owned suppliers of electronic payment services will be able to secure licenses. The bilateral talks have also not addressed restrictions on foreign investment in life insurance and securities trading, or  the many challenges foreign companies face in China's cybersecurity enforcement environment,  Parker said. In an annual report released Thursday, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said China remained a  difficult market .

American firms have also been given access to some parts of China's financial services sector.    More details on the 100-day plan are expected to be announced in the coming week as senior U.S. and Chinese officials gather in Washington for annual bilateral economic talks, rebranded this year as the  U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.   We hope to report further progress on the 100-day deliverables next week,  a U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said on Saturday.  That will be the basis for judging the extent of progress.  The spokesman declined to discuss potential areas for new agreements since a May 11 announcement on beef, chicken, financial services and LNG. Earlier in April, when Chinese President Xi Jinping met U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time at his Florida resort, Xi agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and trimming the U.S. trade deficit with China.  The U.S. goods trade deficit with China reached $347 billion last year. The gap in the first five months of 2017 widened about 5.3 percent from a year earlier, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.   It is an excellent momentum builder, but much more needs to be done for U.S.-China commercial negotiations to be considered a success,  said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) in Beijing. There has been little sign of progress in soothing the biggest trade irritants, such as U.S. demands that China cut excess capacity in steel and aluminum production, lack of access for U.S. firms to China's services market, and U.S. national security curbs on high-tech exports to China.  The Trump administration is considering broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum on national security grounds, partly in response to what it views as a glut of Chinese production that is flooding international markets and driving down prices. North Korea has cast a long shadow over the relationship, after Pyongyang tested what some experts have described as an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.  Trump has linked progress in trade to China's ability to rein in North Korea, which counts on Beijing as its chief friend and ally.   Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!  Trump said on Twitter after the North Korean missile test.  Trading Meat  American beef is now available in Chinese shops for the first time since a 2003 U.S. case of  mad cow  disease, giving U.S. ranchers access to a rapidly growing market worth around $2.6 billion last year. More beef deals were signed during an overseas buying mission by the Chinese last week.  There are hopes there will be even more concrete results,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing on Friday. He did not elaborate. Critics of the 100-day process said China had already agreed to lift its ban on U.S. beef last September, with officials just needing to finalize details on quarantine requirements. China, meanwhile, has delivered its first batch of cooked chicken to U.S. ports after years of negotiating for access to the market.  But unlike the rush by Chinese consumers for a first taste of American beef, Chinese poultry processors have not had a flurry of orders for cooked chicken.  Demand should improve once China is allowed to ship Chinese grown, processed and cooked chicken to the United States, said Li Wei, export manager at Qingdao Nine Alliance Group, China's top exporter of processed poultry.  Biotech Crops     Other sectors in China under U.S. pressure to open up have moved more slowly.   Beijing had only approved two of the eight biotech crops waiting for import approval, despite gathering experts to review the crops on two occasions in a six-week period.  U.S. industry officials had signalled they were expecting more approvals. U.S. executives say the review process still lacks transparency. Financial services is another area where little progress has been made, U.S. officials say. USCBC's Parker said it is unclear how long it will take for foreign credit rating agencies to be approved, or whether U.S.-owned suppliers of electronic payment services will be able to secure licenses. The bilateral talks have also not addressed restrictions on foreign investment in life insurance and securities trading, or  the many challenges foreign companies face in China's cybersecurity enforcement environment,  Parker said. In an annual report released Thursday, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said China remained a  difficult market .

Meet South Korea's Park Mak-rye, a sprightly 70-year-old whose Youtube channel  Grandma's Diary , has made her a social media sensation, drawing more than 277,000 subscribers. Park made her Youtube debut in January, when her grand-daughter's video travelogue of their trip to Cairns in northeast Australia went viral. It showed Park touching a kangaroo, diving on the Great Barrier Reef in a helmet that let her walk underwater, and splashing through the Cairns Esplanade Lagoon in a Santa Claus cap.  One day my granddaughter filmed me in a few videos, and she must have uploaded them,  Park told Reuters at her home in Yongin, on the outskirts of the capital, Seoul.  About 20 days later, she tells me 'Granny, we hit the jackpot!'  Park's granddaughter, who asked not to be identified, said she uploaded the video to help teach her a new skill and communicate online. Its surging popularity helped convince Park to upload more of her personal stories. Park's most popular video, titled  Going to the dentist and market makeup look , in which she dons black eyeliner and red lipstick, has drawn more than 1.8 million views. She now has 43 videos on her Youtube channel, with more than 108,000 followers on Instagram.

The 51-year-old won his 10th Asian Tour title at the Singapore Open in January to qualify for the year's third major, which will tee off at the Merseyside course on Thursday.  It is very difficult to make the cut because the course and weather is very different,  Prayad, who is playing in his first British Open since 2012, told the Asian Tour.   Every year, I will be in the last or first groups and I will be playing in the wind or rain. If I can make the cut, I will be very happy.  This will be the sixth time I will play in The Open. I feel that my game is very good and in good shape. But like I said, it will be windy, cold and raining, so it won't be easy to control the ball. It will be a very difficult week.  Prayad is also ready to tweak his club selection to allow for the wet and blustery conditions expected at the testing par-70 links course.  Maybe I'll take a two-iron with me and hit low ball flights,  added Prayad, whose best performance in a major was a tie for 15th at the 2008 PGA Championship.   My natural ball flight is high so that's my problem.    Physically, I feel good. My mental game is also strong. I enjoy playing golf so I don't feel stress,  he said.   I keep walking fast on the course and don't feel like a senior. I have a natural swing and don't use much power, so that helps a lot.  I am very happy because I can still play with the young boys. The only difference in my game 10 years ago? Maybe I putted better but overall, my game is good.

Sun Zhengcai had been party chief of the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing, until an abrupt announcement on Saturday morning that he no longer had the position and had been replaced by a rising political star close to President Xi. The announcement, carried by state news agency Xinhua, did not say Sun either had a new position or use wording to suggest he was waiting for a further appointment. A source who has been briefed on the matter said Sun is suspected of  serious discipline violations , a term that can encompass everything from taking bribes to not toeing the party line. The source added that it was a  conversation investigation , meaning it's not yet at the stage of a formal probe.  A second source with ties to the leadership told Reuters that Sun is undergoing investigation for suspected  violation of political discipline . The source declined to elaborate.  But he is still a comrade. He is still a Politburo member,  the source said, referring to the party's 25-member decision-making body. Officials are stripped of their title  comrade  once a formal legal case is filed against them and they are expelled from the party. Officials are sometimes put under investigation but not formally charged. However once a party announcement about a probe is publicly announced they are almost always punished.  The Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Calls to the Chongqing government information office also went unanswered. It was not possible to reach Sun directly for comment, and unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer. It is not clear if any limits have been put on Sun's movements.  New Party Boss Hong Kong and Taiwan media as well as the Wall Street Journal have also reported Sun is being investigated. Sun did not appear on Chongqing television's Saturday evening broadcast when new party boss, Chen Miner, was introduced to city officials by Zhao Leji, head of the powerful organization department which oversees personnel decisions. Zhao made the announcement about the probe at the Chongqing meeting, the first source added. File photo: Sun Zhengcai attends the opening session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, March 3, 2016.Jason LeeWhen Beijing's new party boss Cai Qi was unveiled in May, Zhao not only introduced Cai but Cai's predecessor Guo Jinlong was also present at the meeting and gave a speech, according to the Beijing city government's account of the event. A third source with ties to the leadership emphasised how unusual it was that Sun was not present or mentioned at all in the meeting where Chen was presented as new Chongqing leader.  The source said the Chongqing meeting was told that Sun had committed  political mistakes . The three sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to foreign media, said Sun was currently in Beijing. Bo Xilai Chongqing is perhaps best known for its association with its disgraced former party boss Bo Xilai, once himself a contender for top leadership before being jailed for life in 2013 in a dramatic corruption scandal. Sun had been seen as a potential candidate for elevation at the autumn congress and as a possible future premier, but his star has waned. Sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats say Sun has been out of favor after the party's anti-corruption watchdog in February criticized Chongqing authorities for not doing enough to root out Bo's influence. At that meeting, Sun said he accepted the watchdog's assessment  without question , according to a party statement at the time. Chongqing is one of China's most important cities. Global electronics brands including Hewlett-Packard, Foxconn, Acer and Asus all have operations in Chongqing, lured by tax breaks, cheap labor and land, plus a developed supply chain and logistics. The region makes a third of the world's laptops. Diplomatic sources say Sun had been scheduled to go on a trip to Europe recently but it had been cancelled. It is not immediately clear which countries he was due to have visited. However, another candidate for elevation, Guangdong province party boss Hu Chunhua, visited Britain, Ireland and Israel last month. Such trips are often used by senior officials to raise their international profiles ahead of promotions. Sun's last public appearance as mentioned by state media was on July 12, when he attended a Chongqing party meeting about deepening reforms.

The city, which will be developed over 50-square km of land allocated for energy-related industries, will complete its first phase that covers almost 12-square km by that date, Aramco said in a statement late on Saturday. The city will be located between Dammam and Ahsa, at the heart of energy operations, the statement said. An earlier report said the city will be close to Abqaiq, which is in the middle of Dammam and Ahsa.   Ghawar, the world's largest onshore oilfield is near al-Ahsa.  The Saudi Industrial Property Authority (Modon) which develops industrial cities in Saudi Arabia has started to lay out plans and programmes with Saudi Aramco to develop and operate the city, the statement added. The top oil exporter is trying to lower dependence on oil and build up new industries to speed up job creation for a rapidly rising young population.  It plans to list in stock markets up to 5 percent of its shares in Aramco, which will help it invest in other sectors to generate more revenue streams.

The anti-Islam Freedom Party's (FPO) popularity reached new heights during Europe's migration crisis in 2015 when it denounced the centrist government's decision to throw open Austria's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees and other migrants. It ran first in opinion polls for more than a year, with support of more than 30 percent, and its candidate came close to winning last year's presidential election. Now the party has slipped to second or third while the Social Democrats and conservative People's Party (OVP) - the two parties in government, which have dominated post-war politics - have moved towards the far right's positions.  Most of the migrants and refugees carried on to Germany in 2015 but 90,000, or more than 1 percent of Austria's population, stayed and sought asylum. The two centrist parties have since promised to make sure this never happens again.   Both government parties are something like FPO light,  political analyst Anton Pelinka said.  They are not exactly the same as the FPO but the crossover has become very fluid.  A spat with Italy on July 4 about control of their shared border has highlighted the shift.  In the past month Italy has asked other EU countries to help it cope with a surge in the number of migrants reaching its Mediterranean shores from Africa. Concerned about another influx, Austrian Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said he was preparing to take action if they headed towards Austria. In an interview with Austria's top-selling tabloid, he said he expected border controls at the Brenner Pass, a gateway for Italy to northern Europe,  very soon . The article added that 750 soldiers and four armored vehicles were available to secure the border if needed.  Italy reacted furiously, summoning Austria's ambassador to Rome before Doskozil and Chancellor Christian Kern, both Social Democrats, backed away from the comments.  But the remarks are the latest example of how Austria's two centrist parties are trying to beat the far right at its own game.   The Social Democrats and the OVP are in a kind of race to see who can take issues away from the Freedom Party,  Pelinka said.  They are hurting the Freedom Party with this. Precisely because of this, it has fallen in the polls.   Parallel Societies  The OVP and its 30-year-old leader, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, have taken the lead in opinion polls. Kurz has focused on immigration and integration since taking over as party leader in May, calling for migrants rescued in the Mediterranean to be taken to Africa rather than Europe. FILE PHOTO: Migrants walk on a road towards the crossing point between Hungary and Austria in Nickelsdorf, September 12, 2015.Leonhard Foeger/File PhotoHis positions and language are sometimes so close to the FPO's that the far right party has accused him of plagiarism.  When Kurz said last month that he wanted to do away with Muslim kindergartens, which he and the FPO describe as breeding grounds for  parallel societies  at odds with the rest of Austria, the FPO said it had been making the same demand for years, and Kurz lacked the  will and courage  to carry it out. Chancellor Kern's Social Democrats (SPO) have opposed Kurz on that issue, but Kern put forward a plan on Wednesday to  take back control of migration  and cut arrivals from Africa sharply by 2020. He also oversaw a law-and-order drive this year that included a ban on Muslim face-covering veils. Kern's emphasis has, however, been more on employment and the economy. He has pushed for measures that would favor local workers over foreign rivals, including a tax break for firms that fill newly created posts with people registered as unemployed in Austria. While Kern's approach is more targeted than the sort of national preference the far right calls for, it is testing the limits of freedom of movement under European Union law, and the measure has yet to be approved by Brussels. Slideshow (7 Images)Going Mainstream Even though some stigma around the FPO itself remains, it has found new acceptance within the political establishment.  The center-left SPO has opened the door to forming a national coalition with the far right, lifting a self-imposed ban of 30 years. Parties rarely obtain a majority in Austria's proportional electoral system, and almost always need a coalition partner to form a government. The SPO and OVP have governed together for most of the past 70 years but they are now at loggerheads, making them less likely to join forces again.  The (FPO's) chances of joining the government as a junior partner are the highest they've been in more than 10 years, but the chances of coming first and securing the chancellor's job are very, very slim,  political analyst Thomas Hofer said.  For months now the party has seen its ideas implemented and now they face a dilemma because if they go further and become more extreme they could lose voters.    With parties like the FPO having made electoral gains across Europe, the diplomatic fallout from it entering government is likely to be more limited than in 2000, when its alliance with the OVP prompted the European Union to impose sanctions.

A sea of rapturous, flag-waving crowds gathered in Istanbul to listen as a defiant Erdogan promised to punish his enemies and praised the unarmed civilians who last year stood up to the rogue soldiers and their tanks.  They showed no mercy when they pointed their guns at my people,  Erdogan said.  What did my people have? They had their flags - just as they do today - and something much more important: They had their faith.  Some 250 people were killed and parliament was bombed before the coup was put down. The show of popular defiance has likely ended decades of military interference in Turkish politics.  But along with a groundswell of nationalism, the coup's greatest legacy has been a far-reaching crackdown that has deepened the divide between Western-facing, secular Turks and the pious millions who back Erdogan's Islamist-rooted politics. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 detained for alleged links to the putsch. On Friday, the government said it had dismissed 7,000 more police, civil servants and academics for suspected links to the Muslim cleric it blames for the attempted coup.  Nobody who betrays this nation can remain unpunished,  Erdogan said, promising again to restore the death penalty if parliament votes to bring it back - a move that would all but end Turkey's bid to join the European Union.  Critics, including rights groups and some Western governments, say that Erdogan is using the state of emergency introduced after the coup to target opposition figures including rights activists, pro-Kurdish politicians and journalists.  The two co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) are in jail - as are local members of rights group Amnesty International and nearly 160 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Justice Destroyed' At a parliamentary ceremony in Ankara on Saturday, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) decried what he said was the erosion of democracy following the coup.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses his supporters during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of the attempted coup at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey July 16, 2017. Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed,  said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, in a reference to an April referendum that Erdogan narrowly won, giving him sweeping executive powers.  In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalization, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented.  Kilicdaroglu this month finished a 25-day, 425 km (265 mile)  justice march  from Ankara to Istanbul, to protest the detention of a CHP lawmaker. The march, although largely ignored by the pro-government media, culminated in a massive rally in Istanbul against the crackdown. The U.S. State Department lauded Turks for defending their democracy, but cautioned about the need to preserve basic freedoms. Slideshow (26 Images) More voices, not fewer, are necessary in challenging times,  it said in a statement. Thousands March In Istanbul, hundreds of thousands gathered to listen to Erdogan near the bridge spanning the Bosphorus - the spot where last year civilians confronted the tanks and troops who had halted traffic between the city's European and Asian sides. Roads near the bridge - since renamed  July 15 Martyrs' Bridge  - were so crowded that some people opted to come by ferry. Some in the crowd carried posters of those who died. Erdogan was also due to speak at parliament in the early hours on Sunday, to observe the precise minute that the putschists bombed the national assembly building. In the run-up to the anniversary, Turkish media has been saturated by coverage from the coup attempt, with some channels showing almost constant footage of young men and headscarved mothers facing down armed soldiers and tanks. One man, 20-year-old Ismet Dogan, said he and his friends took to the streets, heeding the call from Erdogan to defy the soldiers. He was shot in both legs, he told broadcaster TRT Haber.  My friends and I said, 'We have one nation, if we are to die, let's do it like men',  he said.  Everyone who was there with me had come there to die. Nobody was afraid of death.

On July 5 a High Court judge upheld an injunction blocking holders of the bonds, which are due to mature in October, from enforcing claims related to the securities against Dana. But he also imposed restrictions on asset sales by Dana and its ability to raise more debt or pay dividends. He ordered Dana to cancel an injunction in a court in the emirate of Sharjah, where it has been trying to have the sukuk declared unlawful, and to seek a stay of proceedings there. In a statement on Sunday responding to the London court decisions, the company said:  Dana Gas succeeded on all the legal arguments upon which it relied, and the Court continued the injunction, until a trial scheduled for September 2017.  The English Judge found, on the two key tests for the continuation of an injunction under English law, that Dana Gas has a 'seriously arguable case' and that the balance of justice was in favour of the Company. Dana Gas was also not required to fortify the injunction.  Dana noted that it had been ordered to lift its injunction in the UAE court and to stay proceedings there; it said this was  in order to avoid duplication in multiple jurisdictions . The company remains keen to engage with sukuk holders and reach an agreement on a consensual basis, which is not prevented by the injunctions in place, Dana added.

Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population, has seen a resurgence in home-grown radicalism, and has stepped up cooperation with its neighbors to stem a growing presence in Southeast Asia of extremist group Islamic State. On Friday, Indonesian authorities blocked all access to Telegram, saying it had several forums that were  full of radical and terrorist propaganda . Pavel Durov, founder of the messaging app, said in on Telegram that there had been a  miscommunication  with Indonesian authorities, as he was not aware of a request by the government to take down certain channels.   Telegram is heavily encrypted and privacy-oriented, but we're no friends of terrorists,  Durov said on his Telegram channel, adding he was  upset  over Indonesia's ban. He said that since the ban, Telegram had taken steps to block certain channels reported by the Indonesian government to carry terrorism-related content.      Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Sunday that other social media platforms will not be affected by the government's latest move. Telegram is a messaging platform believed to be popular with Islamic State sympathizers, who use chatrooms with hundreds of members as well as have private conversations. Many messaging apps such as Whatsapp and Telegram offer end-to-end encryption from sender to recipient, which means not even the companies providing the platform can see the messages. Security officials in several countries have complained that the such apps provide a safe space for militants to communicate with each other. Several governments, including those of Australia and Britain, have urged technology companies to do more to help security agencies thwart threats. On Sunday, the Indonesian communications ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Some users said they were able to use Telegram to send text messages. On Saturday, Communications Minister Rudiantara told Reuters by text message that Telegram had not processed the government's requests to take down  radical  content quickly enough.  We are trying to support their business but we also need their cooperation in addressing our concerns i.e. in addressing negative content,  he said.

Trump,INDIA,MARKETS,WEEKAHEAD","sector":"Homepage","content":"It was a good week for the bulls worldwide after Fed Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the U.S. central bank's rate increase will continue to be gradual, which means the era of cheap money won’t end anytime soon. Risk-on sentiment prevailed in emerging markets as a result. Back home, a drop in retail inflation triggered hopes for a rate cut by the RBI. The trading glitch at the NSE on Monday turned out to be a trap for short sellers, who had to run for cover, resulting in a 100-point move. The Nifty and the Sensex hit respective new highs and consolidated towards the end of the week. The broader Nifty ended up 2.3 percent at 9,886 points. Crude oil prices climbed nearly 5 percent for the week after the IEA said demand is increasing faster than initially estimated. Aiding sentiments were reports of declining U.S. oil stockpiles and Kuwait’s OPEC governor saying crude inventories will drop at a faster pace. In India, technology shares were in focus after TCS and Infosys announced their first quarter results. TCS reported lower than expected numbers while Infosys managed to beat estimates. As with any bull market, the ongoing rally is witnessing an IPO mania. Some of the successful listings so far this year are Au Small Finance Bank, CDSL, HUDCO, Avenue Supermarts and Tejas Networks. The valuations of a few of them have doubled in just a few months. The manic rise seen in IPO scrips reminds me of the 2007 bull run where IPO stocks were the talk of the town and we witnessed new listings week after week. On the macro front, CPI inflation fell to 1.5 percent in June from 2.2 percent in May. Core inflation fell to 3.8 percent, led by lower international oil prices. The base effect is expected to wear off from August onwards. IIP expanded by 1.7 percent in May, compared with 2.8 percent in April. IIP is likely to remain weak in June as sales may have suffered on account of destocking ahead of implementation of GST. Talk of a rate cut by the RBI at its August meeting are getting louder. The central bank lowered its inflation forecast for H1 and H2 FY18 in its June review, and the current CPI reading is lower than expectation. This means there could be room for at least a 25 bps rate cut. It needs to be seen whether the RBI relents to market expectation since lower inflation could be a result of lower demand as reflected in the IIP data. RBI also needs to ask itself whether a rate cut can induce demand and help in increasing capital expenditure, which has fallen to a 25-year low with credit growth at the lowest in decades. The GST-related disruption may be felt in August when pre-GST inventories dry up and filing of returns start, which will result in reconcilation of input credit. If this phase passes off smoothly, then we can be assured that the GST implementation is successful. The coming week sees June-quarter results picking up pace with prominent companies like Reliance Industries, ACC, Jubilant Foodworks, Crisil, Ultratech Cement, Wipro, Bajaj Auto, Kotak Bank and Ashok Leyland reporting their numbers. The focus will also be on the month-long monsoon session of parliament, which begins on July 17. The government is expected to introduce a host of bills, and it will also be the first session after the GST rollout, which emans the impact of GST is likely to be discussed in both houses. The presidential election will also take place on Monday, though the outcome is more or less known. The recent global rally has been able to withstand political upheavals and shocks, including the UK’s vote to leave the EU, Donald Trump’s election, international sanctions on Russia and tensions due to North Korea’s missle programme. Indexes are hitting new highs and valuation are severely stretched, worrying marquee fund managers. There seems to be a major mismatch in India between macro data and the mood in the market. Corporate earnings recovery is at least 18 months away as the GST effect would be felt over the next couple of quarters. Lack of employment generation is a huge problem as millions of young people enter the workforce evey year. Even the IT sector, which led the employment and consumer boom in the past two decades, is waning. The bulls seem to be riding a tiger and they can’t afford to get off. We are looking at a possible blow-out rally and a lot of gullible investors could end up losing their hard-earned money.

My son is not a terrorist. He was arrested while doing farm work,  said one young mother, Sarbeda. She had bustled her way -- an infant in her arms -- through several other women telling reporters their husbands had been arrested on false grounds. In November, Myanmar's army swept through villages where stateless Rohingya Muslims live in the area of Maungdaw. Some 75,000 people fled across the nearby border to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations. U.N. investigators who interviewed refugees said allegations of gang rape, torture, arson and killings by security forces in the operation were likely crimes against humanity. Myanmar's government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied most of the claims, and is blocking entry to a U.N. fact-finding mission tasked with looking into the allegations. The government has also kept independent journalists and human rights monitors out of the area for the past nine months. This week, the Ministry of Information escorted more than a dozen foreign and local journalists representing international media, including Reuters, to the area  under a guard of officers from the paramilitary Border Guard Police Brutal Tactics The reporters spent nearly two days in Buthidaung, a township in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, where they were taken to sites of alleged militant activity. They were taken to Kyar Gaung Taung, one of three settlements requested by the journalists. Officials cited time constraints for the limited access. Reuters had previously gathered accounts from residents by phone and from former residents who have fled to Bangladesh, of brutal counterinsurgency tactics unleashed in Kyar Gaung Taung and several nearby villages in mid-November. Sarbeda, whose teenage son was arrested for suspected links to a militant group, speaks to reporters in Kyar Gaung Taung village, northern Rakhine state, Myanmar July 14, 2017. Picture taken July 14, 2017.Simon LewisWhen a group of journalists insisted on speaking to villagers away from security forces, allegations of abuses by troops emerged almost immediately. Kyar Gaung Taung resident Sarbeda, 30, had been able to visit her son, Nawsee Mullah, 14, at a police camp where he is being held separately from adult detainees. She was not sure if he had a lawyer, she said. Reuters reported in March that 13 boys under the age of 18 were detained during security operations. They were included in a list of 423 people charged under the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act, which outlaws joining or aiding rebel groups. At least 32 people from Kyar Gaung Taung village had been arrested and 10 killed, said a village schoolteacher, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. He estimated that half the village's 6,000 residents had fled during the clearance operation. Slideshow (5 Images)Burned to Death Another villager, Lalmuti, 23, pointed to a small pile of ashes where she said she found her father's remains. She described how he was bound and thrown into a house and burned to death. Her mother was later arrested when authorities deemed her complaint about the killings to be fabricated. She is serving a six-month jail sentence, Lalmuti and two other villagers said. Reporters were not given a chance to put these allegations to authorities, and Reuters was unable to reach officials to confirm the details of the cases by phone. In a press briefing on Friday, Brigadier General Thura San Lwin, commander of Myanmar's Border Guard Police, said some villagers had made what he said were erroneous claims and were subsequently charged and jailed for lying to the authorities.  The media said we torched houses and that there were rape cases -- they give wrong information,  Thura San Lwin told reporters. He also disputed the U.N.'s estimates for the number of people who fled, claiming local records showed that only 22,000 people were missing in the conflict. Myanmar officials say a domestic investigation, led by Vice President Myint Swe - a former lieutenant general in the army - and a commission headed for former U.N. chief Kofi Annan - which is not mandated to investigate human rights abuses - are the appropriate ways to address problems in Rakhine State.

He deserved it,  Davis of Chapman.  There's many more to come where he's going.  Chapman hit his first two career home runs, solo shots in the third and eighth innings off Indians ace Corey Kluber. He went 3-for-3, scored three runs and also doubled. He had multi extra-base hits in a game for the first time in his career. All that from a rookie who entered the game batting .146. with 22 strikeouts in 41 at-bats.  There's always doubt, but I know that I've had struggles before and I was able to work through them and come out on top,  Chapman said.  You just have to trust in your abilities and trust that the work you're doing is going to ultimately lead to success.  Does tonight mean I'm going to be perfectly fine and never have any other struggles again? No. But it's obviously nice to have some sort of success and know that you can compete at this level and you are good enough to do it.  Davis hit reliever Bryan Shaw's 3-2 fastball over the right-center field fence for his 25th home run and second walk-off hit of the season. The walk-off homer was the second of his career. Yonder Alonso led off the bottom of the ninth with a walk against left-hander Andrew Miller (3-3), who developed what he called a  hot spot  on a finger on his left hand and gave way to Shaw. Davis ended the game after a seven-pitch battle with Shaw. He fouled off a tough 3-2 pitch then homered, as he has so often, to the opposite field. Related CoveragePreview: Indians at AthleticsCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch I didn't think it was going out,  Davis said.  I was happy that it was in the gap and Yonder might have had a chance to score, or if they held him up, putting our team in a good position to win the ball game. It just snuck over.  Chapman tied it 3-3 with a leadoff blast to center off Kluber in the eighth inning. Chapman hit Kluber's 93.4 mph sinker an estimated 455 feet, lining the ball off the facing high above the center field fence.  It makes you nervous when anybody, not just a young kid, but a guy struggling and then they take a good swing,  Indians manager Terry Francona said of Chapman.  I know he's a very well thought-off young prospect and you could see why.  Edwin Encarnacion hit his 19th home run of the season, a two-run shot in the fourth inning for the Indians. Kluber allowed three runs on five hits, including two home runs, over 7 1/3 innings. He struck out 12 and walked none.  I threw two balls right down the middle and he took advantage of it,  Kluber said of Chapman.  Not really any secret to it. I mean you put two balls on a tee like that to major league hitters and usually they're going to take advantage of it.  A's rookie right-hander Paul Blackburn allowed three runs on five hits over six innings in his third straight quality start to begin his major league career. Blackburn struck out four, walked four and threw a wild pitch. Liam Hendriks, Daniel Coulombe and Ryan Madson (2-4) each threw one perfect inning in relief for the A's. The Indians broke a 2-2 tie with a run in the sixth. Encarnacion led off with a walk, moved to third on Jose Ramirez's single to center and scored on Carlos Santana's ground out. Chapman gave the A's a 1-0 lead when he sent Kluber's 2-1 cutter over the left-center field fence with one out in the third inning. Davis has been a mentor for Chapman, who watched Davis play baseball at Cal-State Fullerton then followed in his footsteps at the school.  Fantastic,  Davis said of Chapman's two-homer night.  It was great to see him get his first one out of the way. The first one's always the hardest one. He stayed confident. Even though he got off to a little rocky start, he stayed confident.  Cleveland responded with two runs in the fourth to take a 2-1 lead. Michael Brantley worked a leadoff walk and Encarnacion followed with a two-run shot to left field, launching Blackburn's 0-1 slider over the left field fence. Oakland pulled even with a run in the fifth. Chapman lined an opposite-field double down the right field line with two outs, and Rajai Davis brought him home with a sharp, opposite-field single to right. NOTES: A's RHP Kendall Graveman (strained right shoulder) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Wednesday with Triple-A Nashville. Graveman, who has been on the disabled list since May 26, said he expects to make three or four rehab starts and be ready to rejoin the A's in early August. He threw 60 pitches Friday at Class A Stockton during a live batting practice session and hit as high as 95 mph on the radar gun. ... A's INF/OF Chad Pinder (strained left hamstring) ran the bases Saturday for the first time since going on the disabled list June 24. He'll run the bases one more time then will likely begin a rehab assignment this coming week. ... Cleveland CF Bradley Zimmer hit leadoff for the fifth time this season and the second straight game against Oakland. He went 0-for-2 but walked twice and stole a base. Zimmer has hit eighth 22 times, ninth and seventh five times apiece and sixth twice. ...

Dodgers and Houston Astros, but there is no lack of confidence in their clubhouse. The Rays, six games over .500 for the first time since 2015, did everything well Saturday night in a 6-3 win over the Los Angeles Angels that held their position for an American League wild-card bid and moved them 2 1/2 games behind AL East leader Boston. Alex Cobb continued his run of stout starts and Logan Morrison and Steven Souza Jr. continued the Rays' home-run assault on the American League. Cobb (8-6) allowed one run, six hits and three walks in 7 2/3 innings, his seventh straight start of six innings or more, a career high. He's allowed only 36 hits in 49 1/3 innings over his last seven starts and two earned runs or fewer six times. Morrison hit his 25th home run of the season in the third, a two-run shot, and Souza hit his career-high 18th in the eighth. The Rays have hit 136 home runs, third-most in the AL and fourth in the majors. They had 14 hits, including four by Corey Dickerson and three by Shane Peterson. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AngelsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch They're confident, and they should be,  manager Kevin Cash said.  This game isn't easy, but when you play with confidence if makes it a little easier.  Said Cobb:  We're doing a lot of things right. I was worried about the All-Star break coming at a bad time, but after two games it shows that we haven't lost any momentum.  Cobb has been a big part of that momentum. His string of solid and long outings has taken some pressure off the bullpen and underscored the kind of pitcher he is when he isn't battling injuries.  I think I pitched to contact more tonight,  he said.  I looked up at the scoreboard a couple of times and saw the pitch count was low. I probably had fewer strikeouts but we have a great defense.   This game was probably more of a battle for Alex than he's had recently,  Cash said.  But he still set the tone. He made big pitches when he had to.  The Rays hit Angels starter JC Ramirez (8-8) early and often, with eight hits in the first four innings. The big hit was Morrison's two-run home run to center in the third to make it a 3-0 game. The home run snapped an 0-for-15 slump for Morrison and was only his third home run in his last 15 games. Dickerson's four-hit night gave him a league-best 34th multi-hit games, and also snapped a 4-for-38 funk over his last 11 games. The loss sent the reeling Angels four games under .500 for the first time since April 23. They are 2-6 in their last eight games and have scored 11 runs in their last six games, and 32 in their last 14. They are last in the AL in runs per game at 4.06. First baseman Luis Valbuena drove in all three runs, with a solo home run in the seventh and a consolation two-run home run off Jumbo Diaz in the ninth. Mike Trout had a pair of singles in his second game back from the disabled after undergoing surgery on his left thumb, but also lost a fly ball in the twilight that led to a Rays run.  Tonight we had a lot of good at-bats,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  We hit a lot of balls on the screws but had nothing to show for it. We just have to turn the page.  Ramirez went six innings but has allowed four runs or more in six of his last nine starts. NOTES: Angels RHP Parker Bridwell will officially be recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City on Sunday and start the series finale. He's 3-1 with a 3.24 ERA in six appearances in 2017. ... RHP Matt Shoemaker remains on the disabled list with a nerve condition in his right arm and received a cortisone shot that will keep him from throwing for at least a week. He made a rehab start earlier this week and left the game with pain. ... Rays SS Tim Beckham was activated from the disabled list after the game and will start Sunday. He suffered an ankle sprain the first week of July but only missed five games. Infielder Taylor Featherstone was optioned to Triple-A Durham. ... Rays CF Kevin Kiermaier, on the disabled list since early June after suffering a hairline fracture in his hip, plans to begin baseball activities when the Rays return home from their current road trip and hopes to be able to return to the field in early August.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED7G622IHW"}

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the man was suspected of carrying out two shooting attacks in the West Bank on Saturday and opened fire at soldiers and policemen who had tracked him down.  The terrorist was found and surrounded, he pulled out his weapons at them, and in response, the terrorist was killed,  Rosenfeld said. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials. The incident took place before dawn in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, near the city of Ramallah, and no Israeli casualties were reported. One man was lightly wounded in the Saturday shooting, the Israeli military said. A wave of Palestinian street attacks that began in 2015 has slowed but has not stopped. At least 260 Palestinians and one Jordanian citizen have been killed since the violence began. Israel says at least 175 of those killed were carrying out attacks while others died in clashes and protests.  Forty Israelis, two U.S. tourists and a British student have been killed in Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car-rammings. A few of the attacks had been carried out by Arab Israeli citizens. On Friday, two Israeli policemen were shot dead by three Arab Israeli gunmen on the outskirts of one of Jerusalem's most sacred sites, known as Noble Sanctuary to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews. The gunmen were all shot dead by police. Israel blames the violence on incitement by the Palestinian leadership. The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, says desperation over the 50-year occupation of land sought by Palestinians for a state is the cause. Palestinians want to establish an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

It's not an easy job,  he said,  but I have to be ready every single day.  Sanchez got a rare chance to play Saturday and delivered a two-run, walk-off home run as San Diego defeated the San Francisco Giants 5-3 in left-hander Madison Bumgarner's return.  It's fun to see him succeed because he has had such limited opportunities to play,  said Padres manager Andy Green, who inserted Sanchez late into the lineup when Austin Hedges was unable to go.  You wouldn't think so by looking at his numbers, but he has won games for us, over and over.'' Of Sanchez's four home runs this year, three have been as a pinch-hitter and then there's Saturday's dramatic ninth-inning moon shot off reliever Steven Overt that was crushed 407 feet. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PadresSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatch Like any hitter, you are always looking for the fastball in the strike zone and then you try to put a good swing on it,  said Sanchez, a former Giant.  You just want to hit a line drive and get that run in and get the 'W.' To get the victory is more important to me.  Brandon Maurer (1-4) worked the eighth and got the win, the Padres' sixth in nine games. Cory Gearrin (3-3) faced one batter, but he absorbed the loss as Jabari Blash singled and scored the go-ahead run to send the Giants to their sixth loss in their past eight games. Bumgarner started for the first time since injuring his left shoulder in a dirt bike accident on April 20. The left-hander began with a flourish as the Giants ace struck out the side in the first inning on his way to retiring the initial seven batters he faced.  I felt pretty good the whole time and we kind of gradually built up to it,  Bumgarner said.  We were just making pitches pretty much from the first inning on tonight.  I knew I wasn't going to be able to get much over 100 (pitches), so yeah, if you can get out there for seven (innings), I'll take that any time.  Bumgarner, a four-time All-Star and the 2014 World Series MVP, didn't show much rust. He worked seven innings and surrendered three runs and four hits. He had five strikeouts and two walks in a 102-pitch effort.  Nice job by Madison, it really was,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  It was good to have him back, his presence. He gave us a chance to win and a quality start.  Jhoulys Chacin pitched six innings, allowing three runs, six hits and four walks. He struck out four in failing to win his third straight start and to beat the Giants for the third consecutive time this season. Joe Panik tied the score at 3 with his solo homer in the sixth inning. Chacin tried to sneak a 78 mph fastball past Panik and he nailed it for his sixth home run of the year. Blash smacked the second of the Padres' two homers, a two-run, 424-foot shot in the fourth inning for a 3-2 lead. For Blash, who was called up from Triple-A El Paso on Friday, it was his second homer of the year and his first since April 25. Matt Szczur's homer in the third pulled the Padres within 2-1. Szczur punished Bumgarner's elevated curveball with a 407-foot blast. NOTES: Giants RHP Johnny Cueto was placed on the disabled list with blisters on his throwing hand.

On Saturday night, he didn't need to. Cruz belted a two-run homer in the sixth to put Seattle ahead, slumping Kyle Seager hit a solo shot in the second and the Mariners held on to beat the Chicago White Sox 4-3 on Saturday night for their third straight win. Cruz greeted Anthony Swarzak (4-3), Chicago's second reliever, with his 18th homer on a deep drive to center off a fastball. Then Cruz rounded the bases for the eventual game-winning run, jogging at a deliberate pace that wouldn't aggravate his injury.  It's getting better,  Cruz said of his knee.  At least I'm running better, or like you say, walking better. I think I started feeling it little once I got to third base.  Cruz's swing mattered more than his trot to manager Scott Servais.  Offensively, Cruzie with the big blast and Seager really swinging the bat well tonight, too,  Servais said.  Great to see.  Seager's homer was his 11th, but his first -- and only his fourth hit -- in his last 10 games. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at White SoxSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchSeattle starter Felix Hernandez (5-3) scuffled, but got the win in his fifth start since turning to the rotation after missing 54 games with right shoulder inflammation. The 2010 AL Cy Young winner lasted just five innings, giving up six hits and three runs, but only one was earned due to three Mariners' errors. Hernandez hit Chicago slugger Jose Abreu twice with pitches to create bases-loaded, no-out jams in the third and fifth innings. But the six-time All-Star right-hander allowed only one run in those situations -- on Todd Frazier's double-play grounder in the fifth that put Chicago ahead 3-2.  It was a battle the whole game, I couldn't find my rhythm,  Hernandez said.  I couldn't find the balance in my mechanics. I was all over the place.  Four Seattle relievers followed with four scoreless innings. Edwin Diaz pitched the ninth, allowing a single to Melky Cabrera and walking Avisail Garcia with two outs, but got his 15th save in 18 chances when he fanned Abreu to end the game.  Running four guys in a row, it's really hard to have them all on top of their games,  Servais said.  We needed them tonight and they did it.  Cabrera belted his 11th homer and had two RBIs as he moved up to Chicago's leadoff spot for the eighth time this season and went 4-for-5.  It was a good game for me, but I wish we could have won the game,  Cabrera said through a translator.  I've just been doing my routine. I haven't changed anything.  Chicago starter Mike Pelfrey pitched 4 2/3 innings, allowing four hits and two runs -- one earned -- in a no-decision. White Sox manager Rick Renteria was ejected for the sixth time this season after arguing with second-base umpire Tom Hallion in the bottom of the sixth. With Tim Anderson on first base, reliever Steve Cishek threw wide on a pickoff attempt. Anderson got to second, but Renteria thought he should have been awarded third.  I thought it should have been two bases,  Renteria said.  I think we might have disagreed.  Cabrera opened the bottom of the first inning by drilling a solo shot to right. Seager lofted Pelfrey's inside 2-2 offering down the right-field line and deep into the seats in the second inning to tie it at 1. Cabrera's sharp single drove in Adam Engel in the third to put Chicago back ahead 2-1 with an unearned run. Engel reached on shortstop Jean Segura's error, stole second and advanced to third on a wild pitch. The White Sox went on to load the bases with none out, but Hernandez escaped the jam with no additional runs scoring, Todd Frazier's weak grounder to third forced out Cabrera at home, then Tyler Saladino popped out and Matt Davidson flied out to center. Seattle tied it at 2 with an unearned run in the fifth. Carlos Ruiz singled in Danny Valencia from third with two outs. Valencia had reached when Anderson failed to pick up the Mariners first baseman's routine ground ball for his MLB-worst 20th error. The White Sox loaded the bases again with none out in the bottom of the inning. Frazier grounded Hernandez's 0-2 pitch into a 6-4-3 double play to plate one run, but Saladino struck out and Chicago settled for a 3-2 lead. Dan Jennings walked Robinson Cano to lead off the sixth, then Swarzak entered and gave up with Cruz's homer to center. NOTES: Seattle rookie OF Mitch Haniger injured the index finger on his right hand while trying to bunt and left the game in the sixth. He had X-rays and manager Scott Servais expects him to be out day-to-day. ... Melky Cabrera's leadoff homer was the fourth of his career. ...

Anthony Rendon hit two home runs, including his second career grand slam, and drove in six runs to back Max Scherzer's six scoreless innings in the Nationals' 10-7 win over the Reds on Saturday night.  You never know,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.  Rendon had another great game. You never knew the grand slam was going to be the deciding swing. Those guys don't quit. They have a good offensive ballclub.  Rendon was on base five times with a single and two walks for the Nationals (54-36). It was his third career multi-homer game. Rendon did not make the All-Star team in spite of his presence on the National League leaderboard in on-base-percentage (.420), doubles (22), walks (51), batting average (.315) and slugging percentage (.582).  I'll let y'all write about that,  Rendon said.  I try not to think about being hot. As long as we're winning, that's all that matters. We're just trying to extend this lead and keep grinding.  The Nationals defeated the Reds (39-51) for the fourth time in five games. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at RedsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchScherzer (10-5) escaped early jams but struck out 10 to extend his NL-leading strikeout total to 183.  They put some good at-bats on me. They really grinded me out,  Scherzer said.  We just kind of stuck to the game plan. We were joking in the dugout that Wieters had the best sequence he's had all season. Facing (Joey) Votto with runners on first and second and nobody out, your back's to the wall. If they were looking fastball, we went off-speed. If they were looking off-speed, we went fastball.  Scherzer allowed three hits and four walks in his first start after the All-Star break.  Scherzer gave us all he had,  Baker said.  He pitched in the All-Star Game, so we knew it was going to be a short outing - shorter than normal. He got out of those jams in the first and third.  Losing pitcher Luis Castillo (1-2), who picked up his first career win in his last start, worked six innings, allowing three runs, three hits and four walks.  Castillo wasn't bad,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  He's been sharper, but he did a nice job against an outstanding offensive ballclub. It's another step in the right direction. He kept us in the game.  Castillo fell behind 3-0 to Rendon in the fourth inning.  I wanted to challenge Rendon. I didn't want to walk him,  Castillo said.  Sometimes when you get two quick outs, you think the job is done. The game is going fast but you have to make good pitches then too.  The Nationals broke the game open with a seven-run, seventh inning against Michael Lorenzen (six runs) and Blake Wood, who was greeted by Rendon's grand slam. Ryan Raburn, who spent spring training with Cincinnati, led off the inning with his second home run since coming to the Nationals in a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox on May 26. The Reds scored five runs in the ninth against Trevor Gott. Three runs crossed on Scooter Gennett's 16th home run of the season. Matt Grace entered after the Nationals' lead was cut to three with no outs and retired three straight batters for his second save. Washington's Bryce Harper extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a one-out single in the fourth inning. Daniel Murphy, the All-Star second baseman, doubled to the gap in left center with two outs to score Harper. Rendon followed with a homer to give Washington a 3-0 lead. The Reds put the leadoff man on base in each of the first three innings against Scherzer. Billy Hamilton hit a ground-rule double in the bottom of the first. Zack Cozart walked, but Scherzer struck out Votto, Adam Duvall and Gennett. Hamilton singled and stole his 39th base of the season in the third, but Scherzer fanned Votto looking on a 3-2 pitch. After Duvall popped to short, Gennett was Scherzer's eighth strikeout victim. The Reds had a baserunner in each of the first five innings but failed to score against Scherzer, who struck out 10 to log his 12th game with double-digit strikeouts. NOTES: RHP Joe Ross will have Tommy John surgery on his right elbow on Wednesday by Dr. Keith Meister in Arlington, Texas. Ross was placed on the the disabled list. ... Nationals OF Jayson Werth had a long meeting with manager Dusty Baker on Saturday afternoon. Werth has been on the 10-day disabled list since June 4.  He is doing what he can to stay in shape,  Dusty Baker said.  He's a worker.  Werth has been shut down from baseball activities for the time being. ... Reds C Devin Mesoraco was took batting practice on Friday and was scheduled to catch a bullpen before the game.  We didn't have anyone who needed to throw a bullpen,  Bryan Price said.

He'll definitely remember the exact details of his first professional home run. Lugo picked up the win by tossing 6 2/3 solid innings Saturday night, when he helped his own cause by hitting a solo homer in the Mets' 9-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field. While Lugo understands he earns his keep as a pitcher and not a hitter, he couldn't help but smile broadly when the first question for him at his postgame press conference was about the home run.  The jog around the bases was pretty surreal,  Lugo said.  I always looked forward to that moment when I was a little kid, you know?  The Mets were already up 7-0 when Lugo crushed the first pitch he saw from Chris Rusin in the third inning into the party deck just beyond the left field wall.  I knew I hit a line drive, I didn't know if it had enough spin to stay in the air,  Lugo said.  I was watching (and saying) 'Get up! Get up! Yeah!'  The homer was the first for Lugo since his final season at Centenary College in 2011. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at MetsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatch I hit two that year,  Lugo said.  I remember the first one. I can't really remember the second one, though.  There will be plenty reminders of the one he hit Saturday. In addition to the many videos he'll be able to find on the Internet, Lugo won't soon forget his awkward, upright-running trot --  I think I've just got an awkward jog, running's never been my strong point  - nor the tongue-in-cheek cold shoulder he got upon returning to the dugout, where second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera didn't offer the usual welcome he gives to a Met who has just homered.  Everyone who hits a homer, 'Cabby' takes off the helmet and low-fives them,  Lugo said.  I've always looked forward to that. I knew I was going to get a home run sometime, but I had to give it to myself.  On the mound, Lugo (4-2) gave up three runs, seven hits and two walks while striking out five.  They put up seven runs in the first two innings, no reason not to throw strikes there,  Lugo said. Jay Bruce gave the Mets all the offense they needed with a three-run homer in the first inning against Rockies right-hander Tyler Chatwood (6-11), who got just one out before departing with a calf injury. Travis d'Arnaud had an RBI single later in the first and T.J. Rivera (RBI single) and Lucas Duda (two-run double) each had run-scoring hits in the second. Jose Reyes homered leading off the eighth and finished with two hits and a stolen base for the Mets (41-47), who have won the first two games of the three-game series by a combined score of 23-5 to move within 8 1/2 games of the reeling Rockies (52-41) in the wild-card standings in the National League. The lone hiccup for the Mets Saturday occurred in the sixth inning, when the Rockies scored twice and New York left fielder Yoenis Cespedes left with a sore hip after he slid awkwardly in pursuit of a sinking liner by Nolan Arenado. Cespedes said afterward he felt fine and that team doctors told him he didn't suffer a serious injury.  I doubt he's going to be in there (Sunday), just as a precaution,  Mets manager Terry Collins said. Chatwood (6-11) looks headed for a more extended stint on the shelf after his abbreviated outing, during which he allowed four runs, one hit and three walks while striking out none. Chatwood said he felt something in the calf while warming up but tried to pitch through it.  These calf strains, as you know from history -- not only from players around the league but what we've seen recently with Ian (Desmond, who is on the 10-day disabled list with a right calf strain) -- that these are a little tricky,  Rockies manager Bud Black said. Chatwood opened the game by walking Michael Conforto and Asdrubal Cabrera on nine pitches and was pulled for Chris Rusin after issuing a four-pitch walk to Rivera after Bruce's homer. It was just the seventh time in Rockies history a starter has one out or fewer and the first time since Kip Wells lasted just one-third of an inning on July 21, 2008.  I was essentially using all arm, which isn't ideal for a guy who's had two Tommy John's,  said Chatwood, who underwent the ligament replacement surgery as a high school sophomore and again in 2014. Gerardo Parra (sacrifice fly), Raimel Tapia (RBI double) and Charlie Blackmon (run-scoring triple) had an RBI apiece for the Rockies, who have lost 15 of 20. Arenado and D.J. LeMahieu had two hits each. NOTES: Mets 3B T.J. Rivera extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ... Mets SS Jose Reyes stole his 499th career base in the third inning. ...

Adams delivered a three-run double in a four-run sixth inning against the Diamondbacks bullpen and the Braves clinched the weekend series with an 8-5 victory Saturday night.  I feel like I'm getting more comfortable with any at-bat I get,  said Adams, who has eight RBIs on his six pinch hits in 25 at-bats this season.  I look forward to when my number is called. ... I was ready for it.  Braves manager Brian Snitker picked the right-handed hitting Lane Adams to bat rather than left-handed swinging Matt Adams, which seemed like the more obvious choice against right-hander Randall Delgado. Left-hander Andrew Chafin was warming up, though, and the move paid off for the Braves.  I just thought it was a better matchup than Matt Adams against a lefty,  Snitker said.

Delgado (1-2) was charged with all four runs in the eighth, allowing three hits and a walk while getting just two outs. Adams connected on the first pitch after a 3-2 walk to Dansby Swanson and Ender Inciarte plated the last run of the inning with what was scored as his third hit of the game, making it 6-3.  Delgado put himself in a position where he couldn't make a mistake and Adams took advantage of it,  Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. The Arizona bullpen gave up two more runs, including a pinch homer by Jace Peterson in the eighth inning, as the Braves (44-45) handed the Diamondbacks (53-38) their seventh loss in the past eight games.  The season has ups and downs every year,  Lovullo said.  I know that we're frustrated right now. We've lost a couple of games. But Atlanta is a quality baseball team.  It went downhill for Arizona after Daniel Descalso, pinch hitting for Corbin, singled in the tying run off Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz in the sixth. Descalsco scored the lead run on a two-out single by Paul Goldschmidt off reliever Luke Jackson. Foltynewicz, who labored through 110 pitches, was charged with three runs on eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out six. Corbin, who threw just 77 pitches, allowed six hits and two runs over five innings. He struck out six and his only walk was intentional.  It's frustrating coming out. You want to go as deep as you can,  Corbin said.  But it's the National League and there are tough decisions.  The Braves finally scored against Corbin with one out in the third. Phillips turned on a hanging 3-2 slider and smashed his eighth homer into the left-center field seats. Corbin's scoreless streak of 27 2/3 innings against the Braves to start his career was the longest in the majors since Houston's Pete Harnisch went 29 innings against San Diego in 1991 and 1992. The Braves went up 2-1 in the fifth inning as Inciarte singled with two outs and scored on a double by Phillips, who had three hits in his first three at-bats.  He kind of had my number all game,  Corbin said.  I made some mistakes on him he made me pay. I just didn't get ahead of him like I wanted to.

My son is not a terrorist. He was arrested while doing farm work,  said one young mother, Sarbeda. She had bustled her way -- an infant in her arms -- through several other women telling reporters their husbands had been arrested on false grounds. In November, Myanmar's army swept through villages where stateless Rohingya Muslims live in the area of Maungdaw. Some 75,000 people fled across the nearby border to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations. U.N. investigators who interviewed refugees said allegations of gang rape, torture, arson and killings by security forces in the operation were likely crimes against humanity. Myanmar's government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied most of the claims, and is blocking entry to a U.N. fact-finding mission tasked with looking into the allegations. The government has also kept independent journalists and human rights monitors out of the area for the past nine months. This week, the Ministry of Information escorted more than a dozen foreign and local journalists representing international media, including Reuters, to the area  under a guard of officers from the paramilitary Border Guard Police Brutal Tactics The reporters spent nearly two days in Buthidaung, a township in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, where they were taken to sites of alleged militant activity. They were taken to Kyar Gaung Taung, one of three settlements requested by the journalists. Officials cited time constraints for the limited access. Reuters had previously gathered accounts from residents by phone and from former residents who have fled to Bangladesh, of brutal counterinsurgency tactics unleashed in Kyar Gaung Taung and several nearby villages in mid-November. When a group of journalists insisted on speaking to villagers away from security forces, allegations of abuses by troops emerged almost immediately. Kyar Gaung Taung resident Sarbeda, 30, had been able to visit her son, Nawsee Mullah, 14, at a police camp where he is being held separately from adult detainees. She was not sure if he had a lawyer, she said. Reuters reported in March that 13 boys under the age of 18 were detained during security operations. They were included in a list of 423 people charged under the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act, which outlaws joining or aiding rebel groups. At least 32 people from Kyar Gaung Taung village had been arrested and 10 killed, said a village schoolteacher, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. He estimated that half the village's 6,000 residents had fled during the clearance operation. Burned to Death Another villager, Lalmuti, 23, pointed to a small pile of ashes where she said she found her father's remains. She described how he was bound and thrown into a house and burned to death. Her mother was later arrested when authorities deemed her complaint about the killings to be fabricated. She is serving a six-month jail sentence, Lalmuti and two other villagers said. Reporters were not given a chance to put these allegations to authorities, and Reuters was unable to reach officials to confirm the details of the cases by phone. In a press briefing on Friday, Brigadier General Thura San Lwin, commander of Myanmar's Border Guard Police, said some villagers had made what he said were erroneous claims and were subsequently charged and jailed for lying to the authorities.  The media said we torched houses and that there were rape cases -- they give wrong information,  Thura San Lwin told reporters. He also disputed the U.N.'s estimates for the number of people who fled, claiming local records showed that only 22,000 people were missing in the conflict. Myanmar officials say a domestic investigation, led by Vice President Myint Swe - a former lieutenant general in the army - and a commission headed for former U.N. chief Kofi Annan - which is not mandated to investigate human rights abuses - are the appropriate ways to address problems in Rakhine State.

He is also only the ninth Dodgers player to hit for the cycle and his career-best four-hit performance helped Los Angeles defeat the Miami Marlins 7-1 at Marlins Park for its eighth straight victory. Bellinger, who had never hit for the cycle at any level of baseball, participated in the Home Run Derby on Monday and the All-Star Game on Tuesday -- both at Marlins Park -- and celebrated his 22nd birthday Thursday. Now this.  This past week or whatever is probably at the top of everything,  said Bellinger, who seems genuinely humbled by his incredible season that includes 26 homers.  It started right here in Miami ... and it's something I will never forget.  Bellinger, an Arizona native and the Dodgers' fourth-round pick in 2013, singled in the first inning, blasted a two-run homer in the third, slugged an RBI double in the fourth and got his triple when Marlins right fielder Giancarlo Stanton raced in on a hard line drive and had the ball tip off the top of his glove.  I was booking it -- I was running as fast I can,  Bellinger said of the triple.  It (the cycle) is in the back of your mind. But the fact that it actually went there is crazy. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at MarlinsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch I knew I hit it well. I thought he was going to catch it, but I saw him over-run it, and that's when I thought, 'Oh, there's a chance for me to get three here'.  The four hits are a career high for Bellinger, who finished 4-for-5 with three RBIs and two runs scored. His homer sparked a five-run third inning in which all the scoring was done with two outs.  He's being doing crazy stuff all year,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said when asked about the Dodgers rookie. Bellinger's heroics overshadowed excellent performances by the Dodgers duo of catcher Yasmani Grandal and pitcher Alex Wood. Grandal, a former Miami Hurricanes star, capped the big third inning with a three-run homer. Wood, a first-time All-Star this year, improved his ERA to 1.56, allowing only three hits and one walk in six scoreless innings with four strikeouts. Wood hasn't lost to the Marlins since 2014, going 6-0 against them in that span.  Me and 'Yas' were on the same page all night,  Wood said of Grandal.  It's easy when you score seven runs.  The Dodgers (63-29), who have the best record in the majors, have prevailed in 28 of their past 32 games. That type of success clearly has the fan base energized, and there was a strong contingent of Dodgers fans represented at Marlins Park. In fact, in the sixth inning, a massive  L.A.  flag was unfurled in the right-field stands as Marlins fans booed.  When you go 3,000 miles away,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said,  and you hear, 'Let's Go Dodgers' and see that big blue banner ... it was pretty special to our coaches and players.  The fans also reacted when Marlins starter Jose Urena (7-4) brushed back Dodgers right fielder Yasiel Puig with an inside fastball. Puig shouted at Urena and took a couple steps toward him but nothing more developed. Tempers also erupted between the teams May 19 when Marlins reliever A.J. Ramos hit Dodgers batter Brett Eibner. Ironically, Wood also won that game, and Bellinger homered. After Saturday's tight pitch to Puig, Urena got him out. However, Urena lasted only three innings -- his shortest start of the year -- and allowed five runs on seven hits and three walks. Roberts did not, however, blame Urena for the brush-back pitch.  I thought Yasiel overreacted,  Roberts said.  It's clear to me there was no intent.  Urena agreed with Roberts.  (Puig),  Urena said,  acted like a little baby on that.  NOTES: Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton nearly made a spectacular catch in the sixth, crashing into the fence but failing to get the ball. Chris Taylor earned a triple on the play. ... Marlins C J.T. Realmuto's second-inning single extended his hitting streak against the Dodgers to 16 games. Only San Francisco's Jim Davenport (18) opened his career with a longer hitting streak against the Dodgers. ... Marlins RHP Edinson Volquez (left knee) has been scratched from Sunday's start. RHP Tom Koehler is expected to start in his place, moving up one day in the rotation. ... According to a Miami Herald report, more than 10 teams have asked about acquiring Marlins RHP David Phelps and only three teams have asked for RHP A.J. Ramos, who blew a ninth-inning save chance Friday. ... The Dodgers lead the majors with six victories in which they trailed entering the ninth inning. ... The Dodgers lead the majors in ERA (3.16), and lead the NL in bullpen ERA (2.95).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-dodgers-marlins-writethru-idUSMTZED7G5X0SCG"}

When Twins left fielder Eddie Rosario cashed in on similar luck on Saturday night, Minnesota manager Paul Molitor was quick to welcome the opportunity. Rosario turned an infield chopper to the right of the mound into a two-run double and the Minnesota Twins squeezed out a 4-2 victory over the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park. With the bases loaded and no outs in the sixth inning, Rosario ricocheted a grounder off the extended glove of Astros left-handed Tony Sipp. The deflected ball then squirted past lunging second baseman Jose Altuve as he slid in position to field the ball and initiate a double play. Miguel Sano and Max Kepler scored as the ball trickled past Altuve and into shallow right field. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at AstrosMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatch Ball's got to bounce your way once in a while,  Molitor said.  It's a part of the game that gets overlooked, the breaks that you get.  The Twins (46-44) held on from there, first with starter Ervin Santana (11-6) continuing his effective work against the Astros (61-30). Relievers Tyler Duffey and Taylor Rogers bridged the gap to All-Star closer Brandon Kintzler, who notched his 25th save with a scoreless ninth. The Astros stranded 11 runners and finished 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position. They taxed Santana early and loaded the bases against Duffey with two outs in the seventh, but Rogers induced an inning-ending ground ball to smother that threat. Rogers, a left-hander, retired four right-handed hitters to provide the biggest spark out of the Twins' bullpen.  I've got a job to do and I just tried to execute pitches and get ahead right away with runners in scoring position,  Rogers said.  The bases loaded you don't have much to work with so you just try to get ahead and execute from there.  Brian Dozier cranked a leadoff home run for a second consecutive game for the Twins. Altuve hit his 14th homer in support of Astros right-hander Joe Musgrove (4-8), who allowed four runs, eight hits and two walks with five strikeouts over five-plus innings.  A lot of these guys will give you a free strike so I tried to take advantage of that, but I think toward the end, I got a little too comfortable with the zone,  Musgrove said.  The balls weren't hit very hard, but they found some grass, and I thought Tony did a good job of trying to bail me out there.  Santana proved elusive despite the Astros' best efforts to knock him out early. He surrendered a run-scoring double to Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel in the second but made sure Houston didn't cash in on two additional baserunners later in the inning. Santana allowed a leadoff homer to Altuve in the third but buckled down when the Astros loaded the bases in the fourth, getting Altuve to ground out to stifle that rally. The Astros left the bases loaded in the second, fourth and seventh innings. They generated opportunities aplenty but repeatedly failed to convert.  It's a tough game, and when things don't go your way, there's a lot of what ifs, there's a lot of could haves, and there's a lot of nonsense,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  You just need to win the at-bats and we did, but we came up a little short.  NOTES: The Twins placed CF Byron Buxton on the 10-day disabled list with a left groin strain. Buxton sustained the injury Friday night when he slipped rounding second base en route to scoring on a bases-clearing double by 2B Brian Dozier in the fourth inning. In a corresponding move, the Twins reinstated 1B Joe Mauer from the disabled list after Mauer missed six games with a lower back strain. ... Astros LHP Dallas Keuchel will make the first of what will likely be multiple rehab starts Monday with Double-A Corpus Christi. Keuchel is scheduled to throw two innings. He landed on the 10-day disabled list June 5 with a neck strain. ... Twins RHP Bartolo Colon will make his first start with the club Tuesday against the New York Yankees. Colon signed with the Twins on July 7 after being released by the Atlanta Braves three days earlier.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED7G5XCICN"}

Two games into the second half, it doesn't look like the layoff seemed to matter. Jimmy Nelson struck out nine batters and Travis Shaw hit a tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning as the Brewers rallied late for a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, preserving their 5 1/2-game lead in the NL Central in front of 29,293 fans at Miller Park.  We had a lot of momentum going into the break, and for us to be able to take a few days off, then come back and continue that momentum is huge,  Nelson said.  Especially for a younger team.  We're playing with a lot of energy, and who knows what can happen? Who knows what we can do, especially with momentum.  Phillies right-hander Aaron Nola appeared to be the biggest threat to the Brewers' momentum early on. He kept Milwaukee off the board through the first four innings despite allowing four hits and getting four strikeouts. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BrewersTy Kelly provided a 1-0 lead with a sacrifice fly in the top of the fifth and Nola retired his first two batters in the bottom of the inning before Jonathan Villar reached on a base hit before taking second on a stolen base. Eric Thames followed and Nola hung him a slider right over the middle up the plate that Thames crushed off the wall in center, scoring Villar and tying the score at 1.  I looked at it on the video, it was just down the middle,  Nola said. He got out of the inning without any further damage but gave up a solo home run to Hernan Perez to open the sixth. Nola got out of that inning with two strikeouts to wrap up an otherwise solid night of work.  Nola pitched very well,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  You hold this team to two runs over six innings, you've done a good job.  Nelson had kept the Phillies at bay after Kelly's RBI and retired six in a row before Odubel Herrera tied the score at 2 in the seventh with his eighth home run of the season. Pat Neshek struck out the side in the seventh, preserving the tie, and Philadelphia had a golden opportunity in the eighth when Jacob Barnes issued one-out walks to pinch hitter Brock Stassi and Daniel Nava but came up empty when Freddy Galvis lined out to the second baseman Villar, who doubled Stassi off second to end the inning.  You're supposed to freeze on a line drive,  Mackanin said.  He didn't freeze. You don't get doubled up there.  Those little things don't show up when you get 12 hits and score runs day in and day out but when you don't score a lot of runs, those things look bigger than they really are.  It would prove a costly mistake as Travis Shaw sent Jaquin Benoit's second pitch of the eighth over the wall in center for his 20th home run of the season, putting the Brewers ahead.  That's a big spot, for sure,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  Jacob got that line drive to get out of it. It was a tight game and the back of their bullpen has been pretty effective.  I know they've struggled as a team, but the back of their bullpen is effective. Neshek had a great inning. He was tough. Benoit is a veteran that's been doing it really well for a long time. Travis is locked in. Consistent is the right word for it, that's for sure.  Philadelphia had one more chance in the ninth, getting a two-out double from Herrera, but Corey Knebel struck out Cameron Rupp to end it and notch his 16th save of the year. NOTES: LF Ryan Braun was in the lineup again, but Brewers manager Craig Counsell said the veteran is day to day for the remainder of the season thanks to a nagging injury to his left calf that left him on the disabled list for nearly a month. ... Phillies OF Aaron Altherr was unavailable suffering a mild strain of his right ankle a day earlier. Manager Pete Mackanin was optimistic that Altherr, batting .288 this season, would only need a couple days to recover. ... The Phillies expect to get INF Cesar Hernandez back from a minor league rehab assignment next week when they travel to Miami. RHP Vince Velasquez, out since May 31 with a strained flexor in his right elbow, will likely be activated from the disabled list and start the series opener Monday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED7G5WIGC1"}
