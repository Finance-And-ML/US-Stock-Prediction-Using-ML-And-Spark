[{"content": "New York City Mayor       Bill de Blasio       declared war on rats, unveiling a $32 million initiative on Wednesday he said would sharply reduce the population of rodents that roam the city.Much of the plan is focused on limiting rats\u2019 food supply by using so-called smart trash cans in neighborhoods thought to have a high concentration of rodents.At $7,000 each, city officials said the trash cans are expensive but worth the investment.These initiatives come months after a Bronx man died from an infection caused by a rare disease spread by rat urine.\u201cI don\u2019t know any New Yorker who likes rats,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter what community you\u2019re in, everybody wants to get rid of rats.\u201dCity officials said they planned to reduce the rat population by 70%. They said it was impossible to know how many rats live in New York City but that they could measure their progress based on calls to 311, the city\u2019s public, nonemergency service line, and signs of active rats, such as droppings and gnawing marks.Officials also intend to use dry ice to kill some rats, putting the ice into burrows where the rodents live. They said the technique had been used successfully in the city before.The plan targets areas Mr. de Blasio said have the biggest rat problems in the city: the Lower East Side, Chinatown, the East Village, the Bronx\u2019s Grand Concourse area and the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods in Brooklyn.At a news conference at Chinatown, Mr. de Blasio said that while he holds a certain admiration for \u201cPizza Rat,\u201d a subway rodent caught on video carrying a full slice of pizza in 2015, rats have been a problem \u201cfor way too long.\u201dThe $7,000 metallic trash cans are solar-powered, compress refuse and can be opened only by pulling a handle or stepping on a pedal.The city plans to replace 1,800 traditional open-wire trash baskets with either the smart bins or with other closed metallic bins that also do not allow rats inside.The effort will also include renovation of 70 dirt-floor basements found in 111 public housing facilities in the key neighborhoods in order to drive rats out. Mr. de Blasio said dirt-floor basements make it easier for rodents to scurry into buildings.Other actions to reduce the rat population include raising fines for illegal trash dumping and more frequent trash pickups.The initiatives won\u2019t replace current rat and pest control extermination programs other city institutions, including the departments of sanitation and health, are already conducting.\u201cThis plan today is about going at the root causes\u2014stopping rats from having a place to live, stopping them from having the food that they want to eat,\u201d he said.\u2014Mara Gay contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'New Plan Hatched To Rid City Of Rats.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 23:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rats-new-york-mayor-unveils-measures-to-kill-rodents-1499900817", "news_title": "Rats!

He was 72.Mr. Blazer\u2019s death was announced Wednesday by his lawyers,       Eric Corngold       and       Mary Mulligan.       At a November 2013 court hearing during which Mr. Blazer entered guilty pleas to federal charges, Mr. Blazer said he had rectal cancer, diabetes and coronary artery disease.With huge girth, charm, wit and a pet parrot, Mr. Blazer cut a large figure as he made deals from an office and apartment in Trump Tower. The No. 2 official in the governing body of soccer\u2019s North and Central American and Caribbean region from 1990 to 2011 and a member of FIFA\u2019s ruling executive council from 1997 to 2013, Mr. Blazer was central to the rise of the sport in the U.S.Mr. Blazer accused Concacaf President       Jack Warner       and fellow executive committee member       Mohamed bin Hammam       of offering $40,000 bribes to voters in the 2011 FIFA presidential election. Mr. bin Hammam had been the lone challenger to Mr. Blatter, who was elected unopposed to a fourth term after Messrs. Warner and bin Hammam were suspended. Mr. Blatter was elected to a fifth term in 2015 before resigning.But it turned out Mr. Blazer\u2019s conduct was as corrupt as the actions of the people he accused. U.S. government agents threatened him with arrest, and he became a government informant.\u201cChuck hoped to help bring transparency, accountability and fair play to Concacaf, FIFA and soccer as a whole,\u201d his lawyers said in a statement. \u201cChuck also accepted responsibility for his own conduct by pleading guilty and owning up to his mistakes. Chuck felt profound sorrow and regret for his actions.\u201dMr. Blazer pleaded guilty in November 2013 to one count each of racketeering conspiracy, wire-fraud conspiracy, money-laundering conspiracy and willful failure to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, and to six counts of tax evasion. He forfeited $1.9 million and agreed to forfeit a second amount, but he was never jailed as the investigation continued. He was banned from soccer for life by FIFA on July 9, 2015.\u201cHis misconduct, for which he accepted full responsibility, should not obscure Chuck\u2019s positive impact on international soccer,\u201d his lawyers said. \u201cWith Chuck\u2019s guidance and leadership, Concacaf transformed itself from impoverished to profitable.\u201dAn NYU business graduate, Mr. Blazer started in soccer coaching his son\u2019s club in New Rochelle and joined boards of local and regional soccer organizations. He became the U.S. Soccer Federation\u2019s executive vice president from 1984 to 1986, then became chair of the national teams committee. In 1988, he and       Clive Toye,        who had brought Pele to the U.S. as the general manager of the New York Cosmos, formed the American Soccer League.Mr. Blazer urged Mr. Warner to run for president of Concacaf in 1990, and when the Trinidadian won, he made Mr. Blazer the general secretary, who runs the organization\u2019s staff.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-07-12 23:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chuck-blazer-who-touched-off-soccer-scandal-dead-at-72-1499916625", "news_title": "Chuck Blazer, Who Touched Off Soccer Scandal, Dead at 72", "keywords": "american soccer league,chuck blazer,fifa,u.s. soccer,Chuck Blazer,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,fraud,soccer,sports,sports organizations,tax fraud,whistleblowers,obituaries,routine general news"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014J&F Investimentos SA, which controls Brazilian meatpacking giant             JBS SA,        JBSAY -0.77%       has agreed to sell its majority stake in flip-flop maker             Alpargatas SA        ALPA4 0.35%       to investment firm Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda. and other investors for 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion), the footwear producer said Wednesday.Alpargatas, which makes the Havaianas brand of sandals, said in a regulatory filing that the other buyers are a unit of lender             Ita\u00fa Unibanco Holding SA        ITUB -0.85%       and a company called Brasil Warrant Administra\u00e7\u00e3o de Bens e Empresas SA.The purchase is subject to approval by the relevant authorities, Alpargatas said.Write to Jeffrey T.

Mexican-Spanish concern Iberoamericana de Hidrocarburos, in a consortium with Mexico\u2019s Servicios PJP4 de M\u00e9xico, won one. Three blocks received no bids.At a subsequent auction, the government awarded all 14 oil and gas blocks in northern and southern Mexico. Among the winners were Carso Oil and Gas, controlled by businessman       Carlos Slim      ; Newpek, the energy unit of conglomerate Alfa SAB; and China\u2019s Shandong Kerui Oilfield Service Group along with Mexican partners.The 21 areas brought to 70 the number of contracts awarded since Mexico changed its energy laws in 2014 to allow for private and foreign investment in exploration and production. The blocks include onshore, shallow-water and deep-water areas, with 66 companies participating, half of them Mexican.Oil regulator Juan Carlos Zepeda said the projects won Wednesday are expected to generate investment in excess of $2 billion. Production is expected to begin in 2019 and reach a peak of 378 million cubic feet a day of gas and 79,000 barrels a day of oil in 2025, he added at a press conference.Wednesday\u2019s gas auction was seen as a test of interest in gas at a time when Mexico is importing close to 60% of its natural-gas needs, most of that from the U.S.The prospect of finding liquids is probably a priority for Sun God and Jaguar, said       Pablo Medina,        an upstream analyst for Latin America at Wood Mackenzie.\u201cThe economics of dry gas in Mexico are not that attractive because you have the alternative to import some of the cheapest gas in the world into the country, and the infrastructure is there, so you\u2019re competing against a very tough market,\u201d he said.State oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos\u2019 natural-gas production has fallen along with its crude oil output, currently averaging 5.3 billion cubic feet a day, part of which the state company absorbs in its own processes. Imports in the first four months of the year were 4.6 billion cubic feet a day, nearly five times what they were a decade ago.\u201cNatural gas is a priority for the country and for Pemex, for industrialization purposes, but also for profitability purposes,\u201d Pemex Chief Executive       Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya       said this week in an interview in Houston.But he welcomes the gas imports from the U.S. \u201cIt also forces us to produce gas competitively and efficiently. When I say us, it\u2019s Mexico and Pemex. We\u2019re working on these things,\u201d he added.Low gas prices benefit end users, said       Santiago Garc\u00eda,        chief executive of Houston-based Santa Fe Gas, an upstart gas marketing company which began selling gas directly to Mexican customers this month. \u201cI think that has been a major barrier for natural-gas production in Mexico to be flourishing,\u201dMr. Garc\u00eda predicts gas imports will remain high, but said it is easier to get the fuel to northern and central Mexico than it is to the south of the country. \u201cIf we see production start increasing, at least it will be a step in the right direction,\u201d he added.\u2014Bradley Olson in Houston contributed to this article.Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 21:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-awards-seven-of-10-blocks-in-auction-of-natural-gas-fields-1499880507", "news_title": "Mexico Awards 21 Oil and Gas Blocks in Two Auctions", "keywords": "auction,gas,oil,corporate,industrial news,corporate awards,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Investigators are re-examining conversations detected by U.S. intelligence agencies in spring 2015 that captured Russian government officials discussing associates of Donald Trump, according to current and former U.S. officials, a move prompted by revelations that the president\u2019s eldest son met with a Russian lawyer last year.In some cases, the Russians in the overheard conversations talked about meetings held outside the U.S. involving Russian government officials and Trump business associates or advisers, these people said.Russian officials are routinely monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies, and it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for them to discuss people who have business interests in Russia.Mr. Trump held the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, was a globally recognized celebrity and sold properties to Russians. The intelligence gathering wasn\u2019t aimed at Mr. Trump or people in his circle, and it isn\u2019t clear which Trump advisers or associates the Russians referred to, or whether they had any connection to his presidential aspirations.The 2015 conversations were detected several months before Mr. Trump declared his candidacy for the White House. The conversations have been in investigators\u2019 possession for some time, but officials said the       Donald Trump Jr.       news this week prompted them to look at them again.In 2015, intelligence agencies weren\u2019t sure what to make of the surveillance reports, which they viewed as vague and inconclusive, the current and former officials said. But the volume of the mentions of Trump associates by the Russians did have officials asking each other, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d one former official said.A lawyer for Mr. Trump didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the 2015 conversations.Now, in light of the release of emails Tuesday by the president\u2019s eldest son, describing a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer, investigators are going back to those early reports. They are seeking new leads as they probe whether the Trump campaign colluded in what several U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Russian government-sponsored effort to meddle in the election to benefit Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and called the probes a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dThe meeting Donald Jr. arranged in June 2016\u2014as his father was on the verge of clinching the Republican nomination\u2014involved a Kremlin-connected lawyer to discuss allegedly incriminating information about Democratic candidate       Hillary Clinton       obtained by the Russian government.Donald Jr. and the Russian lawyer said no information about Mrs. Clinton was disclosed in the meeting. But the emails offer the first clear public evidence that senior officials in Mr. Trump\u2019s camp were open to offers of assistance from Russia in his quest for the presidency.In the spring of 2016, U.S. intelligence officials\u2019 suspicions about Russian meddling in the election grew after their counterparts in Europe warned that Russian money might be flowing into the presidential election, according to officials with knowledge of the warning. It remains unknown if or whether those funds were funneled to a particular campaign or to others to spend it on behalf of candidates.In June 2016, officials at the Democratic National Committee revealed that their computer networks had been penetrated by hackers, whom the FBI and intelligence agencies later determined worked for the Russian intelligence services. Emails taken in those incursions subsequently were published by WikiLeaks, and in October, the site released emails that had been stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman,       John Podesta.At that point, intelligence officials had little doubt that the Russian government was attempting to interfere in the election. By the end of 2016, they concluded publicly that the Russian hacking campaign was meant to undermine Mrs. Clinton and help Mr. Trump.Now, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and several congressional committees are probing Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia over the years, as is special counsel Robert Mueller.Write to Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Surveillance From 2015 Revisited.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 21:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-officials-overheard-discussing-trump-associates-before-campaign-began-1499890354", "news_title": "Russian Officials Overheard Discussing Trump Associates Before Campaign Began", "keywords": "2016 election,donald trump,election hacking,putin,russia,russian hacking,trump,trump email,Donald Trump,Donald Trump Jr.,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,espionage"}, {"content": "Americans had almost $1.44 trillion in student loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter this year, a nearly $100 billion increase from a year earlier.

Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs committee, introduced a bill on Wednesday with Democratic leadership that an aide said duplicates the text of a measure that passed with a bipartisan 98-2 vote in the Senate.The Senate bill has stalled in the House of Representatives over procedural issues. The legislation would impose new sanctions and make it tougher for       Mr. Trump       to lift sanctions on Russia by inserting a congressional review provision to prevent unilateral action by the White House.The Senate tried to resolve the procedural issue before the July 4 recess, but the fix it installed has drawn objections from some House Democrats, who say it strips power from the minority party in Congress.The White House is lobbying against the Senate measure after objecting to the congressional oversight provision, which the administration says could hamstring diplomacy and intrudes on President Donald Trump\u2019s executive power. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr. Trump supports the sanctions themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that having the president\u2019s party in a position to protect him from any oversight is good policy for our country and, in fact, could be dangerous to our country,\u201d House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said Wednesday.Failure to move the bill forward could make it appear that Republicans aren\u2019t willing to punish Moscow for its interference in the election, as the U.S. intelligence community has found it did.Republican reluctance could also become more politically risky since emails released by Donald Trump Jr. showed a Russian attorney wanting to discuss allegedly incriminating information about       Hillary Clinton,        as part of what he was told was a Russian government\u2019s effort to help his father\u2019s candidacy.The younger Mr. Trump has said the Russian attorney didn\u2019t provide any valuable information for his father\u2019s campaign.\u201cI think the events of the last week only underscore the urgency of getting it passed,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (R., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee that is examining Russian meddling in the election. \u201cI think we need to send a very clear message to Moscow that we are going to maintain these sanctions.\u201dHouse Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) has said he is supportive of Russian sanctions but hasn\u2019t indicated how he will manage the Democratic-sponsored bill.Democratic lawmakers haven\u2019t shared the text of their bill with Republican leadership, according to AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. She called the efforts \u201cgrandstanding and not a serious effort to resolve this issue and hold Russia accountable.\u201d\u201cThis new package effectively means that the Senate would have to consider it all over again, further delaying passing a sanctions package,\u201d she said.If unchanged, the bill would require the president to seek Congress\u2019s permission to relax the present set of sanctions against Russia. Without the legislation, the executive branch can decide to reverse the sanctions on its own.The oversight provision applies to existing sanctions the Obama administration imposed through executive order. Another portion of the bill would prohibit U.S. citizens and entities from exporting goods, nonfinancial services and technology in support of deep-water, Arctic offshore or shale-exploration projects involving Russian concerns. It also would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 20:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-push-house-bill-to-lock-in-sanctions-against-russia-1499897048", "news_title": "Democrats Push House Bill to Lock In Sanctions Against Russia", "keywords": "donald trump, donald trump jr., eliot engel, russian sanctions ,russia sanctions ,sanctions vote,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house"}, {"content": "The Indian Health Service\u2019s top official dodged frustrated lawmakers\u2019 questions about unsafe care at the federal agency and whether proposed budget cuts would worsen the situation during a tense Senate committee hearing Wednesday.Members of the Senate Indian Affairs and Senate Appropriations committees repeatedly cited two articles published last week in The Wall Street Journal on the agency, which provides health care to 2.2 million tribal members. The articles examined agency-run hospitals that failed to meet basic U.S. standards and employed doctors who are now accused of crimes, while the IHS\u2019s political leaders focused on other priorities.The Journal identified 11 patients who U.S. regulators asserted had died in connection with insufficient treatment by the agency.\u201cYou say that the goal here is to improve the patient experience,\u201d Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       (R., Alaska) told the newly appointed acting IHS director, Rear Adm.       Michael Weahkee.       \u201cWell, the experience is people are dying in these facilities.\u201dBefore reading aloud details of The Journal articles, she said: \u201cI was horrified. I was sickened. I was mad.\u201dAdm. Weahkee responded that he had visited the agency\u2019s Pine Ridge hospital, one of several troubled facilities examined in The Journal\u2019s reporting, shortly after his June appointment to the post. He said he \u201csaw a committed caring workforce that is working hard\u201d to address problems federal hospital regulators identified there.Ms. Murkowski repeatedly pushed Adm. Weahkee, an officer in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and a career IHS official, to acknowledge whether proposed budget cuts for next year would affect the agency\u2019s ability to resolve problems at its hospitals. Since 2015 U.S. regulators have sanctioned several IHS hospitals for dangerous care.President       Donald Trump\u2019s       budget would cut about $300 million in agency funding, including supplemental funding added to the 2017 budget by Congress earlier this year. That is a 6% cut from the $5.1 billion lawmakers appropriated for this year.Adm. Weahkee responded that the IHS had focused \u201ca lot of efforts\u201d on the hospitals identified in The Journal article, and said, \u201cWe appreciate the resources\u201d Congress had made available.Ms. Murkowski chided him for having \u201cnot directly answered the question.\u201d She said: \u201cI can\u2019t stand down knowing our system is failing so many of our Native people around the country.\u201dThe IHS directly runs 26 hospitals and provides funding for more that are run by tribes. Its facilities in the Dakotas and Nebraska have faced mounting scrutiny in recent years and were the focus of The Journal stories. However, tribes around the country are raising alarm about care at the agency\u2019s other facilities.On Thursday, the Navajo Nation will host a hearing in Tuba City, Ariz., on concerns about IHS facilities there. The Navajo Nation is the largest U.S. Indian reservation and makes up the IHS\u2019s largest service area.The pressure at Wednesday\u2019s Senate hearing came from both parties. Sen.       Jon Tester,        a Montana Democrat, repeatedly pressed Adm. Weahkee to acknowledge whether, after years serving as an official at the IHS, he was aware of the agency\u2019s challenges with maintaining facilities, recruiting staff and providing adequate care.Mr. Tester also pressed Adm. Weahkee to say whether budget cuts proposed in Mr. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget would reduce the agency\u2019s resources available to hire staff, but the admiral demurred, saying the agency\u2019s \u201cpriority has been to ensure we can continue to provide direct health services.\u201dThat appeared to agitate Mr. Tester, who said: \u201cAll I want is some damn answers. This is an unbelievable hearing.\u201dSeveral members in both parties also pressed Adm. Weahkee to provide data showing how a Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act had affected revenue at IHS hospitals, which can also bill federal health programs for services they provide. About a fifth of the agency\u2019s budget comes from such billing, and a Republican effort to repeal or replace that law could strip a portion of that.Adm. Weahkee said he didn\u2019t have any information available, but pledged to provide it later.Sen.       Tom Udall       (D., N.M.) asked whether IHS had discussed the possible impact that action on the health law could have on the agency with the White House or Congressional Republican leadership. Adm. Weahkee responded that IHS hadn\u2019t been consulted on proposed plans.Adm. Weahkee\u2019s posting is temporary.

But he swiftly fell out of the public eye and died in 2002.\u201cMy brother should be more than a footnote,\u201d said James Smith. \u201cI could almost put my fist in his ribs from where he received that toe of the boot from one of the cops.\u201dJohn William Smith, or J.W. to his family, was a 40-year-old jazz trumpet player and cab driver in Newark when he was pulled over on 15th Avenue in the Central Ward neighborhood on July 12, 1967.After onlookers saw police dragging him, bloodied, into a nearby precinct, a false rumor began circulating that he had been beaten to death. Violence and looting broke out shortly afterward.Lawrence Hamm, founder and head of the People\u2019s Organization for Progress, a Newark-based advocacy group, was 12-years-old at the time and watched the fighting unfold from his second-story porch.\u201cJohn Smith comes to symbolize how black people have been brutalized,\u201d       Mr. Hamm       said. \u201cHe is a symbol of oppressed people, but he is also a symbol of resistance.\u201dHis brother, James Smith, grew up in segregated North Carolina and was 11 years old at the time of the riots. After he was contacted by a reporter, he decided to attend Wednesday\u2019s memorial march in Newark, which commemorated the uprising and its victims.James Smith brought his brother\u2019s obituary in his backpack and carried a trumpet because he planned to later head to rehearsal in Manhattan. He spotted a marcher with a poster that displayed the Time magazine cover that featured       J.W. Smith.       \u201cI don\u2019t know what he would have thought of all this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he would have liked it.\u201dJ.W. Smith was the eldest of seven children, and a 28-year gap separated him from James, the youngest of the siblings. He served with the U.S. Army during World War II and the Korean War before moving north to pursue a career in jazz in New York and New Jersey.James Smith said he remembered his brother visiting the family home in Salisbury, N.C., dressed in zoot suits and with an Afro-hair style. \u201cHe was always sharp...and, oh my god, the ladies just be going crazy, man,\u201d he said.J.W. Smith would bring his trumpet during his visits, and hearing him play sparked James Smith\u2019s passion for jazz.Years later, it was James who moved north, settling in Brooklyn, and making a career music playing with the likes of two-time Grammy Award-winning reggae band Burning Spear and Big Band-era style Harlem Renaissance Orchestra.The brothers occasionally discussed J.W. Smith\u2019s beating by the police, which James Smith said left his sibling disillusioned with law enforcement and the judicial system. \u201cIt shook him up in the head. It was a raw deal and he became bitter,\u201d he said.J.W. Smith moved back to North Carolina shortly after the riots and continued his jazz career, while performing odd jobs. \u201cIt was kind of difficult because white folks down there were afraid. Everybody knew his story,\u201d James Smith said.After suffering from dementia, J.W. Smith died in 2002 at age 75. He was survived by several other siblings, as well as a daughter, who died, and a grandson, who lives in Brooklyn.

After the dictatorship ended in 1985, he ran for president three times, unsuccessfully.In 2002, after trading his       Che Guevara       T-shirts, wayward hair and radical leftist message for suits and a more moderate message, Mr. da Silva finally won the presidency.\u201cWith me being president,\u201d he said in an interview early in his first term, \u201cthe history of Brazil begins to change because someone from the humble people, the lower classes, has risen to the top.\u201dHis government implemented social programs while expanding water and sewage networks.

Mr. da Silva denied any knowledge of the scheme and wasn\u2019t charged.It was only more recently, with prosecutors energetically uncovering wide-scale corruption, that Mr. da Silva became entangled with the law. He was accused of being the brains behind a vast corruption scheme that led to charges against him in five separate cases.One of them resulted in Wednesday\u2019s announcement that he had been convicted and is being sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail.Mr. da Silva has denied all allegations against him, and accuses prosecutors of carrying out a witch hunt.The scandal has left Mr. da Silva \u201ca tarnished figure,\u201d said       Paulo Sotero,        a Brazil scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad story,\u201d he said. \u201cLula probably betrayed himself, his own cause.

But any bipartisan push faces stiff challenges, notably from some Republicans who view any tweaking of the ACA has an abdication of the party\u2019s seven-year pledge to uproot it.While Democrats are determined to protect their party\u2019s signature health-care achievement, many Democratic lawmakers say they recognize that the law\u2019s marketplaces have failed to entice a sufficient number of young, healthy customers, leading to rising premiums and deductibles. And some Republicans say that should their party\u2019s effort fail, the markets would need to be bolstered.\u201cAnyone who has looked at the state of the individual and small-group [insurance] markets across this country knows that doing nothing is not an option,\u201d said Sen.

Rand Paul,        (R., Ky.) said of the Democrats.A group of House Democrats Wednesday offered a proposal they pitched as the basis for bipartisan negotiations. It would create a $15 billion annual reinsurance program and authorize permanent funding for the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies, ideas similar to those being discussed in the Senate talks.The plan also includes policy ideas floated by Republicans, such as broadening the use of health savings accounts and automatically enrolling uninsured Americans in catastrophic health plans.\u201cWe think Democrats need to be proactive with ideas,\u201d said Rep.

It\u2019s too early to draw conclusions about what caused the transport plane to suffer a catastrophic failure on its flight from North Carolina to California, reportedly at cruising altitude. But such tragedies are becoming more routine and deserve some attention.It is unknown what led to the crash, and it could be anything from equipment malfunction to human error. The plane appears to have been loaded with munitions that might have caused or contributed to the crash. The names of the service members on board still weren\u2019t public by our deadline.One reality is that Marine aviation has recently experienced a rise in \u201cClass A Mishaps,\u201d which are incidents that carry a body count or result in more than $2 million in aircraft damage. House Armed Services Chairman       Mac Thornberry       pointed out at a hearing last year that the rate for the Marine aviation community has \u201cbeen increasing significantly.\u201dOver the past decade the rate has hovered around 2.15 events for every 100,000 hours flown, Mr. Thornberry noted. But in 2015 the figure increased to 3.29 and 3.39 in 2016; that year 12 Marines died when two helicopters crashed into each other off the coast of Hawaii. The rate so far for 2017 is 4.47, including Monday\u2019s crash.One hypothesis that deserves to be examined is a combination of old equipment and the fact that pilot hours have been reduced in recent years because of funding cuts.

Earlier this year Navy officials testified to Congress about a number of pilot \u201cphysiological episodes\u201d\u2014e.g. oxygen deprivation\u2014that compound the risk of human error.None of this will come as news to Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis,        who has made addressing readiness problems a central part of his agenda.

It marked the first time under the 1993 Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act that the U.S. secretary has ruled against the commission, which regulates fishing in state waters.New Jersey environmental officials, who were informed of Mr. Ross\u2019s decision late\u00a0Tuesday, said it was good news for the state\u2019s $1.5 billion recreational fishing industry.\u201cNew Jersey is fully committed to employing science and public education to conserve a species that is critical to the fishing culture and economy of the state,\u201d said       Bob Martin,        commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, in a statement.The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission had argued that the stricter quota was necessary to prevent overfishing of summer flounder, a flat fish also known as fluke. Commissioners voted in February to approve a 30% quota reduction, which would restrict New Jersey fishermen to keeping only fish that are 19 inches or longer in most parts of the state.The commission\u2019s decision sparked protests from New Jersey\u2019s environmental officials and congressional delegation. The state opened its summer flounder season in late May with rules that allowed fishermen to keep fish that were 18 inches or longer, prompting the interstate commission to declare New Jersey out of compliance.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the decision,\u201d said       Tina Berger,        a spokeswoman for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been down this road before, so we don\u2019t know what implications may occur.\u201dThere have been 19 other instances in the past 24 years where states have been found out of compliance, and the U.S. secretary has always sided with the commission.New Jersey\u2019s summer flounder season runs through\u00a0Sept. 5.Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Backs New Jersey On Curbs For Anglers.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 19:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-wins-in-effort-to-ease-summer-flounder-quotas-1499885114", "news_title": "New Jersey Wins in Effort to Ease Summer Flounder Quotas ", "keywords": "atlantic states marine fisheries commission,new jersey,new jersey environmental officials,summer flounder fishing,Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission,Wilbur Ross,political,general news,natural environment,agriculture,fishing"}, {"content": "President       Trump       still hasn\u2019t dismissed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director       Richard Cordray       despite several removable offenses. But Mr. Cordray is all but begging to be fired with his mandatory arbitration ban that brazenly flouts the law.The CFPB on Monday finalized a rule forbidding class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. Dodd-Frank prohibited mandatory arbitration in most residential mortgage contracts and directed the bureau to study their use in other consumer financial services. Congress allowed the CFPB to \u201cprohibit or impose conditions or limitations on the use of\u201d arbitration if it finds doing so \u201cis in the public interest and for the protection of consumers.\u201dIn 2015 the CFPB released a 148-page study that is more political than scientific. Like the agency\u2019s enforcement actions, the study engages in misdirection and obfuscation. The bureau avoids apples-to-apples comparisons and has stonewalled requests by the House Financial Services Committee for its raw data. But the evidence still suggests that consumers derive greater benefits from arbitration than they do from class-action lawsuits.Of the 562 class actions the CFPB studied, none went to trial. Most were dismissed by a judge, withdrawn by the plaintiffs or settled out of class. The putative class victims received benefits in fewer than 20% of cases, and the average cash recovery was\u2014wait for it\u2014$32. Lawyers took an average 24% cut of the cash payments (about $424 million) in cases that settled.Meanwhile, consumers were awarded relief in 32 of the 158 arbitration disputes the bureau examined, and rewards averaged $5,389\u2014or about 57% of every dollar claimed. Consumers who used arbitration received relief on average in two months after filing claims. Class-action members had to wait two years.Yet the CFPB has determined that class actions are necessary to protect consumers, even though state Attorneys General and federal agencies can do the job. The rule would apply to nearly all purveyors of consumer financial services save government agencies. That could include colleges that make loans to students.Mr. Cordray says that \u201cmandatory arbitration clauses force consumers either to give up or to go it alone.\u201d But consumers can usually arbitrate disputes by phone or online without an attorney. Arbitration industry rules require that companies pay almost all of the filing, administrative and arbitrator costs. Individual costs are capped at between $200 and $250, which most companies cover.The main beneficiaries of the rule will be trial attorneys who use the threat of class actions to extract fat settlements. Yet most disputes can\u2019t be resolved on a class basis, and companies will likely stop using arbitration if they have to spend millions to defend class actions.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this week raised concerns that the resulting increased cost of litigation could adversely affect the safety and soundness of the federal banking system. Community and mid-sized banks would have to hold greater reserves because of future expected litigation expenses, which could reduce lending.Mr. Cordray has clearly violated Congress\u2019s directions to the bureau and the Administrative Procedure Act by promulgating a rule that contradicts the bureau\u2019s own administrative record. Republicans could repeal the rule during the next 60 legislative days with a simple majority using the Congressional Review Act, though Mr. Cordray is probably hoping that they will be too distracted by health care, presidential nominations and tax reform.Or perhaps he\u2019s eager to launch his campaign for Governor in Ohio. President Trump could have blocked the class-action rule had he fired Mr. Cordray upon taking office. But he can still dismiss him now for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\u201d and his conduct surely constitutes all of the above.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party was routed in Tokyo\u2019s local elections this month, winning a mere 23 out of 127 seats on the municipal assembly, down from 57. But the bad news for Mr. Abe could be good news for Japan if it forces him to refocus his attention on the economy.Accusations that Mr. Abe helped a friend win approval to open a veterinary school in a special economic zone have damaged the Prime Minister\u2019s reputation. That came on top of a scandal involving an ultranationalist group with ties to his wife that bought land from the government at a fraction of the market price.Mr. Abe also lost support after he announced in May his intention to amend the constitution to insert a clause explicitly allowing the Self-Defense Forces to exist. While this change is unobjectionable to most Japanese, it is widely seen as unnecessary because the pacifist constitution imposed on Japan after World War II is already interpreted as allowing it to practice collective defense with its allies.Mr. Abe\u2019s critics fear he\u2019ll use the amendment process to make more controversial changes to the constitution. His administration pushed an antiterrorism law through the legislature last month that is so broadly worded there are fears the authorities could use it to target opposition parties and curtail civil liberties. The LDP bypassed a committee vote to avoid opposition scrutiny of the bill.The Prime Minister will now have to re-evaluate his agenda in light of an approval rating that has halved to around 33% from 66% in a matter of months. While the opposition remains weak, he could face a leadership challenge within the LDP. Pursuing an unpopular constitutional revision would likely hasten his demise.Mr. Abe still retains support for his efforts to rejuvenate the economy, even as he has failed to follow through on promises of reform. The Bank of Japan has failed to deliver on its 2% inflation target, and real wages and consumer spending continue to stagnate. The bright spot is the boost exporters and tourism have received from the weak yen, but this has come at the expense of household spending power.If Mr. Abe tackled reform of Japan\u2019s labor laws instead of constitutional revision, it would give an immediate boost to business confidence. One reason companies aren\u2019t offering wage increases despite low unemployment is that they carry excess employees on their payrolls due to restrictive rules on layoffs. This hidden unemployment is a huge drag on productivity. Allowing companies to hire and fire more freely would be initially unpopular, but it would deliver the economic payoff that Mr. Abe needs to salvage his premiership.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 19:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-course-correction-for-japan-1499901136", "news_title": "A Course Correction for Japan", "keywords": " abenomics, bank of japan, economic growth, economic reforms, gdp, liberal democratic party,shinzo abe,Shinzo Abe,economic performance,indicators,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Theresa May\u2019s       government on Tuesday unveiled a major report on work and employee protection in the modern economy. Too bad it delivers the same version of Labour-lite policy that voters rejected last month.Named for       Tony Blair       advisor       Matthew Taylor,        the Taylor Review clarifies how Britain\u2019s labor market is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014changing. Contrary to complaints from politicians and pundits on the left, there\u2019s no British crisis of full-time employment. The percentage of working people with full-time contracts offering benefits such as vacation and sick pay has fallen only slightly since 2008\u2014to 63% from its average of around 65% in the decade before the financial panic.Meanwhile, at its high after the 2008 crisis, part-time work accounted for 28% of employment but is starting to fall again. The rise in part-time employment helps explain why there wasn\u2019t a greater decline in overall employment during and after the recession, as Britain\u2019s relatively flexible labor laws allowed employers to reduce employee hours instead of laying them off. That\u2019s a lesson for the rest of Europe.The Taylor Review does identify some problems. A large number of part-time workers say they would like to work more hours if they could, although some 70% of part-timers say they wouldn\u2019t want to go full-time. Inflation-adjusted pay also hasn\u2019t returned to its pre-2008 level despite years of nominal weekly pay growth. This will continue as consumer-price inflation is expected to hit 3% this year, and the strain on household finances helps explain Mrs. May\u2019s election fiasco last month.So it\u2019s puzzling that everyone, including Mrs. May in her speech unveiling the report, is focused on other matters. The review\u2019s main proposals concern applying different kinds of employment contracts and minimum-wage increases to \u201cgig economy\u201d workers such as Uber drivers. It also suggests increasing social-insurance taxes on the self-employed so they don\u2019t deprive the government of \u00a35.1 billion ($6.57 billion) in revenue each year.This is self-defeating. The Taylor Review hints, without openly admitting, that economic growth is the best guarantor of worker rights and paychecks. Healthy growth and a tight labor market have allowed some part-time workers, such as those at             McDonald\u2019s                   restaurants, to demand firmer contracts and more hours, while leaving other workers at the same company with the flexibility to opt out.The real lesson is that Britain should avoid the labor trap into which so many other European economies have fallen, in which high taxes on labor coupled with onerous legal obligations stifle entrepreneurship and job creation.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 19:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-britain-to-work-1499901060", "news_title": "Putting Britain to Work", "keywords": "britain, conservative party, labor reforms, labour party, matthew taylor, taylor review, theresa may,Theresa May,economic performance,indicators,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014Former President       Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,        the front-runner for next year\u2019s presidential election, was sentenced to almost a decade in prison for corruption, dealing a heavy blow to his leftist Workers\u2019 Party and its chances of regaining control over Latin America\u2019s biggest country.Sergio Moro, the crusading judge at the head of Brazil\u2019s vast Car Wash graft investigation, found Mr. da Silva guilty on Wednesday of corruption and money laundering, sentencing the 71-year-old to 9\u00bd years in prison, according to a court document.\u201cThe responsibility of a President of the Republic is enormous and, consequently, so is the guilt when he commits crimes,\u201d Mr. Moro wrote in his verdict.Under Brazilian law, Mr. da Silva can stay out of jail while he appeals the ruling. If he loses the appeal\u2014a process that could take up to a year\u2014he would be expected to go to prison and be barred from public office.The conviction throws Brazilian politics into further turmoil, coming less than a year after the impeachment of former President       Dilma Rousseff,        who succeeded her mentor Mr. da Silva, for covering up the country\u2019s growing budget gap. The country\u2019s current president,       Michel Temer,        has been charged with corruption, too, and could also be ousted in coming weeks. The sprawling corruption probe known as Car Wash has also put scores of other leading politicians and captains of industry behind bars, and delayed the country\u2019s economic recovery.The ruling is a remarkable turn of events for a man whom former President       Barack Obama       in 2009 hailed as \u201cthe most popular politician on earth.\u201d Mr. da Silva, who rose from a union activist to president on his fourth try, raised Brazil\u2019s profile both economically and diplomatically. His government secured both the Olympics and soccer\u2019s World Cup, and embarked on a state lending spree that helped Brazil\u2019s largest companies take on their global rivals.\u2018He was a symbol of hope for an entire country, and now we don\u2019t have anyone that even comes close to offering that to the Brazilian people.\u2019But a grinding recession\u2014and then corruption allegations that tarnished him and much of his party\u2014have throttled his legacy. Many of the companies he championed in office, such as construction firm Odebrecht, have admitted they paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to secure contracts in Brazil and elsewhere.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible outcome for his legacy and not just for Lula the person,\u201d said Andrea Murta, a deputy director at the Atlantic Council, a think tank. \u201cHe was a symbol of hope for an entire country, and now we don\u2019t have anyone that even comes close to offering that to the Brazilian people.\u201dMr. Moro ruled that Mr. da Silva received about $700,000 from construction group OAS and laundered money by trying to hide his ownership of a luxury beachside apartment in S\u00e3o Paulo that the company built. Prosecutors had accused the former president of accepting the apartment and its costly renovation in exchange for securing contracts with state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, as part of the Car Wash scheme.The former president has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a political witch-hunt. His lawyers rejected the verdict in a televised news conference late Wednesday. \u201cThe sentence is merely speculative...it disregards the evidence of his innocence,\u201d said defense lawyer Cristiano Zanin.Wednesday\u2019s ruling, the highest-profile sentence yet in the Car Wash case, is the first verdict to emerge from five graft-related charges against Mr. da Silva.Brazil\u2019s currency and stocks extended their gains after the sentence as traders bet the move would make it harder for Mr. da Silva and his Workers\u2019 Party to return to power. The real was up 1.4% late Wednesday and Brazil\u2019s benchmark stock index closed up 1.6%.\u201cThe market\u2019s view is that a candidacy by ex-President Lula could put many uncertainties regarding economic and fiscal policy on the horizon,\u201d said Pedro Paulo Silveira, an economist at Nova Futura brokerage in S\u00e3o Paulo.A former metal worker, Mr. da Silva became Brazil\u2019s first working-class president in 2003. His social policies, coupled with a commodity boom during his eight years in office, are credited with lifting close to 30 million Brazilians out of poverty. Despite being accused by prosecutors of masterminding Brazil\u2019s multibillion-dollar bribery-and-kickback scheme, Mr. da Silva still ranks as the country\u2019s most popular politician.The Workers\u2019 Party has said it has no \u201cPlan B\u201d for winning in 2018 other than with its founder Mr. da Silva as candidate.\u2018Brazilian politics is truly like a game of chess\u2014there are so many moving parts right now.\u2019Constitutional experts fear Mr. da Silva\u2019s conviction, as well as the outstanding charges against him, could plunge next year\u2019s elections into a legal quagmire, presenting one of the biggest challenges yet for the country\u2019s courts. In one of several scenarios being explored in Brazil, it would even be technically possibly for Mr. da Silva to be elected president from inside jail.\u201cThis is really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Ricardo Cury, a professor of constitutional law at Brazil\u2019s FAAP University. \u201cBrazilian politics is truly like a game of chess\u2014there are so many moving parts right now.\u201dThe decision on Mr. da Silva\u2019s expected appeal would fall to a group of three judges in a higher regional court in the southern city of Porto Alegre. If the conviction is upheld, Mr. da Silva would be expected to go to jail, based on a Supreme Court ruling last year. Under the 2010 \u2018Clean Record\u2019 law, Mr. da Silva would also not be allowed to run for public office for the next eight years.The higher court has usually upheld Mr. Moro\u2019s decisions, but the magnitude of this case would makes its outcome more unpredictable, Mr. Cury said.The three judges would also be working to a tight deadline. Appeal decisions can take more than a year, but the court would be under intense pressure to reach a verdict before political parties announce their presidential candidates in the middle of next year ahead of elections in October.If the higher court turned down his appeal while he was running for president, Mr. da Silva could be sent to jail but remain a candidate, said Silvana Batini, a Brazilian prosecutor and professor in public law at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro. If he were to then win, he wouldn\u2019t automatically be freed from jail, she said, although he would struggle to officially assume the presidency.The Supreme Court may also intervene in various situations, adding even more uncertainty, Ms. Batini said.Since it began in 2014, Operation Car Wash has unveiled a nationwide bribery and kickback scheme in which companies paid billions of dollars of bribes in exchange for government contracts, cheap state loans and other favors. Politicians spent the cash on everything from jewelry and yachts to their election campaigns.Mr. da Silva, who presided over a China-led commodities boom that saw everything from the price of iron ore to soybeans soar, left office at the beginning 2011 with his approval ratings above 80%, the highest for any Brazilian president on record. President Michel Temer currently has an approval rating of 7%.\u201cFor many, Lula became the personification of Brazil\u2019s recent social gains,\u201d said Rafael Cortez, a political scientist at the consultancy Tend\u00eancias. With all of Brazil\u2019s major parties now implicated in Car Wash, it is also easier for voters to dismiss the importance of the corruption cases against him, he said.But Mr. da Silva may struggle to win the presidency even if he is able to run. Though he remains popular, the bloc of voters who strongly oppose him has also grown, making it hard for him to win a second-round runoff vote, said Ricardo Ribeiro, a political consultant from MCM Consultores.\u2014Jeffrey T.

With 20.8% of the market, according to Gartner, HP reclaimed the top position from Lenovo, whose share moved down to 19.9%.\u201cBecoming number one in market share was not an explicit objective,\u201d said       Ron Coughlin,        president of HP Inc.\u2019s global personal systems business. He said rather than try to gain market share at the expense of profit, HP has focused on the\u00a0profitable segments of the market, such as gaming and convertible laptops.Lenovo\u2019s shipments fell 8.4% in the quarter, suggesting the company is passing along higher component costs in the form of price increases, Gartner said in its report.\u00a0Last quarter, Lenovo and HP effectively tied in market share.A Lenovo spokesman\u00a0said its PC business continues to deliver healthy profits and stable market share.

AAPL 0.63%       will begin storing all cloud data for its China customers with a government-owned company\u2014a move that means relinquishing some control over its Chinese data.Apple will build its first Chinese data center in the southern province of Guizhou to house data for customers of its iCloud service. The data include photos, documents, messages, apps and videos uploaded by Apple users throughout the mainland, the company said Wednesday.The center will be operated by a company owned by the Guizhou provincial government, and whose chairman was a local government official until last year.Under the agreement, Apple will retain control over encryption keys at the data center. It wasn\u2019t clear if it would have access to any of the data itself, which would be overseen by its Guizhou partner.In addition, Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to transfer data from Chinese customers to the U.S., in compliance with China\u2019s new cross-border data guidelines that were also part of the latest cybersecurity rules.The announcement significantly expands a concession Apple made to appease Chinese authorities in 2014, when it started storing some data at facilities owned by state-owned             China Telecom                   to dispel security concerns. At the time, Apple said the move would improve performance for Chinese customers.Apple didn\u2019t clarify which data was being stored under that previous agreement, but under the new arrangement all of the iCloud data for its customers in China will be stored in the country. Currently, Apple pulls some iCloud data for Chinese users from servers in the U.S.Apple said it made the latest change to comply with China\u2019s new rules on data storage and cloud-services operation that went into effect June 1 as part of sweeping new regulations aimed at improving cybersecurity. It also said the new data center would improve speed and reliability for customers in China.The Silicon Valley company has been one of the technology industry\u2019s strongest advocates for fending off government incursions into user data. In a statement, Apple said it has \u201cstrong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems.\u201dThe latest move comes as Apple has been facing increasing regulatory headwinds in China. Last year, for example, its online book and movie services was shut down by authorities, who didn\u2019t give specific reasons for the closing.China also has ramped up pressure broadly on foreign cloud-service providers over the past year to comply with longstanding rules that require them to partner with local firms.             Microsoft Corp.        MSFT 0.76%       and             Amazon.com Inc.        AMZN 0.24%       already have local partners.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is now being enforced across the board,\u201d said       Chris DeAngelis,        Beijing-based general manager of consultancy Alliance Development Group. \u201cAny cloud-based company coming into China has to have a local operating partner.\u201dU.S. lawmakers sent a letter to China\u2019s ambassador in March, protesting the growing restrictions on foreign cloud-service providers.Under the arrangement announced Wednesday, Apple\u2019s China users will transition to a cloud-storage service that will carry the brands of both Apple and its Chinese partner, whose full name is Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data Industry Development Co.It is the first time iCloud has been co-branded. The transition will occur over the next several years while the $1 billion data project is developed.Apple has said its encryption can\u2019t be cracked, not even by Apple itself, making the company one of the strongest defenders of user privacy among major U.S. tech companies. Apple famously refused the FBI\u2019s demand that it unlock an iPhone owned by a gunman in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino.Governments world-wide regularly ask Apple for user data, which the company documents and publishes in an annual transparency report. In China last year, Apple said it had requests for more than 6,500 accounts and provided some data for 99% of those accounts. In the U.S., it had requests for roughly 13,000 accounts and provided data for about 80% of the accounts.Guizhou is one of China\u2019s poorest provinces, and Beijing has pushed economic development there to create more job opportunities. Chinese President       Xi Jinping       plans to participate in the Communist Party\u2019s leadership conclave this fall as a Guizhou delegate, despite having few ties to the province.With Beijing\u2019s backing, Guizhou is seeking to build a big-data industry, and has attracted investments from other major tech companies including             Qualcomm Inc.       and             Foxconn Technology                   Group.In a description of Guizhou on the Cloud, chairman       Fu Yu       wrote that the company aims to \u201cprovide a platform for aggregation and sharing of government data.\u201dMr. Fu, the former government official, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.

Agents hope Mr. Wray, known for a low-key leadership style, can help protect the Federal Bureau of Investigation from political crosswinds that show no signs of diminishing.Democrats and some Republicans have expressed concerns Mr. Trump may have been seeking to alter the trajectory of an investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election by dismissing Mr. Comey, and many of their questions were clearly aimed at assessing whether Mr. Wray would have the backbone to stand up to the White House if necessary.\u201cI believe to my core that there\u2019s only one right way to do this job, and that is with strict independence, by the book, playing it straight\u2026without fear, without favoritism and, certainly, without regard to any partisan political influence,\u201d Mr. Wray said.Pressed on how he would respond if the president issued an unlawful or unethical order, Mr. Wray said, \u201cFirst, I would try to talk him out of it. And if that failed, I would resign.\u201dAccompanied by his wife and children, Mr. Wray appeared to win bipartisan support as he provided measured\u200bopinions on topics ranging from terrorism and torture to encryption and the Russian probes. The Senate is expected to take up his nomination before its recess on Aug. 12, and confirmation appears likely.The smooth hearing was unusual for such a high-profile nominee during a political period that Mr. Wray conceded is among the most contentious in U.S. history. The hearing\u2019s lack of partisan rancor highlighted in part the fact that Mr. Trump, after a somewhat tumultuous search process, selected an experienced prosecutor to lead the FBI\u2014a more traditional choice than some other candidates. Mr. Wray was an assistant U.S. attorney and served in top Justice Department posts from 2001 through 2005, and since leaving the department he has been a top partner at the law firm King & Spalding in Atlanta.He also benefited from not being saddled with spearheading the politically charged investigation into Moscow\u2019s campaign meddling. That inquiry has now been taken over by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, himself a former FBI director, who was appointed to the post by Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       soon after Mr. Comey\u2019s firing.Mr. Wray worked with Mr. Mueller in various top Justice Department posts and said he would provide the special counsel whatever resources he needs for his probe. Speaking highly of Mr. Mueller\u2019s character, Mr. Wray said he didn\u2019t believe the special counsel was on a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d a term Mr. Trump has repeatedly used to characterize the Russia inquiry.Mr. Trump has said the probe into Russian interference was on his mind when he dismissed Mr. Comey, and the former FBI director testified before Congress that he felt the president was pressing him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser       Michael Flynn,        something Mr. Trump has denied.The hearing came as Washington continued to digest new revelations about the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia last year. The president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., released emails Tuesday that showed he attended a meeting last June to discuss allegedly incriminating information about Democrat       Hillary Clinton,        which was being offered as part of what was described as the Russian government\u2019s support for his father\u2019s candidacy. Donald Trump Jr. said no such information was produced at the meeting.Mr. Wray said he hadn\u2019t read news accounts of the emails, but he agreed with the suggestion of Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) that campaign officials should call the FBI if they are contacted by a foreign government seeking to hurt an opponent. \u201cAny threat or effort to interfere with our election, from any nation state or nonstate actor, is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know,\u201d he said.Sen.       Patrick Leahy       (D., Vt.) asked Mr. Wray whether anyone from the White House had pressed him for his loyalty. Mr. Comey testified last month before Congress that Mr. Trump had sought such a pledge from him, an assertion the president has dismissed.\u201cNo one asked me for any kind of loyalty oath,\u201d Mr. Wray said. \u201cI sure as heck didn\u2019t offer one.\u201dMr. Wray\u2019s associates say he keeps a lower profile than Mr. Comey, who wasn\u2019t shy about making strong statements at news conferences or congressional hearings.Mr. Graham asked Mr. Wray whether he would have held a news conference, as Mr. Comey did, announcing that he was recommending against prosecuting Mrs. Clinton for her email arrangement when she was secretary of state. Mr. Comey also criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s conduct during the press conference.Without directly answering, Mr. Wray said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a situation where, as FBI director, I would give a press conference about an uncharged individual.\u201dBut he also expressed support for Mr. Comey, who has engaged in a public back-and-forth with Mr. Trump. \u201cIn all my dealings with Jim Comey, he was a terrific lawyer, a dedicated public servant and a wonderful colleague,\u201d he said.Senators of both parties expressed support for his nomination and his answers on difficult topics.

Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was a waste of time and nothing came of it. He and two other senior campaign aides\u2014his brother-in-law       Jared Kushner       and       Paul Manafort,        then the campaign chairman\u2014met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York last June.Mr. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he didn\u2019t know of the meeting at the time and only learned about it in recent days. The president also defended his son: \u201cI think many people would have held that meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said.On Wednesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would be inviting Mr. Manafort to a hearing he is organizing on the issue of foreign lobbying and influence in the U.S. Mr. Grassley said Mr. Manafort\u2019s attendance at the meeting with the Russian lawyer would be a topic of conversation.Earlier in the day, the president, on Twitter, defended his son\u2019s actions, praising an interview he did with Fox News. \u201cHe was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad.\u201dIn his comments to CBN, the president suggested that Mr. Putin would have preferred that Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the Democratic nominee, win the 2016 election. Mr. Trump alleged her stances on military and energy policy would have been more helpful to Moscow.\u201cIf Hillary had won, our military would be decimated. Our energy would be much more expensive,\u201d Mr. Trump said, citing his plans to boost energy extraction and build up the military. \u201cThat\u2019s what Putin doesn\u2019t like about me.\u201dDuring the U.S. presidential campaign, Mr. Putin was seen as far warmer to Mr. Trump than to Mrs. Clinton, whom he sparred with during the Barack Obama administration. Following the election, Mrs. Clinton attributed the alleged cyberhacking by Russia to Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cpersonal beef against me.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s first six months have been dominated by investigations into possible collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russia during the election.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the race, and was trying to tilt the election to favor Mr. Trump.The Kremlin has denied meddling in the U.S. election, while Mr. Trump routinely dismisses the matter as a witch hunt and has suggested other countries besides Russia could have been behind the interference.Mr. Trump also insisted Wednesday on Twitter that the White House \u201cis functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.\u201dSome White House aides have said they fear the Russia email story will make it increasingly difficult to advance the president\u2019s policy agenda.\u201cThe president wants to be focused on his agenda,\u201d said spokeswoman       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       during a White House briefing. \u201cHe\u2019d much rather be talking about health care, tax reform, infrastructure, national security. That\u2019s his focus.\u201dMr. Trump has been quietly giving his son advice on managing the latest revelations involving his campaign\u2019s dealings with Russians. Ms. Sanders said the two men had spoken in recent days.On Tuesday, the younger Mr. Trump released a chain of emails that showed he had been told the Russian government possessed information damaging to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy and that an individual described as a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d wanted to pass the material to the Trump campaign.\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump wrote to the intermediary who arranged the meetings, a British publicist, \u201cI love it.\u201dDonald Trump Jr. said the meeting proved a waste of time and that the woman had no such information to provide.The Russian lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        told NBC News she didn\u2019t have incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton and had no connection to the Russian government.In his Fox News interview on Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr. said he \u201cprobably would have done things a little differently\u201d than agreeing to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya.\u2014Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Michael C.

Conservatives are signaling they would blame such a legislative collapse largely on       Mr. McConnell,        and Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he would not be pleased.\u201cI will be very angry about it and a lot of people will be very upset,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network Wednesday. \u201cMitch has to pull it off.\u201dMr. McConnell has struggled for weeks to win back the 10 Senate Republicans who have publicly opposed the bill, but so far none of the defectors has flipped.\u201cAs far as I can tell, the new bill is like the old bill, except it spends more money,\u201d said Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.). \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in here remotely resembling repeal [of the ACA]. I\u2019ve said for a long time now the bill needs to look more like repeal to get my vote.\u201dThe revised bill is expected to include $45 billion more to combat the opioid epidemic, allow people to use funds from their health-savings accounts to pay insurance premiums, and retain the ACA\u2019s two taxes on high-income households.Mr. McConnell responded Wednesday by warning Republicans about the perils of not coming together to pass a bill. \u201cIf we sit on our hands, families will continue to suffer,\u201d he said on the Senate floor.He also delivered a warning to conservatives who are threatening to oppose the bill in a procedural vote next week, saying that would prevent lawmakers from considering any amendments, including those conservatives support. \u201cIf the Senate is prevented from even proceeding to the bill, none of us will have an opportunity,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.Among Mr. McConnell\u2019s challenges is that conservative lawmakers have rallied around a contentious proposal from Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas) that would let insurers sell plans that don\u2019t comply with ACA regulations if they also sell policies that do.Mr. Cruz says that will lower premiums for many Americans, but centrists say it would raise them for the elderly and less-healthy population.Mr. Cruz said Wednesday he wouldn\u2019t vote to advance the health-care bill in the procedural vote if his measure isn\u2019t included in the underlying bill. \u201cThe bill will not have the votes to go forward if there are not meaningful protections for consumer freedom that significantly lower premiums,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters.If Mr. McConnell cannot find 50 votes for a procedural \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d to debate on the bill next week, the effort would quickly collapse.GOP aides said it wasn\u2019t clear if a version of the bill text released Thursday would include Mr. Cruz\u2019s idea. The proposal has alarmed centrist senators, who worry it would destabilize insurance markets and drive up costs for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201cI want to make sure the impact of that amendment doesn\u2019t eliminate [protection for those with] pre-existing conditions\u201d protections, said Sen.       Tim Scott       (R., S.C.), a conservative who rarely breaks with GOP leaders.America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the major trade group for the industry, is opposed to the Cruz measure. But more than 80 conservative leaders said in a memo this week that it should be included in the bill.In an effort to find a compromise, some senators have proposed tweaking Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal by limiting the price difference between plans that comply with ACA requirements and those that don\u2019t. Mr. Cruz said he was having \u201cproductive conversations\u201d with a wide range of senators about the measure.Mr. McConnell also faces resistance from centrists who had hoped to see changes to the bill\u2019s cuts to federal Medicaid funding. Republican lawmakers and aides said they were not expecting any such changes to be included in the version coming out Thursday.Centrist Republican senators, including Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, have said they can\u2019t support steep cuts to Medicaid. The legislation would also phase out the enhanced federal funding for the program\u2019s expansion in 31 states.Conservative groups and lawmakers say the spending reductions are vital to reining in the growing costs of the program for the low-income and disabled. And some of them blame Mr. McConnell for failing to unify his party behind a fuller repeal of the ACA.\u201cThey could have the votes if Sen. McConnell put pressure and showed the leadership needed to do so,\u201d Jenny       Beth Martin,        president of the Tea Party Patriots, a grass-roots conservative group, said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday.Dozens of business groups on Wednesday urged Mr. McConnell to scrap an ACA tax on investment income, sending a letter that was signed by organizations such as the National Association of Home Builders, National Grocers Association and Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America.The bill is also expected to keep a $500,000 cap on the ability of health-insurance companies to deduct executive compensation. Other companies have a less stringent $1 million cap. The House bill would have removed the special tighter threshold on insurance companies.Mr. Trump\u2019s position has at times complicated life for Mr. McConnell, notably by embracing a call by Sen.       Ben Sasse       (R., Neb.) for Congress to fully repeal the ACA first, and then focus on crafting a replacement, if a compromise cannot be quickly reached on the Republican bill. Many GOP senators say that would not be feasible, and Mr. McConnell has shown no sign of embracing the idea.Vice President       Mike Pence       endorsed the Cruz proposal on       Rush Limbaugh\u2019s       radio show earlier this week. But the administration has also taken an initially less-involved role in the Senate negotiations than it had in the House, which senators have said they appreciated.Administration officials have said they broadly support any idea that can attract Republican support for the bill.\u2014Michael C.

But what does this mean? It means we are promoting MAGAnomics\u2014and that means sustained 3% economic growth.For most of our nation\u2019s modern history, a healthy American economy meant one that grew at roughly 3.5%. That was the average growth rate between the late 1940s and 2007. Since then, it has hardly topped 2%.The difference between those two growth rates is staggering. If the American economy had grown at only 2% between the end of World War II and 2000, average household income would have been roughly $26,000 instead of $50,000.Over the next 10 years, 3% growth instead of 2% will yield a nominal gross domestic product that is $16 trillion larger, federal government revenues $2.9 trillion greater, and wages and salaries of American workers $7 trillion higher.For merely suggesting that we can get back to that level, the administration has been criticized as unrealistic. That\u2019s fine with us. We heard the same pessimism 40 years ago, when the country was mired in \u201cstagflation\u201d and \u201cmalaise.\u201d But       Ronald Reagan       dared to challenge that thinking and steered us to a boom that many people thought unachievable. In the 7\u00bd years following the end of the recession in 1982, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.4%. That is what a recovery looks like, and what the American economy is still capable of achieving.The focus of MAGAnomics is simple: Grow the economy and with it the wealth of, and opportunity for, all Americans. It does that by focusing on fundamental principles that made the U.S. economy the greatest engine of prosperity in the history of the planet:\u2022 Tax reform. We need to boost productivity. Fundamental to that is encouraging capital investment. We\u2019ve seen for decades that growth in private-sector jobs correlates to growth in private business investment. When businesses invest in new plants and equipment, they tend to hire more people, who produce more. Lower tax rates and faster cost recovery are two levers that will reduce the cost of capital and thereby help ignite economic growth. And since 70% of business income goes to wages, the benefits flow to workers as well.\u2022 Curbing unnecessary regulation. Much like commonsense tax reform, rolling back unnecessarily burdensome regulations will reduce the cost of doing business. When regulations increase costs, they decrease returns, leaving less capital to invest. If they are too burdensome, they discourage any investment at all, as businesses choose to forgo opportunities. This is important to all business, but especially to capital-intensive sectors like manufacturing. Overly zealous environmental regulations have played a role in pushing many U.S. businesses overseas. Requiring realistic and fact-based cost-benefit analyses of regulations will help protect both the environment and American jobs.\u2022 Welfare reform. Growth also depends on the size of the workforce. Although the labor pool is aging, we are also seeing people who could be working but are staying home. We badly need them to go back to work. We believe that most want to do this but simply lack the opportunity. Our welfare system often creates disincentives for people to seek work. We intend to change that. We need to reform welfare to ensure it helps those truly in need of it, but does not encourage people to stay home.\u2022 Smart energy strategy. The president\u2019s \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy expands the economy\u2019s growth potential. Yes, it puts coal miners back to work. But cheaper, cleaner, more abundant energy will also increase investment and employment across dozens of industries, from chemicals to automobiles. By ensuring reliable supplies and stable prices, the president\u2019s energy plan will reduce uncertainty, especially in the manufacturing sector, thereby reducing the risks associated with building new plants and hiring more American workers.\u2022 Rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. The president\u2019s plan to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure will create immediate job opportunities. More important, it will boost the long-term productivity of American industry. Rebuilding roads, bridges, airports and ports will pay dividends both now and in the future.\u2022 Fair trade for America. The president is right in that the U.S. is frequently abused when it comes to international trade. Ensuring that other nations do not undermine our economy by unduly taxing our products, by dumping products here, or by stealing our intellectual property is essential to our economic future.\u2022 Government spending restraint. When government spends a lot, it takes money away from private investment. And private investment is always a more efficient allocator of capital than government. We will continue to fund critical government functions, including a social safety net that gives people the comfort of knowing they will not be overlooked while encouraging them to be more willing to take chances. But we will watch every dollar to minimize waste. We will, in short, seek to take from you only what government actually needs to function.MAGAnomics is for everyone, but especially for those who left for work this morning in the dark but came home after their kids were asleep. It\u2019s for those who are working part-time but praying for a full-time job. It\u2019s for folks whose savings are as exhausted as they are. This president hears you. He knows America\u2019s greatness doesn\u2019t spring from higher taxes or unnecessary regulations or broken welfare programs. It doesn\u2019t come from government at all. It comes from you.If we enact the president\u2019s broad agenda\u2014if MAGAnomics is allowed to work\u2014we will have set the stage for the greatest revival of the American economy since the early 1980s. It will remind people\u2014including those who have forgotten, or those who don\u2019t want you to remember\u2014what a great America means.

While Uber founder       Travis Kalanick\u2019s       questionable conduct got him ousted, anxious corporate boards facing short-term investor pressures recently have sent unprecedented numbers of virtuous and transformational CEOs packing well before their times.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that 13 companies with market capitalizations greater than $40 billion replaced their CEOs during the first five months of 2017. This list includes Ford,             General Electric,U.S. Steel,       CSX, AIG,             Yahoo                   and Arconic. Many fell victim to a short-term mind-set fueled by activist hedge funds. Meantime, some top-performing CEOs\u2014such as       Michael Dell,             Whole Foods                   founder       John Mackey       and         Panera Bread\u2019s      Ron Shaich      \u2014have led their companies away from short-term financial markets to focus on long-term business investments.Today\u2019s corporate bosses aren\u2019t the robber barons or country-club networkers of yesteryear. Modern CEOs are generally smart, diligent and committed to their jobs. They can easily travel hundreds of thousands of miles a year. Eighty-hour weeks are the norm. Many report that the professional demands are so intense that they have little time for family or personal friendships.Mark Fields       worked for the             Ford Motor Co.       for 28 years, rising to become its CEO in 2014. During his three-year tenure at the helm of America\u2019s second-largest auto maker, the company was profitable. Ford\u2019s recent success was due in part to the popularity of the redesigned F-150 truck, which became America\u2019s best-selling vehicle on Mr. Fields\u2019s watch, and to other major product relaunches, including the legendary Mustang. In 2015, the company enjoyed the best earnings year in its 113-year history.But since Mr. Fields took the reins, Ford\u2019s stock price had plummeted by 36%. He had warned investors that the pace of technological change meant Ford needed to sink some of its recent profits into long-term research and development. Ultimately the company\u2019s family-controlled board decided it could no longer resist pressure from investors to reinflate the stock price. Mr. Fields was let go in May.Board panic is a feature of the current corporate environment. The board of retail giant             J.C. Penney                   fell victim to activist pressure and pushed out the highly successful CEO       Myron Ullman       in 2011. Two years later they sheepishly had to lure him back.Ellen Kullman\u2019s       brilliant six-year reign at             DuPont                   produced a 266% total shareholder return. In early 2015, she beat back a challenge from an activist hedge fund with a 2.7% stake in the chemical manufacturer. But while Ms. Kullman survived that battle, she couldn\u2019t hang on for long. Later that year DuPont suffered two weak quarters due to the strength of the dollar against Brazil\u2019s currency and a downturn in Chinese demand for agricultural chemicals. Before the company could recover from this modest setback, the board panicked and let Ms. Kullman go. A subsequent decision to merge with             Dow Chemical                   has cost jobs, destroyed shareholder value, and ruined the reputation of this 215-year-old global icon.Honeywell\u2019s      Dave Cote       left a proud legacy when he retired this spring in a classic internal succession. In a decade at the helm, Mr. Cote grew the Morris Plains, N.J.-based conglomerate\u2019s global market share and spurred a stock-price gain of nearly 200%. During the same period, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index gained only 63%. Yet two months into the reign of successor       Darius Adamczyk,        activist investor       Dan Loeb       pushed for change. So much for a honeymoon at Honeywell.Activist proxy campaigns are on the rise as hedge funds hunt for short-term stock returns. In the 1960s investors held stocks on average for eight years. Now the average is eight months. Fearing the cost of engaging in proxy battles, not to mention the bad press, directors often wrongly settle with activists, just as many settled with the leveraged-buyout artists of the 1980s. Corporate boards settled 45% of proxy battles in 2016, with many settlements involving invitations to activists to join the board. Fifteen years ago only 17.5% of proxy battles were settled in this way.These settlements often lead to disproportionate activist representation on corporate boards. It\u2019s not unusual for a 4% ownership stake to net an activist as much as a third of the seats on a board. The research and consulting firm FTI looked at 300 activist campaigns between 2012 and 2015 and found that CEOs were three times as likely to be replaced within 12 months after activists joined the board.All of this activist agitation hasn\u2019t translated into soaring performance. According to a 2015 Fortune magazine study, activist funds beat the S&P 500 index in only three of the previous eight years. Preqin\u2019s Hedge Fund Spotlight found that 100% of the institutional investors it surveyed were disappointed with their activist hedge fund investments.The hedge funds are not the only ones to blame for the short-termism stalking corporate America\u2019s corner offices. Institutional investors such as public pension funds and university endowments fuel the activists\u2019 war chests. Eager to make up for faltering performance and lacking the resources for in-depth research on targeted companies, hundreds of such funds delegate their judgment to proxy raters and activists solely focused on short-term share price.Some institutional investors have begun to push back. Companies targeted by activists have seen high rates of management turnover and communities devastated by large-scale job losses. Behemoth funds such as Calpers, BlackRock and Vanguard have begun to see how contrary these trends are to their own investors\u2019 longer-term interests.Corporate boards need backbone, something that is unfortunately in short supply. Without it, many more quality CEOs will fall victim to the terror of short-termism.Mr. Sonnenfeld is senior associate dean and a professor of leadership practice at the Yale School of Management.Correction Buffalo Wild Wings                   has a market capitalization of approximately $2 billion.

As of this Wednesday, his ratings stood at 40.4% favorable and 53.6% unfavorable.Mr. Trump is likely to be more popular in states he won than his national average: The larger his margin in those states last November, the better he stands now. If this trend holds through 2018, Democrats in states Mr. Trump won by double or nearly double digits could face stiff re-election contests.Though many endangered Democrats are now making bipartisan or even pro-Trump noises, voters won\u2019t forget these incumbents\u2019 loyal support for President Obama\u2019s agenda. They can try hiding from their voting records but can\u2019t escape them.Furthermore, these Democrats are highly partisan. For example, Mr. Tester once led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Ms. McCaskill can\u2019t restrain herself from making needless partisan jabs. All eagerly campaigned for       Hillary Clinton.       Even Mr. Manchin personally pushed her last fall to make an appearance in West Virginia.Cozying up now to Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t square with the Democrats\u2019 \u201cresistance\u201d agenda. For example, after hyping rumors that she might be named Mr. Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary, Ms. Heitkamp voted to sustain an Obama administration regulation on methane emissions that North Dakota\u2019s energy industry strongly opposed. She was trying to dampen opposition from the Democratic left, which was angry at her for playing footsie with the new president.Consider also Indiana\u2019s Mr. Donnelly. The Washington Examiner reports that he emphasized his strong support for ObamaCare in a fundraising email on June 21\u2014the same day news broke that two of the four insurers remaining in Indiana\u2019s health exchanges were pulling out. Another fundraising appeal a few days later claimed that Sen. Donnelly was \u201cfighting back against Trump\u2019s extreme agenda,\u201d complicating his effort to look like a bipartisan moderate. Facing similar balancing acts, all these Democrats could easily fall off the beam.Republicans do have their own 2018 challenges. Sen.       Jeff Flake       must play defense in Arizona (which Mr. Trump won by 3.5%) while Sen.       Dean Heller       is fighting an uphill battle in Nevada (which Mr. Trump lost by 2.4%). It doesn\u2019t help that Mr. Heller has stumbled by threatening to scuttle his party\u2019s plan to replace ObamaCare. Both seats are crucial to keeping the GOP\u2019s Senate majority.Since several of these Democrats are better-than-average campaigners, Republicans must also recruit strong challengers. The GOP can\u2019t beat something without something better. Screaming \u201cliberal, liberal, liberal\u201d won\u2019t work either. Republicans must show voters that these Democrats say one thing during elections and something else in between them.The greater key to Republican success, however, is getting things done now in the halls of Congress. That\u2019s why Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to keep the Senate working for two weeks in August rather than breaking for recess is so vital. If Republicans don\u2019t repeal and replace ObamaCare and reform the tax code, the party\u2019s grass roots will lose enthusiasm, donors will shut their pocketbooks, and Republicans will lose.But if the GOP Congress can get things done, 2018\u2019s unusual mix\u201425 Democrats up for re-election versus only nine Republicans\u2014could make it one of the 20% of midterm elections in the past century in which the party holding the White House actually picks up seats.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of \u201cThe Triumph of       William McKinley       \u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/troubled-times-for-10-senate-democrats-1499899156", "news_title": "Troubled Times for 10 Senate Democrats", "keywords": "charles schumer,clair mccaskill,dean heller,democrats,donald trump,heidi heitkamp,hillary clinton,joe manchin,senate democrats,sherrod brown,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "America is an angry country these days. Me, I blame the 1950s. Think about it. So many of the ideas and ideals that came to define the postwar American Dream became ingrained in the national psyche during those \u201cHappy Days\u201d: the nuclear family, home ownership, upward mobility, social conformity, keeping up with the Joneses. Much of the rage in the land, it could be argued, revolves around the loss of these prized notions.Few of such fraying ideals have proved more wrenching than the unraveling of the social contract between American corporations and their employees, a 60-year arc of events that       Rick Wartzman       expertly traces in \u201cThe End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs in America.\u201d That subtitle, by the way, is a bit misleading; there are plenty of good jobs in 2017 America. It\u2019s the loyalty part that this book is really about.A better subtitle, in fact, might have been, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Corporate Welfare State,\u201d because that\u2019s the story Mr. Wartzman, a former reporter for the Journal and now a director at the Drucker Institute in Claremont, Calif., tells by chronicling the history of labor relations at four 20th-century leviathans: Coca-Cola, General Motors, General Electric and Kodak.For an idea so enduring, \u201cloyalty\u201d between employer and employee is actually a newish concept. If it hadn\u2019t fixed itself so deeply in the American way of life, you could almost call it a 1950s-era fad. The push to draw companies and workers closer dates to the 1910s, when GM and others began doling out benefits that would have had the muckraking journalist       Ida Tarbell\u2019s       head spinning: insurance, health care, pensions.By Rick Wartzman  PublicAffairs, 418 pages, $30That some of it was driven by a cynical corporate desire to discourage union membership is beside the point. By the Great Depression, when many companies shed benefits out of necessity, workers at the largest American companies had nevertheless come to expect them. This new thinking was enshrined by a wartime organization called the Industrial Advisory Board of the Committee for Economic Development, a group of corporate executives convened by the Roosevelt administration in 1942 to ponder the question of how to keep the 58 million or so war workers employed once the war ended.The CED, as it was called, packed with executives from GM, GE and other large American companies, crusaded for full employment and saw benefits as the way to make it happen. Industry should \u201clend a helping hand to its workers,\u201d as GM\u2019s Alfred Sloan put it, protecting them \u201cagainst the vicissitudes of life.\u201dMr. Wartzman does a nice job of illustrating how fat and happy American companies got in the postwar years: the corporate gyms and golf courses, the wage dividends, the ample medical insurance and pensions, the free meals\u2014even, as at Coke, for retirees. Workers at Kodak had it so good during the 1950s, Mr. Wartzman writes, that some began calling Rochester, N.Y., the company\u2019s home, \u201cSmugtown, USA.\u201dPushback wasn\u2019t something that began in the 1980s. In fact, it was almost immediate. Unions, which emerged as stalwart defenders of not just wages but benefits, became a target for corporations eager to trim. Anti-union crusaders such as GE\u2019s       Lem Boulware       saw how much all this generosity cost\u2014American wages rose an astonishing 54% during the \u201950s\u2014and argued hard for reining in organized labor.As Mr. Wartzman demonstrates, the first major rollbacks of corporate benefits came with a recession in 1958. They rolled back further during the Arab oil embargo in 1973, with Japan and Germany catching up to the U.S. economically, beginning \u201ca two-decade stretch in which productivity gains at US companies were less than half of what they had been after World War II.\u201dYou know the rest. Led by \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d Welch at GE, the Fortune 500 announced open season on employees. Between 1980 and 1990 the number of workers at Fortune 500 companies fell from nearly 16 million to just under 12.5 million. More and more jobs began moving overseas. In 1965, Mr. Wartzman writes, U.S. businesses invested less than $50 billion in foreign factories and offices; by 1980, 15 years later, it was more than $210 billion. Full employment, which the CED had once compared to \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d as a \u201cgoal of democratic government,\u201d had become, in barely 30 years, \u201cutterly unthinkable,\u201d Mr. Wartzman writes.At the root of all this is a simple question: What are corporations for? Are they primarily vehicles for employment or investment? Mr. Wartzman, a reporter at heart, mostly dodges the politics, preferring to tell the story straight. But what killed \u201cloyalty\u201d was a dramatic shift in legal and philosophical thinking away from the former to the latter.While Mr. Wartzman deftly unpacks important court cases, the book could be faulted for failing to explicate the change in management theory during the 1970s that issued in the era of shareholder supremacy. Having noted that the shareholder-versus-worker debate harks back decades, Mr. Wartzman simply notes that \u201cas the US economy languished\u201d during the 1970s, \u201cthe old debate about the proper role of business reignited.\u201d Surely       Milton Friedman,       Michael Jensen       and others who \u201cextolled the cool rationality of the marketplace\u201d came from somewhere.It\u2019s understandable that many today would yearn for the halcyon days of the 1950s and the security that so many companies offered. But in a world defined by profits, it\u2019s not reasonable. During 150 years or so of American industrialization, as Mr. Wartzman shows, such eras have been the exception rather than the rule. Whatever its origins, and however controversial its legacy, it seems inarguable that the post-1970s-era crusade to \u201cmaximize shareholder value\u201d was badly needed. By almost any measure, American companies had become bloated, lazy underperformers. Yes, it\u2019s sad that making them more competitive often means layoffs and the loss of loyalty. But as long as this remains a capitalist nation, it\u2019s the American way.Mr. Burrough is the author, most recently, of \u201cDays of Rage: America\u2019s Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence.\u201dAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-good-company-1499899125", "news_title": "In Good Company", "keywords": "book review,corporate,industrial news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,motor vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "With only six months in office, President Trump has put his signature on America\u2019s China policy. A strategy that may appear capricious to his critics in fact has a logic consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s guiding beliefs. He sought a deal with China, then concluded he would not get one, and so acted in what he believes is America\u2019s best interest.Mr. Trump\u2019s approach is undoubtedly transactional, but it\u2019s surprisingly realistic given China\u2019s kid-glove treatment by most U.S. presidents. In potentially putting Beijing and Washington at loggerheads, it is also undeniably risky.In June, the White House delivered three blows to China. First, it imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank and two individuals for abetting North Korea\u2019s financial transactions. Second, it listed China in the category of worst offenders in human trafficking. Finally, it announced a $1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan. The Trump administration also made several lesser-order jabs, among them calling for more freedom in Hong Kong and conducting another freedom-of-navigation operation near the contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. It did all this as Chinese President       Xi Jinping       tried to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to China from Britain.Any one of these actions would normally be enough to rock Sino-U.S. relations, at least for a while. Taken together, they constitute a significant break from the past two decades of diplomatic engagement between the two powers. Is this an enduring shift on the part of the Trump administration? Or simply shots across Beijing\u2019s bow to get China to cooperate more with Washington and behave better abroad?To Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, the moves represent a recognition of his initial naivet\u00e9 regarding China. When the president tweeted on June 20 that China\u2019s efforts to help on North Korea had not worked out, he was derided for his apparent faith in Beijing\u2019s promises and for flipping his opinion so quickly. The latest turnaround was seen as part of a pattern stretching back to the campaign and transition, when candidate and President-elect Trump warned that he would not shrink from putting economic and political pressure on China. Then, soon after taking office, the president radically shifted to a far more cooperative stance, going so far as to host Mr. Xi at Mar-a-Lago for a family-style summit.But Mr. Trump\u2019s moves are neither capricious nor naive, even if they do lack a certain diplomatic finesse. His interest has always been in the bottom line, and diplomatic niceties of the kind that have suffused Sino-U.S. relations since       Richard Nixon\u2019s       epochal 1972 visit to Beijing are useful to him only if progress is being made.Last month\u2019s actions put Beijing on notice that Mr. Trump\u2019s transactional approach is real, and so are the potential consequences for failing to make a deal. Moreover, each move serves some larger U.S. purpose, whether strategic (Taiwan) or tactical (North Korea). Chinese leaders have long been accustomed to strong words and no action from Washington; now they will have to consider how far the Trump administration may go.By publicly calling out China, Mr. Trump risks chipping away at Beijing\u2019s carefully polished image as a global leader and contributor to stability. Beijing, already upset by criticism leveled by Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       about China\u2019s militarization of the South China Sea islands, lashed back at the administration\u2019s moves, especially the arms sale to Taiwan.With a critical Communist Party Congress coming up in the fall, Mr. Xi will be loath to be seen as unable or unwilling to combat an activist U.S. policy in Asia. He may look for ways to check Mr. Trump\u2019s recent moves, such as ratcheting up economic and diplomatic pressure on U.S. allies like South Korea, which is already in Beijing\u2019s doghouse for accepting a new U.S. missile defense system. Mr. Xi may also try to regain some standing by challenging the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea.Mr. Trump has made clear that he means what he says about deal-making. China said it would help and did not. That\u2019s enough for Mr. Trump to put the world\u2019s two most powerful countries on a potential collision course. He might be bluffing or he might be in earnest. Either way, the American president\u2019s sharp dose of realism has the potential to reshape the world\u2019s most important relationship.Mr. Auslin is a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-gives-beijing-a-lesson-in-the-art-of-the-deal-1499899021", "news_title": "Trump Gives Beijing a Lesson in the Art of the Deal", "keywords": "china relations,china trade,donald trump,g-20 summit,north korea ,us china foreign policy,us china trade,xi jinping,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Imagine you\u2019re heading into surgery for a hip fracture. You might be anxious about how it will go and nervous about starting rehab. You also probably are hungry and thirsty. For decades, patients have been told to fast before surgery. Eight in 10 say their doctors instructed them to, according to a 2017 survey commissioned by my company, Abbott, and conducted by Clarus Research.The practice dates back to the 1850s, when physicians worried that patients who ate before receiving anesthetics might be at risk of regurgitating and choking. But today\u2019s technology makes this outcome unlikely. The latest research shows that drinking a carbohydrate beverage\u2014Abbott makes one version\u2014up to two hours before an operation can ease some of the most common side effects of anesthesia and surgery, like nausea, pain or vomiting. Proper nutrition before and after an operation can reduce the chance of infection, too.Surgery may seem like a passive activity. How taxing, after all, can lying on an operating table be? But in reality, a body undergoing surgery works vigorously due to metabolic stress\u2014with results that are similar to running a marathon. A 200-pound person can burn about 3,000 calories and lose a significant amount of muscle glycogen, a stored form of carbohydrates, during an operation. Would you tell an athlete not to eat or drink after midnight before the big race?Hospitals in Europe have long allowed carbohydrate-rich drinks before surgery, with positive outcomes. A protocol in effect across Europe called ERAS, or Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, emphasizes good nutrition\u2014specifically the consumption of fluids and carbohydrates\u2014and has helped shorten hospital stays and reduce complications for some surgeries by 50%.As similar guidelines are being adopted in the U.S., hospitals are accumulating more proof that they work. At the University of Michigan, implementing a pre-operative program that included nutrition and exercise was shown to get patients out of the hospital two days faster and cut patient costs by 28%.A study published in May by JAMA Surgery examined a comprehensive recovery program put in place at 20 Kaiser Permanente medical centers. The study, which included more than 15,000 patients, concluded that the program was associated with a one-third reduction in complication rates, decreased mortality and shortened hospital stays.Implementing similar enhanced-recovery programs across the country would not only quicken and improve surgical results, it would save money. After all, a day in an average U.S. hospital runs about $2,000.Virtually every American will undergo a surgical procedure someday.

The DCCC quickly backed off its position\u2014a partisan appeal doesn\u2019t help public broadcasting\u2019s cause\u2014but the incident is telling. It\u2019s no secret that NPR and PBS lean liberal. Less appreciated is the extent to which Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) grants are organized around an idea central to the modern Democratic Party: identity politics.The CPB annually receives a $445 million federal appropriation to support public television and public radio. Most of this money goes to local stations, which pay dues to PBS and NPR for programming rights. Yet some $97 million of the federal money is distributed as direct programming grants, much of it to independent producers. This money is meant to support TV and radio programming, as well as educational projects that otherwise might not be commercially viable. Note that individual grants are not approved by the corporation\u2019s board, which is made up of presidential appointees.Much of this money goes to the children\u2019s programming that makes PBS popular. But millions go to nonfiction documentary programming made by independent producers, and that\u2019s where the focus on identity politics becomes clear. The corporation provides grant support to five so-called minority consortia, including African-American, Latino, Asian and Pacific Islander groups, as well as Alaska natives.Additional support is directed toward the Independent Television Service, which funds independent film producers. ITVS maintains a \u201cdiversity development fund,\u201d which has supported projects such as a feminist examination of cheerleading and a videogame that introduces players to the hardships and perils of crossing the Sonoran Desert as a migrant.Current-affairs programming funded by the CPB can reflect a similar sensibility. \u201cThe Talk,\u201d a PBS documentary, reduces the complexities of police-minority relations to advice minority parents are said to give their children about how to behave around cops. The program\u2019s website advises that \u201cone\u2019s never too young to get woke about race.\u201d Identity politics also pervade radio. NPR\u2019s \u201cCode Switch\u201d deals with the \u201coverlapping themes of race, ethnicity and culture.\u201dMany of these projects are well-done and affecting. As a public-television producer, I once produced a series about racial violence in changing Boston neighborhoods and a film about affirmative action in a selective public high school. But organizing program grants around specific identity groups isn\u2019t good for America\u2014or the groups being represented. There are other ways to reflect the full range of Americans in public-broadcasting programming.Those who commission such programs are committed to a deeply embedded ideology. They see American history, politics and culture predominantly through a prism of race and gender. Millions of Americans share this view, but millions more look at the country\u2019s past and present in an entirely different way.One need not set out to make programs about women and minorities for them to appear on television and radio. Letting this occur organically tends to lead to better programming. Focusing on identity politics and its euphemistic cousin, \u201cdiversity,\u201d often leads to tiny audiences. It\u2019s notable that during on-air fundraising periods, PBS stations typically shelve such offerings in favor of music specials aimed at baby boomers. A federal stamp of approval on programming organized around identity groups is also itself a political statement\u2014one the government has no business making.If Congress does decide to continue to provide federal support for \u201cpublic media,\u201d the criteria by which funds are distributed should be re-examined. Far better for public broadcasting, whether funded publicly or privately, to be a unifying force in America rather than a divisive one.Mr. Husock, research vice president at the Manhattan Institute, is a member of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting board of directors.Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/racial-division-made-possible-by-viewers-like-you-1499898974", "news_title": "Racial Division, Made Possible by Viewers Like You", "keywords": "funding for broadcasting,national broadcasting,national public radio,npr,pbs,public broadcasting,public broadcasting station,Corporation for Public Broadcasting,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,broadcasting,television broadcasting,public service television,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "If       Donald Trump       recited \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before a baseball game, it would be criticized as an alt-right dog whistle. So naturally spring-loaded opinions rained down in Poland after he delivered a defense of Western values.Only this particular American president could say, \u201cLet us all fight like the Poles\u2014for family, for freedom, for country, and for God,\u201d and elicit attacks from the left as sending subliminal messages to his isolated rural supporters, and from the anti-Trump right as a fake speech because he gave it. We live in a cynical age.Angela Stent,        a professor at Georgetown University, provided the reductio ad politics analysis: \u201cHe wants to show at least his domestic base that he\u2019s true to all of the principles that he enunciated during the election campaign.\u201dThe Trump \u201cbase.\u201d It\u2019s still out there, isn\u2019t it?It was conventional during the presidential campaign to think of the Trump candidacy as a beat-up bus caravan of marginalized American citizens, who someone called the deplorables. In the event, about half the total U.S. electorate somehow voted for the man who in Warsaw gave a speech that his opponent, Hillary Clinton\u2014or any current Democrat\u2014would never give.To simplify: One side of this debate will never be caught in anything it considers polite company using that phrase of oppression\u2014\u201cthe West.\u201d Ugh.For an enjoyably trenchant takedown of the left\u2019s revulsion at the Trump speech, I recommend       Robert Merry\u2019s       essay in the American Conservative, \u201cTrump\u2019s Warsaw Speech Threw Down the Gauntlet on Western Civilization.\u201d As Mr. Merry says, this is a big, worthy debate, and one I think the Trump \u201cbase\u201d instinctively understood in 2016.In fact, that Warsaw speech on Western Civ was really about the current edition of the Democratic Party and its two-term leader,       Barack Obama.       Mr. Trump momentarily suppressed the urge to call out his opposition, so allow me.The Trump \u201cbase\u201d knew the 2016 presidential election\u2014the contest between Mr. Obama\u2019s successor and whoever would run against her\u2014wasn\u2019t just another election. It was a crucial event, deciding whether America would go on in the Western tradition as it had developed in the U.S. or continue its steady drift away from those ideas.Progressives have an interest in ridiculing the Trump speech as a stalking horse for the heretofore obscure and microscopic alt-right because it deflects from their own political values\u2014on view and in power the past eight years.If there is one controlling Western idea developed across centuries in Europe, including by resort to war, it is that the individual person deserves formalized protection from the weight of arbitrary political authority, whether kings, clergy or dictators.Bernard Bailyn,        the great historian of the pre-revolution politics of the U.S. colonies, showed through a deep reading of colonial pamphleteering that the early Americans were ardently resentful of distant, central authority.The Founders were obsessed with this idea\u2014and for that see Jefferson\u2019s \u201cHe has\u201d bill of particulars against King George in the Declaration of Independence. They designed a government explicitly to protect smaller units\u2014individuals, local governments\u2014from being overwhelmed by too-powerful political authority.The American left has never been altogether comfortable with the U.S.\u2019s decentralized, \u201cdifficult\u201d political system. Once it identifies a universal political good, it is impatient to put it in place. One of the first American ideas resisted by the left was federalism: The states, they believe, can\u2019t be trusted to do the right thing.In the 1950s and \u201960s, this had to do with remedies for racial discrimination. With Mr. Obama, the federalist disdain accelerated. His Environmental Protection Agency imposed regulations on behalf of universalist climate claims. The       Eric Holder       Justice Department filed lawsuits alleging racial disparities against police departments, towns and local school systems. The Obama Labor Department did the same to coerce private employers; its secretary,       Tom Perez,        now leads the Democratic National Committee.No more settled part of the West\u2019s tradition exists than due process and presumption of innocence, which are embedded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Believing this Western tradition impeded sexual abuse allegations at colleges, the Obama Education Department issued \u201cguidance\u201d that reversed due process and legitimized the presumption of guilt.Eventually, the \u201cbase\u201d somehow intuited that a permanent reformulation of their political traditions was happening here.The progressive alternative to the Western experience extends to culture, especially religion. When Donald Trump, of all people, says the Poles in Victory Square chanted \u201cWe want God\u201d in 1979, it was like nails on a blackboard to postmodern progressives.One way to understand American politics today is to think of our divisions as resonant of the decade before the Revolutionary War, when rebellion\u2019s trigger was King George and his Parliament in London.In our time, the struggle is about an aggressive elevation of central authority over the smaller units of American life. The progressive Democrats are the new King George, ruling 50 postcolonial states from distant Washington.

But, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears that the inflation undershoot will be persistent.\u201dStocks rallied and bond yields fell after her testimony.Markets increasingly expect the Fed to next raise rates in December, after launching in September the process of slowly shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets acquired during and after the financial crisis.Fed officials next meet July 25-26. At their meeting last month, they raised short-term interest rates for the third time in as many quarters to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more increase this year.Fed officials in recent weeks have debated whether the inflation slowdown is likely to pass or persist, with some saying they want to hold off on more rate increases until price pressures pick up. But even those who want to go slower on raising rates because of inflation have shown no such qualms about announcing plans to implement the portfolio runoff in the next few months.Ms. Yellen has been in the camp of those who see the inflation slowdown as likely to be transitory.She told lawmakers the traditional pattern in which tighter labor markets put pressure on wages and inflation more broadly has been slow to surface. \u201cThe relationship between those two things has become more attenuated than we\u2019ve been accustomed to historically,\u201d she said. The unemployment rate, at 4.4% in June, was near its lowest level in 16 years, but wage pressures have been muted.\u201cThere is\u2026uncertainty about when\u2014and how much\u2014inflation will respond to tightening resource utilization,\u201d Ms. Yellen said Wednesday.Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge slowed to a gain of 1.4% over the year ended May, versus 1.8% in February\u2014both below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The Labor Department is set to report on its consumer-price index for June on Friday.While some Fed officials in recent weeks have said the Fed should hold to its plans to raise rates despite low inflation, because of the strong labor market and easier financial conditions, Ms. Yellen offered few signs of alarm about the possibility of loftier asset prices creating financial instability.Ms. Yellen characterized the Fed\u2019s benchmark short-term rate as \u201csomewhat below\u201d its neutral level, one in which the Fed is neither trying to spur nor slow the economy. Because that neutral level is currently low by historical standards, she said the central bank might not need to raise rates much further to reach it.Ms. Yellen said, as she did in June, that the Fed could pull the trigger on the balance-sheet plan \u201crelatively soon.\u201d She added Wednesday that she didn\u2019t find the timing terribly important now that the approach is well understood by markets.Ms. Yellen faces a second day of testimony Thursday, before the Senate Banking Committee, in what could be her final appearances before both panels before her term expires in February. The White House is beginning the process of considering who should be the next Fed leader. While Ms. Yellen isn\u2019t expected to be reappointed, President       Donald Trump       hasn\u2019t ruled it out.Asked repeatedly whether she wants to serve a second term, Ms. Yellen initially demurred and implied she hadn\u2019t discussed the matter with the White House. Later, when asked what she would say if Mr. Trump asked her to serve another term, she said, \u201cIt is certainly something that I would discuss with the president, obviously.\u201dThe hearing also showed how the political dynamic facing the central bank could shift with Republicans in control of the White House and the Fed farther along in plans to raise rates and shrink its balance sheet.Ms. Yellen\u2019s appearance before the House panel was less contentious than prior hearings, in which Republicans unsparingly challenged the central-bank leader over everything from institutional accountability to economic forecasts. Democrats, meanwhile, appeared less willing to offer unconditional support for the Fed\u2019s stance toward gradually providing less support to the economy, though many extolled Ms. Yellen\u2019s leadership of the central bank.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Yellen Still Expects Gradual Rate Hikes.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-gradual-rate-increases-will-be-needed-to-sustain-economic-expansion-1499862633", "news_title": "Yellen: Inflation Should Rebound, but Fed Could Alter Policy if Softness Persists", "keywords": "fed,fed congress,fed hearing,fed yellen,house financial services,yellen,yellen hearing,yellen house testimony,yellen testimony,Donald Trump,Randal Quarles,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Federal prisons keep some mentally ill inmates in solitary confinement for at least 22 hours a day, sometimes for years, according to an audit released Wednesday by the in-house watchdog for the Justice Department.The report by the Office of the Inspector General comes 18 months after the Obama administration hailed new restrictions on the use of solitary confinement for federal inmates, including the mentally ill, as a model for state correctional facilities. Former President       Barack Obama       barred solitary confinement for the handful of juveniles in federal prison and called the excessive or unnecessary isolation of adult inmates \u201can affront to our common humanity.\u201dHowever, federal government investigators found a wide disconnect between policy and practice, bolstering longstanding complaints by civil-rights activists that some prisons amount to human warehouses. Cumulative time in solitary confinement isn\u2019t tracked, and many mentally ill inmates are receiving insufficient treatment or none at all, the report said.One prison psychologist described solitary confinement to investigators this way: \u201cYou have no contact, you don't speak to anybody and it\u2019s a form of torture, on some level.\u201dIn a response to a draft of the report, federal prison officials, without directly addressing the problems, agreed with all 15 of the audit\u2019s recommendations, which included clear policies for solitary confinement, tracking of cumulative time in single cells, and careful monitoring of the mentally ill.Amid a national debate over the economic and social costs of incarceration, a number of states have reduced their use of solitary confinement. Colorado, Maine and Pennsylvania, for example, have barred the practice for inmates with serious mental illness in their state prisons. In New Jersey, Republican Gov.       Chris Christie       vetoed legislation last year that would have allowed solitary confinement only as a last resort and not at all for the mentally ill.State prisons house more than half of the 2.2 million people incarcerated in the U.S.In one of the audit\u2019s most notable findings about federal inmates, only 3% receive regular treatment for mental illness, though a recent government study said the proportion with a history of mental health problems is about 19%.The Obama administration raised the standards for treating mentally ill inmates in 2014, but the number of inmates receiving regular mental health treatment dropped more than 30% the following year, according to the audit. The government\u2019s investigators concluded that prisons downgraded inmates\u2019 mental illness assessments because they didn\u2019t have enough staff or resources to meet the higher standards.Currently about 7% of the 154,082 inmates in government-run prisons are in restrictive housing. For 22 hours a day or more, those inmates are separated from the general prison population\u2014sometimes alone in a single cell\u2014because of disciplinary problems or for their own protection. Most of the inmates currently in restrictive housing have been there for 90 days or less.Many researchers say long periods of isolation can have damaging and long-lasting psychological effects, particularly on the mentally ill, making it more likely these inmates will struggle when they return to society and commit more crimes.The review didn\u2019t include prisons run by for-profit operators, which a previous inspector general report found were more dangerous than government-run prisons. Prison contractors disputed those findings.The problems associated with incarcerating the mentally ill could worsen as the Justice Department faces $1.1 billion in budget cuts. A request last year by the Bureau of Prisons for 130 new mental health professionals was turned down, the report said, and no new funding is expected in the coming fiscal year.Even when mental health positions are included in the budget, they are not necessarily filled, the audit found. Mentally ill inmates can spend years on waiting lists to move from a prison to a residential treatment program, according to the report.Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       hasn\u2019t made public remarks on solitary confinement since taking office earlier this year, and he did not comment Wednesday on the audit.Asked about solitary confinement during his confirmation hearings, the former Alabama senator and federal prosecutor said, \u201cI believe that we should closely evaluate the studies and evidence and make the best determination about how to handle what can be a dangerous prison population in a way that is both constitutional and effective.\u201dIn general, Mr. Sessions has prioritized tougher enforcement in what he describes as an effort to curb an increase in violent crime. Under more aggressive prosecution of drug and immigration offenses, the federal prison population is expected to grow after a few years of decline.Federal prisons don\u2019t officially use the term \u201csolitary confinement\u201d even though the practice exists, the report said, further complicating any potential efforts at an overhaul.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-mentally-ill-federal-inmates-receive-little-to-no-treatment-audit-finds-1499897348", "news_title": "Some Mentally Ill Federal Inmates Receive Little to No Treatment, Audit Finds   ", "keywords": "doj inspector general,federal prison report,federal prisons,mental health,mental illness,prisons,solitary confinement,political,general news,national,public security,law enforcement,politics,international relations,domestic politics,prisoners,government bodies,executive branch,justice department"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A congressional battle over President       Donald Trump\u2019s       nominations for a range of influential positions is escalating and becoming more acrimonious, creating additional uncertainty over when some notable government vacancies might be filled.Mr. Trump has been slower than recent presidents to roll out nominees. But for an array of people the president has selected, Senate Democrats are using procedural tactics to slow the confirmation process to a crawl\u2014at least in part to object to the lack of open hearings on health-care legislation, Democratic leaders say.More than 30 nominees are sitting on the sidelines while they await a final Senate confirmation vote. Those include several picks for the Justice and Treasury departments, as well as new commissioners for a federal energy regulator that has been unable to conduct official business because of its vacancies.If the current pattern holds, many of these people may not be confirmed for their jobs before the Senate takes a break in mid-August. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) in most circumstances has been invoking Senate procedures to require up to 30 hours of debate per nominee, an amount of Senate floor time that means lawmakers can\u2019t confirm more than a handful of nominees each week.The minority party often waives a requirement for lengthy debate, but Democrats are generally declining to do so. In response to GOP complaints, they cite what they call Republican obstructionism under President       Barack Obama,        including Republicans\u2019 refusal to hold a hearing or vote on Mr. Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee,       Merrick Garland.In the current environment, even noncontroversial nominees can take up several days of Senate time. For example, the Senate spent much of the first part of the week considering the nomination of David Nye to be a federal judge in Idaho. Mr. Nye was originally nominated by Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump renominated him after taking office.Senators took a procedural vote Monday on Mr. Nye, but he wasn\u2019t confirmed until Wednesday afternoon, on a 100-0 vote.Raw feelings on both sides of the aisle erupted this week. Republicans accused Democrats of unprecedented obstruction, saying it would take the Senate more than 11 years at the current pace before Mr. Trump could fully staff a government.White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, in a press briefing Monday, accused Mr. Schumer of being an irresponsible champion of the \u201cresist\u201d movement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) cited the issue as a top reason for his decision to push back the Senate\u2019s planned August recess by two weeks.On the Senate floor Wednesday, Mr. McConnell said Democrats were \u201cbound and determined to impede the president from making appointments, and they\u2019re willing to go to increasingly absurd lengths to further that goal.\u201dDemocrats dismiss such characterizations given what they see as unprecedented Republican tactics toward Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees, especially Judge Garland. In February 2016, Republican Senate leaders said they wouldn\u2019t consider a Supreme Court nominee until after the election.Democrats also note that Mr. Trump has yet to name people for hundreds of vacancies and say there have been paperwork problems with a number of people he has chosen.\u201cOur Republican friends, when they\u2019re worried about the slow pace of nominations, ought to look in the mirror,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. The GOP complaints about the pace of confirmations, he added, \u201cgoes to show how desperate our Republican leadership is to shift the blame and attention away from their health-care bill.\u201dMr. Schumer has said Democrats will generally insist on lengthy Senate debate time for nominees until Republicans start using traditional Senate procedures for advancing their health legislation, including committee hearings and bill markups.Mr. McConnell has said Republicans have held numerous hearings on ACA issues in the past and it isn\u2019t necessary to do so for the current legislation.Unlike the political fights earlier in the year over some of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks and his Supreme Court nomination of       Neil Gorsuch,        the current nominees at the head of the queue aren\u2019t high-profile, and some have bipartisan support.Those awaiting Senate floor action include Makan Delrahim, in line to lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. Mr. Delrahim, a deputy White House counsel who served as a government antitrust lawyer in the       George W. Bush       administration, was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee five weeks ago on a 19-1 vote.Among its current pending matters, the antitrust division is deep into its review of             AT&T Inc.\u2019s       proposed $85 billion deal to acquire             Time Warner Inc.,       a transaction announced in October.Also pending are two picks for Republican seats on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which usually has five members but currently has just one. Since February, the commission has lacked a quorum to conduct official business such as approving energy infrastructure projects. The nominees, Neil Chatterjee, a McConnell aide, and       Robert Powelson,        each were approved on a 20-3 vote by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last month.Mr. Trump may have made a tactical misstep by not moving to fill an open Democratic FERC seat at the same time he announced the GOP nominees in May. For government commissions made up of members from both parties, presidents usually look to pair Democratic and Republican nominees, which gives both sides an incentive to move forward with the nominations. Mr. Trump in late June announced his intention to nominate Richard Glick, a Democratic Senate staffer, for an open FERC seat, but he hasn\u2019t done so yet.Other pending nominees include Boeing       executive Patrick Shanahan       to be deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 slot at the Pentagon, and Kevin Hassett to be the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.Dozens of other nominees have been working their way through Senate committees and could be in line for full Senate consideration in the coming weeks. Those include Christopher Wray for FBI director as well as two nominees for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Fight Over Nominees Heats Up in Senate.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 18:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-fight-over-president-donald-trumps-nominees-heats-up-1499897063", "news_title": "Senate Fight Over Trump\u2019s Nominees Heats Up", "keywords": " democrats, nominees,president donald trump, republicans, senate confirmation votes,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,upper house"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A Senate committee is asking President       Donald Trump\u2019s       former campaign chairman to testify about a meeting he attended last year between Trump confidants and a Russian lawyer who was said to have information from the Kremlin intended to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Sen.

Ahead of the meeting, Donald Trump Jr. had been told Ms.\u00a0Veselnitskaya\u00a0would be able to provide damaging information on       Hillary Clinton,        who was his father\u2019s Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential race. The younger Mr. Trump was told the information came from the Kremlin in an effort to help the Trump candidacy.The younger Mr. Trump released an email exchange this week that confirmed\u00a0that the meeting was described as part of a Russian attempt to boost the elder Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.The younger Mr. Trump\u00a0said the meeting proved a waste of time and that the woman had no such information to provide.The president defended his son in a\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0post on Twitter, writing about his son\u2019s appearance on Fox News Tuesday: \u201cMy son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad.\u201dMr. Trump has denied that campaign officials colluded with Russia during the election. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the 2016 election and on Wednesday, it dismissed the alleged offer of Clinton information.Mr. Manafort is a longtime lobbyist and Republican political operative. He resigned from the Trump campaign after media reports indicated that he was part of a covert influence campaign in Washington on behalf of the Ukrainian government. The campaign ended in 2014, before he worked for Mr. Trump.Mr. Manafort registered as an agent of a foreign government in late June, acknowledging for the first time that a small part of his lobbying work for Ukraine\u2019s former president was aimed at influencing U.S. policy makers and journalists.The broad thrust of the Senate committee hearing would look at foreign influence peddling and lobbying inside the U.S., including questions about a political intelligence firm that compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump while simultaneously working on a campaign against U.S. sanctions against Moscow.A spokesman for the Judiciary Committee later said the committee was working with special counsel Robert Mueller \u201cto ensure that such an action would not conflict with any criminal investigation\u201d before formally extending the invitation and scheduling the hearing date.\u201cIf conflicts exist, then Chairman Grassley is prepared to work with special counsel Mueller to find a way for the committee to proceed with its oversight responsibility,\u201d said the spokesman, Taylor Foy.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 17:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-trump-campaign-manager-paul-manafort-is-asked-to-testify-about-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-1499890450", "news_title": "Senate Panel Seeks Testimony of Ex-Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort About Meeting With Russian Lawyer ", "keywords": " 2016 election, campaign chairman, donald trump, donald trump jr.,russia investigation, russian lawyer, senate judiciary committee,Donald Trump,Paul Manafort,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"}, {"content": "The three huge glass apartment towers rising in Long Island City near the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge will share a clubhouse and a 1.6 acre private park, creating a mini city of rental units with lavish amenities in the once-gritty industrial neighborhood.The development, named Jackson Park for the private backyard garden near Jackson Avenue, is moving toward completion, with the first of 1,800 market-rate apartments due to begin leasing in the fall.Earlier this month, the developer, Tishman Speyer, marked the topping out of the tallest of the buildings after the concrete was poured for the apex of the 581 feet tall, 53-story tower.The first tenants are due to move in before the end of the year, said       Erik Rose,        managing director for residential development at Tishman Speyer.

There is just one problem: its $16,000-per-dose price tag.The drug, called ACZ885, is already sold under the brand name Ilaris for certain rare inflammatory disorders affecting a very small number of people. But a recent clinical trial suggests it could also reduce the risk of serious complications like strokes in people who have suffered a heart attack.If the drug does pan out with regulators, Novartis would have to drastically cut its price to make it competitive with other cardiovascular drugs. That would mean jettisoning a small, but reliable, revenue stream on an uncertain bet that the drug could become a top seller as a cardiovascular medicine.\u201cThey\u2019ve got a bit of a puzzle on their hands,\u201d said       Bernard Munos,        a senior fellow at nonprofit FasterCures who previously worked at             Eli Lilly                   & Co.A Novartis spokesman said it is too early to discuss its pricing strategy. \u201cWe will continue to fully analyze the data, plan to discuss these with regulatory agencies and determine how it would fit into clinical practice,\u201d he said.Rare-disease, or orphan, drugs can command sky-high prices because they are typically the only treatment option available. The small number of patients also limits the overall bill to the health-care system.That isn\u2019t the case for drugs for common ailments. If approved for use in patients recovering from a heart attack, ACZ885\u2019s potential market would skyrocket: around 615,000 people in the U.S. survive a heart attack every year, according to the American Heart Association. Novartis estimates that the drug, which helps patients who also suffer from inflammation in the arteries, could be suitable in around 40% of those cases.Novartis\u2019s revenue from ACZ885, at $283 million last year, is modest. Adding heart-attack patients, even at a vastly reduced price, could bring that figure to as much as $3.6 billion, according to Jefferies analysts. Credit Suisse analysts put the peak sales estimate at closer to $1.5 billion.On paper, that seems an obvious gamble to take. But because of the way drugs are priced in the U.S., Novartis would have to drop the price it charges rare-disease patients as well, giving up most of that revenue stream. Once the price of a drug is cut, raising it again would likely damage a company\u2019s reputation. Ilaris is sold in more than 70 countries, including Canada, parts of Latin America, Europe, Russia, Japan, Turkey, Israel and Switzerland.And there is no guarantee that the drug will be widely used if the price comes down. Cardiologists can be reluctant to put their patients\u2014especially those already on several medications\u2014onto new drugs. That problem has dogged several recently launched heart drugs, including Novartis\u2019s own Entresto.Another potential problem: ACZ885 is already late in its patent cycle, making it uncertain whether Novartis could really get all that additional business if it dropped the price now.\u2018They\u2019ve got a bit of a puzzle on their hands.\u2019ACZ885 is to lose patent protection in 2024, at which point lower-cost versions can enter the market and sharply erode sales.To keep a lid on cost, insurers also tend to impose higher copays or complex approval processes for patients to get access to new, pricey drugs for common conditions. One example: insurance plans are curbing access to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that cost around $14,500 a year before rebates or discounts, in a bid to keep all but the most serious cases patients on pennies-per-day statins, which work well for the majority of people.ACZ885\u2014dosed every three months at its current pricing before rebates and discounts\u2014would cost around $64,000 a year for heart-attack patients. Novartis may need to drop the price by more than 90% \u201cto get close to palatable,\u201d according to       Craig Granowitz,        chief medical officer at             Amarin Corp.      , a small pharmaceutical company that focuses on cardiovascular medicine.Ilaris came on the market in 2009 to treat a group of rare inherited conditions called cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, whose sufferers have a genetic mutation that causes the body to overproduce an inflammatory protein. Novartis has since won further approvals for a few other rare diseases, but hasn\u2019t altered the price as a result.In 2011, Novartis hoped that a positive result in a gout trial would sharply broaden the market for Ilaris, but the drug was denied approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over safety concerns in these patients. At the time, the company\u2019s then-head of drug development       Trevor Mundel       acknowledged that if the drug had won approval in gout, it would have had to lower the price to win coverage from insurers.Setting a single price that holds for every use of the drug discourages companies from exploring new disease areas for their medicines, said       Ed Schoonveld,        a pricing and market access expert at consultancy ZS Associates.Novartis\u2019s spokesman said the trial that tested ACZ885 in heart-attack patients \u201cwasn\u2019t designed with any commercial implications in mind at the time\u201d and that its main purpose was to discover whether inflammation played a role in cardiovascular disease.A big hurdle is how U.S. drugs are priced for federal programs. Drugmakers must sell drugs to Medicaid at the lowest price they have offered to any private insurer. And they must sell their medicines to Medicare at the average selling price, plus 4%, Mr. Schoonveld said.Under current legislation, there is no room to vary the price of a drug based on its application. The lowest price would have to apply to all uses, according to Mr. Schoonveld. Such dynamics could discourage companies from investigating whether an approved, rare-disease drug could have a much broader application, he said.\u201cShould you keep [a rare-disease drug] off the market because it treats common disease?\u201d said       Marlene Haffner,        a consultant and former director of orphan drug development at the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cEverybody would say no.\u201dWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'A $16,000 Medicine Spurs Pricing Dilemma.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 17:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-dilemma-over-a-16-000-drug-1499832421", "news_title": "The Price Dilemma Over a $16,000 Drug ", "keywords": "approval,drug approvals,drug cost,drugmakers,drug prices,fda,medicaid,medicare,orphan drugs,prices,pricing,FasterCures,Novartis,NOVN.EB,Eli Lilly,LLY,research,development,corporate,industrial news,new product,service testing,heart,cardiac disease,political,general news,health,medical conditions,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014House Republicans will try again to provide money for President Donald Trump\u2019s promised border wall with Mexico, but the project faces the same stiff resistance from Democrats as it always has and prospects remain doubtful.House Republicans are including $1.6 billion to construct a physical barrier along the southwest border as part of the Homeland Security spending bill for the fiscal year 2018. The proposal, released this week, sets up a new round of battle on this issue after lawmakers balked at funding the wall\u2019s construction in a spending bill that passed Congress in early May.This spending is popular with many Republicans but faces a high hurdle in the Senate, where Democratic votes will be needed. Democratic Party leaders have been clear they oppose paying for the construction of a physical wall, which as a candidate Mr. Trump promised would be funded by Mexico.Meantime, anticipating that funding will eventually come through, the Department of Homeland Security said it would soon choose four to eight designs from among proposals submitted earlier this year and would build prototypes in San Diego by September.Mr. Trump has voiced support for a design with solar panels on it, but the acting deputy commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection agency, Ronald Vitiello, said the president\u2019s view \u201chasn\u2019t impacted the planning.\u201dThe proposed $1.6 billion for next year would pay for a total of about 74 miles of new or replacement barriers, for an average cost of about $21 million per mile. That includes 32 miles of new border wall and 28 miles of a new levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and 14 miles of replacement secondary fencing in San Diego.\u201cThese miles will help connect existing segments of wall \u2026 and fill critical gaps,\u201d Mr. Vitiello told reporters last week.House Republicans said this week they were ready to push again for the funding.\u201cOne of the principal issues that drove the last four elections was the promise to secure our borders, and the wall is an important part of that promise,\u201d Rep. Tom McClintock (R., Calif.) said Wednesday.The House budget bill also includes increased funding for deportation of people in the U.S. illegally, including money for nearly 4,700 additional detention beds, for 1,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 500 new Border Patrol agents.Immigrant advocates oppose all of these ideas, but congressional Democrats have been particularly vocal about the border wall. That sets up a shutdown fight this fall when the government\u2019s current funding expires on Oct. 1. Support from at least eight Senate Democrats is needed to pass spending bills. That is because 60 votes are required for most legislation to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate and Republicans hold 52 seats.In late June, Senate Democratic leaders sent a letter to Senate GOP leaders urging them to exclude funding for a \u201cvery expensive, ineffective new wall along the southern border with Mexico.\u201dIn the House, Republicans can pass spending bills on their own, but they sometimes need Democratic support because of GOP defections. That gives the minority party some leverage in both chambers. This week, House Democrats were clear about their opposition.\u201cOnce again, Republicans are trying to put American taxpayers on the hook for the multibillion-dollar boondoggle President Trump swore Mexico would pay for,\u201d House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.) said Tuesday.Some Republicans are also opposed or neutral, with those representing the areas along the border among the skeptics. But conservatives said it was important to try to push the funding through, and a summary of the bill emphasized that it met Mr. Trump\u2019s budget request.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that eight Democrats don\u2019t control what we do on appropriations from here on out,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen conservative House Republicans, said Wednesday.Mr. Meadows said Republicans couldn\u2019t give in to Democrats, given the GOP\u2019s full control of the House, Senate and White House.Another conservative member of the House is thrusting the issue into the Senate GOP primary in Alabama. Rep. Mo Brooks said in a campaign ad that if elected he will read the King James Bible on the Senate floor to delay consideration of any spending bill that doesn\u2019t include wall funding.\u201cEven some establishment Republicans are blocking the way,\u201d he said in the ad. \u201cElect me to the Senate and I\u2019ll fight every spending bill that doesn\u2019t fund that wall.\u201dA Republican congressional aide noted that the most conservative House Republicans often wind up voting against spending bills for various reasons, and said their insistence on border wall funding wasn\u2019t likely to be consequential in final negotiations.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 17:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-gop-again-seeks-funds-for-trumps-border-wall-1499895546", "news_title": "House GOP Again Seeks Funds for Trump\u2019s Border Wall ", "keywords": "2016 campaign,border wall,donald trump,illegal immigrants,mexico border,political,general news,crime,legal action,illegal immigration,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014            Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google won a reprieve from one of its biggest legal battles in Europe on Wednesday, when a Paris court threw out a \u20ac1.11 billion ($1.27 billion) bill that France\u2019s tax authority has sought from the search giant for five years of back taxes.In a decision issued Wednesday afternoon, Paris\u2019s administrative tribunal ruled that Google\u2019s lucrative advertising-sales business had no taxable presence in France\u2014absolving it of income or sales taxes on advertising income from French clients.The decision, covering the years 2005 to 2010, backs Google\u2019s position in a dispute that has dragged on for more than six years, and could have implications for other tax battles in Europe and elsewhere.A Google spokesman said that the court \u201chas confirmed Google abides by French tax law and international standards,\u201d adding: \u201cWe remain committed to France and the growth of its digital economy.\u201dFrench Budget Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said that the tax authority is analyzing the decision with a view to appealing it, noting \u201cthe significant role of French employees in Google\u2019s commercial activity in France.\u201dThough the decision concerns only France, and is subject to appeal, it is a victory for Google and other Silicon Valley firms when they are facing multiple regulatory battles on topics including taxes, competition and privacy.The European Union two weeks ago fined Google \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) for abusing the dominance of its search engine to promote one of its own businesses, one of three antitrust cases in which the EU has filed formal charges.Multiple European regulators are also investigating Facebook Inc. over its use of personal data, and tech companies are also clashing with authorities over how to best remove hate speech and terrorist propaganda from their platforms. Last month, Germany passed a new law threatening fines of up to $57 million for companies that don\u2019t comply quickly enough.Taxes have been a particular pressure point. Politicians in countries such as France and the U.K. have said tech giants declare too little profit in their countries and then manage to reduce whatever profit they do declare elsewhere in Europe by paying huge untaxed royalty fees that often end up in tax havens.Several European countries, other than France, have pursued Google for back taxes. Spain raided Google offices in Madrid last year, and the company earlier this year agreed to pay Italian tax authorities \u20ac306 million ($349 million) in back taxes.The EU last year demanded that Ireland recoup as much as \u20ac13 billion ($14.8 billion) in back taxes from Apple Inc. stemming from profits the EU said Apple should have declared as taxable in Ireland, and it is investigating whether Amazon.com Inc. should owe back taxes to Luxembourg. Apple is appealing, and Amazon has said it pays all the tax it owes.The threat of legal action\u2014coupled with new tax rules proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and a new \u201cdiverted profits tax\u201d in the U. K.\u2014has led companies to make structural changes. Last year, Facebook began directing U.K. clients to start paying an affiliate in the country rather than funneling that money through Ireland and then on to the Cayman Islands, boosting its tax payments in the U.K.Google also made a controversial tax deal with the U.K. that involves attributing more income to that country, therefore paying more taxes there.The French case indicates, however, that there may be limits to tax authorities\u2019 efforts to make significant clawbacks of taxes under existing laws.Similar to how Google operates in other large EU countries, its French unit doesn\u2019t sell ads to French customers, but rather offers only logistical and marketing support to the Google unit in Ireland that closes the advertising deals. Google Ireland pays the French unit for that support service, leaving a smaller profit in France than if the sales were booked in the country.The French tax authority argued that the structure is fictitious and that it believed French employees were actually selling ads in France. The authority said that meant the Google\u2019s Irish unit should have paid income and sales taxes as if it had a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d in France.But in its decision, the court backed Google\u2019s argument that its French employees were doing nothing more than preparatory work allowed under the Franco-Irish tax treaty.France\u2019s tax authority has separately complained to France\u2019s tax prosecutor, which said last year that it has been investigating the company since 2015 for aggravated tax evasion. Wednesday\u2019s court decision that Google doesn\u2019t owe any additional taxes could complicate that criminal case.Corrections & Amplifications   The EU last year demanded that Ireland recoup as much as \u20ac13 billion ($14.8 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

The two sides won\u2019t be back at the table until after Monday.\u201cThese are challenging times in health care,\u201d Michael Wagner, the president and chief executive officer of Tufts, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe must make decisions that ensure the financial viability of our hospital so we can continue to provide the high-quality, low cost care our patients depend on.\u201dLabor costs, typically the largest expense at hospitals, have been pressuring profits at hospitals around the country. Expenses for salaries and wages \u201cjust popped\u201d between 2015 and 2016 for a host of potential reasons, ranging from a shortage of skilled professionals to rising costs for employee benefits, said Beth Wexler, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.Hospitals are also concerned that the planned Congressional repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act could squeeze Medicaid budgets in states like Massachusetts that expanded Medicaid \u2014 resulting in hospitals generating less revenue or serving more uninsured patients.Some 15 months of negotiations between Tufts and nurses included disagreements on pay and staffing, with a key sticking point being retirement benefits.Seeking to restrain costs, health-care providers, states and companies have increasingly moved to reign in rising pension obligations. In late June,             United Parcel Service Inc.       said it would freeze pension plans for about 70,000 nonunion staffers.Classic pensions, or defined-benefit plans, are funded by the employer, which also bears the investment risk. Workers, meanwhile, are primarily responsible for funding 401(k)-style defined-contribution plans \u2014 with employers often providing a partial match \u2014 and bear all the investment risk.Employees who have retirement benefits at work are overwhelmingly enrolled in defined-contribution plans rather than traditional pensions, a trend that took hold in the late 1980s and was exacerbated by the recession, said Stephen Blakely, spokesman for the Employee Benefit Research Institute.Tufts said it is spending $6 million a year on administrative costs to run its traditional pension benefit, and that continuing the plan is unwise at a time when hospitals are trying to control health-care costs.Tufts stopped offering traditional pensions to new nurses in 2005 and said it now wants to move the remaining 340 nurses with traditional pensions onto defined-contribution plans. The money the nurses have accrued so far for retirement would stay in a pension, but going forward, they would save for retirement in a 401(k)-style account.Nurses oppose that proposal because they worry about the safety of their retirement funds if, for instance, the economy goes into another recession, said       David Schildmeier,        the spokesman for the Massachusetts Nurses Association, the union that represents nurses at Tufts and more than 80 other facilities.\u201cWhen you have a 401(k), you have to carry all the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lose it in a 401(k), it\u2019s gone.\u201dWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 17:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nurses-at-major-boston-hospital-go-on-strike-1499895061", "news_title": "Nurses at Major Boston Hospital Go on Strike", "keywords": " 401(k), 401k, boston, labor, labor costs,massachusetts nurses association,nurses, nurses strike, pensions, retirement, tufts, tufts medical center, unions,Massachusetts Nurses Association,Tufts,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,workers pay,economic performance,indicators,employment costs,productivity,economic news,political,general news,health,personal finance,retirement planning,health care,life sciences,hospital care,healthcare provision"}, {"content": "Dozens of major online firms launched protests against Republican efforts to roll back Obama-era net-neutrality rules, in an escalation of tensions over Washington\u2019s proper role in the internet.\u201cProtect Internet Freedom.

And some big players, including             Alphabet Inc.       unit Google, were content with relatively low-key efforts.Google posted an item on its public-policy blog supporting the current net-neutrality rules that it also sent out as an email to people on its \u201cTake Action\u201d list. Its main search page made no mention of the protest, however, and featured a Doodle honoring the late Japanese artist and costume designer       Eiko Ishioka,        whose birthday is July 12.Amazon.com Inc.       placed a box on its home page saying, \u201cNet neutrality?

The meeting involved several big internet platforms, including Google and Facebook, as well as a high-tech trade group, the Internet Association.Republicans generally have sided with internet providers such as             AT&T Inc.       and             Verizon Communications Inc.,       who regard the rules as an overreach that could hurt investment and innovation. The rules had reclassified broadband as a utility-type service subject to potentially stringent regulation.Aides to House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.), Majority Leader       Kevin McCarthy       (R., Calif.), Majority Whip       Steve Scalise       (R., La.) and others attended the meeting, according to one person familiar with the matter.A spokesman for the Internet Association,       Noah Theran,        said in a statement: \u201cNet neutrality is a bipartisan issue, and Internet Association remains committed to working with all stakeholders to protect and preserve strong rules.\u201dThe protests were said by organizers to involve tens of thousands of people, websites and organizations, are aimed at highlighting public support for the rules adopted in 2015.Net neutrality is essential to ensuring the survival of the next wave of innovative startup companies, said       Michal Rosenn,        general counsel at Brooklyn-based Kickstarter.\u201cLike most internet companies, we started off small,\u201d Ms. Rosenn said. \u201cWe know that we depended on a level playing field to get Kickstarter up and running to become the company we are today.\u201dThe GOP-led FCC approved a plan in May to substantially overhaul and narrow the rules. Supporters of the current rules face an uphill fight.Big telecommunications firms were trying to sound conciliatory Wednesday, and AT&T Inc. went so far as to join the \u201cday of action.\u201dBut other firms sounded frustrated by the protests. \u201cThe day of action isn\u2019t designed to educate consumers about sensible policies, rather its goal is to scare them into thinking their internet experience will somehow suddenly be degraded if the FCC restores light touch regulation,\u201d said the NCTA, a cable trade group, in a blog post. \u201cDon\u2019t believe the hype.\u201dThe Trump administration is siding with the FCC. \u201cThe Trump administration supports the FCC\u2019s efforts to roll back burdensome, monopoly-era regulations,\u201d an administration official said in a statement. \u201cWe all believe in fair rules of the road for everyone\u2014consumers, [internet providers] and website providers, and we\u00a0believe that legislation is the best way to provide a stable, predictable environment for growth and innovation by the entire internet ecosystem.\u201dWrite to John D.

He was arrested in the Boston area.Mr. Yan worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s electronics research lab, according to an MIT spokeswoman. It is unclear whether he is still employed there.Federal prosecutors say Mr. Yan made more than $100,000 trading in options of Stillwater Mining Co., a Colorado-based mining company, ahead of its acquisition by South African miner             Sibanye Gold Ltd.        SBGL 0.21%       He allegedly knew secret details of the merger from his wife, who worked on the deal as an associate in the Manhattan office of Linklaters LLP, a large London-based law firm.A spokeswoman for Linklaters said the associate, who is not identified in the complaint, has been suspended without access to the firm\u2019s systems and confidential information. She hasn\u2019t been arrested.\u00a0The law firm says it is cooperating with authorities.A spokesman for Sibanye declined to comment.A lawyer for Mr. Yan couldn\u2019t immediately be identified.In June 2016, Mr. Yan opened a brokerage account in the name of his mother and began trading Stillwater stock, the government alleges. The complaint details several calls from Mr. Yan to the brokerage firm and to his wife in the months before the acquisition.On Nov. 22, 2016, hours after Mr. Yan\u2019s wife participated in a call on the potential deal, Mr. Yan\u2019s brokerage account bought call options in Stillwater, which is typically a bet that the price of the stock will increase. The account continued purchasing call options until the deal was announced, prosecutors said.In a related complaint, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Mr. Yan also made around $9,700 in profits from illegal trades tied to the acquisition of Mattress Firm Holding Corp. by Steinhoff International Holdings. Steinhoff, like Sibanye, was being represented by his wife\u2019s law firm, according to the SEC.Several of Mr. Yan\u2019s internet searches were documented in the complaint.Three days before the public announcement of the deal, Mr. Yan allegedly searched for \u201chow sec detect unusual trade\u201d and accessed at least three articles about insider trading. In the next few days, prosecutors said he also searched for \u201cinsider trading with international account\u201d and viewed an article entitled, \u201cWant to Commit Insider Trading? Here\u2019s How Not To Do It.\u201dMinutes after the deal was announced on the morning of Dec. 9, 2016, Mr. Yan\u2019s brokerage account sold all of its Stillwater call options, resulting in a profit of approximately $109,420, the complaint said.That same day, Mr. Yan searched on the internet for \u201cinsider trading cases\u201d and \u201cinsider trading options,\u201d prosecutors said.Tips gleaned from law firm assignments have been used as the basis of several insider trading cases in recent years.In May, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged a former Foley & Lardner LLP partner with making illegal trades based on pending corporate announcements from firm clients, and with passing along tips to a neighbor to make trades of his own. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office is in discussions with the two defendants,       Walter C. Little       and       Andrew M. Berke,        about a possible disposition of the case, according to a court filing.Earlier guilty pleas in insider-trading cases involving employees at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati PC and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP got widespread attention and served as a wake-up call for law firms that their internal systems may not be secure enough.Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com and Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Insider-Trading Charge For Lawyer\u2019s Husband.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 17:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/research-lab-worker-arrested-charged-with-securities-fraud-1499894236", "news_title": "Research Lab Worker Arrested, Charged With Securities Fraud ", "keywords": "boston,chinese citizen,insider trading,mit,research lab employee,securities fraud,stillwater,Linklaters,Sibanye Gold,SGL.JO,GFI,Stillwater Mining,Fei Yan,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,insider dealing,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,metal ore mining,legal services,basic materials,resources,business,consumer services,gold ore mining,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "Buckling to pressure from activist investors,             NRG Energy Inc.

Expectations were modest for the gas auction, given the low price of the fuel and readily available imports from the U.S.The discovery, along with strong interest from foreign investors in recent oil and gas auctions, is a boon for the Mexican government, which in 2014 opened up the country\u2019s energy industry to private investment after 76 years of state ownership.The Zama-1 discovery \u201cproves that the energy reform was a step in the right direction,\u201d said Mexican Energy Minister       Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Coldwell.       \u201cThe Mexican state is going to increase its hydrocarbon reserves, which had been declining, and\u2026benefit from the corresponding tax revenue.\u201dThe energy overhaul has become a political football in Mexico in the run-up to next July\u2019s presidential election. Thousands of Mexicans have staged protests against a sharp increase in gasoline prices that began this year as part of the energy reform.Meanwhile,       Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,        Mexico\u2019s leading opposition leader, has pledged to roll back or reverse the reforms and build new refineries across Mexico to create more energy-sector jobs.\u201cTo people who know the industry, it\u2019s very good news that there is more oil than we expected,\u201d said Jorge Pi\u00f1on, a former oil executive who is now a professor at the University of Texas, Austin. \u201cBut from the point of view of the guy on the street, as far as he\u2019s concerned, the reform hasn\u2019t given him any benefits so far.\u201dPremier, Talos and Sierra won a tender to develop Zama-1 in a 2015 auction, the first such contracts awarded to private investors.The find is \u201cthe most important achievement so far of Mexico\u2019s energy reform,\u201d said       Pablo Medina,        an analyst with Wood Mackenzie who focuses on Latin America.The firm estimates that Zama-1 is one of the 20 largest shallow-water fields discovered globally over the past two decades.Others cautioned that Premier\u2019s estimate of the size of the discovery refers only to oil-in-place, not the amount of hydrocarbons that could be recovered from the field. Energy-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. estimated that Zama-1 could yield about 425 million barrels.Alfredo Marti,        managing director of Riverstone Holdings, the U.S. private-equity firm that backs both Sierra and Talos, said that drillers typically recover 25% to 30% of the oil found in formations like Zama-1, but said he expects the group could recover between 30% and 40% because the area where the oil is located is deeper than expected and the rock more permeable than initially thought.\u201cNot only is there more oil there, but it\u2019s easier to recover,\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ed said. \u201cIt shows how there\u2019s low-hanging fruit to be had in Mexico. In the U.S., companies work extraordinarily hard chasing a deposit of even 20 million barrels\u2026With the prices of oil and gas being so low, we don\u2019t have as many opportunities to break out the champagne these days, but this is one of them.\u201dThe discovery comes on the heels of another significant oil find in the Gulf of Mexico. Italy\u2019s             Eni                   SpA on Wednesday estimated reserves in a field it won in 2015 at around one billion barrels of oil equivalent. Initial estimates had put reserves in that field at about 800 million barrels.Wednesday\u2019s auctions also showed that Mexico has a large and growing market for natural gas. It imported around 4.6 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas in the first four months of this year, accounting for nearly 60% of its needs.Canada\u2019s Sun God Resources and Mexico\u2019s Jaguar Exploraci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n de Hidrocarburos won six of the blocks. There were only six bidders for the gas auction, while 17 bidders were participating in a later auction Wednesday of 14 onshore oil and gas blocks.\u2014Bradley Olson and Juan Montes contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Alfredo Marti is managing director of Riverstone Holdings.

Last year, a person familiar with Transfix\u2019s valuation pegged it at over $75 million.Transfix has raised a total of $78.5 million since its founding in 2013. The company projects it will be profitable in 12 to 18 months, Mr. McElroy said.Transfix connects retailers, consumer products companies and other shippers with trucking fleets via an app and through its website. The service is one of a crop of online bookers looking to grab a slice of the U.S. freight transportation management business, which generated $58.7 billion in revenue in 2015, according to the most recent data from consulting firm Armstrong & Associates.Startups hope to use technology to more cheaply and efficiently pair shippers and truckers in a business that is still often conducted by armies of brokers via phone and email.In addition to other freight-booking startups, including Convoy and Cargo Chief, trucking has begun to attract the attention of technology giants. Uber Technologies Inc. launched a trucking app in May, and             Amazon.com Inc.       is working on its own booking solution.

Inflation is a main focus for bond investors because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed returns and can lead to higher interest rates, which also hurts prices for outstanding bonds.Wednesday\u2019s rally came after a recent bout of weakness in the bond market. Fearing a broad shift by global central banks away from their longstanding stimulus policies, investors had dumped government debt in recent weeks, lifting the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to nearly 2.4% from below 2.2%.On Wednesday, the yield settled at 2.325%, a drop from 2.362% Tuesday and 2.393% at the end of last week. It was the yield\u2019s largest one-day decline in nearly a month. Yields fall when bond prices rise.\u201cThe rates market has been looking for something to latch onto,\u201d and Ms. Yellen provided it, said       Brian Edmonds,        head of interest rates trading at Cantor Fitzgerald LP.Long considered hesitant to tighten monetary policy, Ms. Yellen has appeared more eager in recent months, saying the recent slowdown in inflation was largely attributable to temporary factors. For a while, investors mostly shrugged off such comments, buying Treasurys in the belief inflation would remain low and prevent the Fed from raising interest rates aggressively.Sentiment shifted at the end of June, however, as officials from other major central banks also suggested they were growing more comfortable with the state of the global economy. That raised the prospect of multiple central banks tightening policy at around the same time, putting downward pressure on bond prices.Still, investors haven\u2019t forgotten about the tepid inflation data. Even before Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony, Treasurys had shown signs of stabilizing this week, a sign investors were ready to re-enter the market with 10-year yield still well below its high for the year.Helping to offset some of the demand for bonds Wednesday was an auction of 10-year Treasury notes, which got a somewhat weak reception after yields had declined earlier in the day. The sale followed an auction of three-year notes Tuesday. A sale of 30-year bonds is scheduled to take place Thursday.Further insight into the inflation situation will come soon, with U.S. consumer price data set for release Friday.\u201cIf Friday\u2019s numbers suggest that yes, inflation did pick up\u2014it didn\u2019t need to rebound massively, just not disappoint\u2014I think some of the faith in the Fed continuing to hike this year and next year can come back to the market,\u201d said       Priya Misra,        head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 16:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-strengthen-on-yellen-testimony-1499867769", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Rise on Yellen Testimony", "keywords": "debt,fed,federal reserve,house,interest rates,investors,janet yellen,markets,monetary policy,testimony,u.s. bonds,u.s. government bonds,yellen,Janet Yellen,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Bilbao, SpainTo kick off the 20th-anniversary celebrations of       Frank Gehry\u2019s       titanium-clad Guggenheim, the museum has mounted a retrospective of the American video artist Bill Viola. Curated by the Guggenheim Bilbao\u2019s       Luc\u00eda Agirre       and elegantly arranged in rough chronological order, it runs the gamut from his early experimental videos (the earliest work is 1976\u2019s \u201cFour Songs\u201d) to his high-definition meditations on time and the elements.Bill Viola: A RetrospectiveGuggenheim Museum Bilbao  Through Nov. 9Mr. Viola\u2019s work has been seen in (and often commissioned by) churches and such secular sacred spaces as opera houses and concert halls. Viewed one at a time in, say, an oratory in Venice or a cathedral in England, his videos appear as startling interventions that can transfigure their surroundings; lining them up inside the darkened galleries of Gehry\u2019s temple for contemporary art can blunt their meditative intensity.Once a nerdy eccentric of the video art scene, Mr. Viola, at age 66, is now the world\u2019s most famous video artist. His career has spanned nearly five decades, but the majority of the videos at the Guggenheim date from after 2000, with luminous high-definition images crowding out the grainy videotapes of his experimental works from the 1970s. These include the trick photography of his metamorphosis-like \u201cThe Reflecting Pool\u201d (1977-79) and \u201cChott el-Djerid (A Portrait in Light and Heat)\u201d (1979), where a telephoto lens captures mirage-like images in a Tunisian desert.Viewers most familiar with Mr. Viola from his recent work will be surprised to find installations from the early 1990s that show him working in modes he would later abandon. In \u201cHeaven and Earth\u201d (1992), two suspended TV monitors face each other, projecting images of birth and death. In \u201cSlowly Turning Narrative\u201d (1992), the images are projected onto a rotating screen. In \u201cThe Veiling\u201d (1995), they are thrown onto a series of nine hanging scrims.Mr. Viola\u2019s videos are largely non-narrative and without dialogue, yet they often take on a cinematic quality. Especially since 2000, the attention he lavishes on slowness and texture, his graceful pans and zooms bring to mind the indelible images of       Andrei Tarkovsky.       The intensity of the work sometimes makes it seem in danger of collapsing under the burden of being transcendent and transformative. For example, I\u2019m not sure that the composed stillness of \u201cThe Dreamers\u201d (2013), seven large plasma screens of people reposing peacefully underwater while waves and bubbles ripple across their clothed bodies, generates much more than a cool effect.Mr. Viola\u2019s most ambitious and arresting work to date is arguably his video (four hours\u2019 worth!) made to accompany a production of \u201cTristan und Isolde\u201d in Paris, a 2005 collaboration with the theater director       Peter Sellars.       Among the Tristan-derived works in the exhibit are \u201cFire Woman\u201d (2005), \u201cTristan\u2019s Ascension (The Sound of a Mountain Under a Waterfall)\u201d (2005) and \u201cNight Vigil\u201d (2005/2009), three grippingly intense episodes that crescendo in explosions of fire and water. Sadly, the full \u201cTristan\u201d is not in the show, although a video recording taken from a 2014 production in Madrid will be screened here on Oct. 28.Digital video has been a mixed blessing to such cinematic visionaries as       Tim Burton,       Terry Gilliam       and       Peter Greenaway,        often bringing their singular visions to life with an irritating slickness. Mr. Viola\u2019s recent work, much of it done in studios and with a large technical apparatus, undeniably has cinematic flair, but the results\u2014with their commercial-grade production values\u2014sometimes come dangerously close to kitsch. Yet in his strongest work, Mr. Viola manages to avoid or transcend this danger by showing himself an artificer of searingly original visions that combine formal rigor and spiritual mystery.There is also a generous helping of art history. Despite his cutting-edge aesthetic, Mr. Viola works in a stringently classical mold, appropriating major themes of Western art. The most explicit art-historical quote in this show is \u201cThe Greeting\u201d (1995), a slow-motion work in vertical format inspired by a Mannerist masterpiece, Pontormo\u2019s \u201cThe Visitation\u201d (1528-29). The five projections that make up \u201cGoing Forth by Day\u201d (2002), a colossal work that wraps around one of the exhibition\u2019s largest rooms, borrow motifs from fresco cycles of Giotto and Signorelli.While the 23 works on display provide a solid overview of Mr. Viola\u2019s technical development and expressive range, the show could benefit from a more creative arrangement, such as the one chosen by       Kira Perov,        Mr. Viola\u2019s wife and longtime collaborator, for his monumental 2014 Paris show at the Grand Palais built around existential questions at the heart of his work (\u201cWho am I?\u201d \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d). And for an artist this widely exhibited, it would have been nice to find new work created for the show. (The most recent video is 2014\u2019s \u201cInverted Birth.\u201d)Admiring the Gehry building\u2019s dynamic swirls after several hours in the dark with Mr. Viola\u2019s striking images leaves a sense of what is lacking in so much of the video artist\u2019s work: a sense of spontaneity and play, and a lightness of touch to temper the severe artistic vision.Mr. Goldmann writes about European arts and culture.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 16:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-viola-a-retrospective-review-where-video-meets-art-history-1499891196", "news_title": "\u2018Bill Viola: A Retrospective\u2019 Review: Where Video Meets Art History", "keywords": " a retrospective,arts in review,bill viola, guggenheim museum bilbao, video art,Bill Viola,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,film,video exhibition,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "A group of cancer experts voted unanimously on Wednesday to support U.S. regulatory approval for a first-of-its kind gene therapy targeting an aggressive form of leukemia that occurs in children and young adults.The treatment, called CTL019 and developed by Swiss drug company             Novartis AG        NVS 0.31%      , works by modifying a patient\u2019s own immune cells to make them more effective at hunting down and killing tumor cells. It involves removing some of the patient\u2019s blood and genetically modifying the T-cells, a type of immune cell, before re-infusion.A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee, which comprises a group of cancer experts from across the U.S., voted 10 to 0 that the therapy had a favorable risk-benefit balance, meaning that its positive effects outweigh its safety risks. The question of risk-benefit balance is widely seen as a proxy for whether the FDA should approve the treatment.\u201cThis is a major advance and is ushering in a new era of treating children with\u201d severe leukemia, said committee member       Malcolm A. Smith,        who is associate branch chief for pediatric oncology at the National Cancer Institute.The FDA isn\u2019t required to follow the advice of such advisory panels, but it generally does so. Analysts expect the FDA to issue a final decision by the end of September.The therapy holds out the promise of a significant advance in the treatment of children and young adults with a form of blood cancer known as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is also the first in a series of new treatments facing FDA review that use genetically modified T-cells.For Novartis, FDA approval would open a potentially big, new revenue stream. Jefferies analysts estimate the drug could bring in $850 million in annual sales by 2021.Novartis has said that in a clinical trial, 52 of 63 participants who received the treatment were cancer-free after three months. The patients in the study had either failed to respond to standard therapies, or relapsed.Most children and young adults with this form of leukemia are treated using existing methods such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bone-marrow transplants.But the roughly 1 in 7 patients who don\u2019t respond to standard treatment, or suffer a relapse, have typically had only a 10% to 20% chance of survival, according to       Rajesh Chopra,        head of cancer therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research in London. The Novartis therapy raises that to about 80%. \u201cThat\u2019s big,\u201d he said. Dr. Chopra isn\u2019t involved in the study.Timothy P. Cripe,        an advisory committee member and pediatric oncologist, said the Novartis therapy was \u201cthe most exciting thing I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime and probably since\u201d advances in the treatment of childhood leukemia in the 1950s.CTL019 is the first of a hotly anticipated class of treatments known as CAR-T therapies, all of which use genetically modified T-cells, to be reviewed by the FDA. Close behind is California biotech             Kite Pharma Inc.,       which filed its own CAR-T for non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the FDA just days after Novartis.Despite their promise, CAR-T therapies have also raised safety concerns.Juno Therapeutics Inc.,       based in Seattle, dropped its most advanced CAR-T candidate earlier this year after several patient deaths during a clinical trial because of swelling in the brain.A spokesman for Juno said the company had conducted an exhaustive investigation into the causes of the deaths, which appeared to be linked to a mix of the specific design of the treatment, the characteristics of the patients and the process used to administer the therapy. The company plans to release the detailed results of its investigation at a scientific conference later this year, he said.He added that patients in an early-stage trial for its now-leading product, JCAR017, experienced relatively low rates of serious side effects.A common side effect of CAR-T therapy is a condition known as cytokine release syndrome, which causes severe flulike symptoms. Novartis said most patients in its trial suffered some form of CRS, but that none died from it. None of the patients in Novartis\u2019s trial suffered from swelling in the brain.The FDA, in briefing documents issued ahead of Wednesday\u2019s panel meeting, also said there was a risk that CAR-T therapy could, in the long term, make the modified T-cells cancerous.That caution arises from an incident in the late 2000s when several people developed a leukemia-like condition about 10 years after receiving an older form of gene therapy for an immunodeficiency disease. So far, there is no evidence that a similar effect could occur with the Novartis therapy, which uses a different form of virus to insert the new genetic material.Xiaobin Victor Lu,        gene-therapy product reviewer at the FDA, said during the hearing that the design of the Novartis therapy lowered the chances of such a side effect, but that the risk \u201ccannot be entirely eliminated.\u201dTo help address these concerns, Novartis has said it would monitor clinical-trial patients for 15 years and would set up a registry of patients who receive the therapy post-approval to monitor for unexpected side effects.Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com and Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Leukemia Therapy Garners Support.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 16:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-panel-considers-leukemia-gene-therapy-treatment-1499873113", "news_title": "FDA Panel Votes Unanimously to Support Leukemia Gene-Therapy Treatment ", "keywords": " approval, b-cell ,blood cancer , cancer,car-t therapies,childhood leukemia,clinical trial, ctl019, deaths,fda committee, fda panel,food and drug administration, gene-therapy treatment,genetically modified t-cells, immune cells, immune system, leukemia,novartis drug,risks,side effects,survival, t-cells, therapy,tumor cells,Novartis,NOVN.EB,Food and Drug Administration,Juno Therapeutics,JUNO,Kite Pharma,KITE,Rajesh Chopra,Daniel DeAngelo,Malcolm A.

However, Mr. Yeo said he didn\u2019t consider himself in the financier\u2019s inner circle.A lawyer for Mr. Yeo said Wednesday in court that his client was remorseful and had agreed to hand over an unspecified amount of illegal earnings. He said Mr. Yeo would cooperate with Singapore authorities in their investigation into other individuals involved in the 1MDB case, including Mr. Low.Investigators had said earlier that Mr. Yeo hadn\u2019t been cooperative. Mr. Yeo, under different legal representation, had previously intended to fight all charges against him.BSI provided financial services to entities connected to 1MDB. The prosecution said Mr. Yeo had conspired with his former boss,       Kevin Swampillai,        to receive secret profits from 1MDB-linked money flows while facilitating a series of transactions made by 1MDB subsidiaries and Mr. Low. Mr. Yeo pleaded guilty to cheating his employer, BSI, by hiding those profits and to attempting to conceal and launder those proceeds.Mr. Swampillai, who testified as a prosecution witness against Mr. Yeo in an earlier trial for obstruction of justice, hasn\u2019t been charged with any crimes. However, Singapore\u2019s central bank has named him as a person of interest in its investigation into 1MDB. A lawyer for Mr. Swampillai declined to comment.1MDB didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment and has previously denied wrongdoing and said it would cooperate with any lawful investigation. A spokeswoman for Mr. Low said, \u201cAny attempts to link Mr. Low to the recent guilty pleas by parties allegedly making secret profits are based on unfounded assumptions.\u201d The spokeswoman said there has been no proof that funds were misappropriated from 1MDB.BSI has previously acknowledged shortcomings in its anti-money-laundering controls but declined to comment Wednesday on Mr. Yeo\u2019s case.Mr. Yeo is serving a 30-month prison sentence for attempted obstruction of justice. The 54-month sentence handed down Wednesday will be served concurrently with the remainder of his earlier sentence, of which he has served about 15 months.Investigators in at least five countries are probing the finances of 1MDB in response to allegations that billions of dollars have gone missing, much of it through private bank accounts in Singapore. Swiss investigators say they believe that as much as US$4 billion was misappropriated from the fund through several banks, including BSI.Several Malaysian probes into 1MDB have ended without finding wrongdoing at the state fund. U.S. authorities, who have frozen more than $1 billion in assets linked to Mr. Low and 1MDB, are conducting their own criminal investigation and are collaborating with Singapore investigators.Mr. Yeo is one of five people to be successfully prosecuted in Singapore for crimes linked to a web of 1MDB-related transactions. Singapore\u2019s central bank has also taken action against several financial institutions involved in the 1MDB case; it has shut down two banks, including BSI\u2019s local branch, and imposed financial penalties of 29.1 million Singapore dollars ($21.1 million) on those two and six others for various breaches of anti-money-laundering regulations.Write to Jake Maxwell Watts at jake.watts@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 16:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-banker-sentenced-to-prison-after-pleading-guilty-to-1mdb-linked-money-laundering-1499852340", "news_title": "Ex-Banker Sentenced to Prison After Pleading Guilty to 1MDB-Linked Money Laundering", "keywords": "1mdb, bsi, jho low, malaysia fund, money laundering, singapore,BSI,1Malaysia Development,Kevin Swampillai,Yeo Jiawei,Jho Low,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,money laundering,embezzlement,financial crime,fraud,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The White House is expected to nominate Russ Behnam, a Senate Democratic aide, to be a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as early as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Behnam serves as an aide to Sen.

Murray, also 30, lost 12 of the final 14 games as his body abandoned him down the stretch. Rafael Nadal got knocked out Monday.\u201cAt a certain point in your career, you are going to experience these things,\u201d said Djokovic, who has been battling the bad shoulder for 18 months. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to swallow.\u201dIn the other quarterfinal, Marin Cilic of Croatia bested Luxembourg\u2019s Gilles Muller in five sets.

Raonic held a 3-0 lead in a third-set tiebreaker before Federer won seven of the next eight points with a series of baseline winners, cut volleys and dazzling serves to finish the match.Federer said after struggling with injuries last year and taking some much-needed breaks, he is \u201ca normal tennis player again.

The project for the nation\u2019s busiest passenger rail segment\u2014which stretches 457 miles from Washington to Boston\u2014still needs funding from Congress.The FRA\u2019s plan calls for new segments designed for faster trains and eliminating choke points to achieve the speed improvements.\u201cSafe, reliable and efficient rail transportation is a vital part of our nation\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d said U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary       Elaine Chao.       \u201cAnd expediting the project delivery process is key to delivering needed infrastructure more quickly.\u201dThe plan previously included a proposal to build a straighter route that would run for 35 miles between Old Saybrook, Conn., and Kenyon, R.I. Residents and some elected officials fiercely objected, saying it would cut through private properties, farms, historic districts and sensitive wetlands.The opponents to the plan wanted the federal agency to focus on making improvements to the existing 53-mile track in their area.In its Wednesday release, the FRA said it canceled plans for the new rail segment between Connecticut and Rhode Island because of broad public concern over the plan.\u201cAt this time, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate railroad infrastructure elements in this area,\u201d the agency wrote in its final plan.Instead, the FRA proposed conducting a study in Connecticut and Rhode Island to address capacity and speed restraints in the region.\u201cWe are looking to the states to spearhead that effort,\u201d said       Rebecca Reyes-Alicea,        an FRA official.Connecticut Gov.

So why aren\u2019t bank customers demanding higher interest on their deposits? This is the dilemma confronting banks.For now, most bankers are happy to keep deposit yields low, standing pat even as the Federal Reserve hikes short-term rates. No one is sure, though, how long customers will tolerate that.\u201cMany bank management teams believe we could be one to two hikes away from an increase in retail\u201d deposit rates,       John McDonald,        a bank analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a recent note. \u201cAt the same time however, we\u2019ve never quite seen a cycle like this play out before, so it\u2019s tough to know for sure.\u201dHow banks prepare for any moves by depositors is important for their profits, especially given disappointing loan growth this year.Deposit rates will be top of mind for many investors when banks begin reporting earnings this Friday, because increases could maintain pressure on already-low net-interest margins.The Fed had previously signaled that it expected to raise rates one more time this year, from the current range of between 1% and 1.25%. But Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        testifying before Congress on Wednesday, gave no indication about the timing of the next rate increase. She also said the Fed could alter its rate-raising plans if the slowdown in global inflation persists.The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised its policy rates for the first time in seven years, sending the Canadian dollar up more than 1% to its highest level in a year against the U.S. currency.Banks have been dealing with interest-rate cycles and depositors for decades, but a number of factors, both psychological and technological, make this time of rising rates different. A decade of near-zero rates, more competition from online firms, less loyalty from customers and new capital rules, among other factors, are making preparations more difficult.\u201cWe\u2019ve never really seen this movie before,\u201d       Marianne Lake,        chief financial officer of             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., told investors recently.Of course, banks don\u2019t want to raise deposit rates until they have to. Though they tend to raise certain loan rates as soon as the Fed makes a move, they prefer to let deposit rates lag, bolstering profits.And when they do raise rates, it is often because competition has forced them. \u201cNobody wants to be first,\u201d said       Greg Carmichael,        chief executive of Fifth Third Bancorp. \u201cBut nobody wants to lose deposits.\u201dSo far, the Fed has raised rates four times since December 2015, but banks haven\u2019t been under much pressure to raise deposit rates concurrently.Bank of America                   is a case in point. Its cost for U.S. interest-bearing deposits in the first quarter was just 0.09%\u2014unchanged from the prior quarter and the lowest among its peers.Talking with analysts recently, finance chief       Paul Donofrio       said it seemed unlikely that customers would leave the bank to chase rates because many had their primary checking accounts there.Officers at some banks believe it will take another one or two Fed rate increases before they have to start raising deposit rates. Others believe customers will start to demand higher deposit rates now that the Fed rate has crossed the visually important 1% threshold.\u201cThe first Fed increase, people are like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s still so small, who cares?\u2019 \u201d said       William H.W. Crawford IV,        chief executive of             United Financial Bancorp Inc.,       a community bank based in Glastonbury, Conn. \u201cBy the fourth or fifth increase, people care.\u201dOr at least they used to care. A complicating factor is that depositors haven\u2019t thought of bank accounts as income-producing instruments in nearly a decade, thanks to the Fed\u2019s near-zero interest-rate policies.Given that, many customers have come to view banks in terms of the services they offer, such as mobile banking, rather than the rates they pay.Another difference: Banks are awash in deposits. At the end of June, total deposits at U.S. commercial banks equaled $11.72 trillion, only slightly below an all-time high reached in May, according to Fed data.What\u2019s more, loan growth has slowed this year, so the 4.7% average rate of deposit growth during the first half of 2017 was ahead of the 4.5% average rate of loan growth, Fed data show. Loans at U.S. commercial banks are equal to just 79% of total deposits, meaning even if banks saw some deposit outflows, many would have plenty of room to keep lending.Fitch Ratings analysts said in a recent report that they expect banks will be able to keep deposit rates low throughout 2017, even if the Fed raises rates again, and won\u2019t meaningfully increase their rates until loan demand picks up.Yet banks can\u2019t ignore depositors if they start to make moves. There are regulatory concerns, for example.In certain tests related to the amount of liquid assets a bank has on hand, consumer deposits are more valuable than commercial deposits. That could prompt some banks to act quickly if depositors get itchy.Meanwhile, technology has made it much easier for depositors to quickly shift funds and to use multiple banks.Andrew Bain       doesn\u2019t think much of the rates at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which generally pays customers with savings accounts from 0.01% to 0.08%. But he likes the bank\u2019s QuickPay system, which lets him pay for his children\u2019s day care easily and without a fee.So Mr. Bain, who works in corporate finance in Portland, Ore., found a workaround. He keeps enough money at J.P. Morgan to pay some bills and spreads the rest between a credit union and an online bank, both of which pay him more than 1%.A number of online-focused banks, like             Ally Financial Inc.       and             Synchrony Financial,       are able to pay higher rates because they are less encumbered by brick-and-mortar expenses. An even newer competitor,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       has been driving rates higher to draw deposits to its new consumer bank. It currently offers 1.2% interest on online savings accounts.All those factors combined raise the prospect that when consumers do decide to move, banks may be forced to raise rates at a faster pace than investors might be expecting.Nelson Bonilla       is part of that threat. His savings account at Synchrony pays about 1.15% interest. But Mr. Bonilla, a software developer in San Francisco, is on the lookout for institutions that might pay more.Though he has already moved his savings account twice in recent years, he\u2019s open to being wooed away a third time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d Mr. Bonilla says, \u201cto switch again.\u201dWrite to Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Bank Deposits Don\u2019t Pay.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 16:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-a-higher-interest-rate-on-your-bank-account-tough-luck-1499851801", "news_title": "Want a Higher Interest Rate on Your Bank Account?

Mr. Clayton, a former corporate lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, has called for the agency to find ways to encourage growing companies to go public instead of relying on less regulated private markets that are closed to retail investors.\u201cTo the extent companies are eschewing our public markets, the vast majority of Main Street investors will be unable to participate in that growth,\u201d Mr. Clayton said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York.Mr. Clayton\u2019s speech was short on policy details and didn\u2019t offer any radical ideas for loosening rules to promote capital raising. The proposals under consideration would cull some repetitive requirements from companies\u2019 annual reports, which would largely have the effect of making the filings shorter and easier to read.Mr. Clayton declined to answer several questions from the moderators that sought his views on activism and short-term investing and whether companies should be shielded from investors demanding stock buybacks or higher dividend payouts. \u201cI do look to the long-term Main Street investor for guidance, but we benefit from all types of participants,\u201d said Mr. Clayton, who acknowledged at his Senate confirmation hearing that he met with billionaire investor       Carl Icahn       after President       Donald Trump      nominated him to run the agency.Mr. Clayton\u2019s remarks are likely to raise expectations that his tenure will focus on making it more attractive for companies to go public. He cited a recent meeting with business owners where he sought input about how to shave rules without carving up investors protections. \u201cIf I could invest in those companies, I would have wanted to invest in every one of those companies,\u201d he told the Economic Club.Mr. Clayton also encouraged firms to give the SEC feedback on requirements they believe are immaterial to explaining their business or future earnings outlook. In recent years, Congress has required disclosures that some companies and investors believe are meant to address political concerns, such as the use of so-called conflict minerals by manufacturers and high-tech firms. Mr. Clayton said the SEC staff would respond to such feedback with \u201ctimely guidance.\u201dMr. Clayton announced June 29 his first policy change to encourage more initial public offerings, allowing all companies to file paperwork confidentially to the SEC that must be reviewed by regulators before the deal moves forward. He also said the SEC staff is drafting a proposal for a pilot program to test exchange trading without the complex schedule of fees and rebates charged or offered to brokers.In recent years, the SEC has been drawn into Wall Street\u2019s internecine fights over where stocks are traded, with exchanges complaining too much business has moved away from regulated venues. Some large money managers, on the other hand, have complained that exchanges\u2019 incentives for attracting orders create too many conflicts of interest for brokers. Mr. Clayton said the SEC would vote on the pilot proposal in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d His predecessors also called for work on such an experiment.Mr. Clayton added that the SEC would establish an advisory committee to advise regulators on potential changes to how bonds are traded. Unlike stocks, corporate bonds and other fixed-income products still trade over the phone, where price quotes are less transparent and dealers enjoy information advantages that yield bigger profit margins. The SEC began a similar study of fixed-income trading several years ago under former Chairman       Mary Jo White       but didn\u2019t propose any significant rule changes.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 16:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-clayton-calls-on-agency-to-ease-disclosure-burdens-on-public-companies-1499876100", "news_title": "SEC\u2019s Clayton Calls on Agency to Ease Disclosure Burdens on Public Companies ", "keywords": "economic club of new york,ipos,jay clayton,sec,securities and exchange commission,Securities and Exchange Commission,Sullivan & Cromwell,Jay Clayton,corporate changes,regulation,government policy,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,securities regulations,legal services,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Skepticism toward the media is most often associated with conservatives in Middle America, some of whom eat something other than artisanal sandwiches. But this week brings more evidence that investors worldwide have become very reluctant to buy what many established news organizations are selling. How else to explain the collective shrug of the shoulders in financial markets to the latest breathless media reports about alleged collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia?Such reports have dominated this week\u2019s news as much of the professional commentariat has pondered out loud whether treason has been committed in the President\u2019s inner circle. Yet after an ever-so-slight hiccup on Tuesday following Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s release of emails regarding a meeting he took last June with a Russian lawyer, stocks drifted higher. Since then, investors have spent much of their time parsing the remarks of Federal Reserve Chair       Janet Yellen.       Reassured by her questionable suggestion that interest rates won\u2019t have to rise very fast or very far in the years ahead, they continue to keep market indexes near record levels.Investors in the aggregate obviously don\u2019t believe that the republic is coming to an end, nor do they seem to expect a wrenching change in U.S. leadership. There have been similar episodes over the last several months of sharp divergence between the collective analytical judgment of journalists and that of investors. This era of reported turmoil has been marked by a striking lack of volatility in the financial markets. Stocks aren\u2019t cheap by historical standards and corrections do happen.Yet the world\u2019s investors still like U.S. equities, despite constant media reports that U.S. constitutional governance is hanging in the balance. Now let\u2019s look at the general population in the U.S. A new report from the Pew Research Center also suggests that the news media\u2019s credibility problem reaches well beyond the hard-core MAGA crowd. A full 85% of Republicans and those who lean Republican have a negative view of the national news media. And even among Democrats and those who lean Democratic, the press corps is underwater, with 46% holding a negative view compared to 44% holding a positive one.Each respondent may distrust the media for a different reason. And perhaps investors are not so much ignoring the reported news as they are trying to strike a balance between conflicting reports. For example, let\u2019s say that an investor has concluded that the             New York Times                   and the Washington Times are equally trustworthy. A reader of this story from the New York paper is bound to take away a very pessimistic view of the current White House:But an investor reading this Washington Times story published the same day may conclude that the real danger to the republic was narrowly avoided last November:While investors may be unnerved to learn how many political operators of both parties seem eager to glean opposition research from Russian sources, they apparently still don\u2019t see it as a threat to American prosperity, or the rule of law on which it depends.***In other media news, the Washington Post thinks Tuesday\u2019s column on the Post\u2019s new social-media policy was too tough on the news organization and its owner       Jeff Bezos.

Stephen Poloz       said Wednesday rock-bottom rates are no longer necessary amid the bank\u2019s expectations of slightly stronger economic growth this year and next, at 2.8% and 2% respectively, than previously forecast.The improving economy has soaked up unused labor and production capacity at a \u201csignificant\u201d pace, the bank said, and a string of improving indicators measuring employment, exports and business-investment intentions suggest the time has come for a rate rise.\u201cThe most important thing here is the economy clearly no longer needs as much stimulus as we have been giving it,\u201d Mr. Poloz said at a press conference in Ottawa. \u201cThe accumulation of evidence, and the growth in our confidence that the economy is on a solid trajectory, should be good news for everyone.\u201dMr. Poloz added a rate rise would also \u201creinforce efforts\u201d among Canadian authorities to take some steam out of the housing market. Frothy pockets in the Toronto and Vancouver real-estate markets pose a top vulnerability to financial stability, the Bank of Canada and others have warned.The Bank of Canada is now the second central bank in the Group of Seven leading nations, after the Federal Reserve, to raise rates in response to stronger economic activity. Signals from the Bank of England and European Central Bank indicate they, too, are considering the withdrawal of the extraordinary stimulus put in place to help their economies recover and adjust following the 2008-09 financial crisis.Canada\u2019s economy is a top performer among the G-7, leading the pack in first-quarter growth, with a 3.7% annualized gain. The Bank of Canada now forecasts 3% growth in second quarter before activity moderates in the second half.\u201cAnd so the tide begins to turn,\u201d said Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, on the central bank\u2019s move. \u201cThe initial indications are that the bank fully expects to follow through with another rate hike.\u201dHis firm expects the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate to hit 1.5% by the end of the year.Traders were also betting on further rate rises, given Mr. Poloz\u2019s upbeat tone, with the Canadian dollar hitting a fresh 12-month high. In afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar was around C$1.2713, down from C$1.2910 right before the rate decision, according to data provider CQG.As the Bank of Canada delivered its first rate increase since 2010, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen was testifying on Capitol Hill. She told lawmakers she expects consumer prices will allow the central bank to keep gradually raising interest rates. She added the Fed would alter its plans if weak inflation proved more persistent. Stocks and government bonds rallied on the news.At his press conference, Mr. Poloz played down concerns over low inflation, which in May was 1.3%, or well below the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2% target. The bank said this was largely due to temporary factors, related to the cost of energy and automobiles.He said the Bank of Canada\u2019s job is to target \u201cfuture\u201d inflation. Its forecast has price increases returning close to 2% by mid-2018, as temporary factors fade and the price of food picks up steam.Because it can take 18 to 24 months before low rates can influence inflation, \u201creacting only to the latest inflation data would be akin to driving while looking in the rear view mirror,\u201d he said.Jimmy Jean, an economist at Desjardins Capital Markets in Montreal, said these comments suggest the central bank won\u2019t let itself \u201cbe paralyzed by minutiae and temporary factors\u201d affecting inflation in the pursuit of tighter monetary policy.The central bank said the output gap, or a gauge of unused labor and production capacity in the economy, is set to close at the end of this year, versus its earlier forecast of the first half of 2018. Closing the gap tends to put upward pressure on prices and wages.The Bank of Canada last raised its policy rate seven years ago, when current Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       was in charge. Canada\u2019s economy recovered relatively quickly following the 2008-09 crisis and avoided the bruising hits dealt to economies in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe. Canada\u2019s policy rate got as low as 0.25% in 2009, and in 2010 Mr. Carney raised rates three times to 1%.\u2014David George-Cosh contributed to this articleWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 15:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-raises-policy-rate-for-first-time-since-2010-1499868949", "news_title": "Canada No Longer Needs Strong Stimulus, Central Bank Says", "keywords": "bank of canada,bank of canada rates,boc,boc rate hike,canada rate hike,canada rate increase,canada rates,poloz,Bank of Canada,Stephen Poloz,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "In a parallel world, the U.K. would have been embarking this month on its six-month stint in the rotating presidency of the European Union. It would have been an opportunity to set the bloc\u2019s agenda and push the other 27 member states to adopt reforms to make the EU more dynamic and attuned to British interests.But history took a different route and that task has instead fallen upon Estonia, whose turn was brought forward six months after the U.K. pulled out following the Brexit vote. It is a mark of how disengaged from the EU the British state had already become that London appeared to have done nothing to prepare for the presidency before the June 2016 referendum, according to Estonian officials. But Estonia was never going to squander its chance: the most pro-EU of all member states has a very clear agenda.Its plan centers on driving forward Europe\u2019s digital single market, drawing on Estonia\u2019s remarkable transformation in just 25 years from a former Soviet republic into Europe\u2019s undisputed digital leader. Key to this transformation was the country\u2019s decision at the end of the 1990s to embrace e-citizenship, in which the government provides every citizen with a secure digital identity that can be used to access thousands of public and private services.That novel approach came about almost by accident in response to a request from the banking sector to establish a secure common platform to enable their customers to identify themselves. The cash-strapped government subsequently spotted an opportunity to offer cheap and efficient services in a country with a population of just 1.3 million spread across an area roughly the size of Belgium. Cost considerations also lay behind the decision to adopt open software-based web systems rather than traditional mainframes, putting Estonia at the forefront of the internet revolution.The country has evolved over time into a remarkable digital ecosystem. The only transactions the government won\u2019t let you do online are marry, divorce and buy a house. The e-economy has bought substantial economic benefits. A fundamental principle is that the government should never ask you the same question twice, your answer being held securely in one place where it can be accessed by other databases but only with your permission.The resulting security, transparency and efficiency has propelled Estonia to the top of many international surveys for the quality of its business environment. It has also delivered high degrees of trust in the state: Tax-compliance rates are among the highest in the EU, helped by a simple, flat-tax system\u2014another accident of Estonia\u2019s transition. The country\u2019s flourishing IT cluster, which has played key roles in major European success stories such as Skype and Transferwise, now accounts for 7% of gross domestic product and offers wages comparable to those of neighboring Finland.Now Estonia wants to export its e-citizen revolution to the rest of Europe and the world. One goal is to attract businesses to locate in Estonia. Two years ago, it launched an e-residency program that has so far attracted more than 3,000 businesses and 20,000 individuals to acquire an Estonian digital identity, allowing them to access e-services.But the country\u2019s greater aim is to persuade the rest of the EU to replicate its digital transformation at a national and European scale. It wants the bloc to establish an EU-wide right of \u201cfree movement of data\u201d to stand alongside the rights of free movement of goods, services, capital and people. The government argues that providing an EU-wide means for citizens and companies to establish their identities and transfer data across borders isn\u2019t only vital to the EU\u2019s economic fortunes, but also essential if governments are to continue to deliver services in a world of changing work patterns and increased labor mobility.Of course, such a radical agenda is bound to face hurdles. Many EU governments are reluctant to fully embrace digital services because of anxieties about data security. Estonian officials counter that their systems have withstood recent viruses that have affected computer systems world-wide. They say the blockchain algorithms upon which their digital identities are based effectively can\u2019t be hacked. Having lived under the shadow of the Soviet KGB, Estonians are sensitive to civil-liberties concerns, yet many believe their data to be more secure\u2014and access to it more transparent\u2014than under paper-based systems or where information is held on multiple websites. Some governments in what Estonians call \u201cOld Europe\u201d also complain that a major digital transformation is too difficult in large countries\u2014to which Estonians reply that this depends on how reforms are delivered.What Estonians fear most is that the EU digital agenda will be hijacked by vested interests and bureaucrats, leading to new regulations that would undermine their model. The EU has already run into fierce resistance as it tries to create a single digital market by outlawing so-called geo-blocking, which allows web-based companies to limit access to services by country.Naturally, Estonians are deeply disappointed that their traditional free-market ally, the U.K., will no longer be fully engaged alongside them in the battles that lie ahead. On the other hand, they note that Brexit is likely to oblige many British firms to set up EU subsidiaries to ensure continued frictionless access to the single market. Perhaps some will consider Estonian e-residency.Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 15:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/estonia-seeks-to-digitally-transform-the-eu-1499888456", "news_title": "Estonia Seeks to Digitally Transform the EU ", "keywords": "estonia e-citizens,eu data privacy,eu digital transformation,eu rotating presidency,European Union,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "FOR MART\u00cdN Berasategui, the Basque chef who bagged his eighth Michelin star last year\u2014the most of any chef in Spain\u2014a recent revelation came in the form of a mud-caked beet. \u201cIt was a local variety I\u2019d never seen before, called arr\u00f3spide,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely magnificent, bright fuchsia and sweet like candy.\u201d At his namesake restaurant in the small town of Lasarte-Oria, in the Basque Country of northern Spain, he coaxes a beet into six different preparations that could pass as sculptural art.One of the originators of Basque modernist cuisine\u2014the movement that shook up fine dining with its centrifuged sauces and foams\u2014Mr. Berasategui, 57, came up at Bodeg\u00f3n Alejandro, the unfussy and dependable restaurant in San Sebasti\u00e1n owned by his mother\u2019s family. Today, though he has restaurants as far afield as Mexico and the Dominican Republic, he\u2019s happiest at home, where he lives with his wife, Oneka, and daughter, Ane\u2014his organization\u2019s floor manager and PR and communications director, respectively\u2014in a loft above their flagship restaurant. In 2004, when his father-in-law was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, Mr. Berasategui sought out foods he hoped would slow the progress of the disease. His latest cookbook, \u201cSalsa para tu coco\u201d (\u201cBrain Food\u201d), a collaboration with a neurologist and a Parkinson\u2019s foundation, represents yet another version of cooking for family.The best feature of my kitchen is: the view. When I look up from a pot I\u2019m stirring, I see evergreen forests and white farmhouses out the window. You get the feeling you\u2019re a part of the landscape. Inside my kitchen, you won\u2019t find any crazy futuristic gadgets. I err on the side of simplicity. But I do love my Gaggenau appliances and Gemini espresso maker.The kitchen tools I can\u2019t live without are: sharp knives. I\u2019m a sucker for hand-forged Japanese blades by Sugimoto and Misono. They\u2019re, light, precise and come in every shape and size.My cooking mentors were: my parents. My father, a butcher, was a real bon vivant. My mother and aunt, both cooks, were more practical. They sat me down in \u201875 and asked me if I wanted to be a chef. I said yes. The next day I was working a 16-hour shift. \u201cThis schedule, day in and day out, is the lifestyle of a chef,\u201d they said. \u201cKnow what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\u201dMy pantry is always stocked with:       El Rey de la Vera       piment\u00f3n [smoky paprika] from Extremadura. A garlic soup would be dull without a hit of the spicy picante type. Delicate dishes\u2014seared cod with a pan sauce, say\u2014take better to the milder agridulce and dulce.My refrigerator is always stocked with: tons of fresh produce, meat and fish. I\u2019m not one of those people whose refrigerator door clanks with dozens of sauces. Basque cooking is about clean, simple flavors. When it comes to condiments, homemade almost always trumps what you can buy. If you have a whisk and a bowl, you can make mayonnaise with a little practice. There are exceptions, though, like good mustard. I have a French chef friend who sends me jars of moutarde violette de Brive, a tangy purple mustard from Aquitaine.The pan I reach for most is: my 40-centimeter Bra induction paella pan. Sturdy, non-stick and dramatic enough to double as a serving platter. Beyond paella, I use it for pan-roasting whole fish and oversize cuts of meat.I also love: earthenware cazuelas, rustic clay pots unbeatable for low-and-slow cooking. You can buy them in the artisan shops on 31 de Agosto Street in the old town of San Sebasti\u00e1n.The ingredients I\u2019m most excited about right now are: the ones that come and go in a blink of an eye because of seasonal availability. Right now we have fresh anchovies coming into port from the Bay of Biscay, straight as pencils, so fresh. Ibarra peppers are another luxury. I blister them in hot olive oil and sprinkle them with crunchy salt. They\u2019re equally addictive pickled.On weeknights, I typically eat: in the restaurant with my staff, which luckily includes my wife and daughter. But if I feel like a late-night snack, Galo Celta eggs from Galicia are my go-to. They\u2019re unreal, the best eggs I\u2019ve ever eaten, especially wonderful when baked en cocotte. I also have a weakness for Iberian pork charcuterie too. I recently discovered the lomo natural [cured pork loin] by 5J, and let me tell you, it\u2019s 10 times better than any Italian salami.When I entertain I: make things easy. I want my guests to feel comfortable, to talk and laugh their asses off. I\u2019m just the shy screwball chef in the background who provides the food.\u2014Translated and edited from an interview by       Benjamin KemperMr. Berasategui favors turbot for its flavor and flakiness, but any flatfish\u2014such as sole or flounder\u2014can be substituted. Simply adjust the cooking time to the weight of the fish, taking it off the heat when the flesh is opaque and the internal temperature registers 145 degrees.Total Time: 45 minutes Serves: 51. Soak clams in fresh water 20 minutes to allow them to purge any sand or impurities. Drain.2. Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon oil and half the garlic in a large saucepan. Set over medium heat and cook until garlic softens and becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add flour, increase heat to medium-high, and whisk to prevent any lumps. When mixture begins to bubble, add stock and wine and simmer 2 minutes.3. Increase heat to high and add clams. As clams open, transfer to a bowl. Discard any clams that remain closed after 5 minutes of cooking. Tent bowl with foil. Set aside saucepan with wine sauce.4. Dry turbot inside and out with paper towels. Pour 2 tablespoons oil into a 15-inch paella pan or skillet over high heat. Salt both sides of fish and inside the cavity. Once oil is shimmering and you begin to see wisps of smoke, lower fish into pan, skin-side down, and leave undisturbed 9 minutes.5. Meanwhile, place remaining oil, minced chilies and remaining garlic in a small pan set over medium heat. Cook until garlic softens and begins to turn golden, 2-3 minutes.6. Using a large spatula, flip fish, adding a little more olive oil if pan looks dry. Lower heat to medium-high, and cook, undisturbed, 5 minutes.7. Pour garlic-chili mixture over fish, then cider vinegar over top, swirling pan to distribute liquid evenly, and cook to combine, 1 minute more.8. Tilting pan to one side, spoon as much liquid as possible into reserved wine sauce in saucepan. Set over medium-high heat and cook, whisking, until sauce begins to bubble. Quickly pour this sauce back over fish. Cook until sauce is bubbling and evenly distributed, 1 minute. Remove from heat, arrange clams atop fish, and sprinkle with parsley and flaky salt.9. To serve, make a shallow cut following the lateral line in the center of the fish, then make another incision across the top of the tail.

These included opening humanitarian corridors, intelligence sharing and ending conflicts in parts of the country.\u201cIt was the president who made the final decision,\u201d the senior administration official involved in the assessment said.For President Omar Bashir\u2014the world\u2019s only sitting head of state wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court\u2014the Washington-led sanctions have changed little: He is firmly ensconced in power and has responded brutally to any protests against his 27-year rule.Sudan was first placed on the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993, when it harbored Osama bin Laden and other terrorists in Khartoum, and was placed under comprehensive economic sanctions in 1998 by the Clinton administration after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.The sanctions were bolstered further in 2007 by President       George W. Bush       in response to worsening fighting in Darfur. Over the years, the government has been accused of fighting bloody wars against its people there and other peripheral regions of the country. The government has said those conflicts have ceased.The Obama administration in January began taking steps to lift the trade embargo with Sudan as well as to unblock Sudanese government assets that have been frozen in various sanctions measures taken against the country.The Trump administration faced a July 12 deadline to decide whether to make that relief permanent or not, and said late Tuesday it would delay the decision for three months but that the initial steps to ease sanctions would remain in place.The path to lifting sanctions has been slowly transforming regional geopolitics, re-engaging Sudan as a key actor and ally of Sunni Saudi Arabia in Arab and Horn of Africa politics. Sudan is a strategic partner of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and is key in containing extremists from Libya.\u201cSix months is a short period to make an overwhelming transformation in humanitarian access and cessation of hostilities, but three months is unlikely to make a big difference,\u201d said       Magnus Taylor,        the regional expert for the International Crisis Group, referring to the reasoning behind the delay in lifting sanctions.Mr. Taylor added that the government was \u201clobbied hard by human-rights groups and the Christian right lobby\u201d and that their \u201cargument is emotive and powerful.\u201d       John Prendergast,        a former Clinton administration official, and his Enough activist group advocated the delay, while a group of Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers wrote a letter last week asking for the same. The administration\u00a0official declined to comment on the claim.The senior administration official involved in the assessment of Sudan\u2019s sanctions stressed the importance of Sudan demonstrating it wasn\u2019t engaging with North Korea, calling it the top security priority for the Trump administration. Mr. Ghandour said the two countries have \u201cabsolutely no relations.\u201dThe Sudanese foreign minister attributed the delay to the Trump administration\u2019s full plate of issues at home and abroad.\u201cThe current [U.S.] administration, has [a lot of issues] domestically and abroad. From the Gulf to Yemen, to Syria, to Iraq, to Afghanistan, to North Korea\u2026up to the internal business of the issue of the postelection matters now being discussed in the media, to the pressure of the lobby groups and some congressmen,\u201d he said.Write to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Delay on Sudan Relief Puts Cooperation at Risk.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 15:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-delay-in-lifting-sudan-sanctions-could-hinder-cooperation-plans-1499887864", "news_title": "U.S. Delay in Lifting Sudan Sanctions Could Hinder Cooperation ", "keywords": "africa,omar bashir,president omar bashir,state department,sudan,u.s. sanctions,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "Oil prices made small gains in topsy-turvy trading tied to falling U.S. inventories.Crude storage levels fell by 7.6 million barrels in the week ended Friday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday morning. That is more than double the draw estimated by analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and nearly confirmed a drawdown of 8.1 million barrels that the American Petroleum Institute estimated Tuesday evening.The market had surged after that report Tuesday, sending prices higher into the morning. It pared gains after the EIA report, likely from skeptics still concerned about oversupply and from automated-trading systems that are following a pattern from recent months of selling off after similar data or reports that might indicate an end of oversupply, brokers said.Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled up 45 cents, or 1%, at $45.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 22 cents, or 0.5%, to $47.74 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both hit a third-straight session of gains, but those gains had been larger\u2014beyond 2%\u2014before the EIA\u2019s data release at 10:30 a.m. EDT.The EIA\u2019s weekly storage update for the U.S., the world\u2019s largest consumer, is considered as a leading indicator of the balance between supply and demand. It has become especially important in recent months as market watchers await signs that output cuts from the world\u2019s big exporters are affecting a longstanding glut.Commercial crude stockpiles fell to 495 million barrels, EIA said. It is the 11th decline in the last 13 weeks.Gasoline stockpiles also fell by 1.6 million barrels, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of a 300,000-barrel addition. That helped bring total commercial stocks of crude and all oil-based products down 3.9 million barrels to 1.3 billion barrels. That is down 1.2% from a year ago.\u201cThose were bullish stats,\u201d said       Scott Shelton,        broker at ICAP PLC. But \u201cthe market loves rallying for no reason, and then selling off on good data.\u201dThat has been a pattern for several months, with many traders still skeptical of a changing market because U.S. production is rising and stockpiles aren\u2019t falling as quickly as some expected. Commercial crude levels, at 495 million barrels, are still 0.9% higher than they were a year ago, according to EIA data. U.S. production rose 0.6% in the past week to 9.4 million barrels a day. It was at just 8.6 million a year ago.\u201cOn a global scale, we\u2019re not eating away at the surplus,\u201d said J. Alexander Blackman, an executive at Standard Delta LLC, a trading company in Houston.U.S. production is expected to increase in 2018, albeit at a lower rate than previously estimated. Tuesday\u2019s revised short-term energy outlook report from the EIA showed a lower production forecast for 2018 to 9.9 million barrels a day, slightly down from around 10 million before. That would still set the record for annual production, exceeding 9.6 million barrels a day in 1970.

Yet these same types of decisions are made in this country under our fractured, fragmented, patchwork-quilt system of health care. Usually these decisions are made by nameless bureaucrats working deep in the bowels of insurance companies to deny new/experimental (read costly) treatments for very sick or terminally ill patients. In addition, from time to time, U.S. courts pass judgment in equally wrenching cases regarding ending treatment for patients or removing them from life support.Terry McNairFramingham, Mass.We can fight to save the Piping Plovers, baby blue whales and most any species except baby humans.U.K. judges direct the plug to be pulled on baby Charlie Gard against the wishes of his parents and international supporters.

As a former four-term congressman from South Carolina, I saw firsthand the real impacts of subsidizing expensive energy infrastructure. Right now in my home state roughly $27, or about 20% of an average customer\u2019s monthly electricity bill, goes to subsidizing the construction of two nuclear reactors. The reactors have already cost customers more than $1 billion to date and may never produce a single kilowatt of electricity.On the other hand, homeowners who make investments in rooftop solar provide benefits to the entire energy grid. By employing their personal capital they facilitate a lower cost, more reliable modern infrastructure that increases energy security. Innovations in rooftop solar paired with home storage will help us avoid unnecessary utility expenditures and support the grid when it needs power at critical times.There are more than 260,000 Americans working in the solar industry, with strong demand from consumers for rooftop solar in every state.

Not according to the numbers. The best available statistics indicate that somewhere between one-fifth and one-quarter of the plays professionally produced in the U.S. are by women. And who\u2019s to blame for this gender gap?       Paula Vogel,        who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 but only just made it to Broadway this past April with \u201cIndecent,\u201d claimed in a recent tweet that white male critics \u201chelp close us down.\u201d To which       Lynn Nottage,        another Pulitzer laureate who had an equally belated Broadway premiere in March with \u201cSweat,\u201d replied, \u201cThe patriarchy flexing their muscles to prove their power.\u201d I very much doubt it\u2019s that simple, but whatever the reasons, there\u2019s surely something amiss.As a result, a growing number of women now support \u201cgender parity\u201d in American theater, which is too often a euphemism for more or less rigid gender-based quotas in programming and hiring. That road, alas, leads to all sorts of unintended and potentially destructive consequences. Nevertheless, it\u2019s incontestable that there are lots of high-quality plays by women that aren\u2019t as well-known as they ought to be\u2014and, in the case of pre-1960 plays, simply aren\u2019t being staged at all. (When did you last hear of a revival of a play by       Susan Glaspell       or       Dodie Smith      ?)So what\u2019s to be done? I\u2019ve conducted a thought experiment. If I were running a regional theater company and decided to devote an entire season to plays by women, which ones would I choose? Within five minutes, my imaginary season was planned. Not only did I make a special point of including two pre-1960 works that are now largely (if not entirely) forgotten, but I deliberately steered clear of the usual staples. No \u201cLittle Foxes,\u201d no \u201cRaisin in the Sun,\u201d no       Caryl Churchill       or       Sarah Ruhl      \u2014just six fine plays that I picked for no other reasons than that I think they\u2019re good and are likely to appeal to the average playgoer, regardless of gender.Here\u2019s my season:\u2022       Rachel Crothers,        \u201cSusan and God\u201d (1937). The most commercially successful female playwright in the history of American theater, Crothers made it to Broadway 29 times but hasn\u2019t been seen there since 1943. She deserves better. This splendidly well-made play, filmed to lackluster effect in 1940 (      Joan Crawford       was the star) and brilliantly revived off Broadway by the Mint Theater Company in 2006, is the tale of a socialite who gets religion, decides to convert her fancy friends and finds that she\u2019s better at talking the talk than walking the walk. It\u2019s as fine an American play as I know.\u2022 Enid Bagnold, \u201cThe Chalk Garden\u201d (1955).      Angela Lansbury\u2019s       retirement from the stage scuttled a planned Broadway revival of this coolly sardonic country-house comedy about a family whose peculiarities prove to be not so funny. An international success that was excellently filmed in 1964, it doesn\u2019t seem to have had a major American stage production since 1982.\u2022 Lynn Nottage, \u201cCrumbs From the Table of Joy\u201d (1995). Ms. Nottage has already given us one play, \u201cIntimate Apparel,\u201d that\u2019s become a regional hit, but she\u2019s written plenty of other deserving shows. This one, my personal favorite, is a \u201cGlass Menagerie\u201d-style memory play about a Florida family that moves north to seek a better life. Tough, funny, poetic and knowing, it ought to be universally acknowledged as an American classic.\u2022       Julia Cho,        \u201cDurango\u201d (2006). A dark, disturbing study of a middle-aged Korean-American widower from Arizona who loses his job and decides to take his two sons on a road trip to Colorado to see if things might possibly be better there. (This one\u2019s my wild card: The cast consists of five men!)\u2022       Amy Herzog,        \u201cAfter the Revolution\u201d (2010). Ms. Herzog, America\u2019s most gifted under-40 playwright, first came to prominence with this cold-eyed yet deeply sympathetic group portrait of a complacent family of bourgeois radicals whose beloved patriarch is revealed to have been a Soviet spy. No sermons, just unsparing honesty.\u2022       Lydia R. Diamond,        \u201cSmart People\u201d (2016). A saber-toothed portrait of four smug young members of the academic monoculture, \u201cSmart People\u201d is smart enough to make you think of       Tom Stoppard.       It should have made it to Broadway but didn\u2019t.

Instead of lurking in the freezer aisle, these $12-a-person meals are shipped to your door, chilled in ready-to-cook packs. Instead of a microwave, the meals cook in a special $400 steam oven. And since this is 2017, of course that oven connects to the internet.The verdict, after two weeks of cuisine a la robo-chef: Tovala turns out superfast, consistent restaurant-quality meals, making it the first connected kitchen device with real mass appeal. But before I buy in, Tovala has to prove it can turn its razor-and-blades model into a sustainable business.Ever since a colleague and I began testing two Tovala ovens, our insta-meals have been the subject of fascination, and considerable ribbing, by family and colleagues. Some couldn\u2019t believe mankind had slipped to this new level of laziness. The rest wanted to know where they could buy one.Internet food shopping still hasn\u2019t gone mainstream, but millions of Americans are going online for \u201cmeal kits.\u201d They remove the hassle of planning and shopping by shipping selected recipes\u2019 necessary ingredients to your doorstep\u2014right down to that tablespoon of Sriracha. Meal-kit pioneer Blue Apron, which listed on the stock market last month, faces dozens of competitors, with prices that range as high as $18 a person. There\u2019s even a Tom Brady meal kit.Tovala\u2019s subscription kits, with meals costing $2 a person more than Blue Apron\u2019s, arrive mostly oven-ready. For a smoky mesquite chicken dish, I peeled plastic off the top of two foil containers and poured the included sauce over the raw chicken. That took 10 seconds.You put the containers in the oven, and the oven scans a QR code on the leftover cardboard wrappers to know what\u2019s cooking. Press a big button to start.An alert pops up on your phone when dinner\u2019s ready\u2014usually in 15 to 20 minutes. Just promise me you\u2019ll use all this newfound free time to call your mom, OK?The oven is big enough to cook up to four meals at once, depending on their size. You\u2019re still responsible for taking the hot meal out of the oven and putting the elements onto your own plate.Tovala\u2019s founders, graduates of the Y Combinator startup program, say their meal kits are for people who tried others but gave up because they were too much work. On some nights, that includes me. I\u2019ve subscribed to Blue Apron for nearly two years, but there are plenty of times when I just couldn\u2019t be bothered with 30 to 45 minutes of chopping, mixing and cooking\u2014leaving some ingredients to go to waste.Tovala promises that, unlike takeout, its meals contain healthy and \u201cclean\u201d ingredients; they range from 450 to 650 calories, not counting toppings like Parmesan cheese. Of the more than 10 meals we tried, all were at least diner-quality and most better than that. We had small quibbles: The sauce for the corn-and-mushroom pasta had an overpowering raw-garlic kick. But mostly, we were impressed. The cheese on top of a rigatoni dish was beautifully browned. All the salmon dishes were cooked just right.What you give up, even versus other meal kits, is control over salt, sugar and fat in your food\u2014and a sense of accomplishment. When a machine does all the work, can you still call it \u201chome cooking\u201d?And for many budgets, $12 a person is a lot for dinner. But it\u2019s less than the $17.50 a person it typically costs to go to a full-service restaurant, including tax, tip and parking, says Bob Goldin, partner at research firm Pentallect. Meal kits \u201care succeeding to a significant extent because they are bringing the experience of eating-out to the home,\u201d he says.The Tovala oven, sold separately from the meal kits, is both the key to its magic and likely the biggest hurdle to mass adoption. It\u2019s a steam oven\u2014a cooking technology that hasn\u2019t made it into many homes because it requires some expertise to operate. Restaurants use steam ovens to bake, cook and reheat food faster, more evenly and (most important) without drying things out. Instead of \u201ccook at 325 degrees for 20 minutes,\u201d the Tovala oven runs a program that might involve cycles of steaming, convection baking and broiling.Tovala\u2019s internet connection and companion app are what make it accessible: You don\u2019t have to know anything about food science to make a tasty dish. Increasingly, kitchen gear is building in smarts. A pricier oven, called June, uses machine learning to identify and cook dishes to perfection. But most of these devices\u2014from Wi-Fi Crock-Pots to burners that teach you how to fry\u2014have an uphill battle convincing people they\u2019re are worth an upgrade.Yet even if Tovala\u2019s convenience is obvious, its business model could complicate things. Silicon Valley is in love with the idea of combining an internet-of-things gadget with an e-commerce subscription for recurring revenue. This \u201cKeurig of\u2026\u201d mind-set has produced plenty of stinkers: There\u2019s a juicer that only squeezes proprietary packs of veggie mush, a beer-making robot and several competing bartender robots.The Tovala oven isn\u2019t quite as nutty. It cooks entire meals but also can be used to cook store-bought foods. The oven dial control isn\u2019t intuitive, but with the companion app you can make your own recipes, or choose presets for dishes like chicken and broccoli. (Tovala promises more soon.)Here\u2019s the problem: You have to buy the $400 oven before you can discover how delicious and simple these meals are. It\u2019s not that the oven is overpriced: It\u2019s only about $100 more than a similar nonconnected steam oven from Cuisinart. And Tovala provides a 180-day no-questions-asked return policy\u2014a generous trial period.It\u2019s just most people don\u2019t need another large box on their cramped kitchen counters. The Tovala oven can replace your toaster, but it doesn\u2019t provide the same functions as a microwave. It also has a steam vent on top, so it requires decent ventilation and can\u2019t be placed directly under cabinets.I could see Tovala ovens being a hit in college dorms and apartment complexes\u2014and with parents of 20-somethings who want their fresh grads to eat better. It would be easier to justify trying if Tovala could find a way to wrap the cost of the oven into the meal subscription.Will you be an early adopter in hopes that Tovala catches on? Or do you wait to make sure you don\u2019t get stuck with a $400 steam oven but no ready-to-eat meals, should the startup fail?

Gold pays its holders nothing and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.Following the testimony, the U.S. dollar weakened and bond yields fell, helping to support gold prices. The WSJ Dollar Index was recently down 0.3% at 87.93, making dollar-denominated metals like gold and copper cheaper for foreign buyers.Mr. Hug said that the central bank may focus more on normalizing the balance sheet than raising interest rates now, but traders are still looking for guidance on the timing of the tightening. \u201cIt sounded a little waffle-y to me,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, copper for September delivery settled up 0.4% to $2.6840 a pound in New York, rallying from the inventory-driven pressure on the potential of fresh mining strikes in Chile.Workers at             Antofagasta                   PLC\u2019s Zald\u00edvar copper mine in Chile voted in favor of striking on Monday. That followed a similar vote last week at Antofagasta\u2019s Centinela mine, also in Chile. Both sets of negotiations are now in a period in which the employer can request government mediation.\u201cIt will be surprising if the miners change their view,\u201d said       Carsten Menke,        a commodity analyst at Julius Baer. With Zald\u00edvar near to Escondida, the scene of a 43-day strike earlier in the year, that local precedent increases the likelihood of a strike, Mr. Menke added.The impact of the votes to strike was surprising given that labor actions at the world\u2019s two largest copper mines\u2014Grasberg in Indonesia and Escondida\u2014had little effect on the base metal\u2019s value, the analyst said, adding that he expected the support to be short-term.The two recent votes to strike lifted copper from inventory-driven falls which had weighed down prices in the days preceding Wednesday. London Metal Exchange stockpiles grew by 30% in the four days from June 29\u2014the fourth large deposit since December, according to Investec in a morning note.Those increases have raised questions over whether or not LME stock movements actually reflect supply-and-demand fundamentals. \u201cThe inflows have been largely in Asian warehouses and typically do not reside for long suggesting that a speculative battle is under way between bulls and bears,\u201d Investec said.Write to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 14:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/metals-gold-rises-on-yellens-remarks-1499874910", "news_title": "Metals: Gold Rises on Yellen\u2019s Remarks", "keywords": "base metals,copper,gold,industrial metals,precious metals,Antofagasta,ANTO.LN,UK:ANTO,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,metals markets,gold markets,commodity,financial market news,non-ferrous metals markets,precious metals markets,metal ore mining,copper ore,nickel ore mining,banking,central banking,basic materials,resources,credit,financial services,gold ore mining,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "His Restaurant: Miller Union in Atlanta, Ga.What He Is Known For: A deep affinity for vegetable cookery, from root to stem. Inventive dishes that seem timeless.MILD, SUCCULENT and gently sweet when cooked, summer squash is too often overlooked at this time of year, when other, bolder, brighter vegetables are also coming into season. But it makes a great base on which to layer other ingredients and flavors.\u201cIn the South, we cook it with onions and butter,\u201d said Atlanta chef       Steven Satterfield.       In this simple recipe, he adds fennel and a handful of herbs to a saut\u00e9 of squash, onions and butter, and then lays pan-seared sea-bass fillets on top.Mr. Satterfield begins by working herbs, shallots, lemon zest and juice, and garlic into the butter, which lends flavor to both the vegetables and the fish. The fennel brings a decidedly Proven\u00e7al anise accent to the dish. Low, slow stewing concentrates the squash\u2019s delicate flavor. A splash of white wine and a final pat of herb butter make a simple, scrumptious sauce.A little bit south-of-France, a little bit south-of-the-Mason-Dixon, this fresh and flavorful dish will change the mind of anyone who\u2019s underestimated the low-key appeal of summer squash.Total Time: 35 minutes Serves: 41. Separate fennel bulb from stalks. Quarter bulb and remove tough outer layers. Dice bulb. Thinly slice stalks into rounds. Mince fronds.2. In a medium bowl, stir together butter, dill, fennel fronds, chives, tarragon, garlic, shallots, and lemon juice and zest. Season with salt and pepper. Set a lidded large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat and stir in 1\u00bd tablespoons butter mixture. Add fennel bulb and stalks and onions. Saut\u00e9 until onions turn translucent, 3 minutes.

Swirl in oil and season fish with salt and pepper on both sides. Once pan is very hot, carefully lay in fillets. (If necessary, cook in batches to avoid crowding.) Cook fish until golden brown on underside, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip fish and pour in wine to deglaze pan.

But price pressures had \u201ceased slightly\u201d in some districts as gasoline prices and dairy and crop costs fell.The report was based on information collected in June across the central bank\u2019s 12 districts.Broadly, the Fed said economic activity expanded at a slight to moderate pace in June. The Fed reported economic growth was modest in six districts, moderate in four districts and slight in two districts. Looking forward, many districts expect modest to moderate gains in the months ahead.The report found that \u201cwage pressures generally trended with employment conditions.\u201d A broad range of industries reported a shortage of qualified workers.But wage pressure didn\u2019t appear to translate into stronger inflation.\u201cPrices continued to rise modestly\u201d across districts, with several reporting higher construction materials costs and increased home prices. Still, highway construction costs were lower than expected in Minnesota, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis reported. Elsewhere, restaurants and manufacturers reported price declines.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said in congressional testimony Wednesday it would be premature to judge that the economy wasn\u2019t on the path to 2% inflation over the next couple of years.\u201cWe have seen increasing strength in the labor market that continues, and although there are lags in this process, I believe that\u2019s something that over time will put upward pressure on both wages and prices,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The Commerce Department reported the personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose 1.4% in May from a year earlier. That was a slowdown from a 2.1% annual increase in February, the only month since 2012 the index\u2019s annual increase exceeded the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target for inflation. The Labor Department will report the June consumer-price index on Friday. Economists expect only a very modest increase from May for that inflation measure.The beige book showed consumer spending to be rising across a majority of districts, led by increases in tourism and retail sales, outside of auto dealerships. The San Francisco Fed reported strong tourism demand despite \u201ccontinued uncertainty surrounding immigration policy\u201d that slowed international bookings at hotels in Southern California.The next Fed policy meeting is July 25-26. At their meeting last month, officials raised interest rates for the third time in as many quarters to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more rate increase this year.Officials will also contemplate when to begin shrinking the Fed\u2019s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.Several Fed officials said the central bank had sufficiently prepared markets to begin that process \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d according to the minutes of the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting.

It was packed long before favorite son Andy Murray took Centre Court for his quarterfinal match.This was not long after the morning television shows had relived the glory of new favorite daughter Johanna Konta\u2019s three-set duel in her quarterfinal Tuesday afternoon. That win set Konta up for a semifinal showdown Thursday with       Venus Williams       and seemed to signal a few days of all-out Britmania at Wimbledon.But then Murray, hobbled with funky hip, coughed up a seemingly comfortable lead over Sam Querrey and lost 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(4), 6-1, 6-1 to the American.Suddenly Konta has the British stage all to herself, and what a stage it is. This sport-loving nation will all but stall Thursday afternoon when Konta takes the court.Yes, there are some other characters involved in this year\u2019s Wimbledon drama\u2014random players named Federer and Williams, who look like they have some potential. But there is now a singular plot line starring the late-blooming Konta, who has this island nation teeming with hopes for tennis history that does not involve Murray.Headline from The Telegraph: 14 Reasons Why Johanna Konta is the Best Woman in Britain Right Now. \u201cNo. 5 She\u2019s a foodie who rates ice cream; No.9 She used to drive a             Peugeot                   hatchback.\u201d\u201cI hope she goes on to win the tournament,\u201d Murray said of Konta, after losing the chance for a dreamed-of British double championship. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t.\u201dNo British woman has been in the semifinal since Virginia Wade in 1978. Wade was the last Briton to win it in 1977. With each forehand winner struck, the applause and roars for Konta grow less polite. A collective, angsty grumble rises each time she faces crucial moments.\u200b\u201d\u200bIt\u2019s taken so long,\u201d said Wade, who watched Konta from a box during her Tuesday win over Simona Halep of Romania and had her comments distributed throughout the press room that evening.Now the British\u2014protectors of the tennis tradition who are not all that great at playing the game\u2014are two matches from having a tennis queen of Wimbledon.Brazilians worship their soccer team and Americans would bellow \u201cU.S.A\u2026U.S.A\u201d at the World Cup of Marbles if given the opportunity. But there is no enthusiasm in sports quite like British homerism. It is desperate mix of glee, fatalism, and nostalgia for a long ago time when everything seemed to go the way of the Empire.They come by it honestly. The nation has had so many hopes for international sports glory\u2014where have you gone David Beckham?\u2014and not much to show for it. Lately British cyclists rule the world, and hope springs anew that a \u201cgolden generation\u201d of soccer stars may scale the mountain. (Probably not).Murray\u2019s first Wimbledon win in 2013, the first by a \u200bBritish man since the 1930s, was supposed to have done away with all that tennis anxiety. But the stunning emergence of Konta, who is already 26 years old, has the nation roiling all over again. Primal screams during match point against Halep finished off the rattled Romanian, who was already tweaked that Konta appeared to take longer than the allotted four minutes for a toilet break after the second set\u2014with no penalty from the hometown officials\u200b.\u201cIt gives you goosebumps,\u201d Konta said of the support, though she did say the mid-point screams were a bit much.Born in Australia to Hungarian parents but raised in England since age 14, Konta was everywhere and nowhere in tennis for years. She trained in Spain. She trained in Texas. She bounced back and forth from tournaments on the minor league ITF circuit to the top-tier WTA Tour, winning occasionally, losing a lot.She broke through in Australia in 2016, making the Open semifinals, but she had never gotten past the second round at Wimbledon before this year. Now, three of her last four matches have gone three sets, including a second round 7-6, 4-6, 10-8 barn-burner over Donna Vekic of Croatia that marked her matches as must-see events.She credits the late sports psychologist Juan Coto with teaching her not to let her ranking, which was hovering around 150 two years ago, determine her happiness.Her latest coach, Wim Fissette, who previously worked with multiple grand slam winners Victoria Azarenka and Kim Clijsters, has her attacking from the baseline with crushing groundstrokes and swinging through volleys in the middle of the court. Athletic genes help\u2014Konta\u2019s grandfather played for Hungary\u2019s national soccer team.Now she faces a resurgent, 37-year-old Williams, who has won here five times.

Ms. Thurman will portray Chloe, a character described in the show\u2019s press material as a \u201csocialite armed with charm and wit\u201d who is \u201ccoming to terms with politics, her past, her marriage and an uncertain future.\u201dTom Viertel, one of the show\u2019s producers, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a piece about a woman who dominates the world she lives in in a very subtle way.\u201d He added that producers were \u201cjust thrilled\u201d to land Ms. Thurman in the lead role.\u201cThe power of Uma on stage is unparalleled,\u201d said Mr. Viertel, who declined to reveal the show\u2019s budget.Ms. Thurman couldn\u2019t be reached to comment.The production continues the trend of Broadway shows casting Hollywood names in lead roles. Such actors and actresses as Scarlet Johansson, Tom Hanks and Kiefer Sutherland have all appeared on Broadway in recent seasons.The approach can pay off in a big way. But there have been instances where it has backfired. A case in point: a revival this past season of Tennessee Williams\u2019s \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d that starred Oscar winner Sally Field. It failed to garner strong ticket sales and closed more than a month ahead of schedule.Still, expectations are high among Broadway insiders and observers that \u201cThe Parisian Woman\u201d will do well \u2013 not just because of Ms. Thurman, but also because of the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d connection.\u201cI think the combination would make it a rather big draw,\u201d said Christopher McKittrick, an editor with DailyActor.com, a website that covers film and theater news.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 14:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uma-thurman-to-make-broadway-debut-1499883829", "news_title": "Uma Thurman to Make Broadway Debut", "keywords": " broadway debut, house of cards, the parisian woman,uma thurman,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,movies,theater"}, {"content": "After the Canadian dollar rallied to a 12-month high against the U.S. dollar Wednesday on the back of a rate increase by the Bank of Canada, analysts expect the currency to remain strong for the rest of the year.In Wednesday afternoon trading, following the central bank\u2019s first increase in seven years, the U.S. dollar was around C$1.2713, down from C$1.2910 right before the decision, according to data provider CQG. Alternatively, the Canadian dollar is trading around 78.64 U.S. cents, up about 1.6% from Tuesday\u2019s close.The loonie, as the Canadian currency is commonly called due to the loon on its single-dollar coin, has moved up by 8% against its U.S. counterpart since hitting year-to-date lows in early May as positive economic indicators sent strong signals that the central bank was likely to make a move on its overnight policy rate.Currency analysts say more hikes are expected, with market odds betting on one more rate increase by the end of the year. That would help keep the loonie around its current highs.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has sent a strong signal that another rate hike is likely,\u201d said John Curran, managing director at Bendix Foreign Exchange in Toronto. \u201cWhile the loonie has strengthened in the short term, I believe it\u2019s going to top out around these levels.\u201dYgal Bodokh, a currency trader at Velocity Trade in Montreal, said he could see the U.S. dollar falling even further, to the C$1.25 area in the next coming days amid bullish investor sentiment on the Canadian dollar. However, he also anticipates the Bank of Canada to step back from its \u201caggressive tone\u201d in today\u2019s announcement to prevent any further shocks to the country\u2019s closely-watched housing market and household indebtedness levels.\u201cThe Bank of Canada wanted to wake up the market today,\u201d Mr. Bodokh said.While the Bank of Canada has highlighted that future economic data will play a key part in its monetary policy decisions, analysts also expect that oil prices and shorter-termed yield spreads between U.S. and Canadian bonds will continue to be key drivers of the loonie. Wednesday\u2019s testimony from Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       also weakened the U.S. dollar against a broad range of currencies, including Canada\u2019s dollar.The higher currency may impact Canadian exporters who have benefited from a weak Canadian dollar over the past several years, although many of them have already hedged their foreign exchange exposure, blunting the currency\u2019s impact. Still, any strength in the currency may compel manufacturers to import expensive machinery, offsetting any revenue lost from lower sales, said Dennis Darby, president of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters.\u201dIt might be anywhere for 12 to 18 months for a rate change to have an effect on economic activity,\u201d Mr. Darby said in a recent interview.Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said he thinks the rate increase will keep a tighter lid on inflation, helping to damp growth amid slower exports in the next quarter. Tourism and cross-border shopping will remain sensitive to an appreciating Canadian dollar, although notable impact will occur once the loonie reaches a \u201cpressure point\u201d of 80 U.S. cents, or about C$1.25, he said.\u201dIt weighs on inbound tourism when the currency catches up to the current levels,\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t the pull from American tourists out there [as] when we were at the low-to-mid 70 [U.S. cents].\u201dWrite to David George-Cosh at david.george-cosh@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 14:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-dollar-rallies-on-interest-rate-increase-1499871821", "news_title": "Canadian Dollar Rallies After Rate Increase   ", "keywords": "bank of canada,boc,canadian dollar,canadian loonie,higher rates,increase,rate increase',u.s. dollar,usd,Bank of Canada,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Bank earnings season gets under way on Friday with four of the biggest U.S. lenders\u2014            Citigroup Inc.,J.P.

Next week,             Bank of America Corp.      ,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and Morgan Stanley will release their results. Here are five things to keep an eye on as the earnings announcements arrive.The trading surge that supported banks\u2019 bottom lines over the past few quarters petered out in the spring of 2017. Relatively calm markets have prompted lower levels of activity among banks\u2019 clients, leading bank executives to tell investors to expect lower revenues. Average daily trading volumes fell for municipal, mortgage and corporate bonds during the second quarter, though U.S. government bond trading volumes rose, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to trade around right now,\u201d said       Marianne Lake,        J.P. Morgan\u2019s finance chief, at an investor conference in May. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been that many exciting events, and we need a few more of them.\u201dThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise short-term interest rates in June, the fourth rate increase since December 2015, should boost banks\u2019 lending income. The rates banks charge on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other types of loans vary depending on the Fed\u2019s target. Those higher yields will help push net-interest income at the median big U.S. bank up by 6.2% in the second quarter, according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets.The fly in the lending soup: The rate of growth for business lending at U.S. banks has been decelerating for the past year. And in the second quarter, the slowdown became more pronounced. The rate of growth for commercial and industrial loans fell to just 1.87% at the end of June compared with a year earlier. Such loans were growing at around a 7% pace at the start of the year. Last year at this time, business loans were increasing by nearly 10%.             U.S. Bancorp                   CEO       Andy Cecere       said at an industry conference in June that one reason for the slackening was that business executives want to see how the political landscape evolves before borrowing more: \u201cThey are waiting for more certainty around tax policy, trade policy, health care, infrastructure spend, so they\u2019re just a little bit on hold,\u201d Mr. Cecere said.Companies are also cutting back on borrowing from the capital markets as well. Issuance of investment-grade bonds fell 6% in the second quarter, while high-yield bond issues fell 4%, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. That contributed to a 14% overall decline in debt capital markets volume. That, along with drops in deal making, should make for a weak quarter for some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest businesses. The lone bright spot was initial public offerings. Thanks to listings like             Altice USA,       which was the biggest U.S. telecom IPO since 2000, IPO volume was up 53% from the second quarter of 2016, according to Goldman.After years of historically strong loan performance, banks are starting to see upticks in defaults in certain portfolios. That is especially happening with credit-card and auto loans: Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. show that the net charge-off rate for each type of consumer loan is at or near multiyear highs. While banks\u2019 business borrowers are in better shape, loans to energy companies and retailers could be under stress given the tumult both industries are facing, according to analysts at Evercore ISI.Write to Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 14:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-earnings-are-coming-5-things-to-watch-1499882400", "news_title": "Bank Earnings Are Coming: Five Things to Watch", "keywords": " auto loans,bank earnings, commercial loans,credit cards, fed, industrial loans , interest rates, lenders, loans, trading, trading revenue,J.P.

But three days into what New York Gov.

Berkshire, which is       Warren Buffett\u2019s       energy unit, signed a $9 billion cash deal last week but needs approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas as well as from a bankruptcy judge to finalize the buyout.Instead of the usual 180-day regulatory review period, Berkshire Hathaway will try to get the PUC Texas to act in 60 to 90 days, said Chad Husnick, lawyer for Energy Future Holdings Corp., which owns 80% of Oncor, at a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.The goal is for Berkshire to show up in bankruptcy court in October, he said, to win confirmation of an Energy Future bankruptcy restructuring plan that will cement Berkshire\u2019s acquisition of Oncor.Meanwhile, Elliott, Energy Future\u2019s biggest bondholder, is lining up financing for a counteroffer that is picking up support from other junior bondholders who believe the Berkshire buyout will leave them shortchanged. Instead of the 80-cents-on-the-dollar recovery they were expecting under an earlier Energy Future plan, junior bondholders calculate they will receive only 24 cents for every dollar of debt they own, said       Gregg Galardi,        a lawyer for Elliott, at Wednesday\u2019s court hearing.At the hearing, Energy Future\u2019s legal team sketched out a timeline for future action, one that calls for Berkshire to initiate formal proceedings with a Monday filing with the Texas PUC, which has twice killed deals for Oncor, an essential component of the Texas power grid.On Aug. 10, Energy Future will ask a judge for authority to go through with the Berkshire deal, which is built into a chapter 11 plan slated for hearings to start Oct. 24 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington.Twice before, the bankruptcy court confirmed chapter 11 plans premised on the sale of Oncor, only to see those plans upended by regulators. This time, Berkshire will go to regulators before coming to bankruptcy court.\u201dI think that makes a lot of sense,\u201d Judge       Christopher Sontchi       said.Until last week, Oncor was to have been sold to             NextEra Energy Inc.,       a Florida power company. NextEra\u2019s proposed buyout has foundered for months in regulatory action, and Energy Future began talking to others, including Elliott.Wednesday, Elliott\u2019s lawyer complained that Energy Future insisted on keeping creditors in the dark about the negotiations that led to Berkshire\u2019s $9 billion all-cash buyout proposal.\u201dWe understand that this was not the position of Oncor and it was not the position of Berkshire,\u201d Mr. Galardi said.As a result, creditors are moving as quickly as possible to complete their alternative transaction, doubting they can get an improved offer from Mr. Buffett, who is famously resistant to bargaining once a deal is agreed.\u201dWe all know Berkshire\u2019s MO [modus operandi]--that they will not negotiate a deal once they execute it,\u201d Mr. Galardi said.Elliott is       Paul Singer\u2019s       $33 billion hedge fund. It bought up Energy Future debt at strategic positions in the capital structure, hedging against losses and gaining a \u201cblocking\u201d position that means the company needs Elliott\u2019s vote if it wants to avoid a pricey bankruptcy court fight.Energy Future\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Husnick, said he understands there have been some discussions between Berkshire and Elliott.Energy Future, the former TXU Corp., filed for bankruptcy in April 2014, burdened with tens of billions in debt left over from a record-breaking leveraged buyout seven years earlier. While most of the operating businesses left chapter 11 to become a separate company, Energy Future and its 80% stake in Oncor remain in bankruptcy, with costs running more than $20 million a month, according to Mr. Husnick.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Berkshire Pushes Texas to Clear Oncor Bid in Fight With Elliott.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 13:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/berkshire-aims-for-fast-regulatory-action-on-oncor-deal-1499878926", "news_title": "Berkshire Aims for Fast Regulatory Action on Oncor Deal ", "keywords": " bankruptcy court, berkshire hathaway energy, elliott management, energy future holdings,nextera,oncor,pe restructuring, warren buffet,Elliott Management,Energy Future Holdings,Berkshire Hathaway Energy,BRKA,Oncor,Berkshire Hathaway Cl B,BRK.B,Gregg Galardi,Paul Singer,Warren Buffett,Christopher Sontchi,Chad Husnick,regulation,government policy,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,electric power distribution,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,electric utilities,financial services,investing,securities,utilities"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014      Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       government revised its budget plans to front-load deeper tax cuts the French president says will drive job creation and growth.The French government made the tweaks after Prime Minister       \u00c9douard Philippe       said only a week ago that some tax cuts would be delayed as the country faced a mountain of debt and a larger-than-expected deficit this year.On Wednesday, however, Mr. Philippe said that after consulting with Mr. Macron he would make tax cuts to the order of \u20ac11 billion ($12.6 billion) in 2018 to spur the gradual acceleration in the economy. To finance the cuts and keep the deficit under the European Union\u2019s limit of 3% of economic output, the government will find \u20ac20 billion of savings in 2018.\u201cWe want to spark a tax blast effect in favor of investment, employment and growth,\u201d Mr. Philippe said in an interview with French daily Les Echos.The to-and-fro on the budget plans shows the challenge Mr. Macron faces to juggle competing pledges that defined his political brand. On one hand, the 39-year-old leader is seeking to improve France\u2019s standing in Europe by repairing the country\u2019s finances, while on the other hand he is promising pro-business measures that can be costly to the public coffers.The announcement of delays to tax cuts drew criticism from business leaders last week, but overall Mr. Macron\u2019s pro-business stance has struck a chord with investors. At an event promoting Paris as a financial center on Tuesday, J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive       Jamie Dimon       praised the new government for making the capital city a more attractive place to invest and recruit thanks to a promised loosening of labor laws and lower taxes on the financial sector.\u201cIt has a new president who I think is great, who\u2019s behind entrepreneurship, growth and jobs. And it\u2019s nice to be wanted,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.Of the \u20ac11 billion in tax cuts in 2018, the French prime minister said overhauling France\u2019s wealth tax to encourage investment will cost the state \u20ac3 billion in lost revenue next year. Cuts to taxes on savings will cost \u20ac1.5 billion and a reduction in local-residency taxes another \u20ac3 billion.To finance the tax cuts and keep a lid on the deficit, the government will freeze the volume of public spending. That will deliver \u20ac20 billion of savings in 2018, Mr. Philippe said, without giving details of where the state will rein in spending.Overall, the deficit will fall to 2.7% of gross domestic product in 2018 from 3% this year, the government said. In 2019, the deficit will rise to 2.9% of GDP due to the one-time cost of transforming a tax credit into a straight tax cut. The deficit will then drop to 1.5% of economic in 2020, according to the government forecasts.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-government-tweaks-budget-to-fund-tax-cuts-1499868663", "news_title": "French Government Tweaks Budget to Fund Tax Cuts", "keywords": "budget deficit,economic growth,edouard philippe,emmanuel macron,french budget,french economy,Emmanuel Macron,\u00c9douard Philippe,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The Trump administration is due to release its findings shortly on whether steel imports threaten U.S. national security. It is reportedly considering imposing \u201c232\u201d sanctions, referring to an article in the 1962 Trade Expansion Act that allows the president to impose tariffs. This provision has been invoked only five times in its 55 year history, as past presidents preferred to use antidumping and countervailing duty cases to impose more targeted sanctions.Historically, the U.S. hasn\u2019t been shy about helping the steel industry. At the end of 2016, the federal government had 113 protective measures in effect for that industry alone, the work of both Republican and Democratic administrations. As undersecretary of commerce under President       George W. Bush,        I was responsible for this enforcement program.There is a broad consensus among trade professionals that China and other nations subsidize their steel industries, though the extent of this aid and whether it violates World Trade Organization agreements is more debatable. A program in the U.S. to help a steel mill expand in an economically depressed area, for example, would be a legal subsidy.The issue is further complicated by long-term trends of automation and product substitution that put more downward pressure on the industry than trade issues. Steel plants need fewer workers than they used to. Cars use less steel. Advances in material sciences allow for specialty plastics and polymers in industrial use.The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) states that the U.S. steel industry employs some 140,000 workers, which might include total company employment such as accountants, warehouse staff and cafeteria workers. AISI also notes that in 30 years, the industry has enjoyed a five-fold increase in productivity. In other words, even if the Trump administration is completely successful in its efforts, steel employment will almost certainly continue to shrink.Here are a few points to keep in mind in contemplating a steel strategy.First, tariffs are more useful as a means than as an end. The threat of tariffs can help in negotiations, but they are more likely to backfire if put into effect. A wise negotiator will use the prospect of tariffs to break down trade barriers.The goal is to get the other country to lower tariffs, not to get the U.S. to raise them. If you must raise tariffs, keep the hike modest and short-term to minimize the cost to the U.S. economy and the prospect of retaliation.That\u2019s why targeted tariffs are preferable to the blanket 232 variety. The more selective approach allows the government to fight unfair trade practices on a case-by-case basis.Second, have a positive trade agenda by liberalizing with those who play by the rules. Trade friction isn\u2019t a substitute for a trade policy. Bad cops work best if paired with good cops.Mr. Trump has stated that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is unacceptable, but he has yet to state what would be acceptable. The more countries we have playing under rules that the U.S. has negotiated, the better off the steel industry, and the U.S. economy in general, will be.Third, keep cost-benefit analysis in mind. I am not in favor of foreign subsidies, but we should note that they can help the U.S. economy, even as they put pressure on the U.S. steel industry.It\u2019s not just that imported steel has a 30% share of the U.S. steel market. The imports constrain pricing across the entire market. So the U.S. steel industry might be worse off with more imports, but industries that use steel, such as autos, appliance manufacturers and construction, might be better off. Measured in aggregate, tariffs will likely hurt the U.S. as much as the target countries.Not only are tariffs a dead-weight cost that will hike U.S. costs and inflation, but they will also open the door to retaliation. Some of America\u2019s trading partners might accept the tariffs with equanimity, but if history is a guide, most will feel compelled to respond with their own tariffs. This is how trade wars start.Fourth, fight micro problems with macro solutions. If employment in the steel industry will continue to shrink, let\u2019s get serious about economic growth. The U.S. needs tax reform and an aggressive growth culture to make job creation as easy as possible. A 57-year-old steelworker is unlikely to learn computer code, but he can learn to operate shaping machines for specialty polymers, not radically different from metal-bending.Finally, be aware of rent-seeking. Companies\u2019 competitiveness is constantly changing, and those which are failing to keep up with the market may ask for government help. Acceding to their request for tariffs would not only be the wrong policy, but it would make the U.S. as a nation less competitive.President Trump has a tough set of decisions in front of him. Can he push back against illegal subsidies while avoiding collateral damage to the U.S. and other economies? Knowing when to throw a punch might be part of the solution, but knowing when to hold a punch might be even more important.Mr. Lavin is CEO of Export Now, which helps U.S. brands in China e-commerce, and served as U.S. undersecretary of commerce for international trade from 2005 to 2007.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trouble-with-sanctioning-chinese-steel-1499878296", "news_title": "The Trouble With Sanctioning Chinese Steel", "keywords": " american iron and steel institute, china, international trade,steel, tariffs, trade policy, world trade organization,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "MOSCOW\u2014The Kremlin said Wednesday the release of an email chain by       Donald Trump Jr.       was part of a \u201clong-running TV drama,\u201d dismissing an alleged Russian government offer to pass on information to damage       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       presidential campaign.\u201cThere is nothing to investigate,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman       Dmitry Peskov       said, according to the news agency RIA-Novosti, after he was asked to comment on the publication of emails that showed the younger Mr. Trump attended a meeting last year to discuss purportedly incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton.In his comments to RIA-Novosti and other news agencies, Mr. Peskov said the disclosure appeared timed to damage U.S.-Russian relations after a meeting last Friday between President Donald Trump and Russian President       Vladimir Putin.       He compared the new revelations with a \u201clong-running TV drama that can compete with the most successful series airing in the U.S.,\u201d the news agency Interfax reported.The Russian government has maintained that it wasn\u2019t involved in any effort to tilt last year\u2019s election in favor of Mr. Trump. But the release of the emails Tuesday appeared to indicate that Russia\u2019s prosecutor general may have sought to sought to influence the Trump campaign through Aras Agalarov, the Russian-Azerbaijani businessman who organized a Moscow beauty pageant in 2013 with Mr. Trump.The Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office said in a written statement to The Wall Street Journal that it \u201cdoes not exchange information and does not conduct any meetings at the international level outside the framework regulated by international legal agreements and Russian procedural legislation. Interaction with the competent authorities of the United States is no exception.\u201dThe statement added that its cooperation with U.S. counterparts was \u201cquite effective.\u201dMr. Agalarov       told Russian radio station Business FM on Wednesday that it was his son Emin, a pop star, who had the primary relationship with the younger Mr. Trump, and called the released correspondence \u201csome kind of fiction.\u201dWith tensions on many fronts, U.S.-Russian relations remain in a deep freeze. The U.S. and its European allies imposed sanctions on Russia following the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and Russia\u2019s backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine. Washington has also been at odds with Moscow over Mr. Putin\u2019s support for Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad.The scandal embroiling the Trump administration has solidified doubts among Russian officials that a rapprochement with Washington is possible. Russian officials say they believe that national-security hawks in the U.S. and the media have a vested interest in stoking confrontation with Russia.Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       on Wednesday expressed incredulity over reports about the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s contact with Russian lawyer       Natalia Veselnitskaya      in the meeting, which was arranged through the Agalarovs.\u201cI did not know about this fact, I heard it from the news,\u201d he said in Brussels. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how some people make an elephant out of a fly\u2014and maybe there wasn\u2019t even a fly.\u201dWrite to Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kremlin-dismisses-alleged-russian-offer-of-incriminating-clinton-info-1499869641", "news_title": "Kremlin Dismisses Alleged Russian Offer of Incriminating Clinton Info", "keywords": "russia trump,russia u.s.,Donald Trump Jr,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The word of the day at the Federal Reserve is \u201cgradual.\u201d It might not be the word of tomorrow.In congressional testimony Wednesday, Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       noted that the central bank has \u201cgradually\u201d tightened policy this year, that \u201cadditional gradual rate hikes\u201d are likely in the years to come, and that policy makers intend to \u201cgradually reduce\u201d the Fed\u2019s bondholdings.\u201cGradual\u201d is the stuff of central banker dreams, but up until late last year the Fed struggled to realize them. Whether it was the 2013 taper tantrum or the global credit worries that hit early last year, the Fed\u2019s plans to wean the economy off its easy-money policies were repeatedly thwarted.With the U.S. and global economies on better footing, it is unlikely the Fed will be forced to delay its tightening efforts. The bigger risk is that falling unemployment will force the Fed to raise rates faster than either it or investors expect.The unemployment rate, at 4.4%, is a bit below what Fed policy makers think is its long-run, just-right level for the economy. But slow wage growth and low inflation raise the possibility the right rate might be even lower than it is today. If the unemployment rate were to slowly drift lower, the Fed might be open to sticking to its \u201cgradual\u201d guns and finding out what the right rate is.The problem is the drop in the unemployment rate has been anything but gradual. It is nearly a half point lower than it was at the start of the year, and at the recent pace of hiring it could fall below 4% by January. That would put the Fed in a situation where it had to guess whether the labor market was overheating.The consequences of guessing it wasn\u2019t overheating, and being wrong, would be dangerous. The Fed would then need to raise rates sharply in an effort to push the unemployment rate higher. And, as Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist       Ethan Harris       points out, increases in the unemployment rate of a few tenths of a percentage point are usually followed by recessions.Instead of running that risk, the Fed would probably raise rates faster than it now has mapped out.

Chris Christie\u2019s national ambitions, was sentenced Wednesday to three years probation.In sentencing Mr. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to two felony counts, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton said his conduct was inexcusable, but noted he had cooperated extensively with federal prosecutors.\u201cYou, and only you, had at least made an attempt to rectify some of the wrongs, unlike some of the others in this case,\u201d she said during the sentencing in federal court in Newark.Judge Wigenton also ordered Mr. Wildstein to pay some $24,000 in restitution and fines, and serve 500 hours of community service.The lane closures, which created five days of traffic jams in Fort Lee, N.J., which sits at the foot of the bridge, were intended as political payback for the borough\u2019s Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, who didn\u2019t endorse       Mr. Christie\u2019s       reelection bid, Mr. Wildstein said during the trial last year.Though Mr. Christie, a Republican, never was charged or accused of wrongdoing, the ensuing political scandal and questions of what he knew and when he knew it haunted his 2016 presidential campaign and potential opportunities with the Trump administration.Mr. Wildstein, who confessed to devising the lane-closure plan, said in court on Wednesday that he was sorry for his actions. \u201cIt was stupid and it was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI violated the law and I profoundly regret it.\u201dFederal prosecutors praised Mr. Wildstein\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cooperation\u201d and said the information he provided led to the convictions of       Bridget Kelly,        a former aide to Mr. Christie, and       Bill Baroni,        a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.During the trial, Mr. Wildstein described brazen and at times petty political behavior by himself and his co-conspirators, which he said was intended solely to support the career of the governor they called their \u201cone constituent.\u201dAttorneys for both Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly argued Mr. Wildstein was a master manipulator and a liar whose confessions were self serving. Mr. Wildstein admitted to past lies and political schemes but said he was remorseful and telling the truth about what happened during the lane closures.Both Ms. Kelly, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and Mr. Baroni, who was sentenced to two years, are appealing.Under sentencing guidelines outlined in his plea agreement, Mr. Wildstein faced up to 27 months in prison, but prosecutors had recommended he receive probation. A lenient sentence for Mr. Wildstein would encourage others involved in public-corruption cases to cooperate, they said.In court on Wednesday, both Mr. Wildstein and the judge referenced the political atmosphere in which the bridge scandal took place.Judge Wigenton said there clearly had been a culture and environment in the governor\u2019s office that made the conduct of the three co-conspirators seem acceptable. \u201cThis culminates a sad chapter in the history of New Jersey,\u201d she said.\u201cEach of us put our faith and trust in a man who neither earned nor deserved it,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said Wednesday, adding he had \u201cdrank the Kool-Aid\u201d of a man he had known since his teenage years.On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Christie said in a written statement: Mr. Wildstein \u201cis a liar who admitted throughout his testimony that he fabricated evidence of a relationship with the governor that never existed to enhance people\u2019s perception of his power, replete with \u2018rules\u2019 and \u2018sayings\u2019 that existed only in his own mind.\u201dMr. Wildstein, a onetime classmate of Mr. Christie, was born in Newark and grew up in Livingston, N.J., according to a sentencing memo submitted by his lawyer.A self-described political operative, he began his political career at age 12 when he volunteered on the campaign of a state senator. He later worked on numerous political campaigns, served as a mayor of Livingston and worked as a political blogger.Mr. Wildstein has been married for 25 years and has three children, according to court documents.

Waller,        vice president of             Toll Brothers                   City Living, which is developing 10 Provost in Jersey City\u2019s Powerhouse Arts District.\u201cWe have created a development that will represent the pinnacle of quality residential development in Jersey City,\u201d said       Ning Yuan,        president of China Construction America, which is developing Park and Shore through its investment arm, Strategic Capital. China Construction America is a subsidiary of             China State Construction Engineering Corp.       Ltd., one of the world\u2019s largest investment and construction groups.Even before the formal launch of a showroom this week, the building was showcased for buyers in China. Well over 20% of the apartments are in contract, according to       Phillip Gesue,        chief development officer of Strategic Capital.When the condominium market collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, it left Jersey City with a large excess of unsold apartments that took years to work through.Thousands of apartments have since been added in Jersey City in tall apartment towers dotting the skyline across from lower Manhattan, but nearly all were rentals. In addition, developers have more than 8,000 rental units in the pipeline.Brokers and analysts said the return of condo development reflects new market forces in a revitalized Jersey City, driven by high demand and rising prices. In Jersey City there is a 2.2-month supply of condominiums at the current sales pace, and in neighboring Hoboken there is a 1.7-month supply.\u201cJersey City has arrived as the seventh borough, behind the other five and Hoboken,\u201d said       Jeffrey Otteau,        an appraiser and president of Otteau Group Inc. \u201cIt is now an appendage of Manhattan, and is experiencing a Brooklyn-like trend on the west side of the river.\u201dAs Jersey City\u2019s population soared\u2014rising about 10% since the 2000 census\u2014the new renters, including many with a hankering to buy, have helped create a condo market.\u201cAll of the rental buildings have helped because rents are high,\u201d said       Diana Sutherlin,        principal of the Sutherlin Group at Keller Williams City Life Realty, who has marketed many condo buildings. \u201cYou have renters who are future buyers, and you have thousands more renters coming in.\u201dThe first of a new wave of condos arrived last year with the opening of the Oakman, a 14-story, industrial style condo building with 159 apartments, a block from 10 Provost Street.Ms. Sutherlin is now overseeing marketing of the long-delayed second phase of a condo development known as Gull\u2019s Cove in       Paulus Hook       in Jersey City. The first phase opened in 2008, but construction of the second phase with 107 units stalled before it was restarted last year.Overall condo prices in Jersey City are far above 2008 levels, though they still lag behind those of Hoboken next door. A condo in Jersey City sold for an average of $548 per square foot during the first half of 2017, or roughly $438,000 for an 800 square-foot one-bedroom apartment.The condo at 10 Provost Street is the second stage of a planned three- building complex, including a 550-seat theater to be built behind the facade of an old warehouse.Mr. Waller said the first building, known as The Morgan at Provost Square, opened with 417 rental units in 2015, when Toll Brothers and other developers were only doing rentals.At one point, 10 Provost was going to be part rental and part condo, but with \u201cso much pent-up demand,\u201d the developers switched back to all condos, he said.Prices for the 242 apartments range from well under $500,000 to more than $1.3 million. Amenities include an outdoor pool and a top-floor lounge with harbor views.Park and Shore consists of two buildings with shared amenities. One, known as 75 Park Lane, is a modern 37-story glass tower with 358 apartments. The second, known as Shore House, is a seven-story building with 71 apartments in a loft-style building.Park and Shore, next to a new city park and close to the water, will offer high-end finishes, including stone counters and bathrooms, comparable to those at luxury condominiums in Manhattan, said Mr. Gesue.The project includes an indoor 75-foot pool with large windows, and a teak-lined spa with steam rooms, saunas, a yoga studio and gym. Prices for one-bedroom condos at both buildings start at $640,000. Two-bedroom units start at $1.95 million, and three-bedroom units start at $2.2 million.Write to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/condo-developers-bet-jersey-city-will-be-the-next-brooklyn-1499877656", "news_title": "Condo Developers Bet Jersey City Will Be the Next Brooklyn ", "keywords": "10 provost street at provost square,apartments,condominium sales,condos,jersey city,manhattan,new jersey,park and shore,real estate,residential development,residential real estate,Toll Brothers,TOL,China State Construction Engineering Corp.

Editor in Chief       Gerard Baker       will continue to oversee news coverage and drive strategy.In a memo to staff, Mr. Baker said the \u201cfar-reaching reorganization\u201d wasn\u2019t a \u201cjob-cutting exercise\u201d and that the newsroom\u2019s head count of about 1,300 positions would remain \u201croughly stable.\u201dAs resources dramatically shift toward digital and mobile initiatives, some existing roles could be eliminated, forcing some people to find other positions within the company.\u201cOur news operations have been somewhat like an elegant and rather gorgeous stately home, whose owners have steadily augmented and renovated, rewiring every now and then, adding a new plumbing system, repainting, refurbishing,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cBut eventually it\u2019s time to tear down the old structure and build a new one.\u201d\u201cThe pace of change, the proliferating adoption of new technology, the changing way in which our audience consumes news and information: all require something much more,\u201d said Mr. Baker, who has been editor in chief since 2013.The restructuring creates a number of new senior newsroom roles. Mr. Baker\u2019s new reports will include editors for professional news, digital content strategy, strategic initiatives and a managing editor responsible for non-news matters such as finance and personnel. There also will be an editor of features, special content and events.New roles such as chief news editor, news planning editor and analytics and audience editor will report to Mr. Murray, who will continue to report to Mr. Baker.Many of the open positions will be available to applicants inside and outside the newsroom. The Journal hopes to increase the diversity of its newsroom leadership through the reorganization and aims to have all of these positions filled by the end of the summer.In a later phase of the reorganization, new candidates will be considered to fill existing roles, including the top editors in charge of corporate, financial, U.S. and international coverage. Those coverage chiefs will report to the chief news editor.\u201cWe need to introduce new faces, new skills and a greater diversity to our news leadership. If we are to thrive in the competitive environment newspapers face, we must ensure that we are hiring and promoting the best people,\u201d Mr. Baker said in the memo.The reorganization also will seek to revamp the editing process to publish stories more quickly, by reducing the number of hands a story passes through and the amount of stories published. Mr. Baker will discuss these changes at a series of company town hall meetings on Monday.The Journal, a unit of         News Corp,       launched its WSJ2020 initiative in October 2016. It is part of an effort to revamp operations following a period of sharp declines in print advertising revenue as the news industry undergoes a tumultuous shift toward digital and mobile. Other news organizations, such as the             New York Times,       have launched similar operational reviews.In a move separate from the WSJ2020 initiative, the Journal is completing plans to significantly reduce production of its print editions in Asia and Europe amid a steep drop in advertising revenue and promising growth in digital subscriptions, a person familiar with the matter said.Write to Lukas I.

Andrew Cuomo\u2019s handling of New York City subways and commuter trains, according to a poll released by Quinnipiac University on Wednesday.A plurality of those polled -- 26% -- gave Mr. Cuomo a letter grade of C for his oversight of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees the subways and trains.Meanwhile, 24% gave Mr. Cuomo a B, 17%, an F, and 15% a D. Only 4% of New Yorkers polled gave Mr. Cuomo an A for how he has handled the MTA.In the same poll, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s overall approval rating slipped to 46% from 52% in March.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office declined to comment on the poll.The governor has been dogged by criticisms of city and state transit since the start of the year, and has spent the past several weeks defending his handling of the MTA.In a television interview with NY1 this week, he called criticisms that the MTA has been improperly funded \u201cbaloney.\u201d\u201cNew York state has put more money in the capital plan for the MTA than ever before,\u201d he said.He recently appointed former MTA chairman       Joseph Lhota       to help oversee the MTA again amid a surge in delays, derailments, and other problems.He also dubbed July and August the \u201cSummer of Hell\u201d as Amtrak, which operates Penn Station closes several tracks from July 10 to Sept. 1.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s fellow Democrats, U.S. Sens.

The cartel comprises 14 countries that control about 40% of the world\u2019s crude-oil production, but its power has been tempered by the rise of U.S. shale producers who have flooded the world with new supplies of petroleum.OPEC\u2019s members and 10 producers outside the cartel first agreed last November and December to cap their production at around 1.8 million barrels a day lower than October 2016 levels. The goal was to drain a global oversupply that has kept prices depressed, but the market has remained subdued as U.S. production keeps on throttling upward.Brent, the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark were both up over 1% on Wednesday, but still trading below $49 a barrel.\u201cIt will be a very difficult six months for the oil industry,\u201d including OPEC, said Fatih Birol, the chief of the International Energy Agency, at a conference in Istanbul. \u201cIt will be riding on the storm.\u201dHighlighting the pressures on the cartel, senior OPEC national representatives\u2014known as OPEC governors\u2014are being summoned to the its Vienna headquarters for a special meeting on Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. The people said the rare gathering was for \u201cadministrative matters.\u201dOPEC\u2019s report Wednesday highlighted non-OPEC oil supply, which is projected to increase by 1.14 million barrels a day in 2018, to an average of 58.96 million a day. That uptick is expected to be driven by production in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the U.K.An increase in the non-OPEC supply could meet much of the world\u2019s demand for oil, while directly undercutting the cartel\u2019s efforts to stem the glut and allow prices to rise. Both Russia and Kazakhstan are among the 10 producers that agreed to join the cartel in limiting production, so predictions that they will increase output potentially undermines OPEC\u2019s efforts to manage global oil supplies.The production cap deal, which was extended in May through March 2018, comes amid a historically high surplus of oil in storage that has kept prices between $45 and $55 a barrel for much of the past year.OPEC\u2019s output remained lower than the record levels reached last year, but its numbers showed the strain some producers are under to keep limiting their supplies during the summer season.Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s biggest producer and the world\u2019s largest crude exporter, told OPEC that its output was 10.07 million barrels a day in June\u2014the first time it has exceeded the 10.058 million barrels a day limit it agreed to last year. The kingdom traditionally has high domestic oil demand in the summer that causes its output to rise.The oil market was weighed down by \u201cexcess oil supply and still high oil inventories, despite ongoing high conformity by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers,\u201d the cartel said Wednesday.Oil inventories in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a group of industrialized, oil-consuming nations\u2014fell in May to 3,015 million barrels, but were 235 million barrels above OPEC\u2019s target of the last five-year average, the cartel said.\u201cWe expect this drawdown to gather steam as demand picks up, bringing the markets back to balance,\u201d OPEC Secretary General       Mohammad Barkindo       said Wednesday at a conference in Istanbul.Also speaking in Istanbul,             BP                   PLC Chief Executive       Bob Dudley       said OPEC\u2019s production cuts were working. \u201cThe market is in balance today,\u201d he said.Write to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-output-rose-in-june-despite-planned-cuts-1499857502", "news_title": "OPEC Output Rose in June Despite Planned Cuts", "keywords": "brent crude oil,non-opec,oil glut,oil inventories,oil prices,oil production deal,opec,shale oil,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction,oil sands,shale"}, {"content": "Some people express their passion for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d by binge watching the HBO series, posting plot theories online or perhaps dressing up as mother of dragons Daenerys Targaryen. Others write code.Joakim Skoog       built an application programming interface using quantified and structured data for every character and clan in that fictional world. His \u201cAPI of Ice and Fire\u201d is designed to help other programmers translate the sea of information about the series into \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d apps of their own invention.Inspired by a similar project someone created for the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe, Mr. Skoog, of Bor\u00e5s, Sweden, spent two weeks cleaning and organizing the data he pulled from various encyclopedic sites. The 26-year-old \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d obsessive wanted to contribute to the fan community and try out new technology. As a bonus, the project also helped in the interview for his current job as a software engineer for an online fashion retailer, Nelly.com.Based on novels by George R.R. Martin, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d starts its seventh (and second-to-last) season on HBO Sunday as one of TV\u2019s most popular, most-discussed, and most-pirated series. It is also the most exhaustively analyzed by a subset of international fans who crunch statistics from the fantasy series with the rigor of baseball nerds tracking hits, strikeouts and stolen bases.Among their many efforts: Charting the hundreds of deaths depicted in the series by time, location, method, and perpetrator; logging screen time for every character and using it to study gender balance; mapping relationships between characters based on dialogue; graphing betrayals; charting character connections as a social network; creating statistical analyses of major battles; and using machine learning tools to predict which characters will die.In the spirit of such fantasy analytics, picture a Venn diagram with a circle representing lovers of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and data science, respectively.\u201cI think there\u2019s quite a healthy intersect between the two. The books and the show are really popular, and especially popular among the people who like to do statistics for fun,\u201d says       Myles O\u2019Neill,        a designer at Kaggle, an online community for data analysis that was recently acquired by Google.Mr. O\u2019Neill uploaded several \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d data sets that he discovered on the web, including a compendium of character deaths. Dozens of Kaggle members have used them as grist for coding projects.Unlike sports, politics and other worlds where hard statistics are widely available, narrative fiction is a challenging realm for data jockeys. But the epic scale and complexity of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d calls out for a census. So far, the story spans 60 episodes of television, with details that have increasingly diverged from Mr. Martin\u2019s \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d book series, which itself fills five hefty novels (with at least two more to come, fans pray). There are deep family dynasties, far-flung kingdoms, shifting alliances and double-crossing, historic wars and many, many characters, not all of them human.For casual readers and viewers, it is a challenge to keep it all straight. For data geeks, it is an opportunity for tools used to better understand the real world.Sometimes that involves writing programs to automatically scrape raw information from the user-generated wiki sites where fans compile character bios and other facts from the books and TV series. In other cases, the data mining is more labor intensive. One anonymous grunt (identified only as \u201cninewheels0\u201d) used an iPhone stopwatch to log how much time characters in the TV series (195 of them and counting) appear on screen, then uploaded the findings, and encouraged others to crunch the stats as they wish.\u201cIt\u2019s rare that you find a fictional world that can stand up to this level of scrutiny,\u201d says       Daniel Mintz,        whose title is Chief Data Evangelist at Looker, an analytics company that helps companies like BuzzFeed make sense of audience activity.In the run-up to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d season 7, Looker used ninewheels0\u2019s screen time stats and other data sets to create charts on factors ranging from character popularity to body count per episode. (Season finales have grown increasingly bloody.)As it turns out, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d data doubles as a popular tool for marketing. Companies like Looker use it to make charts, infographics and videos to grab some of the attention that cool stuff related to the series reliably gets online.Not every stat cruncher is a super fan. Shail Deliwala, a 27-year-old data scientist at an artificial intelligence consulting firm in Ahmedabad, India, had never read Mr. Martin\u2019s books or watched the HBO show before diving into an analysis. That gave him an unbiased view of the facts from the fantasy world, he says. He found an inverse correlation between the size of an attacker\u2019s army and its odds of victory in battle, and discovered that characters with lots of dead relatives are less likely to survive.Mr. Deliwala used this work as the basis for a paper featured at a recent conference, titled \u201cExploratory and Predictive Data Analysis Using Machine Learning Tools and Techniques.\u201d He has since embarked on season 1 of the HBO series, but is having second thoughts: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to get addicted.\u201dWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Fans Geek Out on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fans-geek-out-over-game-of-thrones-data-1499877067", "news_title": "Fans Geek Out Over \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Data", "keywords": "game of thrones,game of thrones season 7,got ,hbo shows,television,tv shows,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,radio,reviews"}, {"content": "Output at the eurozone\u2019s factories, mines and utilities rose at the fastest annual pace in more than five years in May, a fresh indication that the area\u2019s economic recovery picked up in the second quarter.The eurozone economy grew at the fastest rate in two years during the first three months of 2017, outpacing the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. Business surveys suggest that the more rapid pace of growth has continued, and figures for industrial production released on Wednesday back them up.The European Union\u2019s official statistics agency said output was up 1.3% from April, and 4% from May 2016. The annual rate of increase was the fastest since August 2011. That performance was stronger than expected, with economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week expecting a rise of 0.8% on the month and 3.6% on the year.Industry, which accounts for about one fifth of total economic activity in the eurozone, made only a modest contribution to first-quarter growth, with output up just 0.2% across the three months. But that was largely because of weakened demand for heating in response to a milder winter than is usual. There were signs in April and May that the second quarter has seen more normal levels of output from the utilities, with energy production up in both months.But the pickup in industrial output was more broadly based, and supported by a large increase in the production of capital goods, which may be a sign of increased investment by eurozone businesses. Among the currency area\u2019s large members, France led the way with a 1.9% increase on the month.Economists at BNP Paribas said the industrial output figures, combined with earlier data releases, suggest the eurozone economy grew by 0.7% in the three months through June. If so, that would mark an acceleration from the 0.6% rate of quarter-to-quarter growth recorded in the three months through March, and the fastest expansion since the start of 2015.\u201cSuch developments will force the ECB to revise up its growth projections again in September,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients.The ECB\u2019s economists have twice raised their growth forecasts for this year, having begun 2017 expecting to see an expansion of 1.7% and now seeing one of 1.9%. But a number of other economists, including those at BNP Paribas, now see growth coming in at 2% or above.That may appear modest by global standards, but it would be almost twice the eurozone economy\u2019s speed limit, or the rate of growth that many bodies including the European Commission believe it can sustain without generating higher inflation.In response to the unexpected strength of the recovery in the first half of this year, the European Central Bank has indicated it may soon consider withdrawing some of the stimulus it has provided since mid-2014. However, there are as yet few firm indications that inflation is set to rise to and stay at the central bank\u2019s target, so any move is likely to be gradual and cautious.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-industrial-output-picks-up-speed-1499852587", "news_title": "Eurozone Industrial Output Rises at Fastest Rate in Nearly Six Years", "keywords": "eurozone growth,eurozone industrial output,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,industrial production,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "This season, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have embarked on an ambitious experiment in an effort to solve one of the deepest mysteries in sports. They received permission from the San Francisco Giants to put             GoPro                   cameras in the dugout of the franchise\u2019s San Jose minor-league affiliate. With that access, they will monitor players\u2019 interactions, expressions and behavior during games to determine how they relate to production.The study is part of a growing push to understand and quantify one of the most elusive and tantalizing concepts not just in baseball, but in workplaces everywhere: the true effect of team chemistry.There was a time in baseball\u2019s not-too-distant past when the game\u2019s brightest minds dismissed the very notion of chemistry. The analytics revolution of the early 2000s valued only what could be proven with empirical evidence and cast aside anything predicated on intangible qualities as a charming anachronism evangelized by out-of-touch old-timers.Fast forward nearly two decades, and the thinking has changed. In a sweeping shift, many of the industry\u2019s wonkiest stat-heads now acknowledge that how players get along with each other likely can affect how they perform on the field over a six-month season.\u201cChemistry is absolutely critical, but very few teams or managers or general managers know how to create it or even have any idea how to create it,\u201d said Houston Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow, the leader of perhaps the most data-driven front office in the majors. \u201cYou know it\u2019s important, but you don\u2019t know what the levers are to change it.\u201dBut what if they did? Corporate managers and armies of consultants have wrestled with this question for decades, and now baseball is tackling it head-on: Can something as nebulous as \u201cchemistry\u201d be quantified like on-base percentage or ERA, and if so, can it be weaponized?Increasingly, forward-thinking franchises think it\u2019s possible not only to measure the impact of chemistry, but to cultivate positive chemistry in an intentional and systematic fashion. That belief has sparked an information arms race in an area often discussed but rarely analyzed in a scientific way.And whoever solves the riddle first will have earned a competitive advantage over their peers that could come with far-reaching ramifications.\u201cWe know that our general satisfaction in our job and with the people that we work with probably has an impact on our job performance,\u201d Milwaukee Brewers GM David Stearns said. \u201cThere is a quest within the industry to figure out and learn a little bit more about that interaction and whether there\u2019s any predictive ability in that interaction.\u201dThe problem with trying to comprehend chemistry is the inherent challenge of separating it from talent. Teams that win have chemistry. Teams that lose don\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to assume that the best way to generate chemistry in a clubhouse is simply to fill that room with the best baseball players possible. Any differences they may have will be cured by success.Research across various disciplines is underway designed to cut through that noise. The ongoing study in San Jose is one manifestation of that. The Giants, who didn\u2019t commission the study and will not have special access to the results, declined to comment. The researchers also declined to comment until the study is complete.Meanwhile, at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in March, two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an assistant professor at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University presented a paper on quantifying chemistry.Using a mathematical model, they concluded that certain teams, like the Giants and St. Louis Cardinals, consistently outperform the individual statistical contributions of their players, a phenomenon they attributed in part to chemistry. They also found players that consistently showed up on teams that seemingly overachieved, including David Ross, a recently retired catcher known for his leadership qualities.Despite a .229 lifetime batting average, Ross lasted 15 years in the major leagues, consistently finding work because of his perceived\u2014but unquantifiable\u2014clubhouse presence. He appeared in the postseason five times between 2010 and 2016.\u201cIt suggests if there are other guys like him and teams can identify them, there is a competitive advantage for them,\u201d said Scott A. Brave, who authored the paper with R. Andrew Butters and Kevin Roberts. \u201cYou\u2019ll get them at an undervalued price on the market.\u201dBrave and his colleagues decided to investigate this subject as a way to understand the reigning champion Chicago Cubs, who put an unusually heavy emphasis on chemistry and character. Whether the Cubs have had a breakthrough in measuring it remains unclear, but there\u2019s no doubt that their front office believes that chemistry is crucial, creating a loose environment and welcoming individuality.\u201cThat is the next thing that everyone is trying to measure, how that\u2019s brought to a team and how you put that in the formula to building a good team,\u201d said Ross, now an ESPN analyst. \u201cThat\u2019s something that the Cubs definitely pay attention to.\u201dWhen the Cubs opened a new home clubhouse at Wrigley Field last season, they built the locker room in a circular formation as opposed to the typical rectangle in part to encourage interaction among players. Their manager, Joe Maddon, is steadfast in his belief that chemistry matters and is known for his efforts to try to create it. The Cubs recently parted ways with catcher Miguel Montero, despite a strong .805 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, after he publicly criticized a teammate.\u201cBecause we lack an organized understanding of this issue does not mean that we have zero knowledge or zero understanding in this area,\u201d Bill James, the godfather of statistical analysis in baseball, said in an email. \u201cA lot of the stuff that Joe Maddon does that people think of as stunts and jokes is actually a very sophisticated way of managing the chemistry of his locker room.\u201dOf course, not even the best chemistry can compensate for a lack of talent. As James said, in the case of a superstar, \u201cYou will put up with whatever he does and work around it.\u201dWhere quantifying chemistry can help a team is on the fringes of the roster\u2014players like Ross, for instance. When teams look for their final pieces, they are often picking from a vast pool of players with relatively similar ability.But if a team knows, with hard data, that one of those players elevates his teammates with his clubhouse presence\u2014and the rest of the league lacks the ability to recognize it\u2014that team has an enormous advantage. Astros manager A.J. Hinch said that a theoretical chemistry quotient statistic would be \u201ca great tiebreaker.\u201dThe margins of a roster might not seem all that important, but in 2017, they can make all the difference between winning and losing. These days, everybody is using advanced analytics to evaluate talent. In that area, all 30 teams are far more alike than they are different, which wasn\u2019t the case, say, 15 years ago.As a result, teams are actively looking for any edge they can find, recognizing that even a minor breakthrough in a previously unexplored area can have an outsized benefit. In other words, the race to figure out chemistry is on.\u201cIf you can create an advantage, you might be able to sustain it for a long period of time,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for anybody else to figure out what you did or what your formula is or why it works.\u201dWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 12:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baseball-tackles-workplace-mystery-how-to-build-team-chemistry-1499875993", "news_title": "Baseball Tackles Workplace Mystery: How to Build Team Chemistry?", "keywords": "baseball,chemistry baseball,mlb,san francisco giants,st. louis cardinals,team chemistry,teamwork,workplace team chemistry,San Francisco Giants,University of California Berkeley,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "GUANGZHOU, China\u2014The more China tries to rein in its roaring housing market, the more obsessed people get about buying.In February, with this southern megalopolis in the throes of a property frenzy, state banks raised mortgage rates. Then came higher down-payment rules for second homes and limits on owning multiple apartments.The result: Prices in Guangzhou continue to climb, and the market one town over has heated up.Pei Zhiyong, a 56-year-old advertising executive, was barred by the new restrictions from buying a third apartment in Guangzhou. One Sunday in April, he drove his BMW SUV to Foshan, an hour away, to check out a new riverfront high-rise. He figures it\u2019s the ideal time to buy.\u201cThe harder the government tries to control the market, the more prices will rise,\u201d Mr. Pei said.With each new policy intended to restrict home purchases, buyers are piling in. Stressed about the prospect of being left behind, many are borrowing heavily, believing prices will continue to rise despite the restrictions and will soar if the government has to lift restrictions to spur economic growth.Another article of faith is that the Communist Party won\u2019t allow housing prices to collapse. \u201cThe government will spare no effort to make sure there are no big swings in the property market,\u201d says Ni Pengfei, a housing expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank.The desperate home buyers are exposing Beijing\u2019s inability to control a housing market it has been relying on for economic growth. A decade ago, the real-estate sector, including construction and home furnishings, accounted for about 10% of China\u2019s gross domestic product, according to             Moody\u2019s Investors Service.       It now accounts for almost one-third, reflecting both a dearth of other investment options and the petering out of manufacturing growth.With Chinese companies staggering under debt levels pegged by UBS analysts at 164% of GDP, the government has turned to less-indebted corners of the economy to keep growth going.At one time, low levels of household debt reassured government officials and economists that a property slump wouldn\u2019t trigger a wider financial crisis. But the property-buying binge has changed that equation. Long-term household loans, mostly mortgages, now account for one-third of all new bank loans. Household debt stands at more than 42% of GDP, according to Moody\u2019s. That ratio has grown 9 percentage points in three years and now surpasses levels in China\u2019s emerging-market peers including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Russia. In the U.S., that ratio hit about 85% during the housing crisis.Policy makers want to prevent the property bubble from getting worse, worried that any collapse could send defaults cascading through the banking system, infecting the overall economy perhaps for years to come. On the other hand, they are concerned that an investment slowdown could hamper growth. Economists already are warning that the recent property controls are starting to cause developers to scale back on new projects, potentially denting growth later this year.\u201cLessons from Japan and the U.S. told us that there is no such thing as an ever-rising market,\u201d says       Li Xunlei,        chief economist at Chinese brokerage Zhongtai Securities.Frothy as prices have been, China\u2019s housing market isn\u2019t vulnerable to a full-blown property downturn like the one in the U.S. a decade ago, economists say. Chinese home buyers often are required to put at least 30% down. Because Chinese banks only have a limited ability to sell off loans as securities, they don\u2019t offer risky mortgages like those that triggered the U.S. housing debacle. Moreover, home-equity financing that lets owners borrow against their homes hasn\u2019t taken off in China.In Shenzhen, the average home sells for 44 times average annual household income, compared with around 12 times for homes in New York City, according to an analysis by       Zhang Ming,        a senior economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Chinese government data show that prices across 70 Chinese cities were 9.7% higher in May than a year earlier, a larger year-over-year increase than the 9.3% last September, when the current round of housing controls were instituted.In some big cities, the frenzy has moderated somewhat. In Shanghai, the year-over-year increase was 31% in May, compared with 50% last September. Beijing posted a 22% annual increase in May, down from 33% in April.Halfway across China in Lanzhou, a polluted industrial hub at the edge of the Gobi Desert, the housing market is booming. Homes for sale are packed with would-be buyers, including small-business owners who think property is a better bet than shops or factories.Prices started to take off in September, just as Beijing took its first steps to crack down. By December, Lanzhou\u2019s prices were 27% higher than a year earlier. In April, Lanzhou also cracked down with higher minimum down payments and limits on second- and third-home purchases in the city center.\u201cThe housing market in Lanzhou is too heated,\u201d       Gao Jia,        deputy director of Lanzhou\u2019s housing authority, said in an April interview as he leaned back in his chair and smoked a cigarette. \u201cThe government needs to make sure the housing price is going up steadily, not too fast.\u201dIn Foshan, a city of seven million dotted with factories making refrigerators, television sets and other household appliances, home prices have risen 18% in recent months as buyers poured in after property controls were imposed in Guangzhou.Mr. Pei, the advertising executive, was one of many Guangzhou buyers signing contracts in April for apartments at the Master Work high-rise overlooking the Desheng River in Foshan. He intended to pay for a three-bedroom apartment partly with the proceeds from a studio in Guangzhou he and his wife had just sold. He said it had gone up in price more than 50-fold since they bought it 13 years ago.\u201cNo other investment is as profitable as property,\u201d he said. \u201cStocks are too risky.\u201dOne middle-aged homemaker was so eager to snag an apartment in a Foshan shopping-mall complex that she asked a broker to wait in line all night when sales started in May. \u201cFoshan to Guangzhou is just like Brooklyn to Manhattan,\u201d she said. All 300 apartments sold out within 60 hours, according to the broker,       Huang Kai.The boom in Foshan hasn\u2019t cooled things off in Guangzhou. Sales agents for the Blessed and Colorful Apartments, a new high-rise complex in the southern part of the city, say that prices for the units have risen nearly 30% since they went on sale in January.Zhang Ying,        a 27-year-old web designer who makes about $1,500 a month, bought a two-bedroom apartment in another development in January. Her mortgage payments amount to nearly 80% of her income. \u201cI\u2019m essentially a slave to this property now,\u201d she says.In some smaller cities, the property boom is helping to reduce a housing glut produced by earlier overbuilding\u2014a goal of the central government.Tangshan, a heavy-manufacturing city two hours east of Beijing, had benefited from home buyers driven out by new restrictions in the capital. The estimated time it would take to clear the inventory of unsold homes declined from 38 months last November to 27 months in May.Many buyers appear to be investors who don\u2019t intend to move to the city or work there. In late May, Tangshan authorities raised down-payment requirements to discourage speculative buying.The housing rally in Lanzhou, the central China industrial city, also was driven by buyers from outside the area, according to Mr. Gao, the housing official.Zhang Xiaoqi,        a retired accountant, was eyeing an apartment for her son. She was prepared to put 20% down on an apartment early this year. When Lanzhou raised the down-payment requirement to 30%, she gave up.\u201cOriginally I could afford a home, but now it\u2019s too much,\u201d she said. She contends prices shot up because of the restrictions.A 53-year-old engineer in Lanzhou was determined to buy. \u201cThe harder it is to get something, the more you want to buy,\u201d he said while browsing apartments decorated in Old Europe style, replete with chandeliers. \u201cI need to buy before prices go up further.\u201dAt the end of last year, real estate accounted for 68.8% of China\u2019s household assets, Moody\u2019s says. In the U.S., it is less than 60%.Mr. Ni, the housing expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, estimates that as much as 50% of China\u2019s home sales today are for investment, a situation that worries the Communist Party leadership.\u201cHouses are for living in, not for speculation,\u201d President       Xi Jinping       said at a December meeting that set main economic goals for 2017.Nonetheless, the government has stopped short of imposing a property tax, which would discourage people from buying homes as an investment and leaving them empty by making it more expensive to own a home.

Originally employed by academics in postcolonial studies to describe the adoption of one culture\u2019s creative expressions by another, the term has evolved to mean the theft or exploitation of an ethnic culture or history by persons of white European heritage.The accusation of cultural appropriation is now having a chilling effect on cultural life itself. In Canada, editors of two different magazines resigned in recent months amid controversies for voicing their support of creative cultural borrowing. In the U.S., protests in Minnesota against the Walker Art Center led to the dismantling of \u201cScaffold,\u201d a sculpture by the white artist Sam Durant, which referenced, among other victims, the 1862 execution of 38 Native Americans of the Dakota people.It\u2019s a lamentable trend. As history bountifully attests, all cultures have borrowed and exchanged ideas with one another. Sometimes the exchange has been between equal powers, and sometimes not. Either way\u2014whether it\u2019s the Japanese adoption of Chinese literary culture in the ninth century, the American Transcendentalists\u2019 embrace of Hindu thought in the 19th century or the influence of African sculpture on       Pablo Picasso      \u2014there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that one man\u2019s cultural appropriation is another man\u2019s appreciation.The Romans still hold the world record for appropriating culture, enthusiastically basing their own, from law to literature, on the Greeks. In the 4th century A.D., Rome sealed its championship by appropriating the religion of a tiny minority culture in the Middle East\u2014thus introducing Christianity to much of the world. The appropriation wasn\u2019t all one way, however. The image of Jesus as \u201cthe good shepherd\u201d may have evolved from the Greco-Roman god Hermes/Mercury, who was often shown with a ram across his shoulders. Likewise, early Christian imagery of the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus echoes ancient Egyptian depictions of the goddess Isis with the godchild Horus on her lap.Both ancient Rome and early Christianity demonstrate how cultural appropriation produces growth and innovation. By contrast, the fate of societies that have embraced the ideology of cultural separatism offers up a cautionary tale of decline.In 529, Justinian I\u2014the Christian emperor of Byzantium, which had inherited the eastern part of the Roman Empire\u2014closed down the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens, ending a 900-year-old tradition of philosophical inquiry. The blow to Western culture was immense. Only with the founding of the University of Bologna in 1088 did Christian Europe begin to rebuild higher education.Almost 500 years later, Emperor Jiajing of China was guilty of similar folly when he ordered the destruction of all oceangoing ships. The edict effectively sealed his subjects inside China\u2019s borders. Instead of protecting the status quo against foreign ideas and money, as Jiajing had intended, his action helped to precipitate China\u2019s descent from being the world\u2019s richest and most powerful nation in the 15th century into a cultural and economic backwater by the 19th.The same shortsightedness can be seen in the Ottoman Empire\u2019s 1515 ban on printing in Arabic, because the printed word would defile God\u2019s name, and in the Spanish Inquisition, which focused on religious purity at the expense of every other cultural good.

Investors in drug companies should give some attention to state capitals, where a wave of bills designed to limit drug price increases are under consideration.Maryland is the first of about 30 states weighing such bills to pass a new law on drug pricing. The law, scheduled to take effect in October, outlaws \u201cexcessive\u201d price hikes on generics and gives Maryland\u2019s attorney general sweeping powers to roll back price hikes and fine companies for violations.\u00a0Bills with similar enforcement mechanisms have been introduced in several other states, including New York, Missouri, Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island.At first blush, this seems like a sensible reaction to high-profile price gouging incidents which have generated considerable public outrage.

It focuses specifically on generic drugs, where most prices are already falling, and exempts drugs under patent protection. Such branded drugs account for the majority of U.S. drug spending and a small fraction of total prescriptions.Not surprisingly, the generic drug industry trade group, The Association for Accessible Medicines, filed a suit last week to stop the law, arguing it limits competition which will drive prices even higher.\u00a0The group, to its credit, has applauded the new Food and Drug Administration effort to stimulate new generic applications for drugs with limited competition.The Maryland law and any others that follow could further hammer generic drug stocks. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, citing data from IMS Health, said in a note Monday that U.S. generic drug revenues fell by 13% in May from a year earlier and by 9% in April.

They can give a clean, 3-D look inside cluttered bags, which have become a big problem for TSA.These machines could eliminate calls for cabin laptop bans because they can look inside electronics and find explosive material. They could someday do away with 3-ounce, quart bag restrictions on liquids, since they can measure the density of any liquid and determine if it\u2019s explosive. And they can boost the number of people screened at a checkpoint each hour, reducing lines.\u201cWhen and if we go to deploy these systems\u2026the intent would be that laptops and liquids stay in\u201d bags, says       Steve Karoly,        TSA acting assistant administrator.At the other end of the technology spectrum, bins with an ID tag visible on an X-ray screen are being tested at select checkpoints in Denver, New York LaGuardia, Indianapolis and Ontario, Calif. It\u2019s as low-tech as you can get, but it\u2019s showing it can speed up screening, at least according to data collected by the manufacturer.A metal plate with a three-character ID stencil is attached to a corner of a bin, reducing incidents where screeners end up with the wrong bag for a hand check and screening gets halted until the suspicious bag is found. Those mistakes are infrequent but disruptive.Taken together, the two innovations show how years of research by manufacturers and TSA into ways to improve screening are finally starting to affect checkpoints. In the past, many screening efforts failed, like shoe scanners, or had limited impact, like liquids scanners. Body scanners have been criticized as invasive. And past changes to reduce screening failures have led to long lines.These innovations could ultimately disappoint, too. But officials say the CT machines in particular could be revolutionary. Airlines and airports are so excited about it they are willing to pay for machines themselves until TSA can get funding from Congress.The technology has already been in TSA use for several years: It scans checked luggage in baggage sorting systems. But those machines were too big, too expensive\u2014at about $1 million each\u2014and too slow to replace the 2,200 X-ray machines that scan hand baggage in the U.S.A CT scanner rotates around the bag, taking visual X-ray slices from all angles to create a detailed three-dimensional picture. Specific items can be isolated for close study. Software analyzes images for screeners and distinguishes between safe and dangerous materials.Several manufacturers have come up with ways to shrink the machines, lower the cost and speed them up for checkpoint use. Machines have now been made small enough to fit into existing checkpoint screening lanes and light enough to not require reinforcement of floors. The cost has come down to about $250,000.TSA has certified two models for use and is close to signing off on two others. One, made by L3 Security and Detection Systems, is in use at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Terminal 4. Another, made by Integrated Defense & Security Solutions, is being tested in Terminal E in Boston.             American Airlines                   has struck a deal for the first eight Analogic machines to be used in American hubs in the U.S. and Europe.Analogic expects to roll out machines in late summer or early fall.One reason airlines are eager to see checkpoint screening improvements: baggage fees. Airlines collected $4 billion in checked baggage fees in 2016, but the higher volume of carry-on bags from passengers trying to avoid fees has made screening more difficult. That\u2019s led to worries that the government might force airlines to roll back baggage fees to ease the screening strain.The other possible screening change shows that sometimes simple can be pretty smart.SecurityPoint Media, a St. Petersburg, Fla., company that provides bins with advertising inside to 38 airports for TSA checkpoints, saw an opportunity to solve a nagging problem: Sometimes it\u2019s hard for TSA screeners to identify the right bin.Screeners working X-ray machines identify shapes and patterns in a bin to make sure they are sending the right one off for a hand check. Sometimes the screener doing the hand check ends up with the wrong bag, creating a scramble to find the suspicious one. The lane gets shut down and lines grow.\u201cWe have access control issues that happen,\u201d TSA\u2019s Mr. Karoly says. \u201cWhat this will do is guarantee that when you see it on the X-ray and it shows you A25, and you just pulled that bin that says A25 now you know that you\u2019ve got the right bag.\u201dTSA tested new bins in Denver, which has two main checkpoints in the heart of its terminal. The south checkpoint got the new bins. The north kept using existing bins.Research sponsored by SecurityPoint showed a 21% increase in passengers screened per hour at the south checkpoint. Analysts attributed some of that to a redesigned bin with more surface area and lower sides. That shape encourages less stacking of items in a tray, making X-rays easier to read. But most of the increase in passengers per hour resulted in an 83% drop in bad bag handoffs. The south checkpoint had just one bad-bag handoff in a two-month study period.Similar results are showing up at other airports testing the bins, says       Joe Ambrefe,        SecurityPoint\u2019s chief executive.SecurityPoint is gearing up for a big launch this fall. The company provides the new bins to airports free if advertising is allowed. If not, airports can buy in.TSA says it\u2019s too early to verify claims of speeding up lanes\u2014it hasn\u2019t done a full test yet. The agency is also working on alternatives, such as systems that would automatically divert a bin with a possible threat.Write to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 11:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-more-convenient-airport-security-be-around-the-corner-1499870669", "news_title": "Hope for Faster Airport Security", "keywords": "airports,bins,ct scan,explosives,faster,id tags,liquids,security,three ounces,tsa,x-ray,Transportation Security Administration,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,health,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,radiology,radiotherapy,state security measures,policies,travel,transport,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,airlines,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "ISTANBUL\u2014Iran\u2019s ambitious agenda for its oil-and-gas industry is running up against the caution of big energy companies.At a major energy conference here, Iranian officials said French oil giant             Total SA\u2019s        TOT 0.91%commitment of $1 billion toward a gas project this month marked a new chapter in the country\u2019s energy business since the end of Western sanctions. Iranian officials promised 10 contracts like it in the next year and said they were seeking $92 billion in foreign investment to raise oil production by a third and gas exports by 15-fold by 2021.\u201cOur hands are full,\u201d Iran\u2019s Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia told reporters here at the World Petroleum Congress, saying 25 contracts were being negotiated with foreign companies. \u201cWe think that the situation is normal enough now for major international oil business to get engaged in Iran.\u201dBut other big oil companies have been more shy than Total about wading into Iran, even with its enormous oil and gas reserves.Western companies are wary of running afoul of remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran for weapons, human rights and terrorism allegations. Overall, the industry is still smarting from an oil-price downturn that isn\u2019t letting up in its third year, making companies wary of new spending.Speaking at the same conference here,             BP        BP 0.57%       PLC Chief Executive       Bob Dudley       said he was looking beyond Iran for now, as the company had already committed to $15 billion in spending elsewhere this year.\u201cWe have a full plate,\u201d Mr. Dudley said at a news briefing. \u201cWe have to stay on a capital diet.\u201dU.S. companies like             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Chevron Corp.       are barred from doing business in Iran, but European companies like London-based BP can still try to make a deal work. One factor slowing things down: U.S. President       Donald Trump       has criticized the deal over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and threatened to pull out or tighten sanctions.\u201cBP\u2019s decision to be cautious on Iran [was] a ripple effect\u201d of U.S. pressure against doing business in Iran, Mr. Zamaninia said.A BP spokesman declined to comment.Total\u2019s commitment in Iran is evidence that oil companies have concluded \u201cthe return of sanctions is very unlikely, if not impossible,\u201d Mr. Zamaninia said. Total said it was in compliance with all sanctions.Mr. Zamaninia has tried to use the World Petroleum Congress conference here as a sort of coming out party for Iranian energy investments after the Total deal. He cracked jokes while sharing a panel with Mr. Dudley and       Barry Worthington,        the executive director of the U.S. Energy Association, an industry body that advocates for American oil companies.But the panel also underscored Iran\u2019s challenges. While Messrs. Dudley and Zamaninia talked before the panel, Mr. Dudley said they only discussed its topics\u2014not any potential business. Mr. Dudley, a U.S. citizen, didn\u2019t elaborate but Washington\u2019s sanctions bar Americans from discussing oil deals with Iran.Mr. Dudley called Total\u2019s deal a \u201cvery good sign for the industry\u201d but he hadn\u2019t seen its terms. Total and Iranian officials have said the 20-year contract was longer-term than deals Iran allowed in the past and allowed the company more flexibility to recoup costs.Total Chief Executive       Patrick Pouyanne       said the company and its partners were already preparing tenders to contractors in the project. Total\u2019s partners include China National Petroleum Corp. and an Iranian company.Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC signed a preliminary agreement to explore opportunities in Iranian oil fields late last year. The Anglo-Dutch company held meetings in Tehran and Dubai in the two past months with the National Iranian Oil Co. and Chinese state-run             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.       to work together on an oil field called Yadavaran, according to a person familiar with the discussions. But people who work with the company said it is concerned about its exposure to the U.S. and is more selective in the choice of its banks than Total.A Shell spokeswoman said: \u201cShell is interested in exploring the role it can play in developing Iran\u2019s energy potential. We have been engaging with Iranian officials but it is still too early to discuss potential Shell investment in any project.\u201dOil companies are closely watching a political debate playing out in Iran since the Total deal. On Wednesday, Iranian Oil Minister       Bijan Zanganeh       was grilled in the country\u2019s parliament over what some hard-liners said was a sweet deal for Total. Some lawmakers threatened to block it, though they relented.Iran is also working against a persistent chill in oil investments globally. While global oil and gas investments are set to increase by 3% this year, most of it is flowing to the U.S. shale oil, according to the International Energy Agency, an adviser to governments on energy issues.Iran\u2019s old oil fields are a challenge, requiring \u201cpatience and high technology,\u201d       Laszlo Varro,        the IEA\u2019s chief economist, said.Further, Iran\u2019s geopolitical risks, complex contracts and risk of sanctions could deter investors who can go to other growing oil regions like Brazil instead, Mr. Varro said. \u201cIran will remain under its geological potential for quite some time,\u201d he said.Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Big Oil Remains Wary of Iran Dealings.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 11:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-optimistic-but-big-oil-is-shy-1499874611", "news_title": "Big Oil Stays Wary on Iran", "keywords": "iran, iran gas fields, iran investment, iran oilfields,iran oil industry, iran sanctions, oil, total iran,BP,BP.LN,Total,TOT,FP.FR,Bob Dudley,output,production,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "A rate increase from the Bank of Canada Wednesday will give the country\u2019s lenders a long-awaited boost in lending margins, but analysts say it could also trigger concerns about a rise in defaults down the road.The rate increase by Canada\u2019s central bank is the first in seven years, and it is likely to boost lending margins\u2014a key profit-driver for banks\u2014which have been falling steadily during the postcrisis era of ultralow rates in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere.But the six Canadian banks that dominate the financial system are also vulnerable to consumers who are piling on historic amounts of debt, say analysts and investors. An extended cycle of rising rates could cause many to default on their credit cards, car loans or mortgages, potentially rattling the foundation of the Canadian financial sector.Residential mortgages made up 22% of the banks\u2019 combined assets in the second quarter, ending April 30. Personal and credit-card debt made up about 11%, according to filings. Those levels are down just slightly from the 23% and 12%, respectively, two years prior.At U.S. banks, which tend to securitize more of their loans and move them off their balance sheets, mortgages make up roughly 13% of assets, according to the most recent Federal Reserve data.The rate increase comes amid a strong run for Canada\u2019s banks, which have been bolstered by the country\u2019s recent pickup in economic growth and high demand for mortgages in markets like Toronto and Vancouver.             Royal Bank of Canada,        RY 0.51%Toronto-Dominion Bank,        TD 0.48%Bank of Montreal,        BMO 0.31%Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,        CM 1.61%Bank of Nova Scotia        BNS 0.52%       and             National Bank of Canada        NTIOF 1.57%       increased earnings by an average 11% during the second quarter, according to a report by             Credit Suisse.Net interest margins, which measure the difference between their cost of borrowing and the money they make from lending, averaged 2.46%, down 0.04 percentage point from the end of 2015. A rate rise should help boost those numbers, helping grow earnings further, analysts say.The banks have already begun to raise mortgage lending rates. RBC, TD, Bank of Montreal and CIBC raised rates early in July by as much as 0.20 point for five-year mortgages.Despite their robust earnings, some observers have already sent up cautionary flares.             Moody\u2019s Investors Service                   in May downgraded the top five banks, citing their vulnerability to debt. Household debt totaled 175.9% of disposable income at the end of 2016, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That compares with 152.3% in the U.K. in 2016 and a U.S. ratio of 112% in 2015, the most recent year for with the OECD had data available.\u201cCanadian consumers and the Canadian banking system haven\u2019t been tested at such high levels of leverage,\u201d said       David Beattie,        a Toronto-based analyst for the ratings service. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the shocks to the system will be, but we do know it\u2019s harder for the system to respond when we get to these levels.\u201dCanadian officials have signaled they are concerned. They have imposed measures to cool housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver, including a tax on foreign buyers, and last week said they are weighing tighter rules for mortgage issuance.This spring, alternative lender             Home Capital Group Inc.       unnerved the financial sector when it suffered an outflow of 95% of its more than C$2 billion ($1.55 billion) in high-interest savings deposits following allegations the company misled investors about its mortgage fraud problem. The company, a large lender to the self-employed and those with little credit history, was bailed out last month by an investment from             Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.To be sure, the major banks aren\u2019t as exposed as Home Capital to non-prime borrowers. The government\u2019s Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation also fully insures more than half the mortgages on the banks\u2019 books, according to a report by Citi, reducing their risk to the firms. But any damage to the banks\u2019 balance sheets from rising interest rates and stressed borrowers likely will begin through other forms of borrowing, said       Brian Klock,        an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\u201cThe fear in Canada is that you have that consumer borrower who finally turns,\u201d said Mr. Klock. \u201cIf they are having problems with their car loans, do they default? Will that cause an issue with their mortgage?\u201dChris Kresic,        head of fixed income at Montreal-based investment management firm Jarislowsky Fraser, said that growth in the housing sector poses a macroeconomic risk for the Canadian economy as a whole, which exposes the banks. But the banks, which effectively hold an oligopoly in the country, haven\u2019t had to take on as much risk to remain competitive as U.S. banks did in the run up to the housing crisis in 2007.Canadian banks don\u2019t have many subprime loans on their balance sheets, he noted, which could help them avoid the worst of a default wave.That conservatism could help avoid a crisis, even if higher rates lead to a severe housing downturn, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Canadian economy has never been so leveraged and so leveraged to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a macroeconomic exposure for the banks. Is the risk greater now than ever before? Probably. Are the banks able to survive such a downturn? We think they will.\u201dWrite to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 11:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rate-rise-would-stoke-worries-over-canadas-banks-1499856731", "news_title": "Rate Rise Could Stoke Worries Over Canada\u2019s Banks", "keywords": "canada economy,canada housing,canadian banks,housing,interest rates,leverage,mortgages,Bank of Canada,Bank of Montreal,BMO.T,Bank of Nova Scotia,BNS.T,BNS,Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,CM.T,CM,National Bank of Canada,NA.T,Royal Bank of Canada,RY,Toronto-Dominion Bank,TD.T,TD,Keefe Bruyette & Woods,Jarislowsky Fraser,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,leveraged loans,mortgage backed securities,monetary policy,economic news,banking,credit types,services,real estate credit,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Skepticism of electric cars melts\u00a0a bit more\u00a0with each new announcement from the likes of Tesla, which\u00a0last week\u00a0launched production of a mass-market vehicle, and Volvo, which days later promised to phase out gasoline-only engines by 2019.But that progress comes with two big caveats: First, it has\u00a0relied\u00a0on extensive public subsidies and, second, it has\u00a0done little to reduce planet-warming emissions of carbon dioxide.\u00a0If electric cars are ever to displace gasoline engines without government putting its thumb on the scale, they must not\u00a0only keep innovating\u00a0but outrun fossil fuels where productivity also keeps advancing.Electric cars\u00a0have come a long way. They\u00a0are no longer ugly, impossibly expensive and impractical, thanks to technological advances that have slashed battery storage from $1,000 per kilowatt-hour in\u00a02010\u00a0to $273 per kwh last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Nonetheless, that means a 75 kwh battery (about what you need for 250 miles of range) still\u00a0adds\u00a0about $20,000\u00a0to a car\u2019s cost.\u00a0So how do the cars sell? Public largess\u00a0helps\u00a0a lot.The federal government offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 each for the first 200,000 electric or plug-in hybrid cars a manufacturer sells. Throw in state tax credits, subsidies for recharging infrastructure, relief from gasoline taxes, preferential lanes and parking spots and government fleet purchases, and taxpayers help pay for every electric car on the road.What happens when\u00a0the credits go away? When Hong Kong slashed a tax break worth roughly $55,000\u00a0for a Tesla\u00a0in April, its sales ground to a halt. In Georgia, electric vehicle sales plummeted 80% the month after a $5,000 tax credit was repealed.Tesla\u00a0will find plenty of wealthy niche buyers for its high-priced cars\u00a0once\u00a0it\u00a0exhausts its\u00a0credits. But for electric vehicles as a whole, hybrids have a sobering lesson. From 2005 to 2010, some hybrid buyers enjoyed a $3,500 tax credit. Sales kept rising after the credit expired, peaking at 487,000, or 3.1% of total vehicles, in 2013, according to Edmunds.com, when gasoline averaged $3.51 a gallon. A surge in oil supply, thanks to fracking, caused gasoline prices to plummet to $2.36 a gallon this year, and hybrids\u2019 market share has dropped to just 2.1%.Many optimists think falling battery costs mean electric vehicles (EVs) will inevitably displace the internal combustion engine (ICE). Last week, Bloomberg predicted electric cars would become \u201cprice competitive\u201d with ICE cars\u00a0in eight years\u00a0without subsidies.But\u00a0such scenarios hinge not just on the\u00a0cost of batteries\u00a0but\u00a0on the price of oil\u00a0and the efficiency of competing vehicles. Economists       Thomas Covert,       Michael Greenstone       and       Christopher\u00a0Knittel,        in an article for the Journal of Economic Perspectives,\u00a0estimate that\u00a0at the current battery cost of\u00a0$270 per kwh, oil would have to cost more than $300 a barrel\u200b (in 2020 dollars)\u00a0to make electric and gasoline equally attractive. If battery costs fall to $100, as Tesla Founder       Elon Musk       has targeted, oil would have to average $90.That could happen.\u00a0But optimists \u201coverlook the compensating effect of incumbent technology,\u201d says       Kevin Book,        of\u00a0ClearView\u00a0Energy Partners, an advisory firm.\u00a0He\u00a0notes, for example, the\u00a0spectacular\u00a0decline in natural gas prices that hydraulic fracking has made possible.\u00a0Global oil reserves have repeatedly defied predictions\u00a0of shrinkage as industry innovation expands what can be recovered.\u00a0And internal combustion engine efficiency typically rises 2% a year.ClearView\u00a0says that in an optimistic scenario, where battery costs fall 10% a year starting now and gasoline begins at $5 a gallon, electric vehicles will be competitive\u00a0in five years. If battery costs fall just 5% a year and gasoline starts at $2.25, it will take\u00a0more than\u00a020.This would still be a step forward for the climate, but by how much depends on other factors.\u00a0Electric vehicles are meant to be recharged at night. Economists       Joshua Graff      \u00a0Zivin,       Matthew\u00a0Kotchen      \u00a0and       Erin Mansur       note in a 2014 article in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization that night is when\u00a0electricity is most likely to come from burning\u00a0coal. They estimate electric vehicles\u00a0account for\u00a0more carbon dioxide per mile than existing cars in the upper Midwest,\u00a0where coal-fired plants are more prevalent,\u00a0and more than comparable hybrids in most of the country.Federal regulators further dilute\u00a0the carbon-reduction impact by giving manufacturers added credit for each electric vehicle, when complying with average fuel efficiency standards. Thus,\u00a0every electric vehicle sold allows a manufacturer to sell a few more gas guzzlers\u00a0and still comply.These subsidies have clearly accomplished one goal: They\u2019ve accelerated electric vehicle technology innovation when the private market had little incentive\u00a0to invest.\u00a0Yet\u00a0they may not be the most efficient way to combat\u00a0carbon emissions. A carbon tax, for example, would incentivize conservation and alternative fuels regardless of oil prices.Since that\u2019s unlikely for now, Mr. Greenstone and       Sam\u00a0Ori,        both of the University of Chicago\u2019s Energy Policy Institute, and       Cass Sunstein,        of Harvard University, suggest scrapping the current array of fuel efficiency standards\u00a0and assigning manufacturers a tradable emissions cap for each vehicle. This would put alternatives to electric cars, such as more efficient gasoline or diesel engines, on a level playing field.\u00a0Just in case\u00a0electric vehicles\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0meet their heady expectations, the world should spread its bets.Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Electric Cars Are the Future?

Midway through a \u201cpersonal challenge\u201d to travel to 30 states he\u2019d never visited, the 33-year- old aims \u201cto talk to more people about how they\u2019re living, working and thinking about the future,\u201d he wrote in January on his Facebook page.Among those people was Kyle McKasson, manager of the Wilton Candy Kitchen, a century-old shop on the town square in Wilton, Iowa.He was at work one Monday afternoon in June when two men and a woman dressed in jeans and button-down shirts entered the store, which is a regular stop on Iowa\u2019s presidential campaign circuit.The three said they were from California on a business trip on their way to Chicago and asked Mr. McKasson for a tour of the store and its museum of the history of Wilton, population 2,800. They didn\u2019t tell their names, he said, and he thought it impolite to ask.Four days later, the same three people returned to the candy store, and one of his new customers revealed their true mission: \u201cMark Zuckerberg will be here in five minutes.\u201dA startled Mr. McKasson, 54, asked: \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d he recalled, and was told: \u201cNothing.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg walked through the red-and-white store door. He ordered a $5.75 chocolate malt. An assistant paid the world\u2019s fifth-richest man\u2019s tab with a debit card.The tech titan chatted with the young cashier about her future plans and spoke to Mr. McKasson about life in Wilton and the city\u2019s downtown revitalization efforts.Members of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s team plan his visits with secrecy, but there are rare instances of the Facebook CEO\u2019s cover being blown. The result: chaos.When someone let slip he\u2019d be at the Kusanya Caf\u00e9 on Chicago\u2019s South Side, Ren\u00e9e Banks, a barista, said she had to fetch extra chairs for the 100 people who showed up.Amy Dudley, a spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, an entity formed in 2015 by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, which is helping to arrange the CEO\u2019s tour, said the design of \u201cthese visits is to have the most honest and candid interactions and discussions as possible, without the additional attention that\u2019s likely to come as a result of word getting out ahead of time.\u201dFor nearly a decade, Mr. Zuckerberg has started every year with a \u201cpersonal challenge.\u201d In 2009, this meant wearing a tie every day. Another year, he swore only to eat meat that he had personally slaughtered. \u201cI just killed a pig and a goat,\u201d he boasted in a private Facebook post in 2011.Facebook, the 13-year-old company he co-founded, now has two billion monthly active users. Its market value is $446 billion.In Wilton, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s advance team had stopped at city hall to secure a meeting with Wilton Mayor       Bob Barrett       and City Administrator Chris Ball to discuss life in rural Iowa before the CEO went to the candy store.But Messers. Ball and Barrett were asked not to tell anyone Mr. Zuckerberg was coming. Mr. Ball said Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s representatives instructed them not to relay verbatim quotes from their discussions with him if asked by reporters.\u201cThey asked me not to quote what Mr. Zuckerberg said,\u201d Mr. Ball said. \u201cThey said to refer people to their press guys.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spent the July 4 weekend in Alaska, the 15th state he\u2019s visited on his tour since it began in January. He stayed at the Kachemak Bay Wilderness Lodge, a $1,000-per-night fishing resort on the Kenai Peninsula. A receptionist said the lodge\u2019s owners wouldn\u2019t discuss the visit. \u201cYou have to call Amy Dudley,\u201d she said.Ms. Dudley, a former aide to Vice President       Joe Biden       and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, said Mr. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for this article.Despite his world-wide fame, Mr. Zuckerberg isn\u2019t always recognized by his surprise hosts.In June, he attended an Iftar dinner in Minneapolis. Mr. Zuckerberg arrived after the prayers and the other people in the room, who were mostly refugees from Somalia, didn\u2019t know who he was, said attendee Mohammed Jama.Blues musician James \u201cSuper Chikan\u201d Johnson was booked in February to play a concert funded by a mystery client at the Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale, Miss. Mr. Johnson, 66, said it is unusual for him to not be told for whom he\u2019d be performing. When he was on stage setting up his equipment, Mr. Zuckerberg approached.\u201cThey said, \u2018That\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg.\u2019 I said, \u2018Who dat?\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThey said, \u2018It\u2019s the Facebook guy, the guy who owns the Facebook. I said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019 I had no idea who he was.\u201dThe secrecy surrounding Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s visits has nearly led to his target audience blowing him off.Adam Kragthorpe, who runs a local youth hockey program in Minnetonka, Minn., deleted the initial email from James Eby requesting a meeting for \u201ca Fortune 500 CEO who is traveling the United States and visiting a wide range of communities.\u201d\u201cWe thought it was a multilevel marketing scheme,\u201d Mr. Kragthorpe said.Mr. Eby, who planned travels for four Defense secretaries in the Obama administration, is now a contractor working for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. He declined to comment.Two days after he emailed Mr. Kragthorpe, Mr. Eby arrived unannounced at the hockey rink.Mr. Kragthorpe said he was told that Mr. Zuckerberg would like to visit with hockey families a couple of days later. He said Mr. Eby told him not to tell anyone the Facebook CEO was coming and asked that people at the rink not photograph the CEO.The Zuckerberg entourage, which can be up to eight people, includes a professional photographer. His aides said there is no prohibition against others snapping pictures.In Newton Falls, Ohio, Dan Moore got a call in April from Jimmy Dahman, a former presidential campaign field organizer for       Hillary Clinton       in Ohio. Mr. Dahman doesn\u2019t work for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s organization, but was acting as a volunteer, he said.He wanted to know if Mr. Moore, a Democratic union steelworker who was a volunteer for       Donald Trump\u2019s       presidential campaign, would host \u201ca billionaire philanthropist from California\u201d at his home five days later.Four days later, Mr. Moore, 57, was standing in his driveway waiting for his mystery guest. Fifteen minutes before a pair of black SUVs arrived, he was told he\u2019d be joined by Mr. Zuckerberg.Mr. Moore and his family enjoyed a dinner of chicken Francaise and baked whitefish Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s staff had catered from a nearby restaurant. As Mr. Zuckerberg was leaving, he made one request, Mr. Moore said.\u201cHe said, \u2018If there are any news reporters that call you, just make sure you tell them I\u2019m not running for president.\u2019\u201dWrite to Reid J.

We owe this to our companies,\u201d said Economics Minister       Brigitte Zypries       as she outlined the plan.The move illustrates how a push among mature economies for fairer trade terms with the rest of the world\u2014from U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies to French President       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       call for more trade protection\u2014is gaining ground. The trend is occurring even in Germany, a country whose economy is highly reliant on exports and which is a vocal advocate of free trade.In recent months, Germany, France and Italy have called for the creation of a European equivalent to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews sensitive foreign investments. The U.S. is also considering new protections after Chinese investments there tripled last year.In Berlin, China is the main concern. Last year, Chinese firms, often backed by government money, bought German competitors at a rate of one a week, a push analysts believe reflects the Chinese government\u2019s plans to dominate advanced manufacturing by 2025.\u201cGerman companies are certainly a flashpoint because it\u2019s all about high-tech industries and China catching up,\u201d said Jan Gaspers, researcher at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. \u201cGermany is just the market leader in many domains\u2026It\u2019s a natural target.\u201dOverall, the number of German companies under Chinese control rose to 270 in 2014 from 153 in 2009, according to the most recent German government statistics available.Chinese investments in Germany reached $ 10.8 billion in 2016, up from $500 million in 2015, while total investment in Europe was $97.8 billion, more than three times the level of 2015, according to data provider Dealogic. Figures available so far for 2017 suggest waning appetite, however, with the value of acquisitions in Germany reaching only $2.6 billion and $31.7 billion in Europe, according to the firm.The new rules were partly prompted by last year\u2019s successful $5 billion purchase of             Kuka AG      , which makes robotics systems for the auto and aerospace industries, by China\u2019s             Midea Group.Berlin already had limited legal tools to review foreign investments on national security grounds.

And so, when gathering over 450 timepieces from its vaults in Geneva for the Art of Watches, Grand Exhibition, a retrospective opening July 13 in New York, the company knew it had to appeal not only to watch enthusiasts but to the dial-illiterate as well.

RBS said in a statement that it had already set aside funds to cover most of the cost of the settlement. The bank will have to take an additional charge of $196 million, which will be realized in its coming results in August.In settling, RBS becomes the 17th bank to strike a deal with the FHFA over the sale of subprime mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The settlement came in higher than investors expected, tempering the idea that U.S. agencies would soften their approach to foreign banks under the Trump administration.More pain could still be ahead. RBS had set aside $8.3 billion to cover a range of allegations linked to its role in packaging and selling on subprime mortgages in the lead up to the financial crisis. The bank still faces probes from several U.S. agencies including criminal and civil investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. RBS warned Wednesday that \u201cfurther substantial provisions and costs may be recognized\u2026depending upon the final outcomes.\u201d Analysts at Jefferies estimate RBS will set aside a further $2.5 billion by the end of the year to cover future Justice Department settlements. So far, the bank hasn\u2019t had meaningful discussions with the Justice Department over any settlement, said RBS Chief Financial Officer       Ewen Stevenson.That could slow the grinding process of returning RBS to private hands. U.K. Treasury officials have said they would not sell the government\u2019s 71% stake until they have clarity on the size of the fines RBS may face.Under the FHFA settlement, RBS will pay the $5.5 billion, but is eligible for a $754 million reimbursement under indemnification agreements. Mr. Stevenson admitted the deal was \u201cat the high end of the other settlements\u201d but said there should be no read across to potential settlements with the Justice Department. RBS paid more per mortgage bond sold than any other bank that has settled with the FHFA to date.RBS is involved in another case with the FHFA where they are named co-defendant with Japanese bank Nomura. This is still ongoing following an appeal.The FHFA settlement \u201cis a stark reminder of what happened to this bank before the financial crisis, and the heavy price paid for its pursuit of global ambitions,\u201d RBS Chief Executive       Ross McEwan       said.The bank has shed a large chunk of its bond trading operations in the U.S. and is in the process of retreating to its U.K. base.\u2014Razak Musah Baba contributed to this articleWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 10:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rbs-agrees-to-5-5-billion-settlement-over-sale-of-mortgage-securities-during-crisis-1499864581", "news_title": "RBS Agrees to $5.5 Billion Settlement Over Sale of Mortgage Securities During Crisis ", "keywords": " financial crisis, mortgage crisis,rbs, royal bank of scotland, settlement, subprime crisis, toxic mortgage backed securities,Royal Bank of Scotland Group,RBS.LN,RBS,Federal Housing Finance Agency,U.K. government,U.S. Department of Justice,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Naples, Fla.Five bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathOverlooking Admiralty Bay, this 2015 home has a large lanai for outdoor entertaining.

But at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 3D technology is there not for entertainment but pain relief.Patients in chronic or acute pain have put on special goggles and traveled virtually through Iceland\u2019s waterfalls and valleys, floated among dolphins or meditated beside an idyllic coastline.Brennan Spiegel, a Cedars-Sinai researcher, says a virtual-reality experience can reduce pain by 24% or more, according to clinical trials he conducted in the past two years. VR eased different types of pain, from cancer to orthopedic injuries to abdominal discomfort.An immersive virtual-reality experience can commandeer a patient\u2019s brain so it no longer focuses on pain, says Dr. Spiegel, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work on everybody, but when it works, it really, really works.\u201dAt a time when doctors are scrambling to curb the use of addictive painkillers, he and others say VR could be an effective alternative or complementary treatment.Virtual-reality technology engages a person in a 360-degree visual experience. It has been used in medical research for more than two decades, to treat trauma, anxiety and even burn pain. The fact that it can now be accessed with headsets and mobile phones is fueling hospitals\u2019 interest.Researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital are using virtual reality in studies on pain and anxiety in youngsters and adolescents. NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan recently launched a VR study on patients in its burn center.AppliedVR, Inc., a private company headquartered in Los Angeles, says it is contributing and lending equipment or funding studies in four hospitals around the country to determine if virtual reality can ease pain and anxiety. The company also has sold virtual-reality equipment to about 100 hospitals. Chief Executive Matthew Stoudt says the firm has created or acquired a library of more than 20 experiences, as the VR scenarios are called.Virtual reality holds promise in alleviating psychological and physical pain, says Albert \u201cSkip\u201d Rizzo, a psychologist who has run his own virtual-reality laboratory at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since the 1990s.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have any illusions that you are going to have open-heart surgery and you are going to slap on the headset and do it without anesthesia,\u201d says Dr. Rizzo, a research professor in USC\u2019s psychiatry department.But virtual reality can have \u201cdramatic effects\u201d on reducing pain, he says.Years back, it was hard even to get funding. \u201cA lot of the agencies thought it was \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 \u201d he recalls. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the past year or two, and he believes that \u201cclinical virtual reality\u201d will be used more broadly in patient care. In 2015, Dr. Rizzo received a consulting fee of $1,200 from appliedVR.\u201cIt is Christmas time for virtual-reality researchers,\u201d says Hunter Hoffman, a VR pioneer and research scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who has used virtual reality to help burn victims for the past 20 years.Once upon a time, it was a costly research niche. \u201cWe used $90,000 computers and the helmet weighed 8 pounds,\u201d Dr. Hoffman remembers. Yet it was effective, and he and a research partner, Dr. David Patterson, used it to ease the pain burn victims felt. They designed a VR experience known as SnowWorld which was \u201cthe antithesis of fire,\u201d and used colors such as white and blue.\u201cVirtual reality hasn\u2019t been used as widely as it should be,\u201d Dr. Hoffman says. But now, he believes, \u201cwe are at the transition phase between research and clinical practice.\u201dAt Cedars-Sinai, patients in Dr. Spiegel\u2019s trials used an $800 kit consisting of a             Samsung                   headset and a Galaxy phone to access VR \u201cexperiences.\u201d The gear was provided by appliedVR, in partnership with Samsung.For some of the studies, the experiences included a tour of Iceland\u2019s terrain and a game called \u201cBear Blast,\u201d where participants shoot balls at animated teddy bears. In another experience\u2014a guided relaxation and meditation session alongside a waterfront\u2014an unseen narrator soothingly intones: \u201cSee if you can offer loving kindness to yourself by saying or thinking these words: May I be healthy. May I be happy.\u201dA study published in March about a group of 50 Cedars-Sinai patients who were offered the virtual-reality teddy bear game for their pain found \u201cstatistically significant and clinically relevant\u201d improvement. Another 50 patients, who were offered a relaxing video with scenes of lakes and running streams, experienced less relief. The paper, which appeared in the Journal of Medical Internet Research Mental Health, concluded that virtual reality \u201cmay be an effective adjunctive therapy\u201d for hospital patients. Dr. Spiegel was the senior author.In a new trial, Dr. Spiegel took 120 patients who were in pain and randomly assigned half to try VR experiences and half to watch a relaxation channel on hospital TV. Preliminary results show a larger drop in pain among the VR group than the TV one, he said.He now plans to measure whether there was a drop in the patients\u2019 opiate use. Dr. Spiegel says he received a $1,250 consulting fee from appliedVR and was reimbursed $889 for transportation; he has no other financial ties to the company. Samsung, in partnership with appliedVR, partially funded the most recent Cedars-Sinai clinical trial.Ernest \u201cBuck\u201d Shearer, a 40-year-old Cedars-Sinai patient who has endured considerable pain related to Crohn\u2019s disease, took part in a trial last spring and found relief with virtual reality. \u201cIt distracts your mind completely,\u201d he says. Mr. Shearer, who says he was on the opioid drug Dilaudid while hospitalized, says he would reach for the goggles during rough stretches between doses of the painkiller. \u201cIt helps you get through the hump,\u201d he says. Playing Bear Blast was a welcome distraction. \u201cOnce, I played the game and forgot it was time for my pain medicine.\u201dJoAnn Difede, a psychologist and professor at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill-Cornell Medicine, recently began testing VR on burn victims having staples removed after surgery. AppliedVR is funding her pilot study. \u201cBurn pain is extraordinarily difficult to control,\u201d says Dr. Difede, even using opiates.Dr. Difede, who has used virtual reality to treat trauma victims of the 9/11 attack and in the military, believes in its potential. \u201cThere is a lot of evidence it does reduce pain,\u201d she says. She hopes one day \u201cthe equipment is in every patient\u2019s room\u2014that VR is as ubiquitous as TV.\u201dAt Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, a trial led by Jeffrey Gold, a pediatric psychologist, offered patients a VR experience\u2014playing Bear Blast\u2014while they had their blood drawn. This simple procedure can be distressing for children who have complex diseases such as cancer. \u201cThey have been stuck numerous times and every needle poke is another trauma,\u201d Dr. Gold says. The study involved more than 100 patients ages 13 to 21, some of whom were offered VR, while others were given the usual care. The trial was funded by appliedVR. Dr. Gold says he has been an unpaid scientific adviser to the company and is negotiating to acquire options in it.Brandon Taitai has leukemia and has been a Children\u2019s Hospital patient since 2014. The 15-year-old says he isn\u2019t afraid of needles or having his blood drawn but enjoyed the VR experience. While playing Bear Blast he was \u201ca lot more focused on the game\u201d than on the blood test.Boston Children\u2019s Hospital has been using virtual reality to help calm children before they receive medicine intravenously or undergo endoscopies or colonoscopies. Kate Donovan, the hospital\u2019s Innovation Technology Coordinator, says children like the goggles. \u201cIt is a new toy for them,\u201d Dr. Donovan says. While the headsets aren\u2019t intended for anyone under 13, Boston Children\u2019s has offered them to patients as young as 8 whose parents have consented. The hospital is investing in more headsets from appliedVR and wants to study if VR can reduce reliance on pain medicine.To Dr. Spiegel of Cedars-Sinai one big advantage of virtual reality is that it has no side-effects other than possible dizziness. \u201cThe worst that happens is they [the patients] are entertained, but there is very little risk.\u201dAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'A Virtual Approach to Real Pain.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 10:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/enlisting-virtual-reality-to-ease-real-pain-1499869442", "news_title": "Enlisting Virtual Reality to Ease Real Pain", "keywords": "Cedars-Sinai,political,general news,medical research,health,sciences,humanities,technology,virtual reality technologies"}, {"content": "Iraqi Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi       declared victory Monday over Islamic State in Mosul, and Americans can also take pride at the end of a bloody three-year campaign that would not have happened without U.S. leadership and arms. The triumph will be short-lived, however, if the Baghdad government and U.S. repeat the mistakes they made after the successful \u201csurge\u201d of 2007-2008.The victory removes ISIS from the capital of the self-styled caliphate that       Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi       declared after routing the Iraqi army in Mosul in June 2014. It provides relief to tens of thousands of Iraqis living in fear of torture or death for even minor offenses against Shariah law, or for being a non-Muslim.It is also a morale boost to the Iraqi military and Mr. Abadi, who has proven to be a major improvement over predecessor       Nouri al-Maliki.       Particular credit goes to the Kurdish peshmerga who were the main resistance to Islamic State in 2014 and prevented a larger rout.The biggest problem with the Mosul campaign is that it took so long.       Barack Obama       never wanted to admit that his 2011 withdrawal of all U.S. forces was a blunder that required a U.S. military return to Iraq. He thus deployed a light footprint limited mainly to special forces and air power. New Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       accelerated the pace of battle after January. But the ability of ISIS to survive in Mosul for so long gave it an elan in the Islamic world that helped recruit young radicals and spread its brand around the world.Defeat in Mosul diminishes that appeal, a decline that will continue as the U.S. coalition closes in on Islamic State\u2019s Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. But the threat won\u2019t vanish, as the jihadists disperse into smaller cells in towns and cities across the Sunni heartland. The jihadists will return to their post-Saddam insurgent tactics and wait to exploit bad governance or more sectarian conflict.\u201cWe have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh [ISIS] cells, and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,\u201d Mr. Abadi said Monday, and we hope he means it.He could start by declaring his support for local Sunni government and preventing Iran-backed Shiite militias from treating Sunnis like members of Islamic State as they go door to door in Mosul. He needs to rebuild Mosul rapidly and more effectively than his government has Fallujah and other former ISIS-run cities. (See       Seth Jones      nearby.)The Trump Administration can help by negotiating a modest U.S. military presence that will remain in Iraq for the long run. Mr. Mattis told the Senate in June that such a force could serve \u201cin a training role and mentoring role in Iraq if we work that out with the government.\u201d A U.S. presence will serve as a moderating voice among the Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish factions. And it may give Mr. Abadi more courage to resist becoming a de facto subsidiary of Iran and its Hezbollah-like militias in Iraq.This will be crucial as September\u2019s Kurdish independence referendum approaches, which may threaten the Abadi government. Iran would love a fractured and diminished Baghdad to replace Mr. Abadi with an ally like Mr. Maliki. A politically stable and independent Iraq, by contrast, would improve the chances of stabilizing Syria after ISIS is swept from Raqqa. There are no permanent victories in the Middle East, but the liberation of Mosul is an important milestone in the war against radical Islam.Appeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 10:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-victory-in-mosul-1499814467", "news_title": "After Victory in Mosul", "keywords": "political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,torture,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Exchange-traded funds and actively managed mutual funds are competing to see which can gain the most business as the result of the recently passed fiduciary rule.The U.S. Labor Department rule, which went into effect in June, requires advisers overseeing trillions of dollars of tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in clients\u2019 best interest. That would appear to favor ETFs, thanks to their fee transparency and low costs. By contrast, mutual funds\u2014long a mainstay in retirement accounts\u2014charge a variety of fees that are passed on to brokers, which have become a focal point of debate surrounding the fiduciary rule. That practice becomes more tricky for advisers under the new rule.But actively managed mutual funds aren\u2019t sitting back: They are scrambling to launch new share classes with fee structures meant to help brokers comply with the fiduciary rule.\u201cFor an adviser under a fiduciary standard to justify not using an ETF, they\u2019ll need to make the case that any additional cost or uncertainty around performance is justified, and that\u2019s a pretty tough case to make,\u201d says       Dave Nadig,        chief executive of ETF.com. ETFs will become almost a safe harbor, Mr. Nadig says.Already, financial data show that ETFs are making gains. U.S. ETFs took in $466 billion in the 12 months through the end of June, according to             Morningstar Inc.       That\u2019s more than double the inflow for the year-earlier period. Actively managed U.S. mutual funds, meanwhile, experienced $290 billion in net outflows over the 12 months through the end of May, the latest data available from Morningstar.While there are a number of forces behind the shift from active to passive funds, the fiduciary rule is one of the drivers behind the ETFs\u2019 inflows, says Jennifer Muzerall, who heads ETF research at Cerulli Associates. Complying with the rule will force many advisers to reconsider the costs of investment management, and many advisers believe that lower-cost investment products translate to less business risk, she says.A January survey of 1,500 U.S. financial advisers by Cerulli found that 45% of advisers planned to increase their ETF use and 32% planned to increase their allocations to passive investment products in preparation for a new regulatory environment. Financial advisers are expected to increase the percentage of clients\u2019 assets and holdings they allocate to ETFs by 25% over the next two years\u2014to 15.7% in 2018 from 12.6% in 2016, the study found.\u201cThese conversations have already started,\u201d says Colleen Bell, first vice president, fiduciary services, at Cambridge Investment Research Inc. Advisers are looking at all of the costs across their portfolio holdings with an eye toward lowering the costs if it\u2019s right for the client, she says.\u201cAdvisers are doing this given that their responsibilities include monitoring expenses related to client portfolios as well as compliance with the [fiduciary] regulation,\u201d Ms. Bell says.Still, mutual-fund firms are taking steps to remain competitive. Fund companies in recent months have been launching or preparing new types of fund shares for advisers working with retirement savers. One form of these new shares, clean shares, would charge only the fee to manage and operate a mutual fund and not include payments to distributors. If investors buy such funds through brokers, the brokerages would charge the clients separately.Indeed, some brokerages are charging the same fees across different types of products to avoid any appearance that they have an incentive to recommend one product over another. They can do this by selling mutual-fund clean shares that don\u2019t pay them a fee, and then charging a level fee separately for either mutual funds or ETFs.For now, mutual funds are still the dominant product found in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Of the assets held in 401(k) plans, $3.2 trillion, or 64%, were in mutual funds as of the end of March, according to the Investment Company Institute. ETFs comprised just 0.09% of 401(k) plan assets as of December, according to Cerulli Associates.Mutual funds are likely to retain their advantage in 401(k) retirement plans because the plans generally aren\u2019t set up to handle ETFs\u2019 intraday trading. Many plan sponsors\u2014though not all\u2014are so large that they can get the institutional shares of mutual funds, which have expense ratios that are priced below those of some ETFs. In addition, some of the characteristics that make ETFs attractive in the retail space, such as tax efficiency and trading flexibility, are \u201ca nonissue or potentially even a negative\u201d in the retirement space, says Steven Miyao, president of DST Distribution Solutions.ETFs may have more of a growth opportunity, however, in IRAs. Of the $8.2 trillion held in IRAs in the U.S. as of the end of March, $3.9 trillion, or 48%, was in mutual funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. The rest was held in other investments, including ETFs, according to the organization.Demand for ETFs among IRA holders could increase due to changes that some broker-dealers are making in response to the fiduciary rule. Edward Jones, for instance, has created a commission-based IRA with a required minimum investment of $100,000 which allows for the purchase of ETFs and other products, such as stocks and bonds\u2014but not mutual funds.The fiduciary rule might increase the flow of funds to ETFs in another way as well. As the rule encourages more advisers to shift to fee-based accounts, some will likely decide not to keep smaller accounts, which might not be economically feasible under such a pricing model. Some of those investors are likely to turn to robo advisers, which are heavily invested in ETFs, says Michael Wong, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar.The rule also may have a much wider reach than originally expected. While it applies only to tax-advantaged retirement savings, the industry overall is likely to move toward more transparency whether in retirement accounts or stand-alone brokerage accounts, says       Shawn McNinch,        global head of ETF services in investor services at Brown Brothers Harriman.\u201cWhile the fiduciary rule may not have its tentacles in all accounts, it\u2019s bringing a shift in mind-set for the whole adviser-to-investor dynamic,\u201d another factor that could benefit low-cost ETFs, he says.Ms. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Another reading of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a well-connected Russian lawyer is, well, political farce.In June 2016, Mr. Trump Jr. arranged an appointment in Trump Tower with the lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya.       He said in a statement that he hoped to acquire opposition research about       Hillary Clinton,        and he even pulled in Trump son-in-law       Jared Kushner       and then campaign manager       Paul Manafort.       By Mr. Trump Jr.\u2019s account, Ms. Veselnitskaya relayed nothing to compromise Mrs. Clinton and then lobbied him about the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law that sanctions Russian human-rights abusers.According to the emails that Mr. Trump Jr. released Tuesday, Mr. Trump Jr. agreed to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya after he was approached by       Rob Goldstone,        a publicist who offered to pass along \u201csome official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\u201d He wrote that this information \u201cis part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201dThe appropriate response from a political competent would have been to alert the FBI if a cut-out promised material supplied by a foreign government. Mr. Trump Jr. instead replied that \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201dThen again, the Trumps knew Mr. Goldstone through the Russian pop star Emin, aka       Emin Agalarov,        whose father partnered with Donald Trump Sr. in bringing the       Miss Universe       beauty pageant to Moscow in 2013. Mr. Trump Sr. appeared in a music video with Emin the same year. Mr. Goldstone said that \u201cEmin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting\u201d\u2014info his father got from the \u201cCrown prosecutor of Russia.\u201d Russia\u2019s \u201cCrown prosecutor\u201d doesn\u2019t exist.Mr. Trump Jr. responded that \u201cperhaps I just speak to Emin first.\u201d Mr. Goldstone brokered the call, reporting that \u201cOk he\u2019s on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 Minutes so I am sure can call.\u201d Subsequent messages show Emin asked Mr. Trump Jr. to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya, who was well-known as an anti-Magnitsky operative at the time. Mr. Goldstone publicly checked into Trump Tower on             Facebook                   during the meeting, which isn\u2019t how a KGB man would normally conceal the handoff of state secrets.In the daisy chain from Russian oligarch to singer to PR go-between to lawyer to Trump scion, which is more plausible? That Don Jr. was canny enough to coordinate a global plot to rig the election but not canny enough to notice that this plot was detailed in his personal emails? Or that some Russians took advantage of a political naif named Trump in an unsuccessful bid to undermine the Magnitsky law they hated?The problem is that President Trump has too often made the implausible plausible by undermining his own credibility on Russia. He\u2019s stocked his cabinet with Russia hawks but dallied with characters like the legendary Beltway bandit Mr. Manafort or the conspiratorialist       Roger Stone.       His Syrian bombing and energy policy are tough on Russia, but Mr. Trump thinks that if he says Russia interfered in 2016 he will play into the Democratic narrative that his victory is illegitimate.Thus in retrospect the       John Podesta       and Democratic National Committee hacks\u2014still so far the tangible extent of Russian meddling\u2014did less damage to U.S. democracy than it has done to the Trump Presidency.

Ward Carroll, a former F-14 Tomcat radar intercept officer, recalled that in the Top Gun-era game of chicken in the 1980s, slow-flying Soviet warplanes would lumber past U.S. aircraft carriers. A carrier would launch fighters to intercept them, with Mr. Carroll and his fellow naval aviators flying high-speed passes over Soviet ships as a show of force.The aerial maneuvers had a serious purpose during what one Russian-language aviation history described as the \u201chot skies of the Cold War.\u201d Both militaries could test the other\u2019s tactics, assessing the range and capabilities of ships and aircraft.The Soviets wanted to score propaganda points by capturing images of their planes buzzing U.S. carriers. The Americans intercepting them wanted to take close-up photos of the antennae and telltale bumps on the fuselage of the Soviet aircraft that could reveal vital intelligence about their capabilities.\u201cAnytime they took a picture of a carrier, you wanted a Tomcat in the picture,\u201d Mr. Carroll recalled. \u201cIt was photobombing. That was our job, to photobomb the Russians as they flew past the carrier.\u201dThe game of nerves had lighter moments, underscoring a sort of camaraderie among aviators. Mr. Carroll recalled flashing copies of Playboy magazines at the Soviet pilots, and he and his colleagues removing their helmets and putting on Ronald Reagan masks to spoil Russian photographs.Write to Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 10:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-tensions-in-air-recall-top-gun-era-1499868737", "news_title": "New Tensions in Air Recall \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Era", "keywords": "cold war,soviet-nato confrontations"}, {"content": "NATO and Russian pilots are reviving a Cold War contest of nerves, increasing the risk that airborne close encounters could accidentally spark a conflict.Over the past three years, the number of adversarial flights near the other side\u2019s planes and ships have increased significantly. The tactic, usually meant as a show of force or used to test tactics, revives a dormant game of chicken long played by Soviet and North Atlantic Treaty Organization pilots.It was a risky game: Aircraft sometimes narrowly avoided midair collisions, and opposing ships occasionally collided at sea. NATO officials now worry about a new phase of reckless gamesmanship and its consequences.Concerns have risen to the point where they now figure large in conversations between NATO and Russia. The NATO-Russia Council, a body established in\u00a02002 to encourage cooperation and consultation between Moscow and the alliance, is set to meet\u00a0Thursday to discuss large-scale Russian exercises in September. Western officials worry the exercises could lead to a new surge in midair incidents.The Baltic Sea has become the focal point for this new white-knuckle geopolitical tussle. Rhetoric is rising in the region, where newer NATO members on Russia\u2019s border are nervous and Russia\u2019s military has shown a willingness to use close intercepts as political messages.NATO and U.S. officials believe an accidental air-to-air collision, or a plane crashing into a ship, is one of the most dangerous threats facing the alliance. A deadly mishap could engender an escalation\u2014with each side accusing the other of provocation.\u201cWhat we see in\u00a0the\u00a0Baltic Sea is increased military activity\u2014we see it on land, at sea and in the air, and that just underlines the importance of transparency and predictability to prevent incidents and accidents,\u201d NATO Secretary General       Jens Stoltenberg       said. \u201cAnd if they happen, it is important to make sure they don\u2019t spiral out of control and create dangerous situations.\u201dAllies are expected to raise the issue of the intercepts at Thursday\u2019s meeting, officials said. Allied officials said risk reduction in the Baltic Sea is a concern, in particular in light of what one NATO official called \u201cunsafe and unprofessional behaviors by Russian pilots.\u201dThe air-safety issue has been discussed in that forum before, but it is taking on renewed urgency because of the coming exercises and several close calls this year.Global Zero, a research and advocacy group that opposes nuclear weapons, analyzed 97 midair confrontations between Western and Russian military aircraft over the Baltic between March 2014 and April 2017, more than two-thirds the global total of air intercepts in that period. Such confrontations were rarer in the decade before Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in early 2014.Markers are already down. The U.S. recently accused a Russian Su-27 jet fighter of unsafely intercepting an American reconnaissance plane on June 19 and flying erratically just yards away from it.Two days later, Russian television broadcast footage appeared to show a Polish F-16 approaching a plane with the Russian defense minister on board. A Russian Su-27 fighter then zooms into the picture, performing what the Russians described as a warning maneuver before flying away. The channel quoted Russian military expert       Alexander Zhilin       as saying the allied pilots \u201care conducting themselves simply like bandits.\u201dPoland has said its plane was on a NATO patrol mission when it intercepted the Russian jet. NATO officials have said there was nothing unprofessional about the intercept.Western officials and the Global Zero report say it is Russian pilots who more often undertake unsafe intercepts. Some, they say, are accidents, some negligence, and others intentional shows of force.Lukasz Kulesa, research director at the European Leadership Network, a London-based think tank, said some of the most recent incidents \u201cseem to be connected to sending a message to the other side.\u201dMr. Kulesa noted that Russian aircraft approached American spy planes over the Baltic Sea shortly after an escalation in the confrontation between the U.S.-led coalition and the Syrian regime that led to the shooting down of a pro-regime\u00a0drone and Syrian warplane by American aircraft.\u201cIt\u2019s a way to say that we, the Russians, are displeased with your behavior,\u201d Mr. Kulesa said.Some allied and U.S. officials believe the Russian government uses confrontations to turn up and down the pressure in the region for geopolitical advantage, ordering pilots to be cautious or to approach more aggressively.Moscow denies this and that their pilots are at fault, saying it is the West that has been eroding security by building up its military forces on Russia\u2019s borders.NATO and Russia are working to agree on \u201crisk reduction\u201d measures in the Baltic region. Western and Russian officials say progress is a test of each side\u2019s seriousness about dialogue despite deep suspicion.\u201cWe share the view dialogue is important,\u201d       Alexander Grushko,        Russia\u2019s ambassador to NATO, said last month. \u201cThe prevention of military incidents demands\u2026systemic communications between the two militaries, and discussions [by] military experts.\u201dFinland has organized one discussion between NATO and Russia on safety measures and proposed requiring all planes to use transponders. Allied officials have reacted skeptically to the transponder measure, noting many Russian military aircraft don\u2019t have transponders. American reconnaissance planes also don\u2019t always operate with them on.Many Western official fear the large military exercises Russia and Belarus are planning for the fall will raise the risk of an incident. In a sign of the concern about potential provocations by Russia, the U.S. adjusted the rotation of fighter planes for the NATO air-policing mission in the Baltic, so that its planes rather than those of less-experienced pilots from other NATO countries would be on alert during the Russian exercises in the fall.When Russia begins its major exercise, called Zapad or West, over the Baltic airspace in September, Sweden will be conducting its own, called Aurora, joined by a number of NATO countries,.\u201cWe hope everyone keeps calm,\u201d Finnish Defense Minister       Jussi Niinist\u00f6       said.Write to Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'Risky Test of Wills Unfolds Over Baltic Sea.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-nato-planes-contest-airspace-over-baltic-sea-1499868000", "news_title": "Russian, NATO Planes Play Risky Game Over Baltic Sea", "keywords": "baltic sea,cold war,nato,north atlantic treaty organization,russia,russia-nato relations,u.s.,united states,NATO,NATO-Russia Council"}, {"content": "J.P.

Spears is a perfectly entertaining pop icon currently amid a long residency/convalescence in Las Vegas, but I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s the best selection. Minneapolis music hero and halftime show legend Prince would have been an ideal pick, but since Prince is no longer with us, there\u2019s really only one choice for next year\u2019s game in the Land of 10,000 Lakes:Dylan.As in Bob Dylan, born Robert Zimmerman, of Hibbing, Minn.Come on. You know I\u2019m right.He\u2019s the most consequential voice in modern American music. He literally changed songwriting. Dylan won a Nobel Prize, for goodness\u2019 sake. How many Super Bowl acts have won the Nobel Prize? Did Katy Perry win a Nobel? I\u2019m like 90% sure she hasn\u2019t. Yet.And Nobel Dylan is still out there, rambling on the road, playing. On July 12, he was scheduled to play in Winnipeg, Manitoba. On July 14, he\u2019s off to Saskatoon. The next night, Moose Jaw. Then Calgary, Dawson Creek, Prince George, Kelowna and Vancouver. I guess Dylan\u2019s still pretty big in Canada.Dylan does have Super Bowl history\u2014he did two Super Bowl commercials in 2014, for Chrysler and Chobani yogurt\u2014but I know there are some issues with him doing the halftime show. Even the Dylanologists will agree with me on this one. For starters, will he even show up? The man is a famously reliable touring performer, but he did blow off the Nobel Ceremony in Sweden. Patti Smith did a tribute instead. You\u2019re going to have to make sure he shows up for the game. He\u2019s going to need a lot of advance warning. Maybe more than advance warning. I\u2019m not saying the NFL should abduct Bob Dylan and hold him in a Minneapolis hotel suite for a month to make sure he shows up at the Super Bowl halftime show. But I\u2019m not, not saying it, either.(And even if Dylan blows it off, then maybe we get a Patti Smith halftime show\u2014not bad either!)If Dylan does show, the playlist may be a tad problematic. Casual fans will want to hear the hits\u2014\u201cBlowing in the Wind,\u201d \u201cSubterranean Homesick Blues,\u201d \u201cTangled Up in Blue,\u201d etc. Right there you\u2019re in trouble. \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d is seven minutes long. The halftime show is only 12. Bob Dylan\u2019s not going to cut down \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d or throw it into a medley. Who wants that, anyway? Do you really want to miss the part where he\u2019s working on a fishing boat outside of Delacroix? Or the book of poems from an Italian poet from the 13th century? I don\u2019t think so. What if he does \u201cSad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\u201d or \u201cDesolation Row\u201d? That\u2019s 12 minutes right there.Then the Dylan freaks may want deeper cuts: \u201cCovenant Woman,\u201d \u201cBrownsville Girl,\u201d \u201cCaribbean Wind. He hasn\u2019t played \u201cBuckets of Rain\u201d since 1990. Wow, that would be a doozy if he played \u201cBuckets of Rain.\u201d It would be bigger than the Super Bowl itself. Or what about \u201cChanging of the Guards?\u201dThat would really be incredible, man.So we may have a 80-minute Super Bowl halftime show. I think the players will be OK with it. They can take naps. Or, better yet, watch Dylan.Of course, Bob does what Bob wants\u2014that\u2019s why he\u2019s Dylan. He might just show up and do Sinatra covers. Which would also be cool.I know, I know, I know: Dylan\u2019s lost a step in his live performances in over the past few decades. He\u2019s not going to be bouncing around the stage like Coldplay. He can be mumbly and difficult to understand and his voice is\u2026oh, for crying out loud, he\u2019s Bob Dylan, he\u2019s a legend, this whole thing makes too much sense.And if not Dylan, I\u2019d also be OK with Morris Day and the Time.Or fine, you can have Miley Cyrus, what do I care?Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 09:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bob-dylan-must-play-minnesotas-super-bowl-1499867138", "news_title": "Bob Dylan Must Play Minnesota\u2019s Super Bowl", "keywords": "bob dylan,bob dylan minnesota,bob dylan nobel prize,bob dylan super bowl,britney spears,super bowl lii,super bowl minnesota,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,sports,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "ATHENS\u2014The European Union should end disciplinary procedure against Greece over its excessive deficit, the European Commission said on Wednesday, in a largely symbolic yet timely move, as the government considers when it should tap the bond markets.The European Commission announced that it recommends the closure of the Excessive Deficit Procedure against Greece for the first time since 2009, as the country\u2019s fiscal position has improved.\u201cGreece is now ready to exit the EDP, turn the page on austerity and open a new chapter of growth, investment and employment,\u201d EU budget commissioner       Pierre Moscovici       said in a statement, calling the decision \u201ca very symbolic moment for Greece.\u201dGreece\u2019s general government balance has improved from a deficit of 15.1% in 2009 to a surplus of 0.7% in 2016.

Gox collapsed, its former head went on trial this week as customers continued to wait for a clear answer on how exactly the company lost virtual currency valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Mark Karpel\u00e8s, who was arrested in 2015 and released the following year pending trial, is charged with embezzlement and creation of unauthorized records at his company.Prosecutors at the Tokyo District Court said Tuesday that Mr. Karpel\u00e8s wrongfully spent \u00a5340 million ($3 million) of customers\u2019 money for his personal use. They also said he altered the company\u2019s books to inflate the amount of dollars and bitcoins held by customers.Mr. Karpel\u00e8s denied all wrongdoing at the hearing. \u201cI have never manipulated the exchange\u2019s data or used customer money for my own benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cI am innocent.\u201dHe repeated his contention that the exchange\u2019s collapse was caused by hackers, and he said he regretted that he was unable to prevent the losses suffered by customers. Mr. Karpel\u00e8s said he was willing to cooperate with a trustee handling Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy and authorities in trying to locate the lost bitcoins.The 32-year-old Frenchman, who currently works as an engineer in Japan, said the exchange had been profitable and the money he had spent on personal items came from his own funds, not customers\u2019 accounts. He said the accounting moves cited by prosecutors had been part of the exchange platform\u2019s normal operations.The amount at the center of the case represents a fraction of the money involved when Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014. At the time, Mr. Karpel\u00e8s said 750,000 bitcoins held by customers as well as 100,000 of Mt. Gox\u2019s own bitcoins had been stolen by hackers. Together, the lost virtual currency was then valued at some $500 million, although the exchange later said it had discovered 200,000 of the missing bitcoins.The court-appointed trustee in charge of the exchange\u2019s liquidation,       Nobuaki Kobayashi,        has been investigating the whereabouts of the lost currency, but he has yet to release any conclusions. A representative of Mr. Kobayashi said he wasn\u2019t available to comment.The exchange has a list of about 127,000 creditors. Many have said they don\u2019t expect to get their money back and postings related to the exchange\u2019s collapse on online bitcoin forums have died down.\u201cI moved on,\u201d said       Hiroki Minematsu,        an owner of technology companies in Nagasaki who deposited 70 bitcoins at Mt. Gox. \u201cIt would be nice if they find out what had exactly happened to serve my curiosity, but I threw away my hope for my investment a long time ago.\u201dMt. Gox, one of the first bitcoin trading platforms, was among several virtual-currency exchanges that collapsed against a backdrop of security or governance problems.When Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, the price of bitcoin, which was then slightly under $600, sustained a brief hit as investors questioned whether the virtual currency could survive.However, other exchanges have since sprung up and regulations have begun to define more clearly how bitcoin should be handled. Japanese rules that went into effect April 1 established bitcoin as a legitimate payment method and required exchanges to segregate customer accounts and monitor potential criminal activity.Growing interest from Japanese investors reassured by the new regulations\u2014as well as users in China who jumped on the currency as a way to transfer money\u2014has helped bitcoin surge to around $2,300.Japanese trials tend to proceed in fits and starts, and experts said it would likely take at least a year for the Tokyo District Court to reach a verdict on the charges against Mr. Karpel\u00e8s.Write to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'As Trial Starts, Bitcoin Investors Still Waiting.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 08:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-chief-of-collapsed-bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox-stands-trial-in-tokyo-1499862309", "news_title": "Former Chief of Collapsed Bitcoin Exchange Mt.

The audience is too old, the games are too long and far too often, everyone is standing around doing nothing besides inspiring people to reach for the remote out of sheer boredom.But after this week\u2019s All-Star festivities, it\u2019s clear that MLB has found one crucial asset that has long eluded it: a true superstar capable of leading baseball into the future not just on the field, but in the cultural zeitgeist.Aaron Judge, the hulking behemoth who occupies right field for the New York Yankees, is precisely what baseball has been looking for. He\u2019s eminently personable, he plays for the game\u2019s most popular team and in its most visible market, and he\u2019s an unstoppable monster with a bat in his hands.The first half of Judge\u2019s rookie season was nothing short of historic.He leads the majors with 30 home runs, putting him on a pace to finish with 57, which would be the most for anybody in more than a decade. He stole the show in Monday\u2019s Home Run Derby, dazzling the crowd and awing his peers by blasting 47 balls over the fence at cavernous Marlins Park, including four that traveled more than 500 feet. American League manager Brad Mills batted Judge third in Tuesday night\u2019s All-Star Game to ensure that he hit in the first inning \u201cbecause of the story he\u2019s been all year long.\u201d\u201cAaron Judge has been absolutely phenomenal. There\u2019s no other word to describe it,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. \u201cHe is a tremendous talent on the field, a really appealing off-the-field personality\u2014the kind of player that can become the face of the game.\u201dBaseball has no shortage of remarkable young talents, as many as the sport has seen in a long time. Mike Trout, the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 25-year-old center fielder who missed the All-Star Game with an injury, is undisputedly the best player on Earth, putting up numbers that defy belief. Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw has a chance to go down as one of the best pitchers ever to climb atop a mound, a modern-day Sandy Koufax for a new era. Bryce Harper, the Washington Nationals\u2019 wunderkind, is just 24 but has already appeared in five All-Star Games.But none of those players, as spectacular as they are, has created the buzz that Judge has already been able to generate.Trout shies away from the spotlight and has toiled away for a losing team that isn\u2019t even the most popular in its own metropolitan area. As a pitcher, Kershaw only plays once every five days, limiting his impact. Harper, while undeniably exciting, has been divisive and inconsistent at times.That\u2019s why       Tony Clark,        the executive director of the MLB Players Association, acknowledged that when it comes to marketing players, \u201cWe\u2019ve got some catching up to do there.\u201d\u201cI think we have an opportunity with the guys that we have to really move our game forward in that regard,\u201d Clark added. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get there.\u201dIt will start with the 25-year-old Judge. In his brief career, Judge, who stands at 6-foot-7 and weighs 282 pounds, has shown a willingness to embrace the responsibility of stardom without ego. His segment on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in May was an instant hit, and he has thus far handled the outsized amount of attention he has received, both from the media and from fans.And the nation has responded: The average total live audience for the Home Run Derby rose 55% from last year and was the most watched Derby since 2008, with Judge serving as the main attraction.Asked about Manfred citing him as a potential face of baseball, Judge hesitated. He let out a nervous chuckle. Then he hesitated again.\u201cI don\u2019t know about the face of MLB baseball,\u201d Judge said, flashing his trademark broad smile. \u201cI\u2019m just out here to do a job and just try to do the best I can every day.\u201dWith its deep history and conservative roots, baseball has struggled to market its stars beyond its own confines. Trout, like       Derek Jeter       before him, rarely shows much personality, yet receives praise from his peers for playing the game \u201cthe right way.\u201d Harper, the rare player who seems to recognize the value of marketing himself beyond just baseball, is often criticized for being cocky and brash. Baseball needs stars to remain relevant, but in baseball, conformity is king. It\u2019s a dilemma.\u201cYou talk about marketing the game and players becoming the face of the game,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cOur game is a team sport. That creates inherent limitations in terms of how big a star any individual player can become. It actually creates a reluctance among players, sometimes, to market themselves.\u201dIt is, of course, a bit premature to anoint Judge as a lasting crossover star that can transcend baseball the way, say, Stephen Curry and LeBron James have transcended basketball. Judge still hasn\u2019t played a full major-league season.Still, even in an All-Star Game where he failed to contribute\u2014he went 0-for-3, prompting Yankees reliever Dellin Betances to quip that he was \u201cprobably exhausted from all those home runs he hit [Monday] night\u201d\u2014Judge commanded more attention than anybody.That includes Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano, whose 10th inning homer off Chicago Cubs closer Wade Davis propelled the AL to a 2-1 victory and earned him All-Star MVP honors. (For the first time since 2002, the All-Star Game didn\u2019t determine home-field advantage in the World Series, a provision of baseball\u2019s new collective bargaining agreement.)In the clubhouse afterward, Judge fielded questions from a swarm of reporters, expertly deflecting grand proclamations about what his future holds or his place in baseball. But one thing was certain: Judge came to Miami as a curiosity\u2014and left a star.\u201cWhat a day,\u201d Judge said. \u201cWhat a couple days.\u201dWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 08:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aaron-judge-the-brightest-star-among-all-stars-1499861752", "news_title": "Aaron Judge: The Brightest Star Among All-Stars ", "keywords": "aaron judge,aaron judge home runs,baseball,home runs,mlb,new york yankees,yankees judge,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Britain must stand by the spending commitments it has made to the European Union if it wants to progress during Brexit talks into discussions on a future trade deal, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator       Michel Barnier       said on Wednesday.With the second round of Brexit talks set to start next Monday, Mr. Barnier urged the U.K. government to present position papers on all the priority issues in the talks, saying that so far Britain had only set out its stance on the future rights of EU citizens in the U.K. once Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.The EU has placed several key divorce issues as priorities in the talks, which it says must be tackled before the bloc starts working on the outlines of a future trade deal. They are citizens\u2019 rights, the situation in Northern Ireland and a divorce bill, which represents British EU spending pledges agreed in the past.\u201cThese three priority subjects\u2026are indivisible,\u201d Mr. Barnier said in a press conference. \u201cNow what that means in other words is that progress on one or two of these subjects would not be sufficient in order for us to be able to move onto\u201d discussions on a future trade deal.\u201cThe sooner we receive clarification on the British positions from the topics we have not heard from them on, the better,\u201d the former French foreign minister said, adding that he would work through the July 14 holiday to comb through British positions. \u201cI am ready. Our team is ready.\u201d\u2018I am not hearing any whistling, just the clock ticking\u2019Mr. Barnier said the EU team would send additional position papers on divorce issues to London ahead of next week\u2019s talks. They have already sent nine such papers on specific divorce issues.EU officials have said the U.K. should stand by financial commitments worth upward of \u20ac60 billion ($68.81 billion) when it leaves. U.K. officials have said they would abide by legal commitments but have questioned the reasoning behind demands for large sums. On Tuesday, U.K. Foreign Secretary       Boris Johnson       called such large figures \u201cextortionate\u201d and said that Brussels can \u201cgo whistle\u201d if they want Britain to pay such amounts.Mr. Barnier responded to that comment in his remarks on Wednesday: \u201cI am not hearing any whistling, just the clock ticking,\u201d he said, referring to the tight timetable for the exit talks.Mr. Barnier has in the past said he hopes to be in a position to recommend to EU leaders in October that enough progress has been made on the priority divorce issues for negotiations to move ahead. However there have been warnings from officials and diplomats in Brussels that if Britain doesn\u2019t speed its responses on the main issues, that timetable may be delayed. Mr. Barnier didn\u2019t specifically echo that.Mr. Barnier confirmed he would meet U.K. upper house lawmakers later Wednesday and would hold meetings with various British politicians later in the week. They include Labour Party leader       Jeremy Corbyn       and the heads of the Scottish and Welsh governments.He said he has always made clear that he wanted to hear from various people in the British debate on Brexit.\u201cOf course, I will only negotiate with the U.K. government,\u201d he added.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 08:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-barnier-says-u-k-must-honor-its-spending-pledges-1499862757", "news_title": "EU\u2019s Barnier Says U.K. Must Honor Its Spending Pledges ", "keywords": "brexit divorce bill,brexit inset,European Union,U.K. government,Michel Barnier,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,society,community,international relations,politics,domestic politics,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "Activision Blizzard Inc.       on Wednesday unveiled a roster of sports-team owners and videogame-industry veterans involved in an esports league it pledged to launch before the end of the year.The company is building a league around \u201cOverwatch,\u201d betting on a year-old shooter videogame with a cartoonish bent that has more than 30 million registered players but lacks the lineage of a franchise such as \u201cCall of Duty.\u201dActivision Blizzard, which reported $6.61 billion in revenue last year, is looking to build on a growth streak that has helped its stock more than quadruple in the past five years to about $58 a share. \u201cThey\u2019ve aggressively sold this story to Wall Street and the expectation is that at some point in the next three to five years, esports will be a meaningful profit contributor,\u201d Cowen & Co. analyst       Doug Creutz       said.The rollout of Overwatch League is being watched closely as a signal for whether publishers can win control of the multimillion-dollar competitions sprouting around their biggest videogames. Two rivals\u2014            Electronic Arts Inc.       and             Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.      \u2014are developing their own leagues.They are looking to capture a market whose average fan, according to Newzoo BV, is between the ages of 21 and 35\u2014a coveted demographic for advertisers. Roughly 191 million people world-wide this year are expected to watch an esports competition at least once a month, more than double the number in 2012, the research firm estimates.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Activision Blizzard Chief Executive       Bobby Kotick       said the rollout was going according to plan. The company is banking on city-based teams, a structure typical of traditional sports leagues, to drive growth. \u201cWe wanted to introduce that to esports,\u201d he said.Seven teams are on board so far. The buyers paid $20 million apiece, the going rate this year, said people familiar with the matter. The launch draws on a roster of executives, athletes and locales familiar to sports fans.Groups backed by       Robert Kraft,        owner of the National Football League\u2019s New England Patriots, and       Jeff Wilpon,        operating chief of Major League Baseball\u2019s Mets, bought rights to teams in Boston and New York, respectively.Mr. Kraft said he considers his bet on esports on par with his backing of Major League Soccer in the 1990s. It took about five years for his New England Revolution to become profitable, and it remains so today, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking long here,\u201d Mr. Kraft said.Mr. Wilpon said he didn\u2019t follow esports until his venture-capital firm, Sterling.VC, began looking into the industry. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t make the investment if we didn\u2019t think it would be profitable,\u201d he said. There are \u201cgood advertisers out there looking to get in on this demographic,\u201d he added.NRG Esports, an established esports outfit, has the rights to a team in San Francisco. NRG, founded by members of a group that owns the National Basketball Association\u2019s Sacramento Kings, counts       Alex Rodriguez       and       Shaquille O\u2019Neal       among its investors.

As more esports leagues are launched, it could become more difficult to stand out, said       Michael Pachter,        an analyst at Wedbush Securities.The Overwatch League calls for broad revenue sharing between Activision Blizzard and team owners for local and global advertising, merchandising, ticket sales, broadcast rights and other avenues. Teams can host as many as five amateur events a year, keeping all revenue.Additionally, owners will receive half of revenue from sales of team-branded virtual goods sold inside \u201cOverwatch.\u201dMany details of the league still aren\u2019t known, including other possible team owners and locations, or the launch date. Activision Blizzard said it isn\u2019t planning to launch at BlizzCon, its annual showcase in November.The company expects the league to ultimately field 28 teams.

Several organizations were involved in organizing mass protests over the past year against the governor of Jakarta, an ethnic-Chinese Christian whom they had accused of blaspheming Islam. The governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, lost his re-election bid in April and was subsequently convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to two years in prison, stirring widespread concern about the growing power of Islamists in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation.Wednesday\u2019s announcement, which was made by Indonesia\u2019s chief security minister Gen. Wiranto, gives the government the power to ban mass organizations, circumventing a potentially lengthy court process to outlaw specific groups.The most likely target is an international group called Hizbut Tahrir, which argues that Indonesia should adopt Islamic Shariah laws and become part of a transnational caliphate. The government had said earlier that it planned to ban them. But, many political analysts say, the decree could also apply to other domestic groups, such as the Islamic Defenders Front, whose influence grew sharply during the blasphemy case against Mr. Purnama.Gen. Wiranto, who, like many Indonesians, uses one name, told reporters that some groups pose a threat to the unity of Indonesia and that the new measure was designed to safeguard the country\u2019s pluralist traditions, which guarantee rights for Christians, Buddhists and other minority religious groups. It wasn\u2019t designed to marginalize Muslim groups, he said.The decree, which Mr. Widodo signed on Monday, is effective immediately but will be debated in the country\u2019s parliament later.Indonesia\u2019s largest Muslim group, the moderate Nahdlatul Ulama, supported the measure.

It is currently owned by             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.        GS -0.20%       and private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP. GCA was acquired from             Blackstone Group        BX 0.78%       LP in 2016. Terms of that deal weren\u2019t given. Blackstone bought GCA in 2012 from a group led by investment firm Nautic Partners LLC for an undisclosed sum.ABM, which has a market value of about $2.2 billion, will pay $851 million in cash and $399 million in common stock for GCA, ABM said in a prepared statement. ABM will incur a $70 million charge in connection with the deal, and it is expected to add about $1.1 billion in revenue after a year, with $600 million coming in the education industry group.ABM provides cleaning, parking and maintenance, among other services, to office buildings and other facilities. GCA provides similar custodial services and has aggressively expanded into public schools.The combined company will have a total of 137,000 employees. In 2016, ABM\u2019s annual revenue rose 5% to $5.14 billion from a year earlier. Last month, the company unloaded its government-services business for $35.5 million to Valiant Integrated Services LLC.Shares of ABM have climbed 9.8% over the past 12 months.

But banks should fear the phenomenon, too: it poses risks to lending they may not appreciate.People in part-time jobs, agency work, self-employment and work found online on platforms such as Uber or TaskRabbit can see much greater variation in monthly incomes than those in steady, traditional roles. That makes it harder to plan budgets and meet regular bills and credit repayments.This change has been spreading through the U.S. and U.K. in recent years. U.S. labor statistics miss a lot of flexible jobs, or so-called alternative work, even in the wider U-6 measure of underemployment. Research by       Lawrence Katz       of Harvard University and       Alan Krueger       of Princeton to better capture the changes found that all net new employment between 2005 and 2015 seems to have come from alternative work. In the U.K., more than half of new jobs since the financial crisis have been part-time or self-employed.Income volatility is highest among the young and those on low incomes, and these people are typically more reliant on consumer credit. There has also been rapid growth in consumer lending on both sides of the Atlantic.Defaults on credit cards and unsecured loans are particularly painful for banks because there is no collateral. In the U.K., consumer credit is only about one-seventh the size of mortgage lending, yet has historically produced 10 times the losses, according to the Bank of England.When regulators stress-test consumer credit, they look for rises in unemployment. This is no longer likely to be as good a guide. When the economy slows, people who work part-time, or have contracts with no guaranteed hours, or who sell their labor online, will see hours and income fall without becoming unemployed.So far, online gig work seems to be used mainly to top-up other income. That is the finding of studies such as one by the J.P. Morgan Chase Institute, which found that gig work could save people from having to cut spending, taking out extra costly credit or failing to pay what they already owed. That study covered the period from 2012 to 2015 when work was plentiful.Yet in a downturn when more people are more desperate, incomes will likely be worse. A study by the Boston Federal Reserve found that even in good times, the amount people could earn per hour through gig work tended to fall the more hours they were willing to supply. Those who most need the work get paid less for it.For banks and regulators, as flexible working grows, they will need to find other indicators of looming payment problems. Difficulties may already be happening. Delinquency rates on some forms of subprime credit and auto loans are rising according to New York Fed data, at a time when unemployment rates are still trending down.That is very unusual, but it may be a sign of things to come.Write to Paul J.

V 0.69%       has a new offer for small merchants: take thousands of dollars from the card giant to upgrade their payment technology. In return, the businesses must stop accepting cash.The\u00a0company unveiled the initiative on Wednesday as part of a broader effort to steer Americans away from using old-fashioned paper money. Visa says it is planning to give $10,000 apiece to up to 50 restaurants and food vendors to pay for their technology and marketing costs, as long\u00a0as the businesses pledge to start what Visa executive Jack Forestell calls a \u201cjourney to cashless.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re really viewing this as the opening salvo,\u201d said Mr. Forestell, Visa\u2019s global head of merchant solutions, of the potential total $500,000 commitment.Consumers at those stores would be able to pay for goods or services only with debit or credit cards or with their cellphones.\u00a0In exchange, Visa is offering to pay for upgrades to merchants\u2019 technology at the checkout line so that they can accept contactless payments, such as             Apple Pay.       The $10,000 incentive can also help cover some of the merchants\u2019 marketing expenses.Visa will pick the participating merchants from an application process that starts in August.\u00a0Online-only shops are excluded.Visa has long considered cash one of its biggest competitors and has been taking steps to chip away at it. Getting rid of cash is a priority for Visa Chief Executive       Al Kelly,        who took over late last year, especially as cash and check transactions continue to grow globally.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on putting cash out of business,\u201d Mr. Kelly said at Visa\u2019s investor day last month, adding that converting check and cash to digital and electronic payments is the company\u2019s \u201cnumber-one growth lever.\u201dVisa processes credit and debit card payments on behalf of banks and merchants. The company makes money\u00a0when consumers use their Visa-branded cards. An increase in transactions and payments volume over its network typically results in rising revenues.The company accounted for 59% of purchase volume on\u00a0U.S.\u00a0general purpose credit and debit cards last year, compared with rival             Mastercard\u2019s       25% market share, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.Still, cash remains a formidable competitor. Check and cash transactions totaled $17 trillion world-wide in 2016, up about 2% from a year prior, according to Visa.Cards have made a dent in cash\u00a0in the U.S., but cash remains the most widely used payment form among Americans, accounting for 32% of all consumer transactions in 2015, compared with 27% for debit cards and 21% for credit cards, according to a November report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Visa is trying to turn those numbers more in its favor. In the U.S., it is going after spending categories, such as parking and rent, that have been entrenched in cash and check payments for decades. Abroad, it is partnering with governments to move more payments onto its network, including an agreement that it recently signed with the Polish government to move the country to a cashless system.Some merchants have already stopped taking cash.\u00a0New York City-based 2nd City, a Filipino taqueria, hasn\u2019t accepted cash since it opened its doors in 2016. Michael Ryan, the co-owner and co-founder, said he never ordered cash drawers or a safe. By not having to count cash, visit a bank or order change, Mr. Ryan estimates, the manager on duty saves about 23 hours a week.The restaurant, which mostly caters to millennials, has had \u201cvery little\u201d push back from customers, Mr. Ryan said.\u00a0He added\u00a0that the downside is the fees that his business pays to the card issuers.Indeed, many merchants prefer cash because they don\u2019t have to share the revenue with card companies. Credit-card interchange fees, which networks like Visa set and that merchants pay to the banks that issue their cards, are on average around 2% of the transaction amount, according to the National Retail Federation, the largest trade group that represents merchants in the U.S.\u201cThe idea that merchants don\u2019t want to accept cash is a myth,\u201d said       Mallory Duncan,        senior vice president and general counsel at the National Retail Federation.Visa says merchants making the move stand to benefit from higher sales and lower theft risk. Some, though, are skeptical that Visa can take the cashless push much further.\u201cGetting rid of things like rent checks is difficult,\u201d said       Chris Donat,        a managing director who covers credit-card companies at Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners.", "news_time": "2017-07-12 07:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-takes-war-on-cash-to-restaurants-1499853601", "news_title": "Visa Takes War on Cash to Restaurants ", "keywords": "visa card technology,visa cash,visa restaurants,Visa,V,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,credit types,services,debit cards,credit cards,banking,credit,financial services,plastic cards"}, {"content": "Fans of Springsteen rock anthems and drop-top convertibles can rejoice: The great American road trip isn\u2019t dead. Oil bulls, however, should check their enthusiasm.The strange reluctance of Americans to take to the road in early 2017\u2014miles driven and gasoline consumption flatlined despite a robust labor market and rising consumer confidence\u2014prompted much hand-wringing among economists and energy investors alike, who worried that the lack of traffic might hint at deeper problems with the U.S. economy.Those anxieties may have been overdone. U.S. gasoline demand hit a weekly record in late May and has remained high since, and overall consumption of petroleum\u2014which also includes the likes of jet fuel and petrochemical feedstock\u2014hit a record a month later, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.So what slowed growth earlier in the year? Check the pump: Drivers were facing the sharpest rise in oil prices since the financial crisis, up nearly 90% from a year earlier in mid-February. By contrast, in late 2015 and early 2016, when Americans were driving with heady abandon even though the economy was muddling along, prices were down over 50% from a year earlier. Given the big price swings of the past two years, it isn\u2019t surprising that the usual relationship between economic growth, consumer confidence and driving habits was thrown off.Unfortunately, good news for the economy\u2014or at least a lack of bad news\u2014shouldn\u2019t give too much cheer to oil investors. Americans aren\u2019t giving up driving, but cars are getting a lot thriftier with gas. Since tougher fuel-economy standards were introduced in the 2011, highway miles driven have risen around 8%, twice the rise in gasoline burn, government data show.Gasoline demand will likely rebound further as the summer progresses and consumers get used to the new normal of oil prices bouncing around $50 a barrel. But as fuel-economy standards get ever tighter and more auto makers shift toward electric vehicles, as Volvo announced last week, U.S. gasoline demand will increasingly be stuck in neutral.Investors hoping for a structural rebound in oil and refining stocks should consider switching gears.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 07:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-demise-of-the-american-driver-has-been-exaggerated-1499860111", "news_title": "The Demise of the American Driver Has Been Exaggerated", "keywords": "fuel consumption,gas consumption,oil consumption,u.s. driving,u.s. gasoline consumption,u.s. gasoline market,u.s. oil consumption,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,motor fuel markets,heard on the street,energy"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Chinese banks extended higher-than-expected volume of loans last month even as growth in the money supply continued to slow amid Beijing\u2019s efforts to reduce leverage in its financial system.New yuan loans issued by Chinese banks surged to 1.54 trillion yuan ($226.38 billion) in June, up from 1.11 trillion yuan in May, according to figures released by the People\u2019s Bank of China on Wednesday. The volume was well above the 1.3 trillion yuan forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.June is typically a high point for new credit from Chinese banks\u2019 as loan officers rush to meet quarterly targets. Beyond that, demand for credit from households\u2014mostly for mortgages in the hot property market\u2014remained strong, and companies too turned to banks for loans, instead of issuing bonds.Crimping debt and other financial risks is a priority for Beijing this year, as Chinese leaders want a stable economic environment ahead of a shuffling of leadership posts this fall. Regulators have rolled out a raft of measures, from raising some short-term rates to rules forcing banks to unwind hidden loans and investments, with effects felt across the financial system from bond issues to the money supply.Growth in M2\u2014a broad measure of money supply which includes cash, checking and savings deposits and other time deposits\u2014slowed to 9.4% at the end of June from a year earlier, a record low since the central bank started releasing the data three decades ago. June\u2019s pace was lower than the 9.6% rise at the end of May and than market expectations.Central bank spokeswoman Ruan Jianhong said that the deceleration of M2 growth was a result of slower expansion in banks\u2019 off-balance-sheet financing in response to the government\u2019s deleveraging efforts. This slower growth in M2, she said, will become a \u201cnew normal\u201d.Lending to households, which is mostly made up by mortgage loans, stood at 738.4 billion yuan in June, up from 610.6 billion yuan in May, according to data from the central bank. Despite the increase in volume, household loans\u2019 share in total lending was down to 48% in June from 55% in May\u2014a decrease the central bank spokeswoman said was part of the effort to constrain property bubbles.In another effect of Beijing\u2019s campaign, outstanding corporate bonds remained unchanged at the end of June, compared with May. Tighter liquidity has driven up yields, causing many companies to cancel issues of new bonds.Total social financing, a broader measurement of credit that includes bank loans, corporate bonds and trust loans, reached 1.78 trillion yuan in June, compared with 1.06 trillion yuan in May, the central bank said, attributing the rise mainly to the robust growth in bank loans as well as other types of short-term loans.After the economy posted a strong 6.9% rate of growth in the first quarter, economists expect that the government and People\u2019s Bank\u2019s effort to tackle debt will continue, with credit continuing to take a hit.\u201cLooking ahead, while we think the PBOC is now done pushing up interest rates, we expect the monetary tightening that has already taken place to continue weighing on credit growth in coming quarters,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist with Capital Economics.\u2014Grace Zhu", "news_time": "2017-07-12 07:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-banks-continued-to-exceed-loan-volume-expectations-in-june-1499860066", "news_title": "Chinese Banks Continued to Exceed Loan-Volume Expectations in June", "keywords": "china credit,china leverage,china loans,china money supply,m2,people's bank of china,economic performance,indicators,money supply,economic news"}, {"content": "Good morning.

Have those on me free.It was only a matter of time. Ads are coming to Facebook Messenger, WSJ reports. The company says it plans to \u201cslowly and carefully\u201d sandwich ads between people\u2019s messages. Facebook can\u2019t really crank up ad load in the news feed any more, so something had to give. Messenger has 1.2 billion active users for marketers to target, and those users tend to message back and forth even more than they use social networks, according to Mr. Facebook himself, Mark Zuckerberg. But there\u2019s the rub: Messaging is an intimate experience that could do without the interruption. Facebook says that in its Messenger ad tests, users were \u201cvery open\u201d to ads that were useful and connected them to companies via their websites and chat threads. Users are also very open to trying out new online services if their current ones are irritating, and there are plenty of ad-free messaging alternatives out there.The Journal\u2019s Brody Mullins and Jack Nicas have a fascinating report on Google\u2019s efforts to pay academics for research that support some of its business practices that are under regulatory scrutiny. Those academics don\u2019t always reveal Google\u2019s financial support\u2014which can range from $5,000 to $400,000\u2014in their published papers, and some professors share their drafts with Google before publication to let the company offer its suggestions. Some of that research has been used by Google to defend itself\u2014for example, against antitrust accusations from the Federal Trade Commission in 2012. Tech companies funding academic papers that support their business interests is nothing new or unusual, and the academics interviewed said their work wasn\u2019t influenced by Google, but this report is nonetheless eye-opening because it really digs deep into how the process works, thanks to thousands of pages of emails obtained through public-records requests on more than a dozen university professors. Google, which began its life at Stanford, said it has always \u201cmaintained strong relations with universities and research institutes and have always valued their independence and integrity.\u201dA new online retailer launched Tuesday called Brandless\u2122 (I haven\u2019t worked out yet whether the trademark symbol is ironic) that will sell \u201cgeneric, health- and environmentally conscious consumer staples\u201d such as organic fair trade cold brew, sea salt quinoa chips and organic agave nectar for $3 each, WSJ reports. Staples! Did I mention the company is based in Silicon Valley? The idea is that Brandless can cut out the costs of TV and print advertising and supermarket distribution, then funnel that money toward making cheaper products that compete with big-name rivals. Consumers are increasingly picking up private-label brands at the supermarkets, but will they be willing to try new unbranded products, some of which are more expensive than Target\u2019s alternatives?

A positive figure suggests investors are no longer asking to be paid a premium to hold euros, a sharp change from the recent past.Investors also have a net long position in the euro\u2014a bet that the currency will appreciate\u2014for the first time in three years. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows investors held 77,464 more long than short contracts on the euro in the week to July 3.The European Union has long hankered for a greater role in global markets. As far back as the 1960s,       Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing,        France\u2019s then finance minister, complained of the U.S. dollar\u2019s \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d as the pre-eminent reserve currency. Following its launch 18 years ago, the single currency reached a high of around $1.60 in 2008.But the currency has lost ground even since the sovereign debt crisis ended in 2012.Its share of daily turnover in foreign exchange markets has dropped from 39% in 2010 to 31% in 2016, according to the Bank for International Settlements.The European Central Bank estimates that the share of international bonds denominated in euros has dropped from as high as 29.3% in 2004 to 22% at the end of last year.In the first quarter of the year, slightly less than 20% of global official foreign exchange reserves were held in euros, according to the International Monetary Fund. At its peak in 2009, the euro\u2019s share of international reserves reached nearly 28%.Aside from prestige, a greater international role would help eurozone companies raise funds while potentially reducing exchange rate volatility. The dollar\u2019s role as the most important global reserve currency has typically been seen as a boon for the U.S.The lingering risk that the currency won\u2019t survive has reduced the euro\u2019s position in foreign currency reserves held by governments and central banks while putting off some investors.\u201cIf you\u2019re a reserve manager, say in Asia, you would think twice about investing over the very long term in a currency that might not exist in five years,\u201d said       Dhaval Joshi,        chief European strategist at BCA Research.That risk has abated recently. Elections in the Netherlands and France saw pro-EU candidates win convincingly, and support for Germany\u2019s main anti-euro party has dwindled.Expectations that a country will leave the eurozone have fallen. Investors currently assign an 8.6% probability to a country exiting the eurozone in the next 12 months, against over 25% early in the year, according to the Sentix euro breakup index, which polls investors on their expectations for the bloc.The brighter outlook for regional growth, which has recently outstripped the U.S., helps the euro on multiple fronts. It reduces the risk of breakup by helping to bolster the weaker southern European economies, whose debts and stagnant growth helped to fuel the sovereign debt crisis. It makes the region more attractive for outside investors.It also means the ECB will be quicker to jettison the bond-buying and negative interest rate policies that have capped the currency\u2019s gains. Such so-called quantitative easing, QE, policies keep bond yields low, reducing long-term returns for investors and stemming the flow of foreign exchange that would boost the euro.It may even see other central banks stock up their reserves.\u201cIt could be that the first quarter represents something close to the low in the euro\u2019s share of reserves,\u201d said       Stephen Saywell,        head of foreign exchange strategy at             BNP Paribas.To be sure, factors such as less monetary stimulus and a brighter economy could end up hurting the euro if the pace of both disappoint. The region\u2019s anti-euro politicians could also stage a comeback.But the prospect of higher interest rates and other factors have already led many analysts to hike their forecasts for the euro in the short term.Earlier this year             Deutsche Bank                   and             Morgan Stanley                   expected the euro to drop below parity with the dollar. Both have now raised their projections by 21 cents to $1.16 and $1.18 respectively.             HSBC                   analysts who began the year with a $1.10 forecast now believe their current $1.20 projection may be a conservative estimate.\u201cBefore Europe started the QE program we were comfortably above $1.20, so if that\u2019s going to be withdrawn, you\u2019ve got to ask why the euro can\u2019t go much higher by this time next year,\u201d said       Steve Jefferies,        head of currencies and emerging markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at             J.P.

The revelation that the president\u2019s eldest son and senior campaign aides attended a meeting last year with a Russian lawyer to discuss what they were told was incriminating information about Hillary Clinton being offered by the Kremlin to help Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy is among the most explosive yet in the long-running Russia investigation. Donald Trump Jr. released emails himself on Tuesday that detail an exchange with U.K. publicist Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting. The emails appear to contradict the president\u2019s repeated statements casting doubt on the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia sought to interfere in the election. They reveal that Mr. Trump Jr. knew he was meeting with a foreign national who he was told was essentially a messenger for the Russian government. This raises potential legal issues for the younger Trump, creates a long-term problem for his father\u2019s administration and, writes our columnist Gerald F. Seib, kills any prospect that talk of Russian meddling would fade.Google operates a little-known program that harnesses the brain power of university researchers to sway opinion and public policy. Over the past decade, the search-and-advertising giant has helped finance hundreds of research papers to defend against regulatory challenges to its market dominance, paying $5,000 to $400,000 for the work, according to our findings. Paying for favorable academic research isn\u2019t new among food, drug and oil companies. But Google\u2019s program highlights a behind-the-scenes push in Silicon Valley to sway decision makers in Washington. Critics worry such funding, which professors don\u2019t always reveal, could undermine academic credibility. In some years, a former Google employee and a former Google lobbyist said, the company compiled wish lists of academic papers, then searched for willing authors. Conclusions of some Google-backed research: The company hasn\u2019t unfairly quashed competitors, and its consumer-data collection is a fair exchange for its free services.Ratcheting up the pressure on fellow Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a vote on the GOP health-care bill for next week and delayed the August recess, buying time to seek legislative wins even if the health plan stalls.

The White House had been prepared to review options for implementing the law by the end of June, with action expected soon.Signatories include every living former CEA leader except for       Janet Yellen,        who is chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and wasn\u2019t asked to participate. In the letter, some 15 economists who advised past presidents of both parties warn that tariffs \u201cwould likely do harm\u201d to U.S. relations with major allies that are top sources of steel imports, including Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico.\u201cThe diplomatic costs might be worth it if the tariffs generated economic benefits. But they would not,\u201d the economists write. \u201cAdditional steel tariffs would actually damage the U.S. economy.\u201dThe letter also notes that the U.S. maintains more than 150 countervailing and antidumping duties on steel imports, including some as high as 266%.The national security justification for trade enforcement actions has been studied 26 times by previous administrations but invoked only twice. The       George W. Bush       administration launched a Section 232 investigation in 2001 but rejected the security rationale for imposing duties on steel imports. Mr. Bush implemented steel tariffs using other emergency authorities in 2002\u2014as part of a trade-enforcement push to secure broader political support for his free-trade agenda\u2014but lifted them the following year to avoid retaliatory measures from trading partners.The letter cites the emergency steel tariffs imposed by the Bush administration in underscoring the economists\u2019 concerns. Those tariffs\u00a0did little to boost manufacturing employment and raised costs for consumers and businesses, the economists said.The signatories include every CEA chairman in that administration, including former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Other signatories include       Martin Feldstein,        who was chairman of the CEA under President       Ronald Reagan,        and       Alan Greenspan,        who held the post for President       Gerald Ford.       It also includes Nobel laureate       Joseph Stiglitz,        an adviser to President       Bill Clinton.Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for CEA chairman, economist       Kevin Hassett,        is awaiting Senate confirmation. The CEA is established by law and for decades has provided the president with economic advice and analysis. It also serves as a liaison between the White House and the agencies that produce economic data.The letter was organized by the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank that published a separate report this week opposing the steel tariffs.Some Trump administration officials have said the U.S. should take stronger action to curb steel imports, particularly against China, whose steel overcapacity they say could lead to dumping in other markets that are later imported to the U.S.Others have warned that such a move could have repercussions on other U.S. markets because the U.S. is a net importer of steel, and that it could trigger retaliatory duties from major trading partners.White House officials said Mr. Trump had planned to use the forthcoming report from the Commerce Department to press for greater action to curb steel overcapacity at last week\u2019s Group of 20 nations\u2019 summit in Hamburg, Germany.\u201cWe ask the G-20 economies to join us in this effort and to take concrete actions to solve these problems,\u201d National Economic Council Director       Gary Cohn       told reporters before the trip. \u201cBut let us be clear: We will act to ensure a level playing field for all.\u201dMr. Trump told the G-20 leaders in a closed-door meeting they were \u201clargely responsible\u201d for the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit, according to an official.China alone is responsible for about two-thirds of the U.S. trade deficit.

Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures hit $6.7 billion last year, the WSJ\u2019s       Dan Gallagher       writes, up 46% from the prior year and nearly double from three years ago. Amazon used Prime Day to highlight some of that spending, rolling out services with the airfreight fleet labeled Prime Air that it\u2019s ramping up with airline partners. The investments in the cargo airlines are part of the rapid escalation in spending Amazon has undertaken, including capital expenditures that have fed the company\u2019s vast distribution network as well as the technology backbone that drives a fast-growing cloud services business. The Prime Day sales this year will push more business for a wide range of retailers and logistics providers. But the capital spending signals that Amazon expects to handle more of that volume on its own in coming years.The commercial real-estate market looks to be getting tighter, but not necessarily because of strong new demand. From shopping malls to distribution centers, developers are holding the line on new construction and building less on speculation. Analysts at commercial real-estate firm             Marcus & Millichap Inc.       say there\u2019s pent-up demand in the retail market as big grocery chains prepare to absorb an estimated 25 million square feet over the next five years, the WSJ\u2019s Esther Fung reports. That comes as the national retail vacancy rate sits at a relatively low 5.4% because developers have reined in construction. The attention to capacity is also keeping logistics space tight, with real-estate investment manager CBRE Inc. saying the average availability rate for warehouses and distribution centers in the U.S. declined slightly in the second quarter. That was in part because developers completed fewer sites than expected. The group said two-thirds of the 62 U.S. markets it tracks registered declining availability in the quarter.Tesla Inc.       is trying to build a post-sale supply chain for its new mass-market sedans that would veer away from automotive industry norms. The Silicon Valley auto maker plans to triple its capacity to repair vehicles, the WSJ\u2019s Tim Higgins reports, adding 1,400 technicians, dozens of service centers and hundreds of maintenance vans that can be dispatched to an owner\u2019s home. It\u2019s part of the larger effort to build out a supply chain, from parts production to charging stations, aimed at moving the $35,000 Model 3 sedan into the automotive mainstream. The factory side remains an enormous challenge, however, as the company tries to boost production to 500,000 vehicles next year from 84,000 last year. The surge of cars would likely tax a small network of about 150 Tesla service centers around the world, so Tesla is building up that network along with maintenance vans outfitted with repair crews and espresso machines.The squeeze on big brands in consumer supply chains may be getting tighter. A new online retailer is betting it can get American shoppers to break away from staples from Colgate to Heinz, the WSJ\u2019s Sharon Terlep reports, by selling generic, health- and environmentally conscious consumer goods. The idea behind the business called Brandless is to cut out supermarkets and build streamlined sales and distribution that can pricier, name-brand counterparts. The model includes a shipping fee that\u2019s scaled back based on orders and membership, with goods shipped from two distribution centers, one in California and one in Indiana, and delivered mostly within two days. For consumer-goods makers, Brandless marks another bid to shave away still more of their role in the retail market as shoppers shift toward online sales and away from brand loyalty. Those sellers and their suppliers still have scale on their side, however, and Brandless may find itself squeezed if its shipping fees don\u2019t cover its logistics costs.\u2018The momentum we\u2019ve found \u2026. we\u2019re optimistic about that rolling forward through the rest of the year.\u2019U.S. national average availability rate for warehouse and distribution center space in the second quarter, according to CBRE.Chinese passenger-car sales bounced back in June, growing 2.3% from a year ago.

The field began producing in 2015 after years of delays caused by local opposition to the construction of an associated pipeline.The deal with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board takes Shell out of the energy-development business in Ireland.A subsidiary of the pension fund will take control of Shell\u2019s 45% interest in Corrib, while         Vermilion Energy               Inc., a Calgary-based oil-and-gas producer, will become the new operator of the field, Shell and the pension fund said on Wednesday.The transaction is for $947 million initially with payments of up to $285 million between 2018 and 2025, depending on gas prices and production.Shell said on Wednesday the sale was consistent with its plan to sell off $30 billion in assets by 2018, as it repairs its balance sheet after loading up on debt for the 2015 acquisition of BG Group PLC for over $50 billion.Andy Brown,        a top Shell executive, said the company has announced deals valued at over $20 billion.\u201cThis transaction is part of our strategy to reshape Shell and to deliver a world-class investment case,\u201d he said.Shell acquired the company that discovered Corrib in 2002, but its plans to build an onshore pipeline to transport the field\u2019s gas to a terminal it would construct at Bellanaboy in County Mayo sparked fierce opposition.That resistance focused on concerns about the safety of the pipeline and its effects on the environment. The controversy led to changes to the pipeline\u2019s path, including routing it through a 4.9 kilometer (3-mile-long) tunnel, the longest in Ireland, that increased the project\u2019s costs and forced delays.Those delays and changes are forcing Shell to book an impairment charge of about $350 million in its second-quarter earnings results.The company also said it would take an accounting loss of about $400 million because of currency fluctuations between the euro and the dollar once the deal is completed, likely in the first part of 2018.Shell will maintain a presence in Ireland through an aviation joint venture, Shell and Topaz Aviation Ireland Ltd., based near Dublin airport.Write to Michael Amon at michael.amon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 06:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shell-sells-irish-gas-field-stake-for-1-2-billion-to-canada-pension-fund-1499853418", "news_title": "Shell Sells Irish Gas Field Stake for $1.2 Billion to Canada Pension Fund", "keywords": "anglo dutch oil company,canada pension plan,canadian pension fund, corrib,corrib gas field,irish gas field,royal dutch shell, shell's asset sales,shell oil,Canada Pension Plan Investment Board,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,Vermilion Energy,VET.T,CA:VET,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,heavy construction,pipeline laying,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private pension funds,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,construction,real estate,natural gas,oil extraction,financial services,investing,securities,integrated oil,gas,pension funds"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014A Chinese bond rally\u2014bucking the global selloff in government debt\u2014is narrowing the yield gap with U.S. bonds, a potential complication for Beijing.Prices in the world\u2019s third-largest bond market have recovered in recent weeks as Chinese regulators back off efforts to discourage risky loans and cool debt-fueled speculation. That has sent yields falling\u2014to 3.54% on the benchmark 10-year government bond, from a two-year high of 3.69% in early May.Meantime, yields on U.S. Treasurys and German bunds have risen as leading central banks signal that their loose-money policies\u2014which have propped up the world economy since the global financial crisis\u2014are nearing an end.The result: The yield gap, or spread, between the benchmark 10-year Chinese bond and its U.S. counterpart has shrunk to 1.19 percentage points, a 20% narrowing since early June, when it was at its widest in nearly two years.A smaller edge for Chinese assets could make U.S. assets, including bonds, more attractive to Chinese investors, tempting them to send their money out of the country\u2014a flow Beijing has managed to slow in recent months by tightening capital controls.In turn, that could deepen Chinese authorities\u2019 policy \u201ctrilemma,\u201d economists\u2019 term for the impossibility of keeping independent control over currency, interest rates and capital account.\u201cIf U.S. interest rates rise further and the spread narrows more, it will certainly put more pressure on China\u2019s currency and encourage more money to head abroad,\u201d said       Zang Min,        senior fixed-income analyst at Hongxin Securities, a Shenzhen-based brokerage. And that, he added, could force the People\u2019s Bank of China to raise interest rates.For now, investors in China are enjoying the easing of Beijing\u2019s crackdown on financial system risks. After earlier this year setting off market jitters by acting to stifle the buying of domestic bonds with borrowed money, in late May authorities shifted to a more conciliatory approach, and in mid-June the PBOC made its largest weekly injection of cash into the financial system in five months.\u201cThese moves aimed at stabilizing the market have rekindled enthusiasm among some bond bulls,\u201d said Mr. Zang, adding that demand for bonds had almost dried up at one point. In the first half of 2017, Chinese companies raised a total of 1.99 trillion yuan ($292.53 billion) via bond sales, less than half the year-earlier 4.15 trillion yuan.The newfound stability has come with a fresh concern: As the bond market recovers, so has the use of tools for adding leverage, notably a type of short-term loan known as a negotiable certificate of deposit, or NCD, that banks have being increasingly using to raise funds. Issuance surged to a near-record 2.01 trillion yuan last month.Chinese banks, especially those with smaller deposit bases, have made heavy use of this relatively new instrument to roll over old debt and finance bond purchases, especially of higher-yielding corporate bonds.As appetite for such riskier assets returns, the average yield on AA-rated five-year Chinese corporate bonds has fallen faster than the yield on safer AAA-rated bonds. Since mid-June the difference has narrowed to 0.52 percentage point from 0.87 percentage point, which was the widest in nearly a year.\u201cBased on indicators like NCD issuance, one can argue that the level of financial leverage has risen back again,\u201d said       Qu Qing,        chief fixed-income analyst at Hua Chuang Securities.Write to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 06:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-bond-rally-may-stir-up-trouble-for-beijing-regulators-1499855256", "news_title": "China Bond Rally May Stir Up Trouble for Beijing Regulators ", "keywords": "10-year benchmark bonds,bond yields,china bond market,china bonds,china bond yields,china regulators,china yield,pboc,yield spread,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "What consumer good offers the best growth potential?

Yet it sowed a seed that under Reynolds\u2019s archrival Philip Morris has grown into a seemingly credible product: IQOS. Released in Japan in 2014, IQOS accounted for 7% of cigarettes sold in the country in the first quarter, up from less than 1% in the first quarter of 2016.Crucially, PMI gains even if IQOS replaces Marlboro, because heat-not-burn smokes are more lightly taxed than conventional cigarettes in most countries (though not the U.S., important for PMI\u2019s sister company             Altria                  ). Citibank estimates that a pack of IQOS generates 30% more revenues for PMI in Japan than a pack of Marlboros, even though consumers pay similar prices.The brokerage is therefore penciling in 8% organic sales growth at PMI this year, at least double what can be expected of consumer-products groups like             Nestl\u00e9                   or             Procter & Gamble.       Unlike vaping products, which are easy to make and hard to make profitable, heat-not-burn cigarettes can improve manufacturers\u2019 margins.Buying PMI stock is the obvious way to play this theme. But a smarter bet could be London-listed             British American Tobacco                   (BAT), maker of Lucky Strikes. BAT\u2019s valuation gap to PMI has ballooned to its widest in at least a decade over the past two years; investors are excited about IQOS, but give BAT no credit for its challenger product, glo. BAT\u2019s lower margins also suggest potential for cost-cutting, particularly given the company\u2019s merger with Reynolds, which is due to complete later this year.Buying PMI stock on 23 times prospective earnings amounts to a wager that IQOS finds converts beyond Japan. This isn\u2019t certain. Japan\u2019s consumer culture can be insular, and smokers in the country like lighter menthol cigarettes, for which IQOS is a good substitute. It may be harder to win over those used to stronger smokes.On less than 18 times earnings, well below not just PMI but also consumer-goods peers, BAT stock should prove a safe investment -- whether or not heat-not-burn cigarettes live up to their early promise.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 06:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-an-old-flop-could-boost-big-tobacco-1499854924", "news_title": "How an Old Flop Could Boost Big Tobacco ", "keywords": "cigarettes, cigarette substitutes, e cigarettes, heat-not-burn devices, vaping,Philip Morris International,PM,financial performance,earnings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,agriculture,farming,tobacco farming,food,beverages,tobacco,tobacco products,consumer goods"}, {"content": "Doubts in financial markets had already crept in about the             Swiss National Bank\u2019s        SNBN -0.88%       commitment to the franc ceiling even before the SNB unexpectedly jettisoned the policy in January 2015, according to a paper published Wednesday by the Bank for International Settlements.The paper sheds light on one of the biggest events to roil currency markets in many years. On Jan. 15, 2015, the SNB abandoned its commitment to cap the value of the franc without warning, sending the Swiss currency soaring against the euro and other currencies.Less than a month earlier, SNB Chairman       Thomas Jordan       had called the cap \u201cthe key instrument\u201d for the central bank and that the SNB would enforce it \u201cwith the utmost determination.\u201dBy examining the prices of currency options from one-month to 12-month maturities in the run-up to the SNB\u2019s move, the paper authors concluded that while the commitment was seen as generally credible when it was in place from 2011 until early 2015, investors did at times question how long it would stay.Under the policy, the SNB said it wouldn\u2019t allow the euro to weaken below 1.20 francs and would intervene if necessary. For this reason, the policy was often referred to as a floor on the euro\u2019s value against the franc.\u201cIn this paper, we found that financial markets attached some credibility to the Swiss franc floor, since the break probabilities never significantly exceeded 50% while the floor was in place, but especially at longer maturities there was some doubt,\u201d the authors wrote.\u201cWe also found that the credibility of the Swiss franc floor decreased to some degree as the spot exchange rate approached the lower bound of 1.20 Swiss franc per euro,\u201d they wrote.The franc\u2019s value was closely tied to the ebb and flow of Europe\u2019s debt crisis, which started in 2010 in Greece and later fanned out to grip Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. When doubts about the euro\u2019s survival escalated in financial markets the franc typically saw upward pressure given its global status as a safe-haven currency. It also faced pressure ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing program which was announced in early 2015.\u201cDuring the turbulent times in 2012 and at the end of 2014, the densities for all maturities tell basically the same story. Markets assessed the likelihood of discontinuing the Swiss franc floor within the option expiration to be about 50%, that is, there was some doubt about the SNB\u2019s commitment to the currency floor during those turbulent times,\u201d the authors wrote.The euro remains considerably below the 1.20 level 2\u00bd years after the floor was dropped, and the SNB has spent vast sums intervening to keep the franc from strengthening too much. However, the euro has risen against the franc in recent months amid a brighter outlook for the European economy.On Monday, the euro broke above 1.10 francs to a one-year high, and it fetched 1.1041 early Wednesday. The SNB\u2019s foreign reserves have also stabilized, suggesting it has pulled back from its currency-intervention efforts.Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 06:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-franc-shock-of-2015-came-as-no-surprise-for-some-bis-paper-finds-1499854553", "news_title": "Swiss Franc Shock of 2015 Came as No Surprise for Some, BIS Paper Finds ", "keywords": " capping the value of the swiss franc, qe in europe, snb, swiss central bank, swiss franc, swiss franc ceiling, swiss franc euro exchange rate, swiss franc floor,swissie, switzerland,Schweizerische Nationalbank,SNBN.EB,Bank for International Settlements,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,equity markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,pulp,paper markets,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "LETSENG-LA-TERAE, Lesotho\u2014A looming global diamond shortage is driving a small band of adventurous miners to brave bone-chilling winds at the world\u2019s highest mines to extract stones that are worth as much as 20 times the global average.The excavation is extremely challenging.

Mr. Comey later told Congress that Mr. Trump had demanded his loyalty and pressured him to drop a Russia-related investigation of a former top aide, allegations the White House has denied.The hearing also comes as Washington continues to digest new revelations about the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia last year. The president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., released emails on Tuesday that showed he attended a meeting last June to discuss allegedly incriminating information about       Hillary Clinton,        and that he was told the information would be offered as part of the Russian government\u2019s support for his father\u2019s candidacy.After Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       appointed Robert Mueller, himself a former FBI director, as special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and related matters.Current and former FBI agents say they are hopeful that Mr. Wray can keep the bureau out of the headlines so it can focus on conducting investigations. Still, some agents are wary of any replacement given Mr. Comey\u2019s dramatic exit amid a sharp dispute with the president.The FBI over the past year has been criticized for its handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, and it has been stung by Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations that its agents are on a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d regarding the Russia probe.Lawmakers also are likely to press Mr. Wray on any potential conflicts of interest he may have regarding people and companies represented by his law firm, King & Spalding.According to his ethics disclosure form released Monday, Mr. Wray represented some 20 clients since January 2015 who paid him more than $5,000 each in legal fees, many of them major companies.

Since the end of May the KBW             Nasdaq                   Bank Index has risen 8.5%. But other aspects of the banking business have been less positive. Loan growth, trading volumes and mergers and acquisition activity were all tepid in the second quarter.J.P. Morgan Chase,        JPM 0.14%Citigroup,        C -0.28%Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       and             PNC Financial        PNC 0.66%       will kick off second-quarter earnings on Friday, with other major financial firms reporting next week. Broadly speaking, the big universal banks look better positioned than both regional lenders and Wall Street brokers.The lending slowdown that began late last year has not abated. At the end of June, total loans and leases by commercial banks in the U.S. were up just 3.3% from a year earlier, compared with 6.4% for all of 2016, according to Federal Reserve data. Commercial and industrial loans were up just 1.9% at the end of June.In the first quarter, this trend hit regional banks hardest, along with Wells Fargo, whose business profile is similar to a regional lender. Major banks like J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were buoyed by strong credit card and consumer lending. This divergence likely continued in the second quarter.Executives at multiple banks also publicly warned during the quarter that trading volumes were down around 15% from a year earlier, hurt by low market volatility. A late quarter bump up in rates could boost second-, or more likely, third-quarter profits for big universal banks with strong footprints in so-called macro products like interest rates and currencies, says UBS analyst       Brennan Hawken.       In the U.S., that would again be J.P. Morgan and Citigroup.Goldman Sachs                  \u2019 trading results could disappoint yet again thanks to its large exposure to commodities, Mr. Hawken notes. Last quarter its trading revenue was basically flat, compared with double-digit increases for its rivals. Among other factors, Goldman blamed low oil market volatility.Unfortunately for Goldman, this continued in the second quarter. The firm\u2019s own analysts said recently that commodity volatility was down by around a third in the second quarter from a year earlier, a bigger decline than that seen in currencies, equities or rates.Goldman and             Morgan Stanley                   are also most exposed to weak M&A. Total world-wide revenue from realized M&A deals was down 9.2% from last year\u2019s second quarter, according to Dealogic.Rising interest rates and more flexibility to pay out capital are powerful levers that could keep pushing the whole sector higher.

Consumer advocates say requiring arbitration limits legal protections for consumers against corporate greed.Sen.       Tom Cotton       (R., Ark.) on Tuesday said he \u201cstarted the process\u201d of rescinding the rule under the Congressional Review Act, a legislative tool used to overturn newly introduced federal regulations.\u201cThe last thing Americans need is more antibusiness regulation that will prompt frivolous lawsuits while hurting consumers,\u201d he said.Other steps under consideration include opponents suing the CFPB to stop the rule and Trump administration officials in other parts of the government working to delay the rule using the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body of top regulators that monitors the stability of the financial system.All of them come with challenges.A Congressional Review Act resolution\u2014likely the most imminent of such steps\u2014must compete for lawmakers\u2019 attention with high-priority matters such as health care and tax legislation.Analysts say the House is likely to pass a measure to undo the rule. But the Senate might not follow suit.\u201cThe fate of the arbitration rule will be determined by public perception in the coming weeks,\u201d said Issac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading LLC.He said the odds of the rule being reversed by Congress at \u201cslightly less than 50%\u201d because of the busy congressional calendar, a view echoed by analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\u201cThe CFPB is taking a gamble that Congress and the administration will be too preoccupied with other hot issues between now and the next summer,.\u201d said Quyen Truong, a former CFPB official who is now a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP.Consumer advocates who backed the CFPB rule will now press lawmakers to leave the rule alone.\u201cWe are very optimistic and expect the rule to prevail and be implemented,\u201d said       Michael Calhoun,        president of the Center for Responsible Lending.Industry groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce may file lawsuits, a process that would take months or years with an uncertain outcome.The rule also could be challenged by other regulators that make up the FSOC if they could prove the rule poses a threat to the broader financial stability, a high hurdle. Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika criticized the new rule and asked the CFPB to provide to the OCC data supporting the rule. Mr. Noreika also is an FSOC member.In May, a Congressional Review Act measure to overturn the CFPB\u2019s prepaid-card-rule resolution failed in the Senate because it lacked sufficient Republican support amid disagreement in the prepaid card industry over how to fight the rule.Analysts say the arbitration rule has a stronger chance of getting overturned, given broad industry opposition. Forty Republican senators signed a letter last fall urging CFPB director Richard Cordray to reconsider the rule.Opposition isn\u2019t universal among Republicans, however. The House Liberty Caucus, a group made up conservative and libertarian Republicans, in March opposed legislation aimed at making class- action litigation significantly more difficult to pursue.\u201cThey are a preferable alternative to government regulation because they impose damages only on bad actors rather than imposing compliance costs on entire industries,\u201d Matt Weibel, the group\u2019s executive director, said at the time.The rule goes into effect in about eight months. It doesn\u2019t ban mandatory arbitration altogether. Rather, it prohibits contracts that block class-action lawsuits, making arbitration clauses useless for companies to prevent such lawsuits. Forced arbitration clauses are already banned for mortgage contracts.Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-12 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opponents-to-consumer-arbitration-rule-plan-repeal-effort-1499851800", "news_title": "Opponents to Consumer Arbitration Rule Plan Repeal Effort ", "keywords": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,class action,settlements"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014The troubles roiling China\u2019s once-soaring technology company LeEco Holdings deepened after U.S. television maker Vizio Inc. sued the Chinese firm over a failed $2 billion acquisition, arguing that the deal was a ruse to boost the buyer\u2019s financial standing.LeEco\u2019s plan to acquire Vizio, potentially seeking a foothold in the U.S. for its electronics, fell through earlier this year, but as recently as April the two sides expressed hope that they would find ways to work together.Since then, LeEco has faced a cash crunch and other problems. Last week, a Shanghai court froze more than $2.3 billion of shares in the company and $181 million in assets owned by founder Jia Yueting.Mr. Jia subsequently resigned as chairman from the listed unit of LeEco, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp.Vizio filed twin lawsuits in both California federal and state court on Tuesday seeking a total of $60 million in unpaid deal-termination fees from LeEco. The lawsuits level a series of allegations about LeEco\u2019s behavior surrounding the deal, alleging that the Chinese company misled Vizio about its financial well-being and sought to use the acquisition to bolster its financial credibility.Moreover, the lawsuits argue that LeEco sought to use the deal as a way to obtain access to confidential information about Vizio\u2019s customers. According to the suits, during negotiations, LeEco had access to details about Vizio customers, such as their contact information, account history and contract terms, and the Chinese company used that information \u201cstrictly for its own purposes.\u201d Representatives for LeEco didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Mr. Jia built LeEco into an empire with holdings in video content, smartphones, home electronics and electric cars. The entrepreneur\u2019s overseas ambitions included backing the U.S. electric-car venture Faraday Future Inc., a bet that earned LeEco comparisons with             Tesla Inc.But LeEco has stumbled with those plans, too. Nevada had promised $200 million in incentives to Faraday to build a $1 billion electric-car plant in the state. This week Faraday said it is pulling the plug on its Nevada factory, citing a shift in business strategy.Vizio\u2019s lawsuits offer a picture of deepening financial pressures at LeEco.According to the lawsuits, LeEco officials represented the company as \u201cfinancially healthy\u201d and able to complete the $2 billion acquisition. Yet the lawsuits contend that LeEco was experiencing \u201csevere cash flow and financial problems,\u201d and allege that the proposed acquisition was a way \u201cto create a widespread and dramatic public impression of their own financial health and well-being.\u201dLeEco\u2019s proposal to acquire Vizio, based in Irvine, Calif., contained a $100 million deal-termination fee. According to the lawsuits, as problems with the acquisition set in, LeEco offered to set up a joint venture to distribute Vizio electronics through LeEco sales channels in China in lieu of half the termination fee.Both sides agreed to the joint venture, though Vizio said LeEco didn\u2019t follow through with the deal. Ultimately, LeEco paid Vizio only $40 million of the $100 million termination fee, according to the lawsuits.Vizio later sent payment requests for the deal-termination fees that went unanswered by LeEco, according to the lawsuits. The U.S. company said the joint-venture offer was merely a tactic by LeEco to avoid paying the termination fees.Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.comAppeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'China\u2019s LeEco Runs Into More Trouble.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 05:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-over-failed-deal-heaps-accusations-on-stumbling-tech-company-1499850657", "news_title": "Law and Disorder: Chinese Tech Star\u2019s Troubles Go From Bad to Worse", "keywords": " acquisition lawsuit,deal lawsuit, failed deal, tech entrepreneur,Leshi Internet Information & Technology,Vizio,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,radio,television equipment,audio,video equipment,consumer goods,durable household products,home electronics,appliances,online service providers,technology"}, {"content": "SYDNEY\u2014Authorities in China released 10 employees of Australian casino company             Crown Resorts Ltd.

A third Australian, Jason O\u2019Connor, who led Crown\u2019s international VIP program, remains in custody.Another Crown employee is expected to be released Thursday, the person familiar with the matter said. This person said the employees were released because their nine-month sentences had been served. Mr. O\u2019Connor, however, received a 10-month sentence, as did four other employees. The Wednesday releases were expected and the sentences included time served.Last month, Crown said 17 current and two former employees\u2014including the three Australian citizens\u2014were convicted by a Shanghai court of gambling offenses; 16 people received jail sentences.Another three people were convicted but didn\u2019t have to serve jail time. They were released on bail in November.The current and former Crown staff members were first detained by Chinese authorities in October in surprise raids that sent chills through the global gaming industry. Chinese high-rollers had become important revenue sources for many casinos, though some companies said their international VIP businesses slowed in the months following the arrests.Most of the detained Crown employees held sales and marketing positions targeting different regions of China. Gambling is illegal in mainland China and foreign casinos aren\u2019t allowed to directly advertise their gambling operations, though they can promote themselves more broadly by touting beaches and shopping.Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which had been providing consular assistance to the three detained Australians, confirmed that two Australian citizens were released Wednesday.The current and former Crown staff members could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison.

BRK.B 0.52%       is under pressure to do something it usually doesn\u2019t do: raise its bid.Berkshire\u2019s subsidiary Berkshire Hathaway Energy\u00a0struck a deal last week to buy bankrupt Energy Future Holdings Corp., including Texas electricity-transmission business Oncor, for $9 billion in cash.Paul Singer\u2019s       Elliott Management Corp., a major Energy Future creditor, said Berkshire\u2019s bid doesn\u2019t value Oncor highly enough and that it is working on a rival offer. \u201cIt is quite likely that the Berkshire transaction will not close, given the lack of support from the debtors\u2019 creditors,\u201d a lawyer for Elliott wrote in a\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0letter that was publicly released by the hedge fund.For decades, Mr. Buffett has included in his company\u2019s annual report a list of criteria for companies that might want to sell businesses to Berkshire. Berkshire is looking for large companies with little debt, the list says\u2014and it isn\u2019t interested in bidding wars or hostile takeovers.\u201cWe don\u2019t participate in auctions,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in the latest annual report. \u201cA line from a country song expresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales: \u2018When the phone don\u2019t ring, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s me.\u2019\u201dIf the Oncor deal doesn\u2019t go through, Energy Future would pay Berkshire Hathaway Energy a $270 million fee, according to a filing. The fee would have to be approved by the bankruptcy court.The potential Berkshire deal would need permission from a bankruptcy court and from Texas regulators.\u00a0Regulators already have indicated they would support Berkshire as a buyer.Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined to comment.Berkshire watchers said the company is unlikely to raise its initial bid. \u201cHis trump card is his willingness to walk away,\u201d said       David Rolfe,        chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, which manages about $6 billion and holds Berkshire shares, referring to Mr. Buffett. \u201cHe does not have a history of bidding-type competitions, and he typically has played a pretty strong hand.\u201dMr. Buffett has long been known for quickly negotiating deals and sticking with his initial price offer.\u201cHis playbook is not to negotiate,\u201d said Robert Miles, who has written books on Berkshire. \u201cBuffett would take the $270 million and move on to the next deal, which is what they did with Constellation.\u201dBerkshire\u2019s energy unit reached a deal in 2008 to buy Constellation Energy Group Inc. but withdrew the offer after state-controlled Electricit\u00e9 de France SA agreed to buy a stake in Constellation. Berkshire received a $175 million breakup fee.To be sure, many potential Berkshire deals that fall through never become public. In 2012, Mr. Buffett told shareholders that Berkshire almost spent $22 billion buying a company but couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. He\u00a0didn\u2019t name the potential target.A recent withdrawal occurred earlier this year when             Kraft Heinz Co.      , which is partly owned by Berkshire and Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital, backed away from a $143 billion approach to take over             Unilever                   PLC in February after Unilever declined. Mr. Buffett revealed at his company\u2019s May annual meeting that Berkshire would have invested $15 billion if the deal were reached.\u201cIf it\u2019s unwelcome, there is no offer,\u201d Mr. Buffett told CNBC in February.Mr. Buffett famously participated in one hostile deal decades ago\u2014the takeover of Berkshire itself. Mr. Buffett bought shares in Berkshire, which was a New England textile company, starting in 1962. In 1965, he appeared at a board meeting to take control of the company formally and replace the management.In retrospect, he has said, the deal was a mistake. \u201cI found myself\u2026invested in a terrible business about which I knew very little,\u201d he wrote in 2014.Mr. Buffett did raise the offer price in 1999 when he bought a majority stake in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., now called Berkshire Hathaway Energy. But he made the switch before the deal was announced, as he explained in his 2007 letter to shareholders.Mr. Buffett originally offered $35 a share for MidAmerican, but after pressure from investment bankers, he raised it to $35.05, he said in the letter. \u201cWith that, I explained, they could tell their client they had wrung the last nickel out of me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt the time, it hurt.\u201dBut given MidAmerican\u2019s growth since then, he said in the same letter, \u201cI\u2019m glad I wilted and offered the extra nickel.\u201dWrite to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Pushback On Bid Tests Buffett\u2019s Resolve.'", "news_time": "2017-07-12 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-game-warren-buffett-doesnt-play-chicken-1499811803", "news_title": "One Game Warren Buffett Doesn\u2019t Play: Chicken", "keywords": "pe industry news,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Berkshire Hathaway Energy,Elliott Management,Energy Future Holdings,Constellation Energy Group,Electricite de France,EDF.FR,Kraft Heinz,KHC,Unilever,ULVR.LN,Oncor,Paul Singer,Mr. Buffett,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,renewable energy generation,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,diversified holding companies,alternative investments,business,consumer services,electric utilities,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,utilities"}]
